the verge mobile show this is episode
number 49 the week of june third 2013 I
am dieter bohn i'm dan seifert and i'm
chris ziegler and we are sans Vlad today
because he is covering computex Ollie
massive crazy computer action going on
out there and so we're gonna we're going
to struggle on just on our own but we've
got plenty of stuff to talk about
especially after the crazy exciting
things that happened over at the d11
conference which Neal I covered went
over to see we talked at all things D I
a zoom well I just want you um you know
I I don't want to dwell dwell on it too
much but I just want to bring up one
fast and furious related things it
wouldn't be it wouldn't be a proper VMS
a1 a1 well you know I didn't record a
fast cast this weekend so I'm a little
pent up I have some stuff I need to get
off my chest yeah that's if you're a
little pent up about fast and furious I
don't know if getting it off your chest
is the right metaphor to go with be that
as it may just just just dump all your
thoughts right out on us just uh it's
really disturbing furious 6 enjoyed its
second weekend at number one at the box
office beating out everybody including
surprise number two now you see me which
was not expected to do that well I don't
believe so we I want it to be good but I
know it's not I know it's this worst
yeah yeah the trailer makes it look
amazing but that's true pretty much
every movie what you think the trailer
makes it look amazing the trailer is all
I'm working off of here for for for now
you see me you mean yeah yeah yeah yeah
i think the trailer makes it look really
good I think that you're insane but I've
learned that apparently I hate
everything and I'm not happy with
anything and mean today so uh you know
that's because that dieter learned this
today and yet we've known this for years
and years and years this is not a
revelation
and so uh to bring us back on track d 11
uh I honestly did not expect this much
mobile news to come out of this d 11
conference right oh they do have a they
do have this whole separate mobile right
exactly they have a mobile-focused show
I don't think there was this much mobile
news to come out of that as there were
out of all things des mean well yeah but
let's let's be real like no one is under
the illusion that d 11 isn't the
flagship show ran mobile is still the
most important thing in technology so if
a company has big mobile news they're
going to save it and they're invited to
d 11 they're going to save it for d 11
not not do it at at dive into mobile i
suppose but also these companies at the
same time would rather do their own
event to announce may journal news right
yeah that is i do have to give a Wall
Street Journal and all things be a lot
of credit for being able to get that
much news out of a out of a brand
conference because you're right you know
um a lot of things that weren't as the
show probably could have been held for
events but then again the the well we'll
talk about the Eagles you talk about you
know I want to talk let's just talk
about motorola because it was the
biggest thing but it wasn't a full
unveil it was a tease right and it's
yeah the Moto X phone it's coming this
summer and it's going to be made in the
US and I just want right now right here
I believe that this came from who is
somebody somebody is reordering stuff as
I'm trying to click on it in our little
show notes document and I believe these
are lovely producer Evan and you're the
best man but please God it was me I know
is you Dan or a venir the best dance the
worst Dennis Woodside would blame at in
any book anyway always blame Evan he's
texting me right Isaac what are you
talking about shut up always blame the
guy he's off camera kit defendant some
bozo okay this I believe came from Benny
factor on Twitter who tweeted it to
Casey Newton at the verge that it's the
Moto X phone is what it's going to be
called but
uh from now until the end of time we're
going to refer to it as the motocross
yeah I approve of this because it's the
best thing ever yeah otherwise it's that
or it's motox which also is acceptable
okay so here's what we know it's coming
out this summer it's going to be
assembled in the u.s. many of the
components but not all will be made in
the US as well it is quote we know it's
in your pocket we know when it's in your
hand we know when you want to take a
picture and fire up the cameras it'll
know when you're in a car and it will
promote different interactions so
basically what they are they're
basically going to like having two
different things depending on like the
you know position to the phone the
choices this means so here's my
prediction I think that this means close
to nothing because no gorilla
unbeknownst to be fair I mean it's
really reasonable that nobody in the
world knows this but Motorola has been
doing this for years since the
introduction of the original well the
original new razor they had these smart
i think they're called motorola smart
action yeah or something right where
they're basically situationally aware of
things the phone does that can do with
you have to do with like your calendar
with email with like power state based
on location or time of day or like what
the phone is doing what is not doing and
it's you know I mean locale which is a
pretty well-known android app has been
doing this literally since android one
point one point zero yeah well it was
one of the very first apps available for
android so this is I think that what
they're promoting is this revolutionary
technology is in fact going to be very
evolutionary yes there might be a couple
additional sensors in this phone well if
they've there are couple additional
sensors than gs4 too yeah if they make
it easier to configure and not like like
when I when I did it used a I forget
what I had they might have been a razor
that had like these you know
pre-configured Smart Actions I was very
unhappy with them and I was like you
know I know it's not how I want it to
work and then I went to like reconfigure
it and it just looked like a confusing
mess and I didn't have the time to set
it up but I know people who do take the
time to set these things up love
them so they can just make it a little
bit more intuitive and easier to set up
some like common situations that you
might actually care about I'm super into
that idea and I I mean presumably it's
gonna be something close to stock and
least in terms of his look and feel but
probably not exactly because they are
separate from whether they're owned by
Google but they are treated just like
anybody else so they say well I think
that was brought out by the fact that
you had even at d11 you had motorola CEO
speaking on a separate day than yahoo
ghouls head down drew so they weren't
even like talking to each other or
presenting together or anything of that
sort right and by the way I think I
think one of the main reasons this is a
completely different story but I think
that one of the main reasons they're
doing that is so that it's very very
easy to spin off or dispose of that
business if like it you know they're
they're keeping the touch points as few
and far between as possible so that they
can just say okay we're spinning off
motorola and then like literally a day
later it's it's own company right look
guys we just we just want to be friends
because when this goes sour we really
don't want emotions to be hurt that's
right wasn't there some rumor about
there being like or did he talk about
like an extra processor or something or
was out in a different context I thought
I read something about their like being
a second processor and that would really
help a battery life because it would be
able to handle oh great stuff I can't
remember well I mean today's mobile
processors most of them have some sort
of low-power processor with the right I
know high score and media actually get
David Pierce on here yeah yeah Danny
norm for life yeah he is a companion
court of the verge mobile show that's
right um I just did that yeah if you're
only listening to the audio you missed
something terrible and you're welcome so
basically sometime later this summer we
are going to have just an embarrassment
of Android riches available to us we'll
have whatever Motorola's got at some
point in the summer hopefully sooner
rather than later because they're going
to want to get this out before june
twenty
which is zero day for finally getting
the galaxy s4 Nexus edition stock
edition google edition we still don't
know what these are called do we I think
it's officially google edition or
something is it I don't know you do see
the acronym GE floating around a lot
when you see these phones which is super
confusing speaking as someone who used
to work for GE but but yeah I I don't
know if I agree I mean did I I don't
think I'll say two things 1i will have
absolutely no I got this embarrassment
of riches we also now we learned at the
11 officially we're gonna have the HTC
One stock edition right which is great
news so I don't three phones don't like
each HTC calls this the HTC HTC One with
Nexus user experience Wow such as a
mouthful um so I'm gonna review that nu
e and just called HTC one knew you were
merely with with an umlaut on the right
yes I don't think there's any chance
that the Moto X will be at retail
bye-bye jun 26 yeah but secondly i don't
think that it matters at all because i
think that in reality as much as we
would like to will it into relevance the
odds of these google edition phones
actually mattering to the populace are
hovering near zero they'll matter to
people like us them they'll Mabel
they'll certainly matter to our
listeners but are they going to matter
to Joe consumer will they matter to
verizon like that's that's number one
because Motorola's beholding a verizon
well they're claiming this is going to
be available for everybody like they're
there they're clearly planning some kind
of big push right there touting up the
American this americano no sorry and no
sorry i meant the google edition phones
oh right i think those aren't very
relevant yeah the Moto X I think could
be a very relevant phone this year I see
your point Chris but I think that those
google edition phones are relevant to a
significantly influential set of people
and those are the early adopters the
people that want to have the best phone
that they can get as soon as they can
get it are going to generally want the
google edition or
least they've been clamoring or seems
like they've been clamoring maybe in the
Sacko chamber for so long to have these
things uh and then you know the you know
when your mom goes to rename her phone
in November when her contracts up she's
not looking for the google edition she's
looking for the one that's on the shelf
in the store yeah um but you know there
is that very vocal very loud pretty
influential subset of early adopters I
think we'll probably be all over the
Google editions I know that before the
HTC one was made official there had been
you know quite a bit of talk about of
rumors and things like that and one
rumor said that there's only going to be
50,000 available around the world
initially and a small oh it could be
enough it could be pretty small you know
the one that the developer edition has
been pretty much on backorder since it
launched dieter was able no I came back
in it came back in last week and I know
that because I tried to sell mine on
eBay and it didn't because the developer
regardless in my stock levels regardless
of stock levels of the gs4 and the one
stock editions I can guarantee you that
there will be major problems with the
ordering process on day one so be
prepared for a full day of swearing at
your computer because that's exactly
what's gonna happen man google couldn't
sell gumballs if i tried like if you if
they had a gumball machine on campus
you'd put a quarter in and it would just
jam and you a what's good end up
happening it's like at the end of the
day you'll be like did I order to did I
order none did I order one like I you
won't really know it'll be unclear and
then like a week later you'll get a
vague email that's like your your phone
is in process and then like six weeks
later was no no no no there's nothing
with the white Nexus 4 you get that
without too much people today like they
sent out a message saying their orders
are broken but there's i think i think
google actually said that that was that
was an error and he has no real issue
but this is how i guess there is the
issue is that they get yeah that's the
issue but this happens converter because
this is a demo with the nexus 4 you're
going to refresh the store a million
times hoping to see it in stock you're
going to add it to your cart you're
going to think that it went through but
you're not going to get a confirmation
email and then like four days later
you're going to get a confirmation email
saying they've accepted your order and
then about 10 minutes after you get that
email there'll be a phone on your door
stop man I
I got a flyaway hair here that's driving
me crazy I'm really sorry about this and
that my thing is mirrored anyway so
let's talk about these this the way that
they're doing this nexus thing because
we've been waiting for like basically
literally since what the nexus one for
us to come back to a world where top
shelf Android hardware the latest and
greatest was available with stock
Android and we've been just complaining
and bitching and moaning and now it's
here and it's pretty great like I posted
my big angry rant about boot loaders and
now we've got developer editions that
you can buy so I mean my since I'd
already been established that I can
complain about anything I will say that
I find it interesting and maybe a little
bit troubling that rather than just like
posting up roms and giving you know
developers instructions for taking the
retail edition and make turning it into
something stock they're making you buy a
separate stock one or a separate
developer one yeah but I know exactly
why that is oh yes carriers don't want
to accuse or Google doesn't want to be
accused by carriers of theft to subsidy
right well and carriers don't want to
support something they don't want to
have two different they don't want to
have a triage we're like you call in and
then you have to like explain that you
put the stock rom on instead of the
other thing like that's the other reason
that they say they lock bootloaders so
you don't put custom roms on is they
don't want to deal with the customer
support for it but I mean that quibble
aside and presumably like that quibble
is going to get taken care of because
the roms from these stock editions are
gonna get dumped and they're gonna be
made available and we're going to be
able to use them on the carrier retail
editions at least the AT&amp;amp;T ones which is
I believe for HTC it's the AT&amp;amp;T like
model and I'm pretty sure the samsung
one is also going to be that same build
I say well this as far as the hardware
is concerned I think the samsung one
supports both AT&amp;amp;T right right so the
samsung one is qualcomm yeah but there's
there some band thing with the HTC i
can't remember exactly what they it's
it's that is that it doesn't
support hspa+ right that's right or no
no again I think it's it's not even that
is that it doesn't support DC hspa+ on
tmobile wow I think okay or as t mobile
calls hspa+ 42 somebody right correct us
if we're wrong on that but I mean what
do you guys think that we now live in a
world where we will and less than a
month will live in a world where we can
just instead of complaining about having
to get skins from carriers and do what
that we could just go to google and buy
the phone that is hot and new and has
stock Android on yeah I think that's
growing I'm excited I think it's great
the only thing is that if you're an AT&amp;amp;T
customer you get doubly screwed because
you're still paying a subsidy that
you're not really been writing for all
right so but at least you don't have to
be under contract that's the one silver
lining right I guess it's like AT&amp;amp;T
should be like head over heels for
people about these things because it
doesn't have to pay a subsidy out on a
phone and yet it still rakes in the same
amount but of course I mean but I keep
hearing that I keep hearing people
saying uh you know why would AT&amp;amp;T
carriers here you're not taking the
subsidy and then like you know you're
still paying full price for the plan but
the fact remains that AT&amp;amp;T derives some
sick pleasure out of locking you into a
crappy last gen firmware filled to the
brim with bizarre crap we're like it i
think it was it's not sick pleasure its
i'll tell you it's it's cash money
really yeah well that's exactly right
money is the root of all evil around the
time of the gs3 18t started doing this I
can't remember what it's called but like
you the minute you turn on the phone the
first time it starts doing something and
then like throws Ian like this address
books inc thing and it's like it does
that on the one yes god i also have
their online setup thing to yes also
terrible yes and you just know that all
of these things are a consuming storage
and ram be slowing the phone down and is
just it it's such a nightmare
so so AT&amp;amp;T loses out on the ability to
control your experience on the phone
when you buy these stock devices I can
guarantee you that Ralph de la Vega is
losing sleep over these well he's not
losing sleep but he's really he is less
than happy that the phones exist I'm
just I'm just picturing relative de la
Vega at home sharing Russians nigga in
front of in front of the mirror be like
these next two solutions oh yeah I was
picturing him sleeping peacefully with a
feather you know with a pillow full of
cash yeah Ralph if you're listening we
love you yes we should talk a little bit
more about the Moto X though because the
I I don't want to downplay the
significance of the fact that this is
being built in the US what I was saying
on Twitter and I believe this is true
that Google is going to end up building
this this Empire of american-made
products over you know if they keep
going at this pace um what hits well
exactly two years but but the the Moto X
is without question the most significant
so product in that vein right so yeah
here's my thought on it though and I
think this applies just as much to the
Nexus Q the the Moto X is being built in
this Texas facility that was once owned
by Nokia the output of that facility
cannot be that great it can't possibly
be as big as some of the major
manufacturers are in Asia so you know
they only expect to make so many of them
they obviously don't expect it to have
the same demand as you might have for a
mainstream product that gets cranked out
by the dozens and that's exactly what
you know the approach was with the Nexus
Q and I don't mean i think it's it's
great to say that you know you're you're
making this in america and you're trying
to bring the manufacturing back to the
US and maybe this is just like the first
steps to that but i don't think that
this is the major shift you can't
compare the cue to the moto x I mean if
if Google and Motorola are seriously
planning for output on the same order of
magnitude between the Q and the
X then then there's something
fundamentally wrong with that company I
mean the Q was even before it got next
the queue was billed as like this weird
quirky experiment that they were just
calling right right but what I think the
Moto X is I think the Moto X is a
flagship device that's going to be that
rarefied status and it's not going to be
or Google is not expecting to sell it by
the millions that you would expect more
mainstream device to sell yeah I'm sure
that's true i mean i think that it won't
target an audience that's much different
than the audience that the gs4 and the
one are trying to target well I because
of Moto's market position i agree with
you they're not going to sell as well
i'm positive right i mean i yeah i'm
either for the gs4 is like the most
mainstream phone that i can possibly
think of it's the one that's your but
it's also playing device right I might
get right let's but its flagship in the
same way that the iPhone 5 is fly ship
and it's also like the world's most
mainstream device so right you know yeah
and I'm sure the motorola would love to
be there but I mean fact is they have to
start somewhere it's already a good sign
that it looks like this thing will be
coming to a variety of carriers because
Motorola's had this weird situation
going on for a few years now where
they're kind of like holding to verizon
but like they occasionally crap out a
mid-range phone on another carrier well
they talk about a more interesting
device sometimes the well so he's
rotational need your AT&amp;amp;T was more
interesting but like you know we heard
about it for a week reviews were okay
and then you never heard of that again
you're an average consumer and you walk
into a store and you've heard about the
galaxy and you pick it up and you hold
it and you see what it feels like and
then you see a motorola phone if they
make a really good motorola phone that
you know is it better or at least feels
better than the gs4 like there might be
enough brand equity there where they
could they could pick up some traction
in the u.s. right as long as it's not as
don't like me and blocky and ugly as the
razor series right because the razor
series by all arguments are better built
they're more reliable more horrible
they've got the Kevlar and the nano
coating and all that but they're ugly
and chunky and thick and heavy and all
that other stuff right so impressive on
your first touch yeah the other the
bit is like well as Chris was saying you
know Motorola's been beholden to verizon
they a lot of their sales every like
their whole company has been basically
riding on the droid series but they
still need that verizon push I don't you
know they've got google money but i
don't know how much they've got for
marketing on this thing and presumably
they're not going to be able to match
samsung splits right and so if Verizon
decides to make it Verizon's hero device
because they get to put some crap on it
whatever that would be a relatively big
help for motorola they still need that
assist right and they're not going to
get it from ATT 1880s my kind of proven
that there aren't really concerned about
pushing any other phones in the iphone
and their sales reflected that yeah yeah
we're Tywin HTC do we want to talk we've
got yet another CEO or not let's talk
about one before we get to that let's
talk about one more device limitations
HTC is that the one is actually finally
coming to verizon oh yes right okay
afraid at all things d was right it was
right all along it's coming to verizon
the summer it seems like it it's an
about-face because we've heard
statements kind of denying it I believe
or at least like there Twitter account
has kind of went off and said a couple
things way back in the day but yeah so
now HTC's got the one on all four major
US carriers which is a win it's a little
late and we don't know exactly when it's
coming to verizon or like I Suzie priced
competitively but to uh to HTC's credit
even Samsung was not able to launch the
verizon gs4 in sync with other carriers
so I think rising is just an
extraordinarily difficult carrier to
launch a device on I have nothing else
to say about the verizon HTC one other
than yay I hope that I I hope that they
they do a custom color scheme for it I
would like to see mention this in my
post I would like to see a black one
with red trim well there was uh there
were renders
red HTC one Wow before I think they they
leaked before it was announced that be
that would be pretty that would be
predict the black model if either of you
guys played with the black one cuz i
havent very briefly i have is it is it
like an anodized serve yes yes it's very
it's almost identical to what you get on
the iphone 5 the black so so
theoretically HTC should be able to
anodize that phone any color it wants so
yeah i mean a red one would be totally
baller or or even or an orange one even
i don't know where you got that idea
orangi be great never been done before
never thought of that though sorry about
the cop a few the cops are coming to
book DM well it wouldn't be the first
time today there's been an arrest by by
beater I I am our offices located very
close to the Hall of Justice here in San
Francisco so you're saying that the
office is in the throat like there's
like a radius around the office that is
a very high crime area there's something
about the presence of vox media in san
Cisco that just attracts miscreants miss
korea said man yeah yeah I blame you uh
Matthew Costello chief operating officer
I have to admit I can't remember this
guy's name but he left HTC along with
like half Thorat will not have a bunch
of other executives chief product
officer their agent CEO a bunch of
people that we are familiar with in the
US that were in the why I i would i
would correct you asian CEO and CEO of
Asia are different things HTC cuz AJ's
CEO yes because their CEO is Asian it's
true but all but that fabulous way to
make me look like a racist Chris thanks
a lot I just know that just clarifying
the ambiguity because saying that their
agent CEO left would imply the Peter
Chao left and of course he is still at
the helm of the company and right he
very famously made a statement according
to Wall Street I don't think this was
ever made public but hurry The Wall
Street Journal he wrote to the
poured that if the one was not a
commercial success he would step down
and of course the one is out I think the
jury is still way out on whether it's a
commercial success well the the number
that's been thrown out there is five
million so about half with a hassle the
side that's not official yeah I I think
it's a believable yeah but but also five
million a pretty damn good it is but uh
is that is that shipped or sold yeah and
and and Apple does that in a weekend
yeah when it launches the new iphone
we're just looking for enough money for
the company to keep limping along man
it's although therefore I mean well
without knowing their profit margins I
mean five million units of anything
should you know keep a company limping
along or flow right without knowing
their profit margins it's hard to say
it's just really upsetting to me and it
you know I've said this before but it's
very upsetting to me that a company can
produce what is arguably the best phone
or Hardware ever made and if if you
don't agree with that then you you
cannot argue that it's any lower than
the second best first being iphone 5 I
would argue it's the best but it's
upsetting to me that a company can pull
that off and still have its future in
doubt as these departures certainly
suggests it's it's it's very bothersome
to me right it's irksome I would say
well I think that just goes to show you
know that this industry is not just
based on hardware you know there's a lot
more to go into it whether that's your
software support or more importantly
your marketing which is well and and and
carrier relationships and carrier
relationships right which which is it's
funny that that is the is still such an
important thing for these manufacturers
because for a consumer perspective it
may seem like the carrier relationships
have become progressively less important
as time goes on as we're seeing fewer
and fewer customized devices and fewer
and fewer you know verizon specific
devices and sprint specific devices and
18t specific devices more both the
companies have all kind of moved into
offering the same device across all the
carriers that they can get it but those
carrier relationships behind the door
still so vitally important to the
success of the companies that are
manufacturing the devices right
meanwhile you know who we like
practically never talked about and is
not really an eminent financial danger
is LG I like hey you're just as long as
you can make blast chillers and you can
continue to sell black settlers you can
continue to subsidize your mobile phone
of it I would love a blast chiller in my
fridge that sounds like a nice feature
ever that is fascinating cans of beer
does a blast chiller cool and how long
does it take what I wasn't I wasn't out
there it was a CES 2012 right where they
were like demoing it during their
three-hour press conference and I want
to say they chilled it in like a minute
but I can't remember exactly it's
amazing I need that feature in my life
um yeah yeah I just played for the first
time with the optimus g pro at ctia yeah
would you think of it I actually look I
I liked it but I couldn't help shake the
feeling that it was literally a galaxy
note 2 like I'm you know that the
display is gorgeous LG of course makes
great displays but that's not that's
becoming less of a selling point I think
because practically every phone has a
gorgeous display now and apart from that
yet to do is galaxy note 2 has a flip
cover it's an 02 without the stylus yeah
it has it has the act it has an active
flip cover as well as charging which I
guess the galaxy note 2 dozen right so
that's a differentiator but apart from
that I guess it comes down to software
you prefer the you know the TouchWiz
experience or do you prefer the LG
experience this loyalty experience have
a name at well actually Samsung doesn't
call much publish measures anymore yeah
yeah they just called Samsung I mean the
nature UX I think they even didn't even
say that during the galaxy s4
announcement that was a human for the
galaxy s3 but they didn't mention nature
UX at all during galaxy s4 yeah HTC is
the only one that's really still pushing
hard with branding for their experience
so I mean back to the the optimus g pro
yeah i was with Chris when we were
checking it out and it seems like
everything chris said it just seems like
a second step like it's a it's just a
following step to the note to which has
been on the market since fall so it's
like right the screen is upgraded
comparatively ah but you know it just
feels like and if you close your eyes or
if you cover up the LG logos you'd be
hard-pressed to tell the difference
right I will say that the the g2x was
one of the worst phones I've ever owned
for a variety of reasons and its really
let such high hopes for that phone
though I remember I did I remember looks
like you're talking about that phone I
did well who'd you desperately didn't
have high hopes for that android 2.1
dual-core processor and was it qhd
display yet or was it still wvga I can't
remember I don't know but the display
sucked i remember that much yeah it was
a really terrible display and and i
remember that there were uh the froyo
upgrade for it got delayed for like
months and months and months and i got i
somehow got an early build of it and i
installed it on my my g2x and it worked
fine but the official release was
literally like delay like a year it
didn't come out for like a year after
when it was supposed to or something
insane like that and it was by then
phone is completely relevant but yeah
the construction the quality
construction materials were just not
that great and I don't know I mean I
i'll be very upfront i have not spent
enough time with LG phone in the past
couple years to know whether that
situation has improved much oh that's as
for is pretty well bill yeah but the
next yes but i don't i mean there
there's obviously Google influence on
those products well I don't know the
nexus 4 is just a modified version of
the optimus G which is has the dual the
same two layers of glass and whatever
that's fair yeah i'll give you that I
but I mean a spending time with the pro
I mean it did not feel like it was in
the same league build quality wise as
the nexus 4 so actually you bring up to
g2x and the delays in the software
update i we can just sort of wrap up
this whole android discussion because
the last thing to say about these these
nexus editions of the wall
and the s4 is google promises they're
going to get timely updates with the
latest version of Android but I don't
think it's a hundred percent clear if
these updates are going to be going
straight from google servers to the
phone or if the builds get maintained by
Samsung and HTC respectively I believe
it's probably Samsung and HTC so even
though they don't have to wait for the
carrier stuff I suspect that a true
Nexus device would still get billed
before these other devices or at least
like if they if they do push them all
out at the same time they might be just
because they waited like I don't know
for sure but I'm it's not as safe a bet
as a Nexus device write a proper nexus 4
it's still I think a safe bet but like
ninety percent of say hey I think I
gotta sleep easy I got the same
impression as you dieter and I think it
has to come down to the various hardware
differences between the devices the hcc
has a unique camera it's got unique
audio system Samsung has got extra
sensors on it and all this other stuff
that would eventually have to be
supported by these stock build of
android so that's I mean Google's going
to either you know take total ownership
of these devices which I don't think so
or it'll work with the manufacturers and
that could put a delay on things yeah
yeah episode I mean uh thing that
happened at the 11 is Tim Cook got
interviewed and i gotta say like he
didn't say much it moves back to them
too I mean WWDC is coming up I that's
trim cook I me a pelear airlie said
something bombastic and her shattering
at d I mean that you know there'll be
some quotable moments but they you know
I think that they've I saw on Twitter
the only thing they've ever like an
introduced at d was the airport express
so coho I mean which by the way I used
to love I used to love the airport
express so much because it was a perfect
thing to take into a hotel room cuz you
could plug the hotel's Wi-Fi into that
thing and make your own little Wi-Fi
hotspot
instead of using crappy hotel Wi-Fi and
now it's amazing no no no most hotels
are getting smart it used to be that you
could connect up 30 devices to that hot
spot in the hotel's be none the wiser
but now they've figured out a way to
like see through those hot spots to
connect up to the ethernet and you end
up having to pay for each individual
device again at least the last three or
four times I've tried it it's very
annoying well that may be true but but
even now that the airport express is
still I'd say probably one of the best
if not the best a way to like get
airplay to a random room in your house
if you have speakers that you want to
plug it into like it's just really
cost-effective way to do it and it's
also a Wi-Fi repeater like it's a super
rational device right but but that's a
new study my aggression introduces d
introduced to d yeah it Tim Cook did not
say much I you know he hedged on
virtually everything that he said he he
had a quotable moment about glass if I
remember correctly right uh he said that
he believes wearables are interesting
but Colette's not glass basically so
there was a bit there and then he also
the thing that that really perked my
ears up is he made hints that they might
open up the iphone a bit more and I'm
sure it won't be the fully open platform
that I'm dreaming of but his quote was
on the general topic of opening up api's
you'll see us open up more in the future
but not to the degree where we put the
customer at risk of having a bad
experience so but I believe if i
remember correctly this was a during the
question and answer section with the the
audience uh and the question itself was
specifically mentioned how android has
better input options with regards to ya
wold would after him on keyboards
actually yeah yeah and go and and this
was his response to that which is which
is very interesting to me um you know
people have been saying for years that
they want swipers or traceable types of
keyboards on iOS because you can get
them on android and they work great and
everyone's happy with them but you're
still stuck with each additional tap to
type keyboard which admittedly iOS is
very good uh it for that style of tattoo
type keyboard but um you know even
android stock with a a swype
keyboard that works i love side yeah i
mean i don't love the swype branded
keyboard
I love some of the other variations that
like even the stock android 4.2 keyboard
i think is great and i used the tracing
feature all the time but it's very
interesting that he did not flatly say
no we're not going to do that well so i
had heard this was before swipe was
acquired by nuance a rep from the
company had told me this is probably
what twenty two thousand nine or
something that they had been talking to
Apple for a long long time an apple kept
calling them back to cupertino to like
just you know talk Turkey and so it's
obviously been on Apple's mine for a
long long time that they might need to
look into doing something like this if
one surprise me at all if this is one of
I mean it's just it's it's a
continuation of apples long-standing
strategy with iOS updates where every
major version has like one or two like
oh my god yes I've been waiting forever
for that feature kinds of catchers and
it that could very well be one of them
for iOS 7 yeah for sure that and of
course the flatter design which is still
percolating around the internet and so
we're fully expecting that at WWDC and
by the way by the way Walt Mossberg is
almost certainly briefed on what Apple
was doing and I in the next version of
iOS well before anybody else in the
industry so it would not surprise me if
that question was placed open with with
knowledge of what was going on I don't
know and I about that I yes okay yes I I
would I would I would bet a dollar on
that I would put on a solid Washington
on Walt Mossberg knowing of something
happening in iOS 7 involving keyboards
hmm ok what else make logical
progression be recently what was it I
was sick five that we got dictation
finally whatever the iphone 4s launch
you're about to be a dollar poor iowa
survive so you know it took forever to
get the voice dictation to text but
there hey you might as well just kiss
that dollar goodbye just take it out
your wallet put it aside just don't
spend it because you're gonna have to
give it to me
you should have been a real man and been
a Bitcoin but hey I don't want to bet
dieter like 150 boxes yeah here's the
thing i'm gonna get you this dollar my
gonna am I gonna pay the coif you
transfer it yeah they'll take a fee out
if I try and paypal to you if I mail it
to you gotta pay for the stamp that's
not gonna happen I gotta take one dollar
what do i do all I you just gotta fly
out or no you know what you can do uh
you can say you can find you buy a plane
ticket to come here and collect you
somebody through gmail though it was
announced at i/o you oh that's right all
right that's right house money but I
take a fee out I don't know I haven't
looked into it I'll tell you what dieter
I will take the hit on the fee you can
just pay me a dollar and I'll get the 95
cents or whatever okay okay no way but
no but see there's no way that I'm gonna
pay out on this bed because the bet
isn't that there's going to be keyboard
stuff the bet is that Walt new and you
can't prove that uh well I mean what are
the odds that he's gonna bring up
keyboards drink the 11 dude I would the
keyboard on the iphone is a it's
terrible like a very great it was
amazing it was amazing so the rest but
no were like they're like a billion
other things to talk about like its iOS
their billion other things to talk about
you could talk about like the
notification situation you could talk
about like I know you could you could
drill deeper I'm like the UI stuff you
there are a million ways you could take
a conversation that could have taken
that conversation I mean I want to spend
an hour asking questions about Game
Center and why that still looks the way
it does and will it be changed as
spoiler alert dan nobody uses Game
Center battery on my downloaded next the
game center I never opened game center
but there you go you're right you don't
whatever yeah it's like watchin that
would be like the ultimate troll for iOS
7 to come out with a completely like
flat redesign that looks awesome and
modern and yet they don't touch game
center at all in games that is left as
it is well that's I mean like I think of
game centers like a conduit right like
every game connects to it so that like
you can you have leaderboards and
achievements to whatever but no one
actually goes into the game center app
only when someone adds me and I need to
like accept
them or deny them right yeah yeah I
never well no I never used game center I
it for certain games will only
communicate over game center and then it
gets frustrating it's like oh I'd love
to see this in android Oh wah wah
they're tied into Game Center thanks
Apple well Google's gonna do the same
thing with its games platform right
right exactly to the Android and whomp
whomp yo open fainted you ultimate
survivors I'm going to start a business
and it's going to buy up old iphones and
old android phones whatever the earliest
version that still supports Game Center
and whatever androids thing is that i
can get the oldest cheapest phones and
then i'm going to hook them all up to a
server and then i'm gonna let these
games communicate cross-platform between
these two services so like you just you
get to register your crappy iphone in
the cloud and your crappy android phone
the cloud and they talk to each other
it's like Aereo for games Aereo for
games you just blew my mind i know right
you blew my mind yeah who's going to see
you if you're really going to be area
you need to be sued i'm pretty sure i
would get sued by plenty of people with
this plan s4 mini i love that a 4.3 inch
display gets called mini now I know when
you think about the galaxy s2 flagship
was 4.3 inch but yeah the mini the mini
as everybody expected is a complete joke
because well I'm not know for now no you
hang on oh poor boy three would be fine
if it was 720p it's not it's qac oh
really yes out of my face of the qhd man
the worst exactly thank you and it's
like pentile so it's cute a man i'm just
getting to first again screw it but the
first guy will be the only one with the
first did you see that a facebook put
sent out like a little like mailing like
a how to tip for the first telling
people how to turn off facebook home
really this hilarious that couldn't have
been done through an epic notification
they had to like physically mail
something no no it was like an email
come on but but the the text of it was
something like if you need a break from
your friends or something just disable
facebook home the wording was really
funny yeah way they said yeah Wow but
yes I mean so this mini is is yet more
evidence that nobody in this industry
can take a quote unquote small
smartphone seriously they're they're
treated as mid-range devices and that's
that's a shame because they should be
there should be small options with flake
ships packs there's no excuse for it the
only the last one I could think of that
you know fit the smaller size and
flagship specs was a HTC 8x and I had
the 4.3 inch 720p display had the best
processor that Windows Phone could get
at the time uh and you know an advanced
camera and all that other stuff so but
you know as far as with androids
concerned uh yeah I can't what was the
last the 1s had a 4.3 inch display and
that wasn't even really considered top
of the line because it wasn't 720p so
the that the droid incredible 4G LTE got
a for Ashley was it was was it for it
was four inch qhd and was also a super
chubby and thick I thought him yeah 720
p % o the resound the HS amazon had a
4.38 720p display yeah and that was the
first time 20 p yes in the u.s. yeah hey
but yeah I mean for all and then as more
statement isn't even coming to the u.s.
does anybody care it's been rumored to
come to AT&amp;amp;T I think okay been rumored
as being on the road map whether that
actually happens or not kudos I mean but
we're with that even slot I mean like
what are they going to put because
they're still selling the gs3 so how are
they going to price it as where are they
going to position it samsung can't
possibly be cranking out more GS threes
right is it still manufacturing GS 3s
you'd think that i think is that it
would have transitioned to the gs4 or
adventures I didn't know I I totally
disagree s4 at all that's what I do you
do what I keep making the s3 and I don't
I don't even bother making this for many
but the more the more factories it gets
well
yeah the s4 mini but I mean the more
factories it gets working on the s4 the
lower it can bring its cost of bill down
and the threat can push its profit
margins and then as the time goes on and
it needs to drop the price of the phone
because it's now eat what sold you know
those profit margins are somewhat
protected by the expanded manufacturing
but I don't think that's the business
model samsung is going for I think
they're looking to slot right into
apples business model which is we're
going to solve the gs4 for a year at
this price point or the very tail end
will start to discount and underneath
that we're going to slap the gs3 and
there are still a couple carriers that
are that are offering the GS to their
budget carriers but they're still out
there so i can guarantee if the gs3
isn't still being manufactured Samsung
certainly built up a large enough stock
so that they can supply for a long time
to come is there a ton of carrier still
offering it and they're not being like
they're not like on clothes out there
just like their phones are available for
sale I think that's exactly what Samsung
wats we're well we're the maybe they did
the gs4 mini could be priced up 50 bucks
on contract and it's quickly trying to
free like the first I think the gs4 mini
could be returned to sender and never
heard from again that's what I think
Kenan should happen to it um Samsung
yeah do we want to time it so this this
for that these new bands on verizon LTE
in the s 4's we want them but there's a
whole bunch of phones are going to
support the new bands do you want is
anybody care to nerd out on verizon LTE
bands because i know but maybe you do
because you're into it in a weird creepy
fetishistic way well but I mean is to
cs4 the case you what one else yeah
there was one more oh then 928 I think
yeah 928 q10 s4 and what's the deal with
the with what are the bands here now a
time opening up a new AWS verizon
historically has just been on 704 for
LTE and other they're moving to a dual
band situation just like 80 I love it
when you talk frequencies to me baby
well it's funny that these are going to
be on them all on the market long be
for the AWS frequencies or even turned
on yeah good for verizon uh man we've
just got a bunch of like random stuff to
talk about I guess we got a bunch of
apps stuff um vine for Android yeah how
can we not mention that yeah well I'm
just did there it is apparently I
haven't used yet but apparently it's
like super buggy and slow is that you so
so when you're using the buggies your
life slow and also enables hackers to
upload the entire eternity of which is
me so for an average user the the
performance within the app is fine like
when you're scrolling through your feet
and your what you're looking at other
peoples finds they playback fine they
play back fast I tested it on the one
and my nexus 4 performance was great but
when you're actually like shooting a
vine and you complete it and you say
like okay it takes like five times as
long to process as it does on iOS so
you're just like sitting there watching
the bar like creek crawl along before
you can share it and then you can't
share it to Facebook yet you can't use
the front-facing camera yet you can't
search yet doesn't support hashtags yet
I don't think he's sports mentions yet
so it's kind of ways to go to keep up
with iOS but the first step is I guess
getting on Android so it's out yeah okay
it made a lot of people really happy I
didn't hear a lot of like people were
complaining about the bugginess but I
think that that was generally drowned
out by by cheers from from the majority
of the Android sphere lease on on
Twitter as far as I could tell so the
new google calendar and android it's
fine it's got new Pickers i don't care
it's like it's whatever like custom
picker color Pickers do you like it
maybe it's a hint at what we're going to
see in the next version of android in
terms of look and feel but beyond that
i'm not at that interested the new gmail
is kind of it's a little it's a little
the new calendar i haven't played with
new gmail yet but the new calendars a
little google now ish right in terms of
like yeah yeah cut it emphasizes cards
when you're like changing the times and
dates and things like that yeah right
card type of fuel yeah but the new gmail
is out for iOS it's rolling out for
android if you're special it doesn't
work on google apps accounts but it
works on
standard you know regular no totally
totally works on Google Apps accounts no
it works but you don't get the new tabs
the new categorization I definitely have
them Oh Miley yeah oh well then I am
wrong oh yeah there is I could turn it
on but I never will because the new tabs
don't do it worst the worst so bad they
ruin priority inbox so if you've gotten
used to priority inbox and you're using
priority box and you want to be like oh
let me check out the new thing oh I
don't like it can I go back no you can't
go back to let me tell you what the real
problem is like the tabs if you look at
a tab and you see oh there's four unread
emails and you go look at the next tab
it doesn't show you those unread anymore
it only shows you new ones as they come
in and maybe there are people who like
that but I am NOT one of them and it's
not okay to like have to like check
through my tabs to look for email again
that's not cool at all so somebody then
and and you pointed this out Dan
apparently on the iOS f you don't get to
turn on they added this thing where you
can get notifications just for priority
inbox which is like finally I can only
get notifications popping down taking up
half the damn screen on the iphone 4
actually important emails and I don't
have to get it for every single PR blast
and group message that comes into my
inbox but no the only way that you get
to check that box is if you switch over
to the tab system is that right is that
how it works yeah yeah yeah thanks a lot
Google yeah so at somebody on Twitter
said that it was like a fake inbox zero
because because it like shuffles all of
these other things into these tabs and
then your your primary Inbox or whatever
might be inbox zero but you've got you
know 20 messages over there that you
just don't know about but dieter is like
the biggest fan of in the world of fake
inbox zero like I have a mullet agencies
he's told me stories about just
archiving everything into these inbox
and pretending like yes no email
although I here's what I do I archive
everything in my inbox into like a
bespoke label that I make and then you
know I do my work that I need to for
that week because I know I'm not gonna
be able address any of that email like
I'm a damn at a conference I'm like you
know what I just want to deal with this
conference right now and then after the
conference like
I go back and deal with that stuff in
that bespoke label sweet I'm a hero if I
don't yeah yeah wasn't meant to be goes
on you know the brain they'll pump it
back into my inbox it's important yeah
so that's a big fan of that method so
the new web came out for iOS the main
difference is that it's got the support
for the custom labels and if you turn
them on you get the priority inbox
notifications blah blah but the Android
app actually got a much more significant
update at least in my opinion it's got
ya support for these new labels it's got
swiped down to refresh which is like a
pseudo pull-to-refresh it's the same you
do the same thing with your thumb but
instead of you know the whole list
pulling down you get a different
animation and it refreshes which is very
cool to me it takes those giant avatars
that you have in the iOS version and put
some next few messages in the Android
version um so I think and it just feels
faster and more fluid and it's a better
experience assuming you keep all those
new in boxes turned off ah because you
could still have priority inbox
notifications on Android without having
the new in box system right because that
was there from the get go right for a
while anyway right so yeh on Android
grumpy on iOS that's my baby they'll fix
it on iOS don't you think they've
already built it in they should just you
know make it work without that there's
no going back I think eventually
Google's going to force everybody to
switch to these new tabs and this is the
way all there well then I'm switching to
outlook.com yeah as well as a new mail
app right the emoji on email redesign
sweet I also heard a rumor that Yahoo's
weather app no longer has a stupid icon
no this is not a room that is the truth
it's a good icon to it's not not too bad
I mean he's a blue cloud it's not the
deed if I can go to focus focus it's not
focusing I might have to check that out
yeah
uh mobile stuff at computex Intel's
getting on some Samsung tablets ah
there's the the 6-inch 1080p fonepad
note from Asus I love how they had the
brazenness to call it the note like this
you know yeah that doesn't exist already
the biggest the biggest electronic
company the world doesn't use that from
one of their products so that's the best
I mean it I can't tell if it if asus is
trolling or serious i just like the ipad
/ pad phone line is joint role i'm
pretty sure it is because it has i've
got phone pad and pad phone and like
they're just like at what do we call
this one they flip a coin like and by
the way phone and more importantly none
of these products are have actually been
proven to exist yeah right they only
feel there's three of each they're out
there bolted two tables at trade shows
only place you'll ever see them again
yes and edit every trade show every like
three months they roll out the successor
to the one they just showed yeah like
it's a good thing it's a giant long
troll by johnny she and then they show a
picture of somebody holding a 7-inch
slab to their face placing a boy oh man
by the way uh if any of our listeners or
viewers have not seen the original uh
padfone announced you need I'm talk
about like the original original doll
from like seven we had another was this
one where he had it under the like cloth
and he's yes yes it was amazing that the
best part about it is that they had to
to prevent like a video feedback they
had obviously filmed filmed his his act
before the actual presentation and like
they were showing what what they wanted
you to believe was a lot of view of him
behind the main where he was like
standing and doing his thing but it was
a recording and you can see subtle
differences between like what he's doing
on stage and what's in the video the
supposedly live view like up close fetal
area so it's amazing you have to watch
it Johnny she is like that the greatest
showman in all the electronics
the CEO of aces Wow greatest there's
some stiff competition there man yeah
but Johnny she like has no limits he has
no shame yeah yeah like he will do
anything anywhere if it involves rolling
out a new non-existent device that
combines three different categories in
Des Moines like he's there Wow uh you
know I think that's a high note to end
on we've got places to go things due
next week is going to be insane we have
WWDC and we have III and god there's
probably something else I don't even
know I could tell you what June tenth
has long been rumored as the date that
Android 4.3 will launch oh great so if
that happens I'm allow me those are you
pulling an apple on on apple instead of
apple yeah they've been pretty crazy
absolutely would be that would be
amazing and crazy they didn't do it at I
