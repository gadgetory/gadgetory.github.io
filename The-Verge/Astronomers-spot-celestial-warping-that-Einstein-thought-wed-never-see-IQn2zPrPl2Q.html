seen a distant star warp the light of another
star, making it seem as though it changed
its position in the sky.
It’s a rare phenomenon known as gravitational
microlensing that even Albert Einstein thought
we’d never be able to see.
But now that we’ve proven him wrong, astronomers
hope to spot even more events just like this
one and use them to learn more about the stars
in our Universe.
Gravitational microlensing was first predicted
as part of Einstein’s theory of general
relativity.
And it works exactly like it sounds: it’s
gravity acting like a lens to manipulate the
light of objects.
Basically, super massive objects, such as
stars and black holes, actually warp space
and time around them.
And this warped space-time can then act like
a magnifying glass, changing the paths that
light takes through the Universe.
Microlensing occurs when a star passes behind
another star along our line of sight from
Earth.
The warping from the foreground star then
amplifies the light from the background star,
making it appear brighter and distorted.
In fact, Einstein predicted that when two
stars align, the background star would appear
as a bright ring around the star in the front.
We haven’t seen this perfect ring from two
stars outside our Solar System.
But this discovery is the closest thing we’ve
ever observed — the stars weren’t perfectly
aligned, so we saw this weird shift in position
instead.
These events can only happen when stars very
far apart line up just right.
That’s why Einstein once wrote that &amp;quot;there
is no hope of observing this phenomenon directly.&amp;quot;
In fact, up until now we’ve only ever seen
this type of movement before with our own
Sun, during an eclipse in 1919.
But Einstein didn’t quite know how sophisticated
our telescope technology would become.
In 2014, a group of astronomers using NASA’s
Hubble Space Telescope spotted this rare type
of microlensing, when a dense white dwarf
star passed in front of another star thousands
of light years away.
The stars weren’t exactly aligned, but close
enough that the white dwarf made it seem like
the background star performed a little loop
in the sky.
Microlensing has become popular in recent
decades to search for exoplanets and dark
matter, since the effect can temporarily brighten
distant objects that would otherwise seem
dim.
But now, astronomers say they can use this
technique to measure the masses of stars more
accurately.
For this discovery, they were able to use
the relative movement of the background star
to figure out the mass of the white dwarf.
Measuring the masses of stars this way could
be much more precise than other techniques,
since it involves observing the effect one
star has on another.
And this isn’t the last time these astronomers
will make measurements like this either.
Now that they’ve figured out how to spot
this type of microlensing, they’re hoping
to find even more events with new ground-
and space-based telescopes that are coming
online soon.
So, Einstein got it a bit wrong, we are going
to be seeing a lot more of this - but you’ve
got to give him credit for figuring all this
stuff out in the first place.
And this isn't the last time these astronimals....
