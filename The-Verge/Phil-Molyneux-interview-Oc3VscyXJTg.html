here with phil mono president and CEO of
sony electronics and you're here in New
York just to show off kind of all your
newest stuff you've got on the el otro
electronic side of shouting yeah that's
right we asked to your good guys to come
in and come and see our latest and
greatest but we also took it little step
further coming out of CES consumer
electronics show we announced our 4k TVs
and you know a few other products great
products but today we wanted to show you
a side-by-side comparison against our
competitors product so that you could
judge which was the best experience or
best audio or best picture so pretty
brave move and I think it shows the
confidence we have in the product line
so you know so you know what I got out
of this was that you're here you're
showing off your products against your
competitors products in some case it's
very traditional you have a TV they have
a TV you think your TV's better I think
everybody understands that story from
Sony but with your headphones it's
you're entering kind of a market that
you haven't been in before so they have
fashionable style headphones and now you
have fashionable styles headphones are
you trying to say that your product
stack up next to theirs directly you
know we've always been in the headphone
market you know we've always had a major
share in the headphone market the key
difference is and really what I wanted
to explain today we are the go-to
headphone manufacturer for the
professional end of the industry we've
been in there many years and if you go
to rent recording studios today you'll
see them wearing Sony headphones because
it's a trusted representation of what
happens in terms of the recording studio
and the monitoring of the audio output
in the mixing so those professional
producers and mixers use Sony headphones
by a long way and it's not only in
recording studios it's also if you've
got a TV stations or radio station
they've got so many headphones on in the
majority of cases so you're trying to
bring that experience to the consumer I
think it's important that it's
understood from a
from a professional end of the market
that we are the go-to headphone because
of the quality of the audio the true
representation of the audio output and
then using our knowledge and our
experience and technology put that into
our consumer orientated headphones so
that you know you or other people can
hear the music as it was meant to be had
heard and how the artist want you to
hear it yeah so the other thing
constructing about today was apart from
the tablet the Xperia Z tablet which is
very interesting very beautiful what you
shut off is very traditional sort of
consumer electronics from the electronic
side of Sony but the company has talked
a lot about the one sony initiative the
need to bridge across the company and
the two hottest sort of segments that
Sony has are the mobile and the
playstation 4 and you it's not that
they're not here it makes sense they're
not here they're different divisions of
the company but your integration up
through the company into those products
is was not really evident is there is
there a reason you're so tightly focused
on just the consumer electronics portion
here no so then it's great insight so
thank you for that the reality is we are
extremely well-connected and I'll give
you a concrete example we showed today
are 84 inch TV it's stunning and you
know it's full k out for a high
definition so it's a completely
different experience when we launch that
product into market in last November and
as part of that launch we work with Sony
Pictures our movie company and we
remastered several of their blockbuster
in fact 10 of their blockbuster titles
amazing spider-man and then salt and
Lawrence of Arabia into native level 4k
content and we package that together on
the server together with the 84 inch TV
with the tablet so that there was a
world's first experience for consumers
to have native 4k movies in their home
so that's you know from a Sony Pictures
point of view that's their assets yeah
from electronics it's the TV electronics
we put it together we deliver to the
consumer if we're more concretely
talking about the sony Mobile sigh then
the Xperia Z will be part of our
go-to-market approach we're talking
about near-field communication and one
touch we have some great audio product
out there in terms of our speakers and
our audio ball that always gets a giggle
but so the Xperia is that will be one of
those products that we show
demonstrating that one time so what if I
didn't push you on the tablet on the z
it's that is the hear you showed cameras
televisions headphones right right which
sony is sold for forever yeah and then
there's a tablet which is a very new
product category which is potentially
explosive product category which is very
different than the traditional other
products and I would say your focus was
on the traditional products and less so
on this kind of weird hybrid yeah that
blends the elements of a television it
has obviously the technology from the
mobile side of the business correctly
how do you how do you see Sony
transitioning and having focus on both
the mobile stuff the weird new products
and the traditional products so today we
showed the Xperia Z tablet right and
we're demonstrating that in conjunction
with the TV and how it's your your
second screen and the unique application
we have their TV sideview as you can
play with the content that you can see
visually on your tablet do you think the
tablet is more of a mobile device a
television device or a computing device
so our opinion is we have the xperia z
handset and that is truly mobile right
so it's kind of for the consumer now the
center of the world and your social
story etc and when you're out and about
that you'll go to device I believe that
when you have your tablet that is a
partly mobile but predominantly in home
device
and used as a second screen because our
experience that mobile phone device is a
5-inch screen yeah but the xperia z
tablet is a 10 inch screen so obviously
if you're at home and you can lean back
and interact with your TV and also have
a social agenda social media gender it's
a better experience on a 10-inch so you
have to look at what is outside world in
home world and then what is the best
product offering Sol Siler's eight your
needs well you have an LTE version of
the tablet will you do it maybe 3g 4g
hspa+ I think that's the natural
progression isn't it but if the tablets
mostly an in-home device you need it are
you seeing consumers a sport I said
mostly but of course then people on the
road in business will have a need for an
LTE device and to use it for
productivity purposes yeah so really
depending on the consumer but we're
focused on on satisfying the consumer
yeah and of course understanding their
habits and bringing the solutions they
need yep so we talk to you about the
tablet as a second screen i think is
very interesting like that is actually
explosive use of the tablet and growing
very fast and now you've got these new
televisions is there any direct
integration between the tablet than TV
so at this stage not you know we have
some ideas that I'll talk to you later
on okay but you know we're using our
tablet it has an infrared it's probably
the only one on the market now where you
can control not only your TV but your
home audio equipment and
you know whatever you have at home but
we also put unique sony developed
applications like TV sideview which is
giving a much better user interface to
control and understand the content
that's on your TV box and also share
with your friends and social media and
you know i'm watching this and what do
you think all dive in and understand who
the actors are and what other movies or
programs they've been in so it's richer
experience with bringing their so talk
about the TV it's obviously a 4k you're
talking a lot about upscaling yeah a lot
of x-reality all the stuff you're doing
to make 2k content look better yeah but
at CES my favorite products es yeah it
was a Sony product that doesn't exist it
was a circle with a light in it had said
prototype 4k player yeah is that any
more real if you put chips inside the
box yet so we were teasing us yeah I
mean it was I know I know there's a
circle with a lot but we have to put
context on this so with our 84 inch 4k
Ultra high-definition TV we ship it
today with a server and preloaded
content and that's just like a decent
hour it's a PC time but it's got some
tricks in there to make sure the the
consumer experiences you know great
wonderful but in addition to that now
we're working on a home server that will
allow in the summer a download service
for 4k content okay as well as we have
sony entertainment video unlimited so
you'll be able to get access to HD
content as well yeah and well that's
another service not maybe a little bit
fictitious at the moment but a better
player and it was beautiful it was my
favorite comments yet it's come i'm not
i'm not even kidding i showed i took
four people buy it just to see it I said
this box in the light is the best thing
in CS so I mean Sony is brilliant at
design
cosmetic design and industrial design we
do it beautiful we got one of fun
engineers so you look at the TV there's
55 and 65 and the magnetic fluid
speakers that point that you rather at
the ball and give you that dynamic sound
output and you see that server you don't
want to hide it in the in a cupboard
right you want to put it on the wall
it's beautiful well sir but it's
functional as well what you know
wondering and I know you can't talk too
much about the ps4 yeah but that's the
natural there are two things that I want
to ask you about one is they didn't show
us the ps4 the ps4 launch event because
they said we we don't want you to think
about the box we want to think about the
controller yeah and second you're
building a download service for 4k yeah
is it going to work on the ps4 have you
thought about it working on the ps4 do
you know it's a little bit like we
showed the server mock-up as you said at
CES and you thought it was beautiful but
you couldn't get any details right and
then we showing it again you were giving
it a little bit more as we go along so
similarly for the ps4 will give you more
details in due course but I promise you
you will not be disappointed over and in
terms of other 4k distribution yeah
downloads might take a long time right
the files are will be big are you
anticipating it they'll take over night
are you thinking they'll take a few
hours they start instantly yeah the size
of a typical movie depending on the
length of movie you're talking 100
gigabytes and plus right enough so then
you come in two variables about how fast
is your broadband at home or do you have
optical program like they do in houston
where then you can get the movie down
there pretty quickly yeah so that is one
of the challenges that we we have to
work through and for our summer launch
of our service we've got some very good
ideas that will make that a comfortable
consumer experience and then looking to
the future we we need to develop as an
industry new compression ratios yeah and
technologies and that down dialogue is
inactive progress at the moment is there
a I mean I you talked a little bit of a
blu-ray and the progress we're making
yeah is are you anticipating a physical
distribution for 4k as well I'm not
discounting it okay you think it'll be
download primarily so I think the whole
world is moving more and more to
download consumers are used to download
right and streaming so I don't want to
discount the good work that's going into
potential physical media distribution
but that's an industry association and
they're working hard but for the summer
we will bring this download service
first to market world's first and
compelling content than a you know why
the catalog catalog or content for
consumers to enjoy with Sony 4k Ultra
high-definition TVs all right well thank
you so much for I was always pledged our
pleasure thanks very much yeah good to
see you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
