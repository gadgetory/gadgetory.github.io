here with Mac OS Mojave this is the new
version of Mac OS it's going to be
available this fall but if you're
interested it just came out in public
beta and so you can try it out if you
want we're gonna take a look at some of
the big features and some of our
favorites the first thing and probably
the most noticeable is that there's now
a dark mode dark mode has been a long
requested feature for Mac OS and
probably every operating system and app
for ever and now it's finally available
it's gonna ask you right when you start
up Mojave if you want to do light mode
or dark mode and it's basically just
going to turn the chrome around all of
your apps into this you know black or
dark grey color it's kind of messing
with me right now because I'm not used
to it but I'm sure that there are a lot
of people out there who don't like it
now the big deal about Mojave is a lot
more technical and in-depth and that is
that iOS apps are coming to the Mac so
before if an iOS app was coming to the
Mac it had to be basically recoded from
scratch next your apples gonna start
letting developers take their iOS apps
kind of tweak some of the code and put
it on Mac OS now third-party developers
can't do that yet but Apple is showing
us what its gonna look like with four
apps to start and one of those Apple
news so you can see right here on the
left side you have this big column
that's really not like anything on Mac
OS already and then on the main pane you
have something that basically looks like
an iPhone app and you can click in you
get to swipe between stories there are
the normal iOS buttons at the top left
and top right to go back and forward
honestly things even look a little bit
touchable and a lot of the iconography
from iOS comes over here as well it's
not clear if this is how things are
gonna stay forever if Apple will make
these a little bit more Mac like or if
we're just gonna kind of get used to
that sort of hybrid app I will also
brought over voice memos and stocks
voice memos is pretty basic but it's
nice to have here the stocks looks a lot
like Apple News we have that bar on the
left and all these news items in the
middle that again you swipe between and
you have those iOS icons on the top it's
definitely it's a little bit weird but
this is pretty important because it's a
first look of what this new generation
of apps is going to look like obvious
la can still change this is very very
early and we don't know if Apple is
going to make things look a little bit
more like Mac OS but my suspicion is
that we might want to get used to this
style and the reason I say that is
because the next thing I want to show is
the App Store redesign so the App Store
has been redesigned to look a lot more
like the iOS App Store but what's
interesting is this is a Mac app Apple
hasn't really dramatically changed
things here it just brought in a lot of
its editorial content there's now a lot
more banners and there's just a lot more
read and do I don't think it's really
gonna dramatically change things but Mac
App Store is kind of languished for a
while and it's nice to see apples
starting to revitalize it a little bit
and I think we're probably to see a lot
more of that when these hybrid apps
start to flood that store so those are
the really big things there's also a
bunch of smaller tweaks all over the OS
that are gonna help you just use Mac OS
and one of the really nice ones is
railing desktop so if you're a person
who normally has a messy desktop that
looks like this you know just use a
feature called stacks which is gonna
automatically sort them into groups
based on what they are so is one for
PDFs one for images one for documents
you just click on them and they're going
to pop open and show you everything
that's inside them just close them again
and now everything is nice and tidy this
ties right into another feature they
really like and Mojave is updates to
quick look which is the future let's
just get the spacebar to preview a file
so now you can just hit the spacebar and
instead of this looking at the file you
can actually interact with it so it's an
image I can rotate it or I can jump in
and start annotating it
and pdfs - this is pretty handy that
feature is also available in the finder
in a new View mode so if you remember
coverflow
which was that after that started in
iTunes as a way to view album art and
the minutes were to finder and then I
don't think anyone ever used it
Apple now has a basically a more useful
version of that called gallery it shows
one thing at a time
but it also shows information about that
item beside it so into the metadata and
you have some options to interact with
it I think this is gonna make more sense
for some workflows than for others but
it's a nice option to have it's always
good to see how if you're paying
attention to the find the final thing I
want to show you is in Safari now the
really big thing here is that Apple has
added some privacy updates to stop
social media sites like Facebook from
tracking you all across the web now I
can't really show you that what I can
show you is you know what what I'm going
to say is even more important and that
is that you can now add favicons to tabs
and Safari so before it looked like this
where it just said the name of the
website now you can check this box and
boom you have those icons and we have a
ton of tabs open this is just gonna make
it way easier to read I don't know how
this wasn't available before this is an
immense upgrade and probably the main
reason to install Mohave that that's
very pushing a little bit ok another
neat thing in Mojave is a new screen
shot interface you can out hit command
shift 5 and it's gonna give you all
these different options for how you want
to capture your screen view Start screen
recording which can see you're doing
right now and one nice thing about the
screen shot is once you take it it's
gonna appear right in the corner of the
screen like it does on the iPad so you
can click it go right in start marking
things up just like you would in a quick
look so those are the big features in
Mojave there's a lot more here you can
try it all out if you want by installing
public beta I will warn you this is an
early beta things are still a little
buggy and broken especially those
transported iOS apps but if you want to
wait for it it'll all be available this
fall one other nice change is an update
to the screenshot tool can now hit
command shift by
you oh no a screen-recording crashed</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
