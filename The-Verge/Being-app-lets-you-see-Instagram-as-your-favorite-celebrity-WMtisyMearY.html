verge today we're taking a look at an
app called being which lets you see
Instagram through the eyes of another
user so if you've ever wondered what Kim
Kardashian or Taylor Swift sees when
they log on to their Instagram accounts
now you can find out super easily when
you log into the app the first thing
you're going to see is a list of a bunch
of different users of course for the
most part they are listing the most
popular celebrities so you'll see Kim
Kardashian Taylor Swift when you click
on their names it takes a little while
to load their feeds but once it does
it's well worth it you see their entire
feed and what they're seeing when they
log on to their own apps so for Kim for
example you see photos from Kylie Jenner
kendall Jenner her mom makeup artist she
likes and if you're really into those
things you can follow them back right
from the app okay so if celebrities
really aren't your thing you can
customize being to be a little bit more
personal so if you're interested in what
your best friend sees when he or she
logs onto their Instagram app you can
actually find out once you link up your
account there it is you can see all the
people your friends are following right
from the app right now it seems like
being really wants you to live inside
their app you can link up your personal
account you can follow celebrities you
can like photos directly from the app it
seems like being really doesn't want you
to access Instagram directly ever again
so be really interesting to see if this
catches on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
