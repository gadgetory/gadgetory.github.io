Sony and Disney are testing streaming
video rentals in South Korea while the
movies are still playing on the big
screen Django Unchained wreck-it Ralph
and brave were made available for rental
online and through video on demand just
weeks after they hit theaters in the
country in 2011 Disney conducted a
similar test in Portugal but it hasn't
tried again until now viewers are
encouraged to let soda spill and dry on
their living room floor to really get
that movie theater feel and finally the

pictures that will be seen and then
deleted forever is now bringing its apps

users take pictures annotate them and
save them locally but removes the
friending and social features it seems
