announcement instead of sending every
package through the mail who was gonna
look into delivering them through the
air single drone would take off and
bring it directly to your rooftop within
an hour of your order there are a lot of
logistical and regulatory problems to
work out first but the announcement
opened up an important door someday soon
flying deliveries through the sky might
be cheaper than driving them over roads
and that's still thinking small imagine
a future where tiny quadcopter drones
are as common as cars and trucks they'd
be everywhere above us a virtual sky way
using them to move things from point A
to point B is just scratching the
surface of what's possible so what else
will we do with them well one idea is to
use them as high-tech security on
massive estates you could have drones
docked and that'd fly when a motion
sensors triggered their drone ticks off
and check things out streaming back live
video so you can ignore the situation if
it's just a straight grope if it's
something more sinister you could alert
the local cops or shoot out some pepper
spray if you combine drones with
technologies like virtual reality the
possibilities for these eyeballs in the
sky get even more interesting anyone
with an internet connection than a GoPro
could take flight over a raging river or
travel inside an active volcano
quadriplegics have been testing out ways
to fly drones using just the movement of
their eyes forget about IMAX with live
streaming video and head tracking
Hardware millions of viewers could each
experience their own version of a
high-speed drone runs with grin Ken of
course that new freedom cuts both ways
those same drones could be used as
airborne paparazzi hovering endlessly
over celebrity targets and so far
there's no law to keep them from peering
inside your windows as they fly far
overhead in public airspace we've
already seen the first burst of creative
use for drones but it may be followed by
heavy restrictions and hard questions
how much airspace do we really want to
give up
how much weaponry should your security
drone be allowed to carry and maybe most
controversial will drone you stay open
to casual hobbyists or will it require a
license and registration like flying a
helicopter driving a car
a gun we're still struggling with these
questions and the answers will make a
big difference and how the drones of the
future behave</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
