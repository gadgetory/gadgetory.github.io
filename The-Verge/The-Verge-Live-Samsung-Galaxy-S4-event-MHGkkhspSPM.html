ross miller senior editor for The Verge
just minutes ago Samsung wrapped up its
galaxy s4 launch event and as always we
are here to provide a minute-by-minute
detailed analysis breakdown of that
event and all the news but first here's
the galaxy s4 hey guys it's David at the
verge and this is the samsung galaxy s4
it's brand new flagship phone from
samsung so the first thing you notice is
that it's not actually that different
from the galaxy s3 it has kind of the
same design ID the same even feel in
your hand it's a little slimmer a little
lighter but basically the same kind of
feel there are bunch of things that are
different though the screen is bigger
it's a 5-inch 1080p Super AMOLED display
and it has a pentile pixel layout which
we don't love but the screen looks great
and it's super high-res and really
shouldn't cause any problems it's also
more powerful than ever has the Exynos 5
processor and either comes with that or
a Qualcomm chip depending on the region
you're in comes with 16 32 or 64 gigs of
internal storage plus microSD slot and
it's coming with Android 4.2 point2
jelly bean which is the latest version
of Android and not a lot of phones
launched with that which is pretty
exciting Samsung's trying to do a lot of
crazy software things and they really
need power to pull it off so one of the
big things Tim some talked about is the
camera there's a 13 megapixel camera on
the back of the phone and a 2 megapixel
camera on the front and that allows them
to do a lot of different things one is
this dual shot mode where you can
actually see the front and rear cameras
at the same time and they brought some
of the galaxy camera modes to this
device as well so it's definitely the
most powerful camera ever we'll have to
test it out more to see how it actually
does there's all kinds of wild software
stuff on this phone and you can see just
from all the things you have to enable
or disable that there's a lot going on
here one of the big things is called air
gesture and basically what it lets you
do is swipe through photos or scroll in
your web browser without ever actually
touching the phone so you can just
scroll right through all your photos
without having to touch and you can do
the same in a web browser or you can
scroll through your tabs and it's kind
of a gimmicky thing but it does seem to
work relatively well and it's cool
your hands are dirty or wet or what
happened there's also air view which i
think is even cooler so in the browser
without actually touching the screen you
just sort of hover over it and then you
can pick what you want to see and even
Flipboard has done some things with it
so that you can hover over it and see
stories within a particular section
without ever actually having to touch it
one of the biggest things and sort of
the most surprising from Samsung is s
health they love putting s in front of
things and they're basically trying to
replace Fitbit and the FuelBand and all
these different things so there's a
pedometer and a temperature and humidity
gauge inside this phone and it'll
actually track your steps as you walk or
it'll track your heart rate by a device
that works of Bluetooth or it'll track
the temperature and humidity and it'll
tell you all these things about kind of
how you're doing over time you can see
you know i'm weird in kind of an ugly
hotel room so surroundings are poor and
you can track the food that you're
eating and all this different stuff so
it's all built into here and they're
selling some add-on accessories as well
and it's just a pretty clever thing it
seems like something that should have
been built into your phone forever ago
and it's gonna be interesting to see how
this works there's also group play
Samsung loves doing things that involve
lots of their different phones and in
group play you can set a music or photos
or documents or what have you to all of
the different phones at the same time
and it'll sync music so you can listen
as a group and again we've seen a lot of
these features on samsung devices before
and they're kind of gimmicky and we
don't necessarily use them a lot but
they're relatively clever features so
there's also an IR blaster inside the
device which lets you use this to
control your TV and your whole home
theater and they use some of the same
technology they've used before they're
using peels TV Guide so you can see kind
of what's on TV and flip through and use
it to actually control your set-top box
and there's on-demand content all this
stuff that you can watch on your phone
and then push straight to your TV it's
kind of approximating airplay plus a
bunch of extra TV Guide functionality
and it's pretty cool and other devices
and as a smart thing to have here so
that's really it this one's going to be
out on all four major US carriers in the
second quarter of this year it's also
going to be on some regional carriers
and be all over the world there's no
word on pricing yet except to say that
it's going to be a very premium phone
and this is definitely Samsung's
flagship device going forward and that
is the samsung galaxy
joining me now is chris ziegler
basically he ran point for the entire
version news staff today Chris how are
you doing uh besides the fact that I
need a beer and a cigarette and a nap
I'm doing I'm doing quite alright how
about your us I'll give you ten minutes
you can do all that doing just fine I
just want to get your reaction to the
event you basically washed it streaming
like I did I did I thought you did you
just watch the live blog no no I I did I
did that was a statement and a question
Oh fine fine well so what's your
reaction to the event well I think that
this this phone is basically what we
expected given the leaks and the teases
leading up to the event it was a very
iterative device in fact you know the
site right now we have a great editorial
/ report up from our own Vlad say Bob on
the fact that this is very much
emulating apples well known tick-tock
strategy of releases where they do a
major redesign followed by a minor
update and I think that's what the four
is compared to the three the three was a
major shift from the two but the four is
basically the 3s and that's exactly what
Vlad calls it the galaxy s3s mm-hmm well
doesn't roll off the tongue I want to go
over some of the specs though so it's a
5-inch 1080p Super AMOLED is that
correct that's right okay it's also got
in samsung exynos 5 or a Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 pro why the difference Oh
out of you remember but last year we saw
and really two years ago as well we saw
similar things we're in North America
they'd release usually a Qualcomm ship
and then internationally they release a
different ship either from Nvidia or
Samsung both with HTC and with Samsung
and and the reason for that is that
Qualcomm well we don't know with this
phone specifically but typically the
reason has been that when a when a chip
maker releases a new chip and that chip
maker is not named Qualcomm they need to
do some work to integrate Qualcomm LTE
modems or other companies LTE modems
that frankly isn't done yet so but but
Qualcomm has already done that work with
s4 pro so so they release those devices
since they need LTE LT is basically a
requirement on all carriers
in the US now so they have to use a
Qualcomm chip in the US and then
international indies whatever chip they
want but Samsung is one of the biggest
uh chip makers in the industry why
haven't they figured this out yet I
think it's that they're taking a world
view I mean that they kind of have to
we've long heard that that carriers
favor Qualcomm modems in the u.s. anyway
and it was only recently that Nvidia
released an LTE integrated a tegra chip
and I think that Samsung is kind of in
the same boat where they figure that
they can they can attack every
everywhere except North America with
their chip they can sort of hobble along
and I shouldn't even say ha belongs s4
pro is a really good chip it's not a
samsung but they can they can
release that in North America and then
maybe down the road they can switch over
a notably HTC to did that last year with
the the 1x plus the original 1x used a
Qualcomm chip in North America and a
Tegra 3 elsewhere by the time the X plus
came around which is involved last year
they had figured out the LTE thing with
with tegra 3 so they rereleased at north
north america with a Tegra 3 instead of
the qualcomm check what you're basically
saying is we're gonna have the galaxy s4
S or the galaxy s 3 s plus we just might
we just might a couple of things we
talked about we have the it launched it
with Android 4.2 point2 jellybean it's
actually kind of a rarity these days
yeah the the HTC One which was announced
what three weeks ago I think and
actually I've one in my hands now right
here this was announced with 4.1 which
is kind of sad for HTC considering how
long 4.2 has been out but it's I mean
this is an age-old complaint right I
think since since version 1.6 of Android
we've been complaining about how long it
takes to get upgrades so yeah the fact
that that Samsung was able to release
this on 4.2 is good and I think that
it's probably telling that they are a
little tighter with Google then HTC is
not to say they're super tight I think
it's widely understood at this point
that Samsung is kind of trying to create
its own ecosystem outside of the Google
blessed Android proper but still I think
that they have a better relationship
with Google and they have access to
those updates prettier
Leon if you remember it I think it was
at i/o last year Google talked about how
they were offering these android updates
to major OEMs early these close partners
early and I think that Samsung is one of
those partners but is it just am
something I mean clearly they have a leg
up on this than everyone else no LG
phone no sony phone no HTC phone and
they've all pretty much announced major
devices recently Samsung the only one
that's gotten four point two point two
at launch though I think that speaks to
Samsung's size and the fact that Google
is completely unable to ignore what
Samsung is doing just like Apple is
we've seen Apple go on a trash truck at
a trash-talking spree the past 24 hours
they've been shopping a Phil Schiller
around to different news outlets and so
i think that's that's just the reality
samsung is large enough they have enough
scale so that they have those advantages
and it wouldn't surprise me at that
access to 4.2 before anyone else outside
google i really would be surprised at
all that makes sense i do on top of the
apple thing though you did mention that
they've been shopping phil schiller
around he's made a lot of great
statements lately great being biting
it's always fun to watch corporations
fight each other not but I do want to
ask we haven't heard any of the famous
apple rumors come up usually when
there's a big announcement we see hints
of a new iPhone on new iPad even a watch
for example we haven't heard anything
like that right and I think we have a
report on that up on our front page
right now you can check it out but but
basically I think what it comes down to
is that Apple is in this weird part of
their their product cycle where they
they literally don't have anything that
they could have leaked to take the
spotlight off of the galaxy s4 that they
may have been able to say something
about the ipad or you know leak
something to the journal for instance
but that's still kind of not germane to
what today's announcement was obviously
and i think the iphone the next iphone
is still far enough out so that it isn't
solidified enough so that they can leak
something that would garner enough
interest generate enough buzz to really
pull eyeballs away from the galaxy s4 so
the alternative was to shop phil
schiller around and have him say really
mean things about android and about
samsung and that's exactly what happened
it just seems weird almost like on the
defensive like I'm actually hinting new
products they're just going out against
the competition this is not style we're
used to I guess right yeah I it's it's a
very very blatant recognition that
Samsung has become too large and too
powerful for Apple to just go about
their business and ignore them and
you're right it does kind of look like a
sign of weakness I always go back to
Google's Maps event I think it was last
May maybe where they they called every
journalist in the world out to Mountain
View around the same time that that
Apple was doing their own version of
maps google called everyone out to
Mountain View for a Maps event where
they announced literally nothing they
just like basically wanted to call
everybody out to say hey check out doing
yeah check out google maps and and it
everybody perceived it as this huge sign
of weakness and and and you know sign of
fear from google over what Apple could
do with maps and of course that fear
ended up being completely unfounded but
but that's that's what it smelled like
to me when when I first saw Schiller
make those comments to to the journal
last night right now I do what I
actually one thing you um you've been
doing big reports on wearables you seem
to be x-pro that's basically on the
verge about that we're not make locks
right now you were gonna watch right now
I've got my my Nike FuelBand which is
pretty much kind of dumb phone
equivalent of that I do want to ask
though Samsung does not seem to go after
the phone market they had this kind of
health s-band thing spanned whatever
want to call it that's basically all
we're seeing do you think Samsung's
gonna like hit that field or why they
avoiding it I think that given Samsung's
philosophy the way Samsung does this
business it's inevitable that they will
eventually if if the SmartWatch feel
picks up enough steam I think it's
inevitable that they will come to market
with one actually interestingly i don't
have the name of it but it's probably
seven or eight years ago they did a gsm
watch that you could actually buy it was
a real thing wasn't compatible with us
bands but point being samsung is not a
complete stranger to the idea of a smart
wearable and i think we could definitely
see them return to that you know if if
certainly if Apple comes out with an
iWatch
they're widely expected to at this point
Samsung will definitely come out with
one like six to 12 months later
basically basically nest watch a SWAT
right well let's watch they can't call
us watch they can't calls that's the one
time it can't they can't use s they
can't uh Kristen what you got a second
just one last question we've now seen
basically all the big companies come
with their flagships the Xperia Z the
HTC One the galaxy s4 which is the one
to get right now or the when they all
come out at least yeah you know so we we
saw RZR xperia z and our one reviews go
up this week i think that the Z has some
pretty serious shortcomings that prevent
us from giving it our seal of approval
particularly in software Sony is not
known for its software chops in android
and i think that the z is no exception
unfortunately the one having played with
it for the past 24 hours here i have to
agree with david's assessment that the
hardware is incredible it's um it might
be the best looking and feeling phone
ever and and and that's saying something
considering that i have an iphone 5
sitting right next to me and I've played
with basically every phone made in the
past decade so I think I think that you
could feel very good about buying a one
in the next few weeks the only reason
that I can see to choose a galaxy s4
over the one is that a the galaxy s4 is
probably going to ultimately be
available on more carriers than the one
just because of Samsung's reach in coal
with carriers and two if you're if
you're just completely obsessed with
bells and whistles the galaxy s4 is
going to win on that count just like the
galaxy s3 did tonight we saw so many
weird and wacky features get introduced
into the platform like the air gestures
and and all this ridiculousness so if
that really draws you in that's
something that HTC just can't win on but
if you're looking for the best feeling
and looking phone on the market I think
it's going to be the one alright Chris
thank you very much thank you all right
joining me now uh actually right here
there's special magic right here David
Pierce I just a Peter
out of the floor out of complete dusting
this remarkable talent is pretty awesome
i gotta say samsung taught me how with
the galaxy s4 oh is this the SF / ition
separation permissions apparition david
thanks for joining us thanks were
running right back after what a weird i
wish i could be censored kind of show
right it was it was a scene it really
was i don't i don't even know how to
describe it like it was so we had this
qualcomm event at CES which right just
veered into this almost like surreal
territory this didn't quite get there
but it was it was pretty close you see
whose it was closed in reading we were
watching from the from the stream and
it's just it was insane the amount of
like Broadway bravado I think its nine
like brought it was like these kind of
off Broadway yeah and i was there
hacking act they're definitely really
getting into it it seemed like so we
were as we were walking back jordan our
video producer said he was like they
must have just come up in casting and
been like you know we need is a Neil
Patrick Harris character so they found
like the best Neil Patrick Harris
impersonator they could find for you
know $75 and then got him and he got up
there and it was just it was the
strangest I don't know they like they
showed off the phone and it was a pretty
normal presentation right and then they
were like alright that took 20 minutes
let's put on a play I just weren't Radio
City Music Hall actually kind of panic I
thought they were ending after at 30
minutes ok they announced the phone they
got some of the key details out of the
way and they're saying thank you and
goodbye the guys walking off but no
which honestly would have been awesome
but I guess somebody who has SAT through
way too many two and a half hour long
events if they had just gone in been
like here's a phone see you later I
would have like I would have stood up
and cheered it would have been amazed
that this is a this is borderline hubris
with Samsung's part they've done they've
had so much success like with these
outlandish commercials and ad campaigns
and use on the events to I mean hubris
hubris is Samsung's thing it's it's how
they separate themselves I mean
laborious they don't care insurance they
don't care if you make a better phone
than they do they're gonna sell so many
more of them because their commercials
are better and even if they're not
better there's so many more of them that
eventually you're just going to be
beaten into submission and you're gonna
buy a samsung all right now let's
actually let's talk about that so
they're gonna sell these phones no
matter what and it's arguably they
didn't really try to do much different
this time around no so I mean it's
on the one hand I kind of forgive them
for that because why would they change
things like this phone that galaxy s3
sold like crazy and people love it and
it's become I it's the only phone i
would say i see as many of like out in
the world in new york city as i do the
iphone right and it used to be the
iphone and then you'd be like oh that's
a kindle fire or like you debate what
phone it was and now it's the galaxy s3
is on that level so i have a confession
to make i used to commute from the l
train and i would see a dude even
recently i would see him carry the
blackberry tablet old he's using it he's
not wild he's not both now ready to be
bold yet no but so i think on the one
hand samsung feels like they got it
right in a lot of ways and i think they
did get it right in a lot of ways but
they also samsung's whole thing is like
let's have things that Apple can't do or
doesn't do and if you look at their
commercials all of their marketing is
it's not about their Hardware
necessarily it's not about LTE and like
all these things are they have kind of
league average to above average stuff
and then they just pile on these
features that they're like look at this
nifty thing right that the iphone can't
do and like this phone the Galaxy s4 it
gives great demo like it's gift it gives
great demo that's the quote you're gonna
yeah it does and like they they go
through and they're like look I just did
this with my hand and it went through my
pictures and eventually you're like yeah
that's actually kind of cool i could see
how i'd use that and like I don't know
if you would or not but it this phone
like on a store shelf as the guy in the
verizon store walks you around is gonna
seem super compelling right now actually
I'm gonna talk about all this if you saw
at the hands-on demo but first we've got
the galaxy s3 here mm-hmm we've got the
Galaxy Note 2 yep so basically s4 is
just somewhere in the middle it's not
even really it's basically the same size
as the galaxy s okay they shrunk the
bezels a little bit so the the phone is
the screen is bigger but the space
around it is a little smaller so
basically just the same size it's yeah
and it's a little it's a tiny bit taller
but it's actually lighter and thinner so
it okay like to hold it like if I held
both in my hands and close my eyes it
would legitimately be difficult to tell
which is which because it's not actually
that's not a bad size no it's good to
hear and it was I was I was really
impressed like we saw some of the leaks
the phone looks enormous and they must
have had like a four-year-old holding
this phone because it looked gigantic
right but as it is it's it's really no
harder to use like all these phones are
are difficult to use in one hand but
it's really it doesn't feel as big as a
phone like the Xperia Z feels it's it's
pretty well suited for a size like this
it's also got the HTC one with me here
too which is about you know it's about
the same size how would you compare this
you'd actually review this phone as well
so I like this phone a lot and and the
on the hardware front there's just no
comparison the one is is aluminum and
put together and has this kind of fit
and finish that the galaxies for just
doesn't and Samsung doesn't care like
they've honestly they've made it
abundantly clear that they don't care
that like our hardware is good enough
and everybody has ding them for having
plasticky backs and they keep making
like they don't care right and and I
think they're bet is that most people
don't care and sales kind of seem to
bear that out like most people want a
phone with a big screen and a nice
screen that like has these cool features
and runs the apps that I want and the
this real choosing between like really
nice hardware and pretty good hardware
doesn't seem to factor in for that many
people but you're mostly just saw about
the initials are the internal seemed
pretty good and they are at any rate so
one thing Samsung is great at is is
building these like bleeding edge phones
and the s4 is very much that it has its
it either has a Samsung's processor or a
Qualcomm processor depending on where
you are and either one is really
powerful it comes with two gigs of ram
and like Samsung doesn't skimp on the
power in its phones and like we've seen
a little bit of even sort of pre
production software but was just
blistering fast and they have this
camera thing that shows the front and
back camera at the same time you can
take pictures and video and it's super
responsive works perfect also when you
do that it always puts a little stamp of
your face on it so there are a bunch of
bunch of different templates one is like
the postage stamp others make it look
like you're like on a safari there's all
these different ways you can do it too
kind of in bed it's just basically
different Frankie's around that all
right what what is the other use case
with you know scenario for this I have
no idea and this is the thing like me no
honestly the impression I get from this
event is that Samsung has this great
list of features right and you look and
you run down the list and you're like
these are all cool things I want all of
these
and some of them you may end up using
but most of them are things that you're
like huh this is nifty and then
basically forget exists and I remember a
long time ago I was meeting with
somebody from Sony and they were telling
me about the difference between buying
behavior and using behavior and their
point was that people buy phones for a
certain set of reasons and like them for
a totally different set of reasons on
and so for them I forget what it was in
our particular case but they were
talking about like people walk in and
they're like oh this has more megapixels
on the camera I'll buy that because it
has more megapixels and like that
ultimately makes no practical difference
in their life and Samsung has just
nailed that game right so they have all
these things where like the gestures you
do it you're like that seems cool and
then another phone doesn't do it you're
like oh that's a shame it doesn't do it
and like you get to a dozen of those
over the course of using these two
different phones or like well what can
the iphone do and whether or not those
actually add up to something you'll use
in real life I don't know I think some
of them are cool like I actually I kind
of get the gesture thing a little bit
like let's actually get into that little
bit cuz i am i watch the hands on
obvious i just saw this weird event i'm
still not sure how that works or how
actually effective it is so well so
there there are four different kind of
weird interaction things that Samsung's
done there's smart pause and smart
scroll I think they're called which
basically are designed to they follow
your eyes and if you're watching the
phone and if I'm watching a movie and
then I look away it's designed to pause
the movie and then when I come back
it'll play the movie again and that
seems to work but I actually think it's
sort of useless because a lot of leg out
it would be annoying if I'm like sitting
on a train and I look up and then my
movie pauses then I come back and wait a
second for it to pick up I just I don't
want that right the scrolling is
designed to basically follow your eyes
and move the page with your eyes so you
can read comfortably that sounds really
cool so it's like does it actually work
like we're looking to top of the screen
to scroll up and you're like in the
middle stay focused so I I have to kind
of give Samsung the benefited out so I
saw a model this morning that just
straight-up didn't work okay it would it
did this really funny thing where I
would look a tree down the bottom and
then I would wait no wait that's still
be looking down at the bottom and then
it would just snap to the bottom of the
page I bet that's not what I wanted uh
and then I would have to scroll that is
a better question but so would turn that
off but then dan seifert who was also at
the event with us when did it
at it and said it worked great so I'm
I'll give Samsung they benefited out
here and say they pulled it off so then
there's there's gestures which let you
do things like you can scroll a web page
just by going like this or you can
scroll through photos by swiping left to
right and stuff like that I get for you
know they said something about it during
one of their scenes at the event and
they were like oh my nails are wet or my
hands are dirty and like honestly I kind
of get that a lot of times we're like
you know people talk about how we use
our phones and tablets for cooking in
the kitchen it's like my hands are dirty
and I can just go like that like that's
pretty cool like for assignment it's a
how far away it is they're like that's
what I'm kind of curious about cuz I'm
for the hover stuff it was like yeah you
have to be good right on it like that's
yes I know but the hovering are the
gestures rather you you can be like a
foot away it's a pretty comfortable
distance like between you and where
you're holding the phone and you just
swipe over is it just using the cameras
like the camera always looking it seems
to be okay there there yeah the front
facing camera is like Samsung's favorite
thing that harness to do cool stuff and
I guess you need to make apps that
actually use this stuff or is like is
this um that is actually built on the
system level to know so it's Samsung's
not clear on a lot of that stuff which
is difficult because a lot of the cool
features that they have even going back
to some of their older devices where
they have like the split screen stuff
where you can see two apps at once which
is that's even still learning they
didn't mention it at all and I don't
think so because they want to keep the
note as kind of this productivity device
and between the note 2 and the no date
and now the note 10.1 those are kind of
the get stuff done devices and these are
more sort of normal because a father
flagship too I don't a 5-inch phone just
clearly you can't do anything done on it
it's tiny it's basically not easy to
train like you can I can't see anything
okay so it all in all though you've
played with it mozar feel is it the best
phone out there to get it for an Android
device I mean obviously we haven't
reviewed it right but it is coming out
q2 it's the phone to say don't buy
anything yet wait for us I do you feel
like that's the safe thing to do well so
on the one hand I think we actually have
a really interesting competition for the
first time in pretty long time because
it looks like the HTC one is going to
come out on all these different carriers
so Samsung's biggest advantage was that
they got to this point where people just
walked into a store and we're like I
want a galaxy phone and that was just
what there was to buy because every
carrier had it you knew was going on
and it was implicit like the de facto
android phone and HTC can kind of get
into that if because they're on all
these carriers and HTC if they can
market the device right and get some
real momentum they could do it but I
think we're also at this kind of
exciting place where all of these phones
are good like the Xperia Z for all its
weaknesses is a good powerful fast phone
that you can also like throw in the
toilet it's fine on that's a story the
one has great hardware but has some
issues with the camera Samsung has
typically done a much better job with
the camera and they're really focused on
it again this time which if they pull it
off could be a huge differentiator it's
like the Lumia 920 and really the iphone
5 are the only two cameras in my mind
that are great as smartphone cameras and
if the galaxy s4 can get in there that's
a big win for them on because they
become kind of the one android phone
with a great camera right and pull that
off and just for the shameless plug we
did just do like the best smartphone
cameras okay no and Michael Shane agreed
with me and Michael Shane agree with you
yeah one of our best photographers on
staff it was Lumia 920 or the iphone we
done top shelf which you can see every
Thursday's right I know but I think to
the galaxy s4 is probably going to
remain the de facto android phone and
it's because Samsung has done a lot of
really good things they've done a lot of
things right and they've done some
really smart you I things that make the
phone easier to use and more
understandable in a way that HTC hasn't
and Sony hasn't and I think you're going
to see this on shelves everywhere
they're going to market it like crazy
and I think people are gonna start
buying this and I'm gonna end up seeing
it basically on the subway just like the
galaxy s3 and then I'm gonna look in
Vegas at the galaxy s3 there's out the
s4 and no one will know that's where
we'll be all right then great great um
well I think Jesus Blitzen I literally I
keep looking at that thinking it's the
galaxy s4 know how do we get one and
then it's it's it's not it's the s3 I
did like this form factor though that's
the thing is like but we we have this
great advantage of like we get to see
all these phones side by side and be
like this is pretty but then people are
gonna pick that up because that's going
to be the first phone that the guy at
the verizon store recommends to you
because everybody else bought it and
you're gonna be like oh this feels nice
and works well and I'll robot right
actually I wanna say random tangent cuz
I was going through is looking for all
these phone
all the different variations of samsung
galaxy s2 which back then you forgot you
forget I forgot at least they were just
different by the carrier yeah there were
like a hundred and forty million
different yep galaxy has two phones and
then I was like the blaze which was also
a galaxy s2 and then there was like a
galaxy s 2 3 and then like the 4g it was
i was well playing on snapchat point
that reminds me i actually wanted to
talk about vlad tutorial i just went up
the galaxy s3s think it's fair I mean
it's yeah i really do i think it's it's
the it's the tick-tock strategy that
apple has really pioneered and pulled
off and they made it work where people
are on to your upgrade cycles right and
it's just it's just kind of in a way
dumb at this point to continue to
reinvent the wheel every year like we're
going to run out of things to do and
we're gonna you're going to lose your
customers every time you're going to
make people feel like they have this
incredibly outdated phone but they can't
like their contracts not up and they've
so Samsung has adopted the same strategy
and I think that is what this phone is
it's it's faster it has a bigger screen
it has you know some new tricks and
software but fundamentally it's it's the
same ID it's the same idea the same
features like it's it's gonna feel like
the same phone so if i have a galaxy s3
I don't have particular you know upgrade
envy right now but if I the galaxy s2
suddenly it's a no brainer no I do want
I do want to talk about it so it seems
like Apple and Samsung are the only ones
right now we can do this kind of what
they call it tick tock formula sure take
being before talk mean for us why not
HTC whistle trying to find its first it
gets tick is if this is a hit well we
see the 1s like in the year from now or
two like that I'm not the one s whole
dad no I mean I think what what Samsung
did which is what Apple did is really
corner this market I mean we've we've
heard Google say they're worried about
how much Samsung has cornered the
android market and like it's impossible
to underestimate or two over us my
brother how significant Samsung's brand
is in that world and it used to be years
ago that people would walk into a store
and they'd either buy an iphone or a
droid right so motorola had the droid
and they dominated that for a long time
and it's now it's a galaxy instead of a
droid people buy those phones now and it
gives samsung this leeway to say
like there's a good chance you already
own a samsung phone right whether it was
a galaxy s2 which they flooded the
market with a million things two years
ago or a three from a few months ago the
force coming on now it's like Samsung
has this giant market share and they can
they can make a case for all the
different features it feels like they're
coming out with stuff over every every
other manufacturer especially the iphone
so they're gonna try and woo you away
like one device at a time right alright
well David thank you so much my pleasure
when are we getting one I I stole 400 of
them so their exact time actually wanted
now in the state of New York no no I'm
so hopefully I'll get through say thank
you to write so very premium price it's
gonna start being out it's going to be
out in April first around the world but
they haven't made any specific us
announcements it'll be on all four
carriers plus some of the regional
carriers right and it'll be yeah they
called it a premium samsung price so
it'll be what you know one hundred
ninety nine dollars unlocked they're not
doing a 300-foot anymore they might I'd
be I'd be shocked but yeah and it's it's
gonna be this spring and basically don't
buy a galaxy s3 until then alright David
thank you so much my pleasure oh we're
gonna cut to really quickly we've got
some highlights from the event oh dear
so summary stay tuned enjoy that and
we'll be back in the hotel ladies and
gentlemen the samsung galaxy s4
I'm sorry honey I'll get the galaxy s4
after the presentation yeah on the other
hand Patrick does have an s4 so he can
take amazing shots of his son Jeremy as
he gets ready for his first tap dance
recital you're up next honey who am i
nervous oh you're gonna do just fine I
want to get some backstage footage now
if you're like me you have 800 pictures
of your mom and like two of your dad
because dad always took the pictures our
family videos look like a movie about a
single mother well all that's about to
change
what if I'm watching a movie then switch
to playing a game no problem and what if
I'm reading an email and then play a
game and then watch a video adapt
display adjust what if the video is
about a five legged cat doesn't matter
what it's about I have another album of
onna in the market I have another album
Ivana at the falls I'm sensing a theme
yeah dude they're all pictures of Brazil
okay Oh being able to see all of his
photos as soon as he takes them makes it
easier having Jeff away being able to
use my car makes it easier for him to be
away but I love these pictures of Brazil
where do you see Brazil behind honor ah
but what about the life of a New York
actor may I have my car please
now I don't know where I'm going I'm
totally lost that's okay with the new
galaxy s4 you don't need a navigation
system it's all installed right there on
the device you're killing me I found it
here
are you ready for the next Galaxy well
here it is what are you doing now
whatever you say you just experienced I
can't watch I was there ok a lot to me
most saw the strangest happens in the
person and it changed me I have to say
my name less better let me tell you
something important about this event it
was actually really good what it was
really good you mean you mean the first
30 minutes is really good and then know
the whole thing if else the whole thing
was great and this is why so this phone
is like a laundry list of features this
like endless parade of stuff and all of
its really esoteric and weird like
ultimately all every single feature in
this phone is esoteric and weird right
it's its camera they can take 100 photos
and 4 seconds that doesn't mean anything
to people but saying we're gonna do a
skit with like actors to show it off is
successful like it's modest it's not
what we want to see because it's super
cheesy and lame but for the thousands of
people in my theater it was entertaining
and demonstrated the features of product
let me run down literally run down a
list of the weirdest stuff that you and
I have done together yeah since we
started working years ago we've seen
zool soul Samsung's crazy little you
little guy with years we've seen three
Howard Stringer keynotes at least which
is cirque de soleil which is Elvis
professor there's a difference with that
stuff so all that stuff that's just
showmanship right so dancing zol has no
connection to the product always a in
the product is the product right i mean
that's samsung invites you to their CES
keynote and like the kid from billy
elliot dances and he's the future right
I figure it really was it was a kid you
know yet that cat that was not what they
did today right now they grew up a
little bit today okay they talked about
the phone the whole time so this is
there was no abstract like BS about like
digital humanism there was no inspired
by nature there a blooping sounds it was
here are the features that are found and
here's the way that we have chosen to
demonstrate so there's like this is
total like though this be madness there
is method in it there's no b-roll
there's no born
mobile this is just use our condone
right exactly and then so then the way
they chose guess that's why so it's a
headset I'd like to note that it was a
gigantic improvement for samsung all
right fine it was entertaining like
entertaining in maybe all the wrong ways
but very very entertaining then the but
the thing is okay fine we've crossed the
barrier now we're talking about the
product we're using the products
features the skits and the things they
did to showcase the product was so silly
and so like out of touch with reality
like at the beginning there like they
showed a family and the right the kid
was like I have a play Oh dad your phone
isn't good enough to take a photo of my
play now and I thought what kind of like
ranked consumerism are you like you're
like oh you should get a new phone cuz
otherwise your kid's life will I kind of
wonder if that is what kids are like now
I don't know maybe I don't talk to kids
I regular basis or really ever yeah but
D maybe like that they may be like look
cut the iphone 5s passe I think yeah
probably that's probably what kids they
are like and all of you should be
ashamed of yourselves let's gonna leave
it like that it's like still frame no
he's shamed of yourself no I mean it was
just silly was way over the top why was
your an orchestra they leave at the
beginning mate they Orchestra came up
out of the bottle and then it then it
went away and then at the end right
Ellen thank you to our Orchestra the
orchestra came back it leaves why are
you paying for an orchestra least there
was no celebrity like cameos there was
no new creative dress here's there are
two plot holes ok that's a plot major
major annuity hate your plot oh ok uh ok
so there's will chase who's an MC don't
know who he is a good actor very
sarcastic there's Ryan Biden oh we know
if he I love Ryan Ryan's great his buddy
monetise to be blackberry well rim then
black whatever it's called now yeah rim
berry now is the samsung he's great
today were doing their little shake and
all these other actors come out and at
one point a woman named Vivian appeared
and everyone talked about Vivian like
they knew her this is like the black
level men black gloves and she was like
just there to like say mean things to
will chase whoever he was she was your
Broadway vamp stare
yeah she's on like Fran Drescher then
she like play to the phone and then she
left and I was like who's Vivian what
why was she so important for two minutes
and where does she now you didn't like
lost did you then she came back and her
name is Sheila very meta very strange
she even acknowledged it like hey Vivian
and she's like no no I'm Sheila now very
odd then and I think this is the most
important and the most to me personally
troubling okay at one point they
demonstrated s voice driving or whatever
it's called this voice drive in to
hammer home the fact that this was meant
to be used in a car they brought out of
sideways Mini Cooper which is that oh I
remember then we have a shot we have a
shot of the sideways Mini Cooper mmm but
they bring it out and bring out what
that remained on stage for the rest of
the presentation and no one attempted to
get in it or drive it sideways it didn't
do a loop-de-loop all right it just was
sideways like that with Samsung's
contribution no they're mini coopers
contributions absent presently except
like do not use samsung's driving
because you'll end up sideways and edit
our it was very troubling that's very
weird very very weird you're just using
hand gestures he just hit the wheel but
at least with this almost like
over-the-top like it worked like it I
don't know how else to explain this for
the first time it was shocking and weird
they had a hunky guy come on stage and
take a shirt off that gaggle of women
tittered and as they looked away from
their phones to look at the hunky guy
the video paused like all this like
crazy stuff at one point they're like
but why would you ever want to use this
feature where you can like just wave at
your phone instead of touching it
because what why and and they had one of
the women go because my nails are wet
which is like don't do that and then
another one was like because I didn't
want to put down the drink and like
drunkenly staggered around stage right
just crate crazy but effective but
relatable use case scenarios relatable
crazy all right samsung i'll skip the
kids a kleiner so here's the real
tagline of the phone are you ready for
this I'm ready Samsung this is true i'm
not i'm not kidding all right i'll
mention why vlog several times samsung
galaxy s4 life companion life can add it
on on slides like huge letters life
companion no irony know like it's
they oh that's right cuz they had a
little kid of the box going Oh a light
companion or so like that no that'd be
weird that would be very weird but I
swear good Samsung's newest product yeah
try held follow you around child no I
just don't know I honestly I don't think
I'm so overwhelmed he time the talking
too fast on higher pitched and it's just
because the emotions that I felt during
this event for you always wanted this
the emotions that I felt during this
event event were so varied I felt sad I
felt a great deal of embarrassment uh I
felt joy at one point a man named Jeff
just talks about taking pictures of a
girl he met in Brazil Madonna mm-hmm he
talks about that for I would say five to
six minutes right he took a lot of
photos there's actually two things uh
from the from the thing I kinda want to
talk to you about first off is s
translate speaking of weird gags yeah
well so here's the nest translate it's
already in android right google
translate has these features but it's a
google translate that you have to be
connected I was a nest religious has
hand it has canned stuff in it ok so
does all that stuff in the back end but
if you're like in France and you're like
take P to a bathroom like you push a
button the phone will say it in French
ok so just it's all building some
offline caption that's actually really
smart I will give him the credit flip
it's just like it just sounds built like
how much it's doing ok maybe it is going
the internet well then it's the exact
same thing right but it seemed to
suggest it was gonna be an offline of
some sort no sue the offline is like it
has this database afraid it's the stocks
yeah yeah and you can rely push the
button and like it'll help it where is
the nearest apple store yeah yes it
won't do that probably probably not do
that uh that stuff is interesting I mean
I will say that the number of this was
actually feedback I got a lot on Twitter
which was a lot of this stuff is an
Android already right it's all over the
place Android like these aren't features
of Samsung needs to promote in this way
it will rebuild in some other way this
is a very head-on competitive with what
Google's but if you do any small tweaks
they can put an s in front of it and
that's there's squeaks squeaks but I
mean look at like this like in actually
the one thing that this has in common
unfortunately with Samsung is crazy new
video formats because they're now must
exist something between us still in the
video audio it's a Zoe it's a
was it a camera photo yeah or some sense
camera stuff yeah there is very little
like over cheering at the event right
the camera demos got all the cheering so
when they took out the guy photobombing
cuz they take 100 photos right in four
minutes 44 seconds when they did the
drama shot so we could call drama shot
just forgive me for is it is it was it
just burst mode or something like what
is yes they do with this crazy burst
mode and then they can composite so if I
you're running across the room and I'd
like burst mode photo you it like
composite four of you like running so
that's cool stuff but it's it's weird
because it's like what you're saying
it's like the idea of like just taking a
photo is gone it is dead to the
smartphone industry and now we're going
to do other weirder with photos
mm-hm and I'm this would drop the f-bomb
on the air espa haha what he really said
was s hit this s hit yeah exactly uh duh
you know here's the thing so here's the
one right and actually can give me the
gs3 sure cuz just take them all in at
all in all reality the gs4 looks just
like this phone right it's a little I
went on to the dead too it's like point
0 to wider or something so very very
small slight visual differences the
sides are squared off more it feels it
feels only slightly different to hold
their hand but I will tell you that this
phone this piece of hardware is so much
nicer to have in your hand because it's
made of metal it has it just HTC one's a
really nice phone this phone still feels
like the piece of plastic right and the
gs4 still feels like a piece of plastic
and what's interesting to me and invite
put up a piece today like noting this is
that Samsung has this enormous marketing
budget they spent all of this money to
put on this event it's something like
400 million dollars to launch this phone
rights I heard that number from lots of
people so much money anyway they have so
much money they're spending money like
crazy the orchestra literally a date
ball and orchestra and then hid it under
the stage like and they would raise and
lower at every night again to remind you
that they had spent money on orchestra
and the orchestra would go right like
that's ridiculous um and I think what
they're doing is they're they have so
many features or adding so many features
in this event was all about features
right here's how this phone will slice
up some piece of your life that may or
may not be recognized to anybody who has
a normal life and will show you how
phone feature will like solve this
problem that may or may not exist we're
of HTC is like we made a little bit
better camera and it has footboard but
is a much better design i'll give him
that but the hardware's better i think
ultimately it might be a better phone
like I haven't played with the gs4 from
or terrace we're actually we're gearing
up toward the end but there is something
I want to ask about before is a quick
tangent the IR blaster and watch on they
mentioned I don't feel like we talked a
lot about it on stage but they did make
a point of it early on well so there's
like a weird trend in phones right and
it's that your cell phone will be the
remote control for your television H the
one has 12 the IR blasters built into
the power button to does to the notes
you guys won I don't know that the gs4
has an IR blaster built in the top as
well right my pee in the power button as
well and I have these apps right that
like they learned they you type in your
zip code it tells you what's on your
cable provider and it changed the
channel for you and that's great but
it's so like super useless it's I mean
in our boxers look literally like a
sixth sent part like right you can get
140 money they can put in a phone for
zero money and cool you can call peel in
the give you a version or app to run on
your phone and that's neat but it's not
useful I don't think people are actually
use these phones is remote and that's
what's weird to me because like there
seems to be a lot of least a lot of time
and money going to making the software
try to simplify this very complicated
system of cable operators with different
channels and try no that's all does that
ties that's all done that's not hard you
can call TV Guide and i'll sell you the
data right you can call peel they'll
give you the data but they already have
the app what's hard is and this is the
problem samsung should be solving is
they make tvs to write their phones
don't actually talk to their tvs sony's
phones don't actually talk to their TVs
Sony's Xperia Z tablet as an IR blaster
and it runs the peel app right ah these
things aren't actually talking to
televisions they are doing the same dumb
thing that every universal remote has
ever tried to do and that's why people
don't love the universal remotes they're
doing the same dumb thing that every
I phone accessory if an IR blasters ever
tried to do and that's why those never
took off and it's a little bit more
interesting because they've the phones
are really small and thin and they've
integrated the piece right into here but
ultimately it's having IR blasters I'm
going to fix your experience and it
never has it was ok so what is going to
I mean there is that kind of dream of
not having remote walking to a room and
going ok this is mighty remote no or
sunset a dream i would like to like not
have remote you know what i use now the
wii u gamepad I mean but you're a huge
nerd yeah like I can find that we're
like it is good because its enormous
like you're a loser it's kind of a
cop-out look that's great I think that
you can argue about the future of
television rights all you want I think I
don't think design or interface or
technology as a problem I think
literally talking to a television or
cable box as a problem ok and the only
way to do it right now is an IR blaster
and as long as that it's true this like
dum dum technology from the 60s it's
like still in our living rooms none of
these things are gonna solve the problem
fair enough but you know I can commence
what I our last Friday night maybe
that's just one of many features
obviously samsung s4 has the air
scrolling the itraq in case your nails
are wet yeah of course look at a hunky
guy but it's still excite the hard was
the same it's still the same looking
TouchWiz and Samsung is not apple before
for lookin like the exact same like OS
so one point and again right I'm very
fond of Ronnie bud okay at one point he
was like it's so much more alive than
ever before and then he demonstrated
that they've changed the trends the menu
bars no longer black it's translucent
right uh I mean it's just the TouchWiz
is like a silly thing it is a silly dumb
gimmicky ridden thing right you can you
can definitely knock apple is the iOS
home screen is boring and the weather
it's always 73 degrees and sunny but
there must exist some happy state right
between iOS being boring and and this
being a circus and they are just going
full circus which is very I guarantee
you it very full circuits the bloops are
louder than ever and they probably swear
you if you don't if you try to turn it
off me yeah maybe that happy thing is
called stock Android just just an idea
that I have a speaking of either
speaking of that so we've now seen the
s4 which is not now you
it yeah they see one Xperia Z which are
out LG's got a number of flagships every
now and then they'll just pop something
else out they did one optimus g pro pro
yeah over the for advertisement Times
Square right now yeah so everyone's
gotten their flagship Android devices
obviously apples probably do something
next few months oh yeah the 5 5 s plus
mm-hmm are we carrying off like is s for
the phone to get for Android or should
we start looking to the next Google
whatever yeah it's weird because they
sell so many more iphones than an s4 is
just tons more but if you are in New
York and ride the subway you see s3's
everywhere right I think if you have an
s3 there's no reason to get an s4 I
think if you have a previous flag
flagship Android device probably won't
want one I think if you're among the
millions of people of a galaxy s2 that's
probably the place to go um if you have
a iphone I don't know the answer I don't
I mean it there did their wildly
different experience what are you using
right now what is your driver I have a
nexus 4 and iPhone okay what do you see
more i use the iphone Marcus as LTE mmm
right i mean that's the reality of it I
with the nexus 4 I tell to you things
will change very dramatic but the s4 has
four point two point two with TouchWiz
though but it has LT or will have LTE
yeah but it's it's I TouchWiz is not an
attractive thing and I believe you know
they're saying that's for point-to-point
to Google i/o is like right around the
corner we don't know what's gonna happen
so they're gonna fall behind again and
TouchWiz is I it is becoming a different
operating it's funny that you say
they're going to fall behind because the
only phone is gonna have whatever next
Google Android operating system is there
is going to be the Google device of
nightmares are real there's a real
divide between Google's Android and
samsung's android you know because
Google doesn't have ear view or smart
pause or any this stuff right and i
think it's it's unfair to samsung's
efforts actually it's unfair to their
efforts to say that these features are
tacked onto android now these features
are integrated with the phone so if you
buy the s4 you're going to get these
features as part of your core experience
and they're not in android but there's
just a huge gulf between the two
companies now I think you know aunty
ribbon he just left Google but well
weeks ago he was laughing Android he
left Android she's still somewhere he's
in a basement he's rattling original
moon shots um that's what he said he
said he Larry Page was like we want more
moonshots you're out Andy and go to
Google acts and do it every day anyway
look II was at nwc or whatever and he
said to the wall street journal Samsung
is a real threat to Android right and i
think that was like a rare admission of
like the truth which is google's
platform is no longer being driven by
google and i think if you buy an HTC One
what you're getting is some of it yet
another version of Android that isn't as
competitive that doesn't have the
resources invested it doesn't have the
user base of samsung's version of
Android and doesn't have google driving
forward its version of Android I think
that is probably not a realization for
like the ordinary consumer I think
that's a realization if you're like
deeply in EdTech I 11 more wild horse
question that we have to wrap up the
dark horse in all this what's going on
motorola that's that's I don't know they
certainly can't look even if you're even
if you got google money you don't have
google money to get samsung weird s
weird it's weird sweet because this at
this event in this launch and this
marketing they are spending money like
that event was uh it was over the top
like crazy and super weird esque weird
and very few companies can just get s
weird and nothing nothing's going to top
that nine times then I look maybe
motorola maybe google motorola will
combine to produce some crazy chrome OS
android hybrid phone flexible display
can like drive your car for you that has
stock android no t-that's and you can
wait on your head that yeah there's a
lot of stuff that can do to compete with
the s4 I don't think the s4 is a
pinnacle phone right I think it has it
what it's a pentile display but appears
to look very nice I think your cells
that are about pentile i don't i don't
like them they look too green to me um
but whatever it's it's going to be the
indie android phone that other people
have and that is something to be
reckoned with and from motorola or to do
able to get there they have to market
the hell out of have to they're gonna
have to spend money trying to sell the
phone and google historically it's not
good
fair enough all right let's close the
show Neil I thank you so much actually
