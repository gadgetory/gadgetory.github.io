knowledge on you well let me get
comfortable please get color you want to
read song like yesterday about to see a
response is gone ya know this podcast
has gone on too long no no no no no
there's a gay coffee black josh is
literally destroying the set behind me
there what is this what is happening
here this whole wow it's all central on
it like a very no we don't know how this
is mountain guys are gonna break
something really bad what what more can
we break you are gonna read song lyrics
so ghetto better do it there's a
Christian do it Christian I was gonna
get Christian here it's all been a
Christian ska band yeah well i'm not i
do you want to watch our duty let's go
all right the socket no I won't listen
the sagas called ahead booked for the
sellout you found a way to draw a line
don't stop it you gotta listen to cuz
the lyrics are really good there's no
way they're really good there's no way
you're like sorry glasses let's not get
his Christian music but put your kind of
us a Christian ska band that's like
crossing the street you just you just
give it a but give it a shot look is it
better or worse than any real big fish
lyrics oh I think they're here is fat
you found a way you found a way to draw
a line between the world in you please
faking your identity it's true did you
think the world the word alternative was
only meant for the likes of you do you
think that there to school now being
popular is lame you're the one who made
them popular all their songs are still
the same you found them first it made
you stand on we heart you know gonna
read the Hong everyone jumped on the
same bandwagon making you an average Joe
a limbing for the mediocre you were just
a plain old Joker status quo blame it on
the band now if you prick them do they
bleed there's a lot more what's the
point explain what they want if you
won't
them succeed what do you remember where
we all came from do you remember what
it's all about stucco when you made a
point to be objective before you started
right I'd play handbook for the sellout
oh god there's one word no saga the
whole song ruu sochta for worrying you
use a South Carolina's going on we saw
networks you sunk your Worth and being
different I where's the party sometime
where are you traded in objective less
for the underground if you recall a live
thing can I just say something I have a
lot of questions I want to say I'm
disappointed by the lack of a Christian
message in that song yeah no Christian
message I feelings are like 5050 just
really they had a song about like a comb
yeah but it's scott you could do
whatever you wanted yeah but remember
but all of it is sucky like you could do
whatever you want but it's all in the
cone of suckiness it's all in the sphere
of suckiness it's like in this in the
box where you keep this does horrible
stuff that you had I didn't why I was
nice I was the frayed rude boy not
anywhere in those learn that was the
dancer just says that on stage wasn't
like I just want to apologize for what
happened here all right pick it up I
didn't hear that bishop and on that I'm
just saying I went to a lot of people
this this just happens in music all the
time and now we have this phenomenon it
and apps where I like the app before it
was cool like that is really happened
now are you gonna recruit Scott's I just
got but that's just like it's already
been written but that just before my
point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
