months ago that you said there were two
different types of design really that
you saw everywhere in mobile design
which is incorrect me if I get this
wrong you said one looked like bathroom
signage at an airport and which I think
you're talking about Windows Phone is
that what you're right because it's very
stark and iconic you're not you don't
want to say it okay and then the other
style was go on your to the other then
you said the other type of stuff that
you're seeing is kind of like this photo
realism the stitched leather what you're
talking about Apple right that's not
photorealistic it's sorry enough okay
yeah it's like this Trump loi but but
not not fully Trump Lloyd like
illustrations right you actually said it
was easy was cartoonish a little
bit just what bad that bothers you it
does you hate cartoons no I love
cartoons but but I think if you saw that
attitude put on a website or magazine
you would laugh at it it would look
childish right so explain to me the
philosophy behind ice cream sandwich I
want to talk about the Galaxy Nexus a
little bit but what is so how are you
different with I so Sam so I think the
the the the instincts towards a kind of
a more modern more pure design that you
see out there is terrific but what we
wanted to do a fights cream sandwich is
have a space where you could do that but
also you could have a whole number of
different spaces because when you go out
on the web you know you go to the verge
you go to New York Times you go all over
the place and there are just examples of
beautiful designs beautiful websites
thank you and they don't all look the
same is that there are no not when you
go to the versions yeah it's a beautiful
website but but there are out there
right now in contrast websites have a
similar they have a kind of a basic
language of how they function as they
don't all look the same and that's what
you are doing with ice cream sandwich
well we're trying to be a little bit
more cohesive because it is an operating
system right so we want to have a little
bit more of an identity but we don't
want to have a straitjacket identity and
we want it but we do want to have an
identity that is modern that is graphic
that's type of graphic and that's why I
use the words magazine you I to talk
about the way that when you read a
physical print magazine you know all the
articles look like
they belong in the same magazine but no
two are laid out exactly alike you're
speaking my language</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
