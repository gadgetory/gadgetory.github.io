We go there everyday not just to see what are friends are doing but to see what the world is doing.
The company has been working hard to become your only destination on the internet.
That's happened in part thanks to Facebook's trending section where you see news articles and updates based on an algorithm.
The company says this is based on a variety of factors, including pages you've liked, your location and what's trending across Facebook.
But the way the social network decides what's trending on Facebook is based on a collection of data gathered by its millions of users.
That means that whenever you like, comment, click or even scroll across a news article, you're boosting its popularity on Facebook.
And that's why Kim Kardashian's $300 flip-flops became the most important thing in your life that week.
Why? Because why some users really did care, the vast majority were clicking through out of curiosity, thinking the same thing you're thinking now... &amp;quot;Who gives a shit?&amp;quot;
So however you feel about Kim Kardashian and her Givenchy sandals, by using Facebook you were making her more famous.</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
