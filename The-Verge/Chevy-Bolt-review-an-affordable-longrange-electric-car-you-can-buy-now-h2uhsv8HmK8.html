fully electric cars available on one
hand there's the Nissan's the BMW's and
of course the tehsils but this is the
Chevy Volt it's a first fully electric
car that can realistically bridge the
gap between practical range and
affordable price it's the same promise
Tesla's making with the long-delayed in
much-hyped model 3 the car that supposed
to bring Tesla's design and style down
to a much more affordable price but the
bolt is here now and you can buy it
today driving him to the head is not fun
I don't know why anybody lives here
would own a car so my first concern when
getting in this electric car and having
it for a week is where I'm going to
recharge this battery because it's not
like you can just go to any gas station
and fill up the tank and be on your way
so the Chevy people when I picked up the
car told me to download this app it's
called plug share it's like a social
network for electric vehicle owners and
it's got listings for all of the
electric charging stations nearby now
I'm down here in Manhattan where I got
the car and they're everywhere you see
these green dots all over the map and so
there's a lot of electric stations
probably more there than there are gas
stations it might not all work but
there's so many of them that it doesn't
really matter the thing is that's
probably not the case where you live
it's certainly not the case where I live
and drive the most so the bolt has a lot
of responsibilities on it's pretty small
shoulders it's supposed to be the
day-to-day electric car that can work
for anybody it's also pretty inexpensive
at under $40,000 and when you factor in
the tax incentives on top of that it's
even more appealing but it's still early
days for electric vehicles and not
everything is ready for a world of
electric cars I've been driving the bolt
around the suburban areas of New York
State for the past week and while I do
really like it there are definitely some
things you need to consider if you're
thinking about going fully electric for
your next car so the app I was using
earlier brought me here and I'm plugged
into this charger and unfortunately it
doesn't work because this Golden Corral
shut down like three weeks ago and
nobody's updated the listing in the App
and I guess it's just one of the things
you have to deal with as an early
adopter of electric vehicles let's start
with what it's like to drive the bulb
surprisingly or not it's not hugely
different from driving a standard car
with an internal combustion engine so
the electric engine in this you probably
think it's kind of wimpy but actually is
a lot of power and when you hit the
pedal it'll it'll go like right now and
I'm not gonna drag race this thing I'm
not gonna win any races on the streets
with it but when I need to get on an
on-ramp on the highway I've got plenty
of power on top it's called a small
crossover which means that it sits a
little higher on the road than the
average sedan and offers more Headroom
for taller people but it's still a
pretty compact car it's definitely
shorter and squatter looking than your
typical sedan or small SUV and it
doesn't look anything like a model 3
which is low slung and sporty instead it
kind of looks like a $16,000 Honda Fit
now inside the bolt is more roomy than
you might expect because Chevy was able
to maximize space savings due to the
lack of the engine and drivetrain the
wheels are pushed to the far corners of
the car
so interior legroom is plentiful and the
rear seat actually is a flat floor but
again this is not a big car at all and I
was easily able to fill up the back seat
with car seats for my two kids also the
trunk space is pretty cramped small
single folding stroller pretty much eats
all of it up leaving me little room for
groceries or other stuff the interior
design of the bolt is also mixed it has
a slightly futuristic decor that will
probably look super dated in just a
couple of years but it is ergonomic and
comfortable now this is an ax luxury car
by any stretch but does have leather
seating options heated seats and
automatic climate control the main
screen is where you can see things like
how much range is left what's been using
the cars battery and program charging
times its resistive which is a little
bit of a bummer but it's responsive
enough if you hit it hard enough so
Chevy says the maximum range you're
going to get between charges about two
hundred and forty miles but that varies
a lot depending on how you drive how
much climate control you use the terrain
you're driving on and you know the
temperature outside now in my time with
it it's been closer to about 200 miles
per charge at least based on the meter
inside the car and certain things you do
can
instantly change the power so if I turn
off the climate control here it
instantly gives me another 10 miles of
range but if I turn it back on because
it's hot outside I've just stopped knock
10 miles off my range right there there
are three different ways to chargeable
giant 60 kilowatt hour battery that's
about four thousand times bigger than
your phone's battery there's level one
which is your standard 120 volt outlet
it will take about 50 hours to fully
charge a depleted bolt this way then
there's level 2 which is what most
electric car charging stations are these
run at 240 volts and can fully charge
the bolt in about nine hours and then
there's level three which is a new fast
charging option that's available in just
a handful of areas Chevy says you can
get 90 miles of range in as little as 30
minutes of charging with this now if
you're going to buy a bolt and you live
in the suburbs like I do or anywhere
outside of a major metro area you really
need to invest in a level 2 charger for
your garage it'll run you about $1,000
to get one installed but it lets you get
a full charge overnight and eliminates
many of the range anxiety concerns now
I've been stuck with a super slow level
one charging in my garage so taking a
lot of time to get even a little bit of
charge which is made this week with the
bolt a little bit more stressful than
normal
uh well you don't want to become a slave
to the gauge so you wanna you don't you
don't want it to the range to be
constantly dictating how you're driving
and what you're using this plus is just
coming off so the thing is like if
you're driving around and your windows
are fogging up and you're afraid to turn
the defroster on because it's going to
shorten your range like that's stupid
turn the froster on and clear your
windows up like come on
that's ridiculous would I buy this car
probably not because the infrastructure
where I live and where I Drive just
isn't built out yet now though seeing
same issues that any other electric car
has even a Tesla electric vehicles are
still bata experiences but at the end of
the day when you beta test a Tesla you
still own a Tesla and when you beta test
a bolt you're driving a Chevy I think I
know which one I'd rather have yeah I
think that closed I think it closed no
no I think it opened and then it closed
yeah I have no idea it was in the
newspaper a couple weeks ago it's kind
of weird</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
