this is the Samsung Galaxy s4 it's the
latest in a series of insanely popular
smart phones from Samsung from the note
to the note 2 to the Galaxy s3 this
borrows from all of those devices plus
adds a lot of features and new
technology let's start with what hasn't
changed and that's most of the look and
feel of the galaxy s4 it's almost
exactly the same size as the GS 3 and
it's actually slightly thinner which is
a pretty impressive feat given that it
has a bigger screen it feels a lot
denser than the GS 3 though and the
edges have been flattened slightly so
it's much more comfortable to hold but
here's the problem
the GS 4 just flat out does not feel
like a premium device it's still made of
slimy slippery white plastic with silver
edges and just feels gross to hold the
device itself is nicely ergonomic and
it's relatively comfortable to hold but
I found myself constantly wiping my
hands off thinking they were sweaty the
plastic gets dirty and picks up
fingerprints like crazy but the biggest
problem is that it just makes the GS for
look and feel far less high-end than a
device like the HTC One or the iPhone 5
samsung success has proven that people
will overlook that but it's really a
shame Samsung didn't do better here it's
mostly a shame because the rest of the
GS 4 is actually kind of great it starts
with the screen a 5-inch 1080p display
that is absolutely gorgeous it's a Super
AMOLED display which means it has
slightly exaggerated colors and is a
little over contrasted but it's so dense
and so bright that it just looks
fantastic the camera too is a big step
up this is the best camera I've ever
used on an Android phone
period it's 13 megapixels sharp and
accurate with great reproduction and
just great photos but where the camera
really gets wild is in its software
features there are just so many things
you can do with the GS force camera you
can take a picture and attach sound to
it with shot and sound mode you can
erase photo bombers with the eraser mode
you can take big beautiful panoramas or
even create animated gifts within the
camera app itself there's also a dual
view mode that lets you shoot a picture
with the front and back camera at the
same time and superimpose them on each
other
it's pictures aren't quite as good as a
dedicated camera but they're often close
and the feature set is just ridiculous
actually the feature set of the GS 4 as
a whole is kind of ridiculous
from a pure things it can do perspective
no phone on the planet is close to this
one and most of them are cool but you
won't use them much there is of course
NFC and Bluetooth and screen mirroring
either wirelessly to a Samsung TV or via
HDMI
but there's plenty of new stuff to air
gestures lets you wave your hand over
the phone to scroll through pictures or
down a webpage which is neat
but the real use I found for it was
waving my hand over the phone to answer
it and automatically go into
speakerphone which is really handy for
when you can't pick the phone up
yourself air view is the same feature
we've seen on note devices before which
lets you hover over a calendar date or
email to see a preview without clicking
into it but it now it works with your
finger some of the other features you'll
use even less and actually turned off a
few of them they're a bunch of eye
tracking features but most of them don't
work all that well smart pause pauses a
video when you look away from the screen
but it's hit or miss too and I don't
always want it to pause when I glance
away from the screen anyway smart stay
figures out when you're looking at the
screen and keeps it on whether you're
reading or watching a movie but you're
probably better off just setting a
slightly longer screen time out in
settings you also get the multi window
feature from no devices which is pretty
handy for reading an email and looking
up an address or texting and watching a
video at the same time even if you want
all these features it's a lot to learn
and figure out Samsung startup wizard
takes a while when you first turn on the
phone and it's totally necessary the
company's aware of how long it takes
though so it offers an easy mode that
basically strips everything away but big
icons in a few favorite contacts it's
for your mom or your grandma to use even
with everything going the gs4 runs
perfectly this is a ridiculously
powerful phone and it shows it plays
heavy games well and even basic things
like swiping between home screens or
launching apps is smoother than most
phones I've tried it does stumble
occasionally in weird places like the
gallery which makes me think Samsung
hasn't quite figured out its software
but the vast majority of the time this
phone runs Android as fast as I've ever
seen
I used a t-mobile version of the G s4
and though there is LTE on t-mobile I
wasn't able to test it since I don't
live in one of the small number of
t-mobile's LTE markets still data
performance is fast call quality is
solid and reception is exactly what you
expect
unfortunately bloatware is also exactly
what I'd expect you get a handful of to
mobile apps and when you add it to all
the extra Samsung software there's just
a lot going on on this phone
the worst offender is look out it's a
security app that insists on scanning
every single app you download to make
sure it's safe and give you a bunch of
popups letting you know whether it is or
not and of course they were all safe
because they all came from the Play
Store the GS 4 also has an IR blaster
and it's watch on applets you use it to
control your TV and cable box plus
search Netflix and other apps to find
stuff to watch I like the app a lot and
found myself using the gs4 as my remote
control more often than not there's also
a big list of apps that I rarely used
but I guess or sort of cool group play
lets you sync music among your friends
phones as long as you all have GS 4s or
all play a game at the same time which
is pretty cool story album lets you
create scrapbooks out of your photos
which is alright I guess and on and on
this list goes s-health is a
particularly cool app giving you a step
tracker calorie information and lots of
other Fitbit style health info but it's
gonna need some accessories before it
becomes really useful those are coming
though so there's a lot going on here
but even with everything turned on and
running the GS 4 gets pretty solid
battery life I had no trouble getting
through a full day and even partly into
the next before the battery died though
if you do have s health running plus all
the crazy software features things can
get a little hairy still though as long
as you're cool with charging your phone
every night you should never have any
issue with the GS 4's battery so all of
this leads me somewhere I don't really
know I don't know how to feel about the
GS 4 it's fast it has a great screen it
has a huge number of software features
and I even really like a lot of them but
ultimately I don't enjoy using this
phone as much as I do the HTC One or the
iPhone 5 it feels cheap and chintzy and
just unimpressive everyone I handed the
device to had the same first reaction
and it was never good all of the
elements of a perfect Android phone are
out there now but unfortunately they're
still spread across two different
devices
I think I'd buy a one personally but I
won't blame the millions of people who
end up buying GS 4s and make no mistake
there will be millions
