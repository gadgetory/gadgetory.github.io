talk about that Facebook phone if we're
all spending so much time on our phones
interacting with people then how can we
make this easier what would it look like
if instead of our phones being designed
around apps first and then just being
able to have some interactions with
people inside those apps if we flip that
around and made it so that our phones
were designed around people first and
then you could also interact with apps
when you wanted to what would it feel
like if our phones were designed around
people not apps we're not building a
phone and we're not building an
operating system but we're also building
something that's a whole lot deeper than
just an ordinary app you don't need to
fork Android to do this it's a family of
apps and you can install it and it
becomes the home of your phone so we're
calling this home here's what you're
gonna see you can comment right there
from the home screen and Cover feet is
great for being able to stay on top of
what's going on with all the people you
care about but sometimes there's a more
important message and you want to get
notified so let's say I get a message
from my friend I'm gonna get a
notification with her face and her name
so I'm easily gonna be able to tell if
this is a person who I want to interact
with now and if I do that I could just
tap on it to pull pull her up and
interact with her or if not I could just
swipe away to throw her away for now so
let's say that you want to get
directions to a restaurant that you're
gonna go to what you do is you put your
finger on your face there at the bottom
and these options pop out for apps
messenger and the last stuff that you're
in you just swipe up and and there are
your apps right there
we all want to talk to people not apps
so we came up with this idea that we
call chat heads and you can just tap on
his face and bring up the his
conversation this is what this can stay
there in any app that you're in so let's
say you're playing a game then and you
want to tell your friend about it now
that's easy you can move them around to
find the right place where you want them
to be that's a lot of fun and and then
the most fun of all when you're done
with them you just throw them away at
the bottom
damn I'd like to hand it off to Adam
maseri to take us through this some more
so if I press and hold my profile pic in
the bottom you'll see I get three
options messenger apps from them I most
recently used that this is actually kind
of fun to play with people do this a lot
you also notice that there's a really
thin light inline composer at the top
that's so that if you want to post a
status or a photo or check-in it's just
one quick tap away now you've seen home
and you're probably wondering how do you
get it if you have the most recent
Facebook app on Android and you have
messenger on Android you'll see this
when you launch it Android wants to make
sure you really want to do this and so
you just do always and then you're good
to go and that's it home is up and
running on your phone we think home is
going to be a great experience on
tablets now we aren't quite done with
tablets yet so this isn't dead launch
we're not gonna be launching on tablets
and so like all of our other mobile apps
home is going to release every month and
so every month we gonna come out it's
gonna have more features it's gonna work
on more devices and it's gonna be better
with home it's not just mobile first but
mobile best we're gonna start off with
just a few devices that we're supporting
for download and we're gonna make this
available for download starting in about
a week on April 12th so we're looking
forward to getting it in all of your
hands and I'm excited to share that
before even announcing home a lot of the
best phone makers and carriers around
the world have already signed up to
deliver great experiences with home and
today I want to highlight two 18t and
HTC today I'm a proud to introduce the
HTC first it's gonna be available on
April the 12th for a great price of
$99.99 exclusively at AT&amp;amp;T I'm really
excited for for this moment the very
definition of what a computer is and
what our relationship with it should be
hasn't been set for the majority of the
world and when it is I think that a lot
of that definition is going to be around
people first so that's home
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
