is a problem repenting a lot more money
but service and speeds are staying about
the same that's getting better but not
fast enough and a lot of people have
ideas on how to make it better one of
those people is Susan Crawford professor
at the benjamin cardozo school of law
she just came back to New York after a
stint as President Obama's special
adviser on science technology and
innovation and she also served on Mayor
Bloomberg's Council on technology
innovation she's the author of book on
telecom monopolies called captive
audience she has a lot of ideas on how
to fix it i'm here with susan crawford
law professor and author of captive
audience which is basically a book about
how comcast taking over the world uh
it's an argument to by comcast stock
yeah I mean fundamental needs you you
argue very precisely in the book that
they can't be stopped I'm awfully well
hey they are doing well why is that well
it is a great American success story I
mean it's fantastic and these are
fantastic managers they're really good
at running this business they're very
calm very stately but you know so with
Standard Oil that was a fantastic
business too and it's great for them but
if you can control a commodity that
everybody in the country needs and you
can set the prices for it and decide
what quality you deliver it at and then
you can just divide markets and say
alright you take Minneapolis I'll take
Chicago and make deals with your
brethren and then just keep grinding out
profits and then not upgrade that's what
really gets me exercised about this the
more than eighty-five percent of the
country is stuck with cable modem
service for high-speed Internet access
very expensive compared to other
countries and second-rate it's not fiber
it's not fiber and so I would love to
see if you're going to have a big
provider of high-speed internet access
it needs to be subject to either
competition or oversight these guys have
neither and I want to see the country
compete in the 21st century this is not
just about consumers watching video or
you know anxious anxieties about who's
filtering out what internet access this
is about the country's ability to keep
up with other nations and I'm really
concerned broadband interacts s high
speed and access is you are you that
it's effectively utility like
electricity or water but we don't
regulate it like that
what's the barrier I think a lot of our
readers would say tell you that of
course it's required but you can get
here you cannot get it right well here's
what happened exactly the same story for
electricity so it used to be controlled
by a whole series of private trust these
giant companies no oversight nothing FDR
comes into office he said no everybody
in America should have a connection to
electricity at a reasonable price it
doesn't happen by magic it actually
takes government policy to make this
possible and so that's what I'm so
hopeful about this issue because your
generation you know our saw you on the
stuff I just start going to get this
yeah in this context for you to say that
you're hopeful about the government
doing anything yep seems extremely
foolish and I you know I'm an advocate
of net neutrality I enjoyed the book
thoroughly but I have no hope that our
government will accomplishing these
goals well there's government whose
government I'm totally focused on
mayor's these days I've given up on
federal policy for the time being the
wife of the mayor because mayor's our
sovereigns mayor's can act they have
control over their rights of way they
can say we need fiber in our area so I
I've met a bunch of them the mayor and
fluffy at Louisiana tells this great
story his grandmother thought of
electricity as they called it the light
bill because that's all she could
imagine electricity being used for so he
says we need to use our electrical
utility to bring fibre to laugh at and
he's a Republican it's not a you know
left-right issue it's essential and so
everybody there has a really fast
connection a really low cost Chattanooga
Tennessee the mayor there says the most
important thing he's ever done in
Chattanooga's make sure that there's
fiber access for everybody 70 bucks a
month so he says that's important why I
mean I know why yeah a lot of maybe
verge readers know why but the wider
community of people in America don't
necessarily know why there's no
immediate benefit to getting faster than
access in your home other than you're
going to get netflix a little bit faster
right well think about the electricity
analogy okay if you only think it's good
for the light bill and you can't imagine
that you could plug other devices at
your house and run let's say a
refrigerator or a dishwasher same thing
with very high speed fiber access we
don't even know yet what it's going to
be used for we do know that presence
humans actually being able to talk to
each other requires really low latency
really high capacity networks and what
you make presents possible using these
networks all kinds of things become
possible things like health care at a
distance education at a distance not
just sort of dialing into some classroom
but actually doing it advanced
manufacturing all this stuff makes is
possible new businesses Kansas City is
interesting right because yeah time
warner's they're screaming from the
rooftops we've always offered this
service you could always get they never
offered a gigabit 470 bucks a month but
why is it that they're not seeing these
things happen right the big dominant
incumbents are saying they're not
upgrading people that are chart there
grinding away they're costing the same
why don't they see that if they partner
with local communities and big cities
whatever that they will get a flood of
new customers what's holding them back
profit-making just the way an ordinary
business Frances think say they can milk
their existing investments forever they
could make more and more money out of
the existing infrastructure why would
you upgrade why would you lower prices
if you've got a complete control of a
market you've got the richest customers
you're charging the more and more and
more using programming using local
sports a lot of the time and you've got
them in a vice grip and you then you can
set tears and do more price
discrimination it's a great business for
them they have no incentive to change
now in provo where Google showing up
Comcast suddenly for seventy dollars a
month offers 250 down 50 up fast
internet access nowhere else in the
country does comcast do that why do they
do to provo because competition
competition we just were so unused to
this idea that it would like competition
how does that happen yeah and so
whatever we can do in these cities to
set this yardstick to say great cheap
service should exist it's incredibly
important and I'm really excited about
the possibility with 20 more cities you
know that get online and find a way to
bring fiber then every other mayor gets
jealous you have to say every time a
street is ripped up in any one of the
five boroughs put conduit there every
time kinda was put in it should reach
each building around there build the
laterals every time just kind of it
should be shared even if our eyes and
takes part of it make sure that a
competitor gets in there the city really
gets in this way by charging
extraordinarily high franchise fees for
competitive fiber providers that's
ridiculous they did is not a
money-making venture it should be that
everybody gets this
how do you deal with the wireless
carriers who have very little
competition who are pointing repeatedly
to smartphones as a massive success of
competition whether or not you believe
that's true but that's the deal right
and who are saying if you regulate us
you'll kill this look at what just
happened without your help wireless is a
more competitive marketplace than the
wired marketplace I'm focusing on but
these two things are complementary fiber
policy is wireless policy get more fiber
throughout the country and you've got
much more Wi-Fi all kinds of things that
could spring off of that they it's true
that sprint and t-mobile are giving 18
teen browse more of a run for their
money right now and it's true that LT is
everywhere but it's it's such a capped
compressed service it's great for
mobility but it's complementary with
Annie it's not a substitute and nobody
in South Korea would ever start a
business using a smartphone and not
having a wire at home same thing here so
what are the next steps with on the
local and the kind of larger macro
national level beyond just making
everybody jealous well what are the
concrete things are like actual people
can be oh no question so what thing I'm
going to do with my life and my limited
time on earth is make sure that I can
help mayor's understand best practices
across these different cities never act
in a vacuum share lots of information
maybe act as a buying cooperative when
it comes to getting equipment in place
mounting the political campaigns that's
so important and what people can do in
each city is give their mayor air cover
say we're going to vote on this basis
we're going to make sure that the people
who represent us understand that we need
this X as a reasonable cause it's
interestingly your focus on mayor's
that's what I'm come back to it because
how do you do that without a strong
federal policy throughout the country
here's why you go to every state in
every city yeah a secret plan is each
city gets in this we roll back the
terrible state laws that prevent cities
from acting on fiber networks gradually
it's going to take a lot there 19 of
them that creates a patchwork that makes
everybody jealous and switches the
expectation so that at the federal level
even the people who seem incapable of
moving now yeah change the policy but
they we don't make progress really until
you can see something in America right
now we don't see how badly we're doing
make that visible by using the mirrors
it's a first step is not the last step
what was professor professor thank you
very much nice to meet you they're fun
to talk to you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
