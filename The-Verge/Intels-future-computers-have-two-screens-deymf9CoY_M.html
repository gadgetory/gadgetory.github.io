you're watching out by asking a
seemingly simple question what's a
computer and I'm kind of obsessed with
that question or more specifically with
how pcs are changing we know that
Microsoft has a surface and Apple has
the iPad and the Mac and Google has
Chromebooks but that leaves out one
really important company Intel so here's
a question what does Intel think the
future of pcs looks like to answer that
question I went to Intel's headquarters
in Santa Clara California we went inside
the room that Intel calls the client
experience center which is a boring name
for actually a not a very boring place
it's where Intel works on prototypes for
entirely new kinds of computers
this is Murli veeramani a senior
director here at intel veeramani is one
of the people in charge of making stuff
like what you see spread out on this
table so at this table we're looking at
the looks like almost the whole
development process and microcosm for
Tiger Rapids this is the tiger Rapids
prototype you might have seen it before
Intel's actually been showing it off for
a few months now it has an LCD screen on
one side and an ePaper display on the
other where a keyboard would usually go
you've had the idea and then you start
moving on to actually like 3d printing
stuff and building or identity so then
comes the electronics of it which is you
know how does this all of this fit into
the form factor that we have so we do
different kind of motherboards and
here's an example of an earlier
motherboard we did it's a whole computer
the whole laptop is this nice so yeah
until makes computers sort of Intel has
to do more than just come up with the
idea it actually has to build it to
prove out that it's even possible until
goes 90% of the way towards creating a
finished product it builds the board's
checks the thermals and even develops a
little bit of the software on Windows
but you can't go into a store and buy an
Intel computer they don't sell stuff but
you will be able to do is go into a
store later this year and buy the Lenovo
yoga book see 9:30 which is sort of like
a bigger version of this prototype
device you can see that the two things
here are basic
the same idea once I'd Snell city panel
and the other size an ePaper display we
work very closely with Lenovo to get
their product to market using our
learnings and our engineering
collaterals rather engineer to the
things they want and then they say okay
that's pretty good let us now do it our
way
you kind of give them like a blueprint
and then they modify it to their own
needs we just have to work with them and
realize it's their product right right
and make sure that we can satisfy our
eventual requirements which is our
silicon you have done a huge amount of
work to even get to this point how does
it know how does it feel I guess to
basically be making nearly consumer
ready products and then not finishing
that last mile what's that like for you
so it's it's a it's a tough thing and I
tell my team the analogy I give is it's
like you're not bringing up your kids we
wanted to grow want them to have a
successful life but we don't get to live
their life right so it's the same thing
like us we don't get to put our product
because that's not our business cool so
hang on we got a stop here because
there's a thing that we haven't really
talked about yet intel has had a garbage
year it started with specter and
meltdown which were two huge security
vulnerabilities that required everybody
to slow down their chips and then Intel
CEO resigned in July after disclosing
and improper relationship with an
employee and as of right now it still
only has an interim CEO and the other
thing to say is that for a long while
now Intel husband facing kind of a
downturn in its core business so it
spent the past couple of years trying
some really weird stuff we went behind
the scenes at CES this year we saw
drones and voxels and self-driving cars
and back in January we also went to
Intel's office to see some
normal-looking AR glasses that they
called Avant and that project got
cancelled because Intel couldn't figure
out how to get it from prototype to
product so you know yeah
garbage year not great all of which
means that right now I think
Intel is trying to refocus on the PC and
specifically on what the PC is
turning into my grand theory of Intel is
PCs are great smartphones came along and
that but then you you hit ultrabooks and
that was a really big moment and then
there's much weird stuff that you made
glasses and bowls that charged things
and you're making drones and all that
stuff but it feels like it's time for
the next generation of pcs to happen
again it's fair to say we do experiment
with things but I would say the magic
that we have in our engineering
capability when married to our customers
Rogerian capability is we bring
practical innovations okay that can
change or allow people to use computers
in new ways but also if we scale into
the market now Intel's real goal with
making all these prototypes is to create
something that's actually possible for
an OEM to make and it will actually get
sold on the market now Tiger Rapids was
one thing but the next thing is this a
dual screen device called copper Harbor
it's a cool prototype but it's also
really prototyping the software is more
proof of concept than actual and usable
thing in copper Harbor the whole idea is
to have two symmetrical screens of
similar capabilities coming together and
that opens up a completely new landscape
okay two screens but if I want to use it
as one big screen like it's just like a
tablet I could open up Excel here Excel
pops up and voila we have got 46 rows
one of their demos you showed me was
PowerPoint you have the speaker notes on
one side and you're presenting on the
other side so you could be presenting
this to me so this is showing the use
case of having you know attack a Rapids
like but much more powerful because this
whole site is color why is this better
than just having a big old tablet with
two windows open the whole idea is that
it can fold it can be a portable device
kind of multiple modes like for example
you couldn't do the tenth mode on a
tablet of course the tablet has its own
capability that you know until we get
screens which kind of spans or so you
know there are benefits of the tablet as
well
and I guess the other thing it's not
only does it fold up smaller to carry
but it could also fold this way so that
you've got a nicer reading experience or
something yeah yeah whether we actually
see this dual screen thing turn into an
actual product is still an open question
but if you want to know what Intel
thinks the future of PCs looks like it
looks a little bit like this we have
driven the thickness of PCs to single
millimeter thicknesses I mean it's super
thin what's going to happen is as you
carry your thin machine around you're
gonna be able to use it more and more
and more to do the things you want
you'll have the different surfaces
you'll have amazing screen technology to
do not only screens and keyboards but
you can imagine other things you could
do on the second screen after everything
that I saw it Intel here's what I think
it's idea of what's next for the PC
actually is that they're gonna look and
act a little bit more like phones
there's gonna be more willing to carry
them around with you wherever you go
Intel it missed out on the first 10
years of smart phones so now it has to
be hyper focused on what it's good at to
make sure that it doesn't miss out on
the next interesting thing and you know
what that might be
computers everybody thanks so much for
watching and let me know would you ease
the device it has a screen here I'm
gonna screen here and then it folds and
folds the other way let me know in the
comments and if you want to know how to
actually use all the weird technology we
keep talking about we've got a great
YouTube series called workflow and you
should check that out too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
