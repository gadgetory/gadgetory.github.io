chapter in Apple's story and here it is
Apple watch is the most personal device
we've ever created
and it works seamlessly with iPhone and
it's also a comprehensive health and
fitness device it's this dial it's
called a crown the digital crown
includes
infrared LEDs and photo diodes that
translate rotary movement into digital
data the watch senses that you're
raising your wrist and then activates
the display the digital crown is a
remarkable input device it fluidly zooms
into apps it enables nimble precise
adjustment and critically you can use it
without obstructing the display it's
also the home button or you can even
share something as personal as your own
heartbeat it's been laminated to a
machined and polished single crystal of
sapphire the display also senses force
we've developed a linear actuator that
provides haptic feedback to complement
your interactions it's essentially
miniaturizing an entire computer system
onto a single chip infrared and visible
light LEDs along with photo sensors
detect your pulse rate the watch
provides a comprehensive picture of your
daily activity inductive charging
completely sealed it requires no
alignment or expose contacts keeping
time to plus or minus 50 milliseconds we
have designed six different straps and a
mechanism that makes the straps easily
interchangeable now of course we knew
one size wouldn't fit everyone
so we've also developed a smaller watch
with matching smaller straps we've
actually created three distinct
collection
Apple watch the sport collection Apple
watch Edition technology to be worn to
be truly personal this is the current
moon phase we scheduled our event on a
nice full moon so this will look great
here so we've created something called
glances you just swipe up from the
bottom of the watch face and if I just
swipe horizontally I can see things like
where I'm located here at Flint Center
the current weather outside Nasdaq stock
boy quote and world time where I can see
music I'm currently playing on devices
around me we're using the taptic engine
to give you feedback on your wrist it's
just like somebody tapping you on the
wrist very gently and even if you're
sitting right next to someone they won't
be able to tell that you're getting
notified it's very subtle but you'll
field on your own wrist here's a
calendar invitation other notifications
here's one from Johnny we've actually
analyzed the text that's coming in and
picked out some things you might want to
just tap on and send back so we can do
Siri just by pressing the digital crown
here what movies are playing tonight in
Cupertino photos app here now though I
could use the digital crown to zoom
right in to photos and see which ones
I'd like to look at so let's tap on maps
here now while you're walking Apple
watch will give you taptic feedback on
each turn so you'll know whether it's
time to turn left or to turn right and
those feelings are different for each
direction so you can actually know
without even looking at your watch and
there are my friends when we're getting
hungry we can just tap each other and
we'll feel it on our wrist so I'll just
do him do the triple tap here for going
to lunch okay so we do this a lot that
means what's for lunch so I know how
much Jeff loves sushi we've also been
working to enable third-party developers
with something called watch kit you can
see it's using the same layout as the
original tweet but now it's much richer
with images and text it looks like the
Twitter brand and it has buttons that
you'd like to use to favour it or
retweet right on that message and
they'll be let you see the current
sports scores honey well let you control
the temperature in your home with a
Lutron app you can control the lighting
and the scenes in your home with one tap
with a Nike app you can challenge your
friends to go for a run and we just
can't wait to see what developers are
going to create in this great new
platform health and fit
we have two new applications in Apple
watch the first is the fitness app
monitors all of your activity and
movement throughout the day and the
second is the workout app allows you to
set specific goals for specific types of
workouts like cycling or running it uses
an accelerometer to measure your total
body movement it has a custom sensor
that can measure intensity by tracking
your heart rate and it uses the GPS and
Wi-Fi in your iPhone to track how far
you move with the goal of helping you
sit less move more and get some exercise
and it is so much more that we don't
have time to cover this morning the list
of features is a mile long
Apple watch requires the iPhone because
it's been designed to seamlessly work
together Apple pay will work with Apple
watch but we've also designed it so that
it will work with iPhone 5 iPhone 5c and
iPhone 5s Apple watch starts at only
$349 and it will be available early next
year we are so excited about Apple watch
and I hope you are as well
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
