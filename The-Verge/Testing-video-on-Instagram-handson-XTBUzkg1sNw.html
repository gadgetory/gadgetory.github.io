checking out Instagram four-point-oh for
iPhone and Android launching today with
video shooting when you first open the
app it looks pretty much the same when
you go down to shoot a photo like you
normally well you'll notice a new icon
on the right for shooting video so if
you tap that you instantly go into a
square cropped video mode reminiscent of
vine and unlike with vine you won't tap
and hold on the screen to shoot you will
tap and hold on the big red button to
shoot so once you're shooting you can
let go whenever you want you can pick up
stop start shooting another clip you can
shoot as many clips as you want kind of
like on vine except instead of six
seconds you get 15 seconds to shoot all
your videos one interesting feature is
that if you don't like what you just
shot you can hit the little backspace
button and delete your last shot it's a
nice little undo feature and like on
vine you can also flip to use the
front-facing camera if you'd like four
consecutive shots or just in general
once you're done shooting your video you
can move on to the next screen where you
can choose a filter just like with
photos you can watch your video they
have 13 new filters you can use for your
video that we're handmade by some video
editing wizards and you can only apply
one filter to the entire video once
you're done move on to the next screen
choose a cover frame which is an
interesting new feature that lets you
pick one frame of the video that you
want to be the frame people see when
they're scrolling through their
Instagram feeds scrolling through
Facebook or looking on the web next to
go to share screen which looks almost
exactly like the photo sharing screen
you can add it to your photo map choose
location at a caption share facebook
twitter email tumblr you know the drill
once you hit share the video instantly
post to Instagram back on the home feed
Instagram videos instantly start playing
just like on vine except they don't loop
they just play one time through and then
they're done in our tests over Wi-Fi
least the videos load almost
instantaneously and look pretty good
taking an Instagram videos quite a few
more steps than taking a vine but for
everybody who's are using Instagram it's
a great new feature it's out today on
the iPhone and Android
