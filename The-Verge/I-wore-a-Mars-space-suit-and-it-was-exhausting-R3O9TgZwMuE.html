over
it hurts I've been lucky enough to watch
people launched orbit but I've had to
stay behind here on earth and
unfortunately being a reporter doesn't
really qualify me to be an astronaut but
it does let me pretend to dress like one
that means one thing Spacey I can really
see myself in then
get a professor reflective designing a
spacesuit is an incredibly complicated
process combining knowledge of textiles
engineering biology and atmospheric
science that means there's no
one-size-fits-all for a suit right now
astronauts going to the International
Space Station have a specialized suit
geared for spacewalks in lower Earth
orbit but different suits will be needed
if we want to go elsewhere in the solar
system and they'll have to be tailored
to the place an astronaut is going
luckily I found a place that will let me
cosplay as a future planetary Explorer
we're here in the great state of North
Dakota the University here has a human
spaceflight laboratory where they make
prototype spacesuits for going to the
moon or to Mars and they said I get to
try one on this is Pablo de Lyonne
professor here at the University of
North Dakota and the head of the lab and
that lifeless form on the table between
us that's a prototype spacesuit for Mars
called the Indy x1 that I'm about to try
on it's been tested out in some extreme
environments including Antarctica and
simulated Martian surfaces at NASA so
it's the real deal but first I want to
know what takes make a space suit
it's very difficult to contain a human
inside basically what is hot bag full of
oxygen yeah so you know you have to
create it in a way that this mobile that
is comfortable for the astronauts that
is safe and will protect him or her of
vacuums and all the other dangers that
you have in the face when you design a
suit you have to take into consideration
of the environment and you have to study
that particular place so for example we
use a Mars simulant that simulates the
characteristics of smart soil because we
don't have any more soil yet here on
earth
so basically dust gravity atmospheric
composition Mars may be cold but it can
definitely get hot inside a confined
suit in order to control temperature
astronauts use a full body liquid
cooling garment this garment contains
tubing that circulates cold water
removing heat from the skin but
something else that's already used when
they do their spacewalk
as you can imagine it's slightly
uncomfortable but will prevent you from
overheating I will be wearing this today
but I will need to change my clothes
before I get suited up all right so yeah
that's alright so there are some
restrictions when it comes to filming
someone getting into a spacesuit you
weren't allowed to film me actually
sitting it on because of some
international regulations I didn't
really mind because getting into such a
bulky suit isn't exactly the most
graceful experience so clearly this is a
three four person job but I'm assuming
it's going to be not that fun on Mars
either just kidding this way on earth is
a bit of a chore the first thing you
feel is how heavy and restricting it is
it's about thirty pounds here on earth
that you're mostly carrying on your
shoulders fortunately Mars has one-third
the gravity of Earth throw the suit
would feel slightly lighter over there
plus it didn't fit me exactly right so
my fingers didn't quite reach all the
way in the glove and then they
pressurize it which made things even
more difficult you're ready
Oh ears are definitely clapping
how does anyone move in there's a ball
being in a bag of Earth's atmosphere
feels a bit like walking in a giant
balloon I was getting a workout just
trying to keep my arms where I wanted
them it's proved challenging when it
came to performing simple tasks Lear
that roaming around Mars won't be as
easy as going for a simple walk but all
of this discomfort is just a necessary
byproduct of keeping astronauts alive
and it's quite an engineering feat that
I was able to perform tasks in a suit
that's designed to protect me from an
alien environment like Mars and you are
out oh my goodness
you survived okay we'll get you out of a
suit all right listen say it's horrible
after breaking out of the Mars suit and
wiping off the sweat I was ready to head
to my next location the moon well sort
of we tried on the Martian spacesuit
which was intense so we've come to a
much easier environment the lunar
surface which is only 1/6 Earth's
gravity basically I'm going to start my
day on the moon in the lunar habitat
make my way through this tube to the
rover and then dive into this suit and
go for a moonwalk the cool thing about
this is that this is the only place that
you can go from habitat to a rope store
to a suit and then boots on the ground
and one seamless system so the fact that
we can try this out is very critical so
here we are in the habitat and you've
got your basic you know place to sleep a
fridge kitchen but right now I need to
for the haves and go to my rover a bit
life Discovery Zone alright now we are
in the rover but I'm not driving today
seem to hit in my suit okay there you go
let me know when you reach the end of
the boots I needed a bit of help to get
my legs into place and then I was ready
to pull the release and have a bit of
fun no just one there you go
and there you are alright alright
frolicking in the lunar suit was a bit
easier at first it was a training suit
so it weighed less and I wasn't fully
pressurized also this suit was slightly
more spacious making it easier to grip
and maneuver but after a while it still
got incredibly hot and doing sprints
tired me out I'm from irony respect for
people's Americans now my main takeaway
from all this designing a spacesuit ins
thinking about thousands of different
problems that don't immediately come to
mind and floating around the outside of
the station requires a completely
different type of suit than one for a
Mars expedition or one for a lunar base
plus a suit that can keep people alive
in these extreme environments isn't
exactly the easiest thing to work in to
be fair I had Earth's atmosphere and
gravity working against me but it's
clear I need a lot more training before
I can work four hours in a spacesuit so
in case you have to do use the restroom
you get to do that in here right but
it's hopefully you don't feel it for the
rest no this is actually this is this is
a maximum absorption garment okay
maximum absorption</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
