and everyone hates the new design of the
app not everybody why do you have to
make such sweeping generalizations
generation is the worst which is why I
use Instagram it's honestly so much
better because it copies all of the
features that snapchat came up with
first are you wearing a hot dog t-shirt
I like to describe Instagram as one of
the few social apps left that still
feels mostly fun I mean I know it's not
a perfect app and there is still that
whole it's a part of Facebook thing but
to me Instagram comes closest to that
kind of glossy aspirational experience
that magazines had when I was a kid yes
snapchat isn't really that precious it's
not about having the perfect plan did or
what a planned candid yeah it's not
about building up your personal brand or
selling clean food diets and eating
avocados while you live the hashtag dan
life what's wrong with avocados it's
it's just people being real and wanting
to message each other that's why I'm all
about snapchat even after the redesign I
mean isn't it kind of crummy to have
stories and your private messages all in
the same tab no way it's even better now
I mean putting stories in limbo between
chats and discovered and it really makes
sense before I'll tell you what didn't
make any sense before and that's
snapchat I mean even before it was
redesigned I don't really get it that's
because you're old you know we're the
same age right you're older by a minute
one of the best things about Instagram
has always been its filters snapchat has
those too yeah but they're a are filters
too so you can give yourself dog ears or
fish lips or a sleep mask or have hearts
exploding out of your head for
Valentine's Day Valentine's Day and
Instagram is the worst also snapchat had
air filters first and they're really
good oh here we go again with the
copycat claim no really it did I mean
what snapchats been doing with air
filters is pretty sophisticated from a
technical perspective and that's before
things like air core and a arc it even
launched and just look at the dancing
hot dog I'm plant-based now snapchat
lenses really do hold a place in our
current internet culture whether you
like it or not by the way how's that
algorithm working
for you are you still seeing Instagram
post from four days ago another big
feature of apps like Instagram and
snapchat is that you can message your
friends and I'm here to make the bold
statement that Instagram messaging is
totally fine messaging is pretty much
all use snapchat for well we know you're
not using it for discover I mean how
much a Jenner Kardashian content can one
person consume like I was saying
messaging is what snapchat is all about
plus it has streaks which are super fun
what are streaks
I don't think Instagram has those it's
when you and a friend sent snaps to each
other for more than three consecutive
days so it's like like an IM
conversation no it's snaps not chats and
you're supposed to keep them going hmm
that sounds like a feature that's been
designed specifically to get you
addicted to an app i bet it's so much
better than instagram messaging your
dm's must be really lame that's not true
sometimes people slide into my DMS and
say things like whoa your cat did what
or your friends baby is so cute or you
totally crushed that three-foot wave or
is that your twin or is that a special
effect riveting and then there are
stories yeah let's talk about stories
because that is absolutely something
that Instagram and Facebook ripped off
of snapchat okay well if a tree falls in
a forest and you make a snapchat story
about it it's like did it even happen
huh basically lots of people are sharing
Instagram stories but I'm not so sure
how many people are still using snapchat
stories well at least with snapchat
stories I have a little more control
over who sees them I mean with Instagram
you're their public and everyone sees
your story or your private and only your
friends do with snapchat I can choose to
make my stories public even if my
account is private and I can also send
my stories to a custom group of friends
- but Instagram has highlights now which
is public and anyway you could have all
of the features in the world but if
fewer people are using the app then what
good is it all of my friends are using
it I know all your friends are using it
now but eventually they're gonna move on
and then you will - it's known as the
network effect look I realize that app
popularity can be somewhat fleeting but
for now I still think Instagram is the
overall better
it's kind of what Facebook used to be
back when it was just about looking at
photos and liking things and creating a
version of your life that seems slightly
better than it is in real life
what sorry I was sending a snap to my
best friend what are you doing I'm
taking my Invisalign out before lunch
you got Invisalign everybody does so
your teeth look good on Instagram are
you one of those hashtag bad people now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
