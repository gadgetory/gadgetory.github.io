they're going to officially announce and
unveil a one m9 or at least we're all
convinced that's what's going to happen
and you see events like this all the
time where sometimes it's live stream
sometimes it's not but they invite lots
of press and people who cover tech news
and stuff like that to come get the
announcement and the official news for
themselves and then afterwards they'll
have a sort of a hands-on session with
whatever they've announced where we can
all get footage of the actual device
that's sort of the typical way it goes
and they have events like this all year
round and oftentimes at conventions like
this like mobile or Congress or CES
there will be lots of consecutive press
events where press are just kind of
running around in between trying to get
all their footage write all their
articles and get stuff done so we'll see
what HTC s do today so now this is the
moment we've been looking forward to are
you ready ladies and gentlemen this is
the all-new HTC One m9 so during events
like this I like to update people on
what's going on even if you aren't able
to watch the livestream I'm sending some
pictures out actually to snapchat and
also tweeting a lot whenever there's
news like something new gets announced I
can take a picture of it share it and
you guys are the first to see it it's
all the future of HTC so now the event
has ended the special curtain behind
which all the stuff was hidden has been
dropped and now you can see the press as
what they've been after all day some
hands-on time with HTC One m8 that's why
I'm going to be after two
so I'm just going to wait a couple
minutes and hopefully get some shots
with the phone and I asked on Twitter
what people want to see that they are
specifically interested in with the m9
probably the camera and the camera the
camera the camera the camera the camera
I'm already not first I'm never first so
I figured I'd rather be on the opposite
extreme of just covering as much quality
stuff as possible
it's cool meet real people like the
comments section of the video is just
like you know a little icon I'm gonna
name like to meet a real person maybe
this is my Gilligan with marques
Brownlee at Mobile World Congress and
specifically the HTC event is they just
unveiled cause of interesting products
they have a good design going for them I
think it's good that they kept it is
incremental yeah I guess about having
problems
all right well wonderful that's marques
Brownlee here at the hcc event at Mobile
World Congress
thank you coconut beta to see the
Samsung yes exactly
something you're wearing when you shoot
for yourself is that all the camera
moves come from one guy but all the
stuff on camera also comes from one guy
you
so that's it I got all the footage I
needed and I think we're pretty much
good to go I'll be editing the video and
putting it together later today so you
can see that video on my channel when it
goes live so now I'm going to go over
and see what Samsung has to show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
