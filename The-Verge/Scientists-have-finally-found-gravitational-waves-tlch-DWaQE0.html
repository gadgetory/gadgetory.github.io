for gravitational waves for the first
time ever the discovery was made by a
group of researchers called LIGO and if
it's true it marks one of the biggest
scientific finds and decades
gravitational waves are considered
ripples in space-time
what is space-time let's try to
visualize it by imagining it as this
blanket
yes we're compressing four dimensions
into three a smaller object on the
blanket surface doesn't change the shape
all that much it will just roll straight
across but if you place a bigger object
with more mass on the blanket surface it
warps the overall shape much more
significantly and affects other passing
objects this is basically how gravity
works in our universe objects seem
attracted to each other but really they
follow the curvatures of space-time
created by the presence of other larger
objects now let's switch things up a bit
instead of a blanket imagine space-time
as a pool of water if you move an object
through the pool it causes a ripple
effect outward a similar scenario
happens when large masses move
throughout the universe
they produce gravitational waves that
warp space-time everyone basically
agrees that gravitational waves exist
but nobody has been able to prove them
in fact the movement of every object in
the universe supposedly produces these
waves but they're usually way too weak
to be observed so to find them the
scientists at LIGO look for the biggest
ones out there that means observing two
super dense black holes merging far away
this huge explosive event generates
enormous waves that can be picked up by
Legos observatories each facility is
shaped like a giant L the arms are
vacuum-sealed tubes 2.5 miles long at
the end of each arm is a mirror when the
gravitational waves pass the mirror
they warp space-time making it appear
that one mirror is closer than the other
the scientists can measure this
phenomenon by timing how long it takes
for lasers to bounce back from each
mirror the relative movement of these
mirrors is incredibly flight by the time
the waves from the black holes make it
to earth they only change LEGOs
instruments by about one ten-thousandth
the size of a proton
that means these measurements are
incredibly difficult to detect and are
very susceptible to error plus the
science community has been burned before
on gravitational waves in 2014
scientists studying the early universe
said they had found evidence for the
waves but later it turned out the
measurements were just the result of
cosmic dust
but finding gravitational waves is still
a huge deal it confirms the last big
part of Einstein's theory of relativity
that has yet to be proven it could also
open up a whole new way of studying our
universe before now we haven't been able
to see objects like black holes or
neutron stars because they are way too
faint but we could use gravitational
waves to study these objects more
directly than ever before</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
