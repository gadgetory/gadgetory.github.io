we're here at maker studios in Culver
City outside Los Angeles we're here to
interview PewDiePie and the world's most
popular youtuber we've got a new TV show
coming out exclusively on YouTube called
scare PewDiePie and we're gonna play a
little bit of his own video game so you
designed this game with a chain yeah
exactly I work with out of minds and we
might had a jam and they met a really
cool prototype and I was like you guys
are awesome I want to do a full game
with you and out came PewDiePie legend
of the brofist we have to do this like
you're in the game this is me looks
exactly like me
so barrels are the enemy they've taken
over my fans as you see here I don't
have any views on the video which is the
worst thing that could ever happen to me
right to bear and the brownness has come
to my house and they've taken all my
fans is that like a YouTube thing it's
because like in all games ever they just
put dirt barrels as like decor we need
to fill this space that barrels so I
made it like a conspiracy theory that
barrels are evil I mean it's not
far-fetched no it's probably the truth
alright you're not waiting up for me I
say how it is cuz we're that I'm playing
as my girlfriend with another guy right
and I guess well that made it weird what
compelled you kind of suit you looking
to get making your own games it's
literally been my dream before I started
making YouTube videos and the thing like
with the game I was I was scared of
making it like too much of a eco thing I
guess like it's all about me it's all
right look at me in a video game
yeah and I'm making other people develop
that for me as well like I wanted to be
fun for them and I think we found that
so last year you had a video game you
had a book and now you have a TV show
yeah YouTube TV show it all happened at
one turns how is that transition been
going from going from having you know
just a channel and making lots of videos
to now doing always you're another
medium
it's very cool to try out different
things and who doesn't want a game who
doesn't want to do all this stuff I I do
it Lisa what was the inspiration for the
show I mean it's horror theme right
which is like kind of going going back
to your roots of kind of the video the
videos you used to make of the videos
that helps you I guess grow your base
that's correct I think it was cool to do
what I already do and then you know take
it to another level of I'm jumping on
you yeah it's the same thing I do
essentially but even bigger this isn't a
traditional TV show just like you know
your the way you've been doing videos on
YouTube isn't kind of a traditional
entertainment level you gotta jump dude
yeah so what can viewers expect oh it's
gonna be really fun it was the craziest
one of the great days experience in my
life
and so you were picked up every single
day in LA and just taken somewhere I had
no idea I was gonna do I was just gonna
picked up and then I knew I was gonna do
it through some time it's going to be on
YouTube reg right this is like something
for people who subscribe and they pay
the $9.99 a month
uh-huh what was the I guess the
rationale there I mean cuz you've
supported eat your bread and past yeah
yeah II thought it was you think it's
good for artists I hope so
mm-hm I understand why they're not maybe
used to used to being free right it was
kind of the same with the this game when
we we wanted it to be the best game
possible so we said okay we don't want
to put ads in it and we don't want to do
all these things and my friends
especially we're very against that in
the beginning yes the game came up
everyone has played that's been very
positive about it and no one says it I
can force I think people will have
hopefully I think we will have the same
reaction to that the show you have one
of the largest audiences on the internet
one of the largest audiences on YouTube
how does it been trying to treat that
like you're just hanging out on a couch
with somebody
oh man it's hard yeah difficult but I do
think it's important if there's
something that that's going on and or
you know I want to share my thoughts on
it's important because if I just make
funny videos all the time which is what
I try to do sorry man yeah people kind
of forget that I'm just a person and
right I'm doing all this but like you
said it fans are very reasonable and and
understanding people and we suck at this
game so like on top of everything that
you're doing right now you have rebel
mode which is like your own talent
agency it was the I guess what was the
rationale there in terms of you know why
why create kind of this like indie indie
label as part of a larger label was it
just you know you wanted to help support
people you like exactly
I'm kind of an indie guy right at a
larger scale I guess but I think there's
a lot of cool stuff you should dammit
you want without me there's a lot of
cool stuff we can do as a smaller group
and as a part of way more talent and I
want to explore that and I think that's
really exciting so you you must have
like the resources of maker your
disposal but you're able to just make it
kind of like you're you know stick a
circle or friends that you want to
promote do you get it we did it
cool cool job thanks for hanging out
with us change very much very plan yeah
