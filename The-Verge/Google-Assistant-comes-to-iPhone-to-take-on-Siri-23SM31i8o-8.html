Google assistant on the iPhone this week
at Google i/o there are a ton of new
announcements for the Google assistant
you already saw this coming to the
iPhone but now you're going to be able
to type to it you're gonna be able to
buy stuff with it you're going to be
able to set up custom actions on it
you're going to be able to see stuff
with the camera and have it identified
for you that's a lot to take in but
let's start with the big news this is
what the Google assistant looks like on
the iPhone as you can see the Google
assistant on the iPhone looks and works
almost identically to how it works on
Android but there are some new features
so for example you can use the camera it
can identify objects and then it can ask
you questions about what you want to do
with those objects so you see a concert
watch it on YouTube or you can just
order tickets or stick it directly on to
your calendar that's coming later this
year but the Google assistant is
launching right away and what you can
see here is it has a microphone you can
just tap on it and ask for things and
Google will give you the answers right
here in that same conversational
interface that they have on the iPhone
you can even scroll back up to see your
history of previous questions that
you've asked it works really really well
it's really simple and it's really
really good at getting you answers from
Google's ecosystem if you use it also
you'll see here that you can type at it
which is really convenient when you type
to it it doesn't make noise so if you're
in a room with other people you don't
have to bother them you can just open it
up start typing and get your answer it's
something you can't do with Siri right
now now for the iPhone they made a
custom widget so that you can get to it
directly from your home screen so you
just swipe over tap on it and you can
jump directly into a search from the
Google assistant which is convenient
because you can't do it from the home
button and you'll notice last but not
least if you search for an address it
uses proper Google Maps not Apple Maps
which honestly is better
so that's the iPhone but there's a bunch
of other stuff coming to the Google
assistant that we need to talk about and
when you look at all these features
individually they might not seem that
impressive but when you take them
together it actually shows something
really good
it's that Google knows what it's doing
with AI on the phone their previous
attempts like now on tap or Google now
ended up feeling kind of haphazard but
with the Google assistant it's really
clear that where Google is heading is
that beautiful dream of the Starship
Enterprise a computer that just does
what you want without making you worry
about apps and settings and text boxes
and all the rest so let's take a look at
these very first baby steps that they're
taking to get there one of the new
things coming to the Google assistant is
that you can use third-party actions
stuff you used to only be able to do in
Google home but now it works on the
phones so what we're looking at here is
ordering food from Panera for delivery
and what's really interesting is we
didn't set up a Panera account we didn't
set up a Panera skill and Google already
knows our home address and it knows our
credit card number it keeps all that
stuff privately so I can just tap a
button and send it off to Panera and I
can just speak what I want and get it
even though the assistant doesn't really
get credit for it because you can't
count skills like you can on Alexa
Google's actually done a pretty good job
working with smart home device
manufacturers to make more stuff
compatible they're up to 70 different
manufacturers now and starting soon any
of those manufacturers can go and
register their new devices with Google
so you won't have to wait for it to work
so I could just say turn the lights off
and off they go it's also going to start
working with nest ok Google Play outdoor
video in my living room so what's
happening here is really obvious Google
is requesting the video stream from my
nest camera and displaying it over
chromecast on my TV but my favorite
thing that's happening on the Google
assistant is this new thing called
shortcuts basically it lets you set up a
thing that you ask Google for all the
time and automate it with your own
custom keyword so you just type in the
custom keyword that you want and then
you type in the long action that you
want and it just works so for example if
you want to watch youtube videos all the
time instead of saying
okay google watch verge on youtube on my
TV you could just set up a keyword verge
me and it works like this urge me
alright
playing the verge from youtube on living
room everybody Shawn and I'm about to do
something really stupid okay so once all
this stuff coming out well honestly it's
gonna be a while the Google assists are
the iPhone is available right now but
the rest of its coming out in the coming
months or maybe not even until the end
of the year and honestly that's just how
Google rolls they're not very good at
the big splashy announcement where they
lay out a whole product vision and you
can just get it right away what they are
very good at is slowly iterating over
time when you're not even paying
attention that's exactly what they're
going to do with the Google assistant
for much much more on what is happening
here at Google i/o 2017 you should
definitely check us out on YouTube we
are the verge
this isn't what look it's in focus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
