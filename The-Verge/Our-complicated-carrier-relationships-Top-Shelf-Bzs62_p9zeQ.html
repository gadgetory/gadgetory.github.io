iphone the United States was to sign up
AT&amp;amp;T in 2009 the only way to get the
motorola droid it's a sign of rising
back then you weren't shopping for a
carrier you're shopping for a phone but
now things have evened out all four
major US carriers have the iphone and
they all have the galaxy s3 and soon
they'll all have the galaxy s4 and the
HTC One so the question is what are you
really getting out of here and why do we
all seem to be in such incredibly long
relationships well Carrie idea Sprint
t-mobile SIM on tmobile 18 teen virgin
veteran my might I've sprint right
18teen I've tried them all they all suck
but sprint sucks the least to my
experience services all right um but I
mean I'm personally thinking about
switching over not should not sure where
you at them why do you start with t-mo
four-decade um I'm not kind of lazy how
long have you guys uh for about four
years now have you ever been in Mike
relationship with a person for four
years yes how's that gonna turn out in
tragedy how long have you got a teensy
um since like freshman year in high
school so okay yeah you don't know that
so I guess I get ya yes right now like
eight years for I very it's been maybe
five years now t-mobile wants you to
switch the newly renegade carrier is
banking on an aggressive marketing
campaign and what it says are far
simpler plans for a flat fee and no
contract you get unlimited minutes
messaging and however much data you want
to pay for this t-mobile says there's no
two-year commitment required you can
leave whenever you want but even cheaper
prices don't seem to encourage people to
switch especially because when you do
the math t-mobile's prices aren't that
much cheaper but it's not the devices
and it's not the prices that keep you
committed to your carrier and no one
seems to be happy with that relationship
would you switch if the price and other
carrier is twenty percent lower no not
really I don't want to go through the
hassle of like changing over 50 for
summer maybe how much cheaper twenty
percent
to be honest I pay about ten dollars a
month for an unlimited data and limited
texts and I've got three hours of cops
hey you know I want you to know I'm
moving cuz I twenty percent jeepers you
leave no there a 50-percent cheaper I
consider it your wireless carrier has
become the longest relationship in your
life and all of us seem to be settling
when those two year contract sent the
easiest thing to do is just sign back up
t-mobile seems to be banking on people
being fed up with AT&amp;amp;T and the other
more traditional carrier plans and yes
its plans are indeed more transparent
but at the end of the day t-mobile's
biggest competitor isn't AT&amp;amp;T it's just
apathy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
