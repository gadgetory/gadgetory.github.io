instrument cluster fuck we're at the
Detroit Auto Show and everywhere we look
we see screens that are in
work-in-progress we're talking about the
infotainment system the auto industry's
approach to UX one car that we tested
out was the seventh generation
Volkswagen Jetta it debuted here in
Detroit and it has an option for a new
digital cockpit this cockpit reminds us
of course of the virtual cockpit the
Audi debuted a couple years back
it marks a real switch for Volkswagen
which is now using the MQB platform for
the jet up which is also used on their
Atlas and the golf you can use your
screen to turn on from the beep sound
system that's in the Jetta or one of our
favorite fun features is to manually
alter the mood lighting
so one thing we like to see more of is
the future like the ambient lighting
which allows you to alter the color that
appears in your car and a thin strip
that runs around the periphery of the
interior of the car but we'd like to see
more features like that that actually
allow you to drastically change the car
oh you can change it from verge pink to
something else much of the technology
that we saw it's yes was nowhere to be
found in Detroit in Las Vegas we tested
out the MBU act system which
made by mercedes-benz it's the first
system that they've actually developed
themselves one of the lead features of
the MDX system is its voice assistant
which Mercedes developed in-house
they're the first company car company to
do this which is interesting because
they're trying to keep peace with tech
companies like Amazon and Google we know
that automakers are now offering Amazon
Alexa and Google assistant but if you
looked around the Detroit Auto Show you
would never know it we asked five
different automakers if they had Alexa
systems that they could show us but
there was no visible representation of
Amazon or Google on the stand so what
you're kind of buying is still more a
home myth one company that broke the
mold in Detroit was Nissan which
displayed the cross motion SUV a new
autonomous concept car the Nissan
concept car has seven screens and then
there's an additional screen where you
stow your sunglasses or your garage door
opener in traditional car but in that
place Nissan has this thing called the
digital room here and that shows cars in
your rear-view approaching rather than
using the traditional side which is kind
of cool we're told this system is
operated by using thumb prints a retina
of your eye to control the function
which then activates a koi fish that
swims across your screen and acts as
your personal assistant
only thing is that we couldn't actually
test it out so instead we just watched
this video looping of this mesmerizing
koi fish unfortunately at Detroit there
are a lot of ideas but little chance to
actually play around with the execution
some automakers took screens to another
level the new Ram 1500 extended its
massive proportions into a massive 12
inch touchscreen we found the system to
be a bit leggy to use
showing that maybe bigger isn't always
better the reality is is that all the
automakers at the Detroit Auto Show and
Beyond such as Tesla and other companies
that we don't see here today are all
chasing the idea of how to make the
perfect infotainment system whether or
not our car works like our phone has
nothing to do with the real issue which
is how to keep us safe on the road the
best safety system is the best
infotainment system which shares the
commonality of being easy and simple and
clear to use until we get to that point
where we are not driving our cars and we
can sit back and watch the koifish in
our screens we're waiting</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
