The Verge from CES 2014 I'm standing
here with the will which is a advanced
wheelchair created by a team of
engineers in Japan folks who previously
worked at places like Nissan Sony Toyota
and Olympus there's a lot of interesting
components to the will first obviously
is the design which is more futuristic
than anything I've seen before in a
wheelchair so you notice this arm here
folds up to make it easy to to get in
from the side and then when you sit down
you just drop this down like this I turn
it on here to power it up those lights
go blue so this is the controller here
what's really interesting about this is
it's designed to work just like a mouse
so I have 360 degrees of motion here I
can go left I can go right and I just
started you know using it a couple
minutes ago it it's extremely intuitive
you know I feel like I'm able to direct
it with a lot of certainty and I can
make kind of complex maneuvers the wheel
design which includes these 24 separate
tires is made so that you can have a
really tight turning radius for indoors
and also four-wheel drive so that when
you're outdoors you can go over any kind
of terrain so this is the will it'll be
available for around $9,500 starting in
April it could place your pre-orders now
and they're gonna do a pretty limited
run between 50 and 100 units you know
this is the third prototype and they're
continuing to improve it as they have
more and more people test it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
