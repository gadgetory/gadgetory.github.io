the history of trucking in America
projected onto the massive Hoover Dam in
the middle of the night you kind of
wonder what you're doing with your life
but when you realize they're revealing
the world's first road ready
self-driving truck things make a little
bit more sense
you might think that it's done by plane
or you may wish it were done by drones
but a lot of the goods in this country
are still delivered by trucks the
problem is that big rigs are dangerous
they kill 4,000 people a year in nearly
half-a-million crashes driver fatigue is
a leading cause of these accidents but
it's a problem that Daimler has a pretty
revolutionary solution for it the
company basically took an existing
version of one of its freightliner
Trucks and installed what's called the
highway pilot system it's the same thing
that powers the Mercedes future truck
that we saw debut last year and a
technology that guides it is actually
pretty simple just radar and cameras
once the system becomes active then it's
fully autonomous and it's steering
braking and accelerating or decelerating
as necessary to maintain control we have
two cameras that are mounted up into the
windshield and they use the white lines
to determine the trucks position in the
lane of course if you don't have the
white lines you can still run in the
normal ACC cruise control mode and you
can still write from the truck manually
it's still safe to run it manually and
the truck will let you know when it
doesn't see the white lines and when
they're supposed to take over that's
actually a really important point if the
painted lines on a road aren't in good
shape the trucks autopilot just won't
work you have to make sure that there
aren't objects in the way you have to
make sure that the roads are actually
still well built out it'll tell you when
those things might be interrupting your
drive but
if the white lines aren't painted while
on that road
the cameras aren't gonna be able to pick
it up and it's gonna tell you to take
back over it once the driver is warned
to take control there's a countdown
visual and audible to indicate that he
has a specified amount of time to take
over the wheel and basically the system
goes from active to completely inactive
and unavailable Daimler gave us a ride
in the truck on the public highways
outside of Las Vegas the experience was
actually pretty normal there were a few
instances where the driver had to take
control like getting on and off the
highways or getting around construction
vehicles but for the most part the drive
was pretty autonomous the only thing
that was weird about it was you could
feel the truck drifting from side to
side as it kept itself in the lane and
that made me a little bit motion sick
but I'd imagine a truck driver wouldn't
have that problem I mean I've never been
in a big rig before but this is the only
moment where you really felt a little
blip of fear is just when the gear shift
change and that's just because that's
the most noticeable thing that happened
without you doing this this system is
more is very integrated so that it's
making choices on what gear to be in and
what the optimal speed is and all of
that so the benefits of this system
there's three that we're that we're
focusing on one in the area of safety
improves safety chances with the
integration of the camera the radar the
steering system the other being the
connectivity aspect allow the driver to
connect to either work or home based
type systems with tablets and then
finally efficiency the chances for
optimization of acceleration
deceleration as it impacts the driver
and also the vehicle that efficiency
translates into better fuel mileage and
reduced emissions which are more reasons
for Daimler to keep testing this
technology in the coming years as we go
forward there's a higher expectation for
for
people and drivers and fleet owners to
be more connected to their vehicles and
so in turn offering that to them also
allows additional efficiency potentials
all of this is great in a future where
our highways are full of automated
vehicles big and small can only mean
we're all going to be safer but only two
of these trucks are licensed to run on
public roads right now and many other
states won't allow them so it's gonna be
a long time before robot trucks take
over the highway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
