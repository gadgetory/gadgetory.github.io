was silly then it was a little bit true
now it's just kind of obvious we don't
use our phones to make calls we use them
to watch movies and read books and get
work done and send weird videos on
snapchat so we want phones with big
screens and great cameras and good
battery life and lots of apps so Apple
made that exactly that this is the
iPhone 6 there's really nothing more
accurate to say about the iPhone 6 then
it's a big iPhone it's taller and wider
and slightly heavier than last year's
iPhone 5s so it's actually a bit thinner
it comes in the same three colors as the
5s silver gold and Space Gray plus three
storage options you either get 16
gigabytes though I wish the base option
were 32 plus 64 or 128 gigs if you
upgrade it has much slimmer rounder
edges than the 5s which makes it both a
little more comfortable and a little
less starkly impressive because it's
thinner it's still easy enough to hold
in one hand though I definitely have
more trouble using it than the 5s it's
about the size of your average flagship
Android phone somewhere in between last
year's Moto X and this year's HTC One m8
moving up from a 4-inch phone takes a
minute to get used to but it really is
worth it
the iPhone 6 looks a bit like the very
first iPhone actually there's no
question this is an Apple product it's
really well made sturdy and high-end and
even the buttons feel better than they
ever have the power button is on the
right side now which took forever for my
fingers to relearn but it's definitely
the right location and the volume
buttons are a little longer and a lot
click here the only real design flaw in
my mind is the stripes along the back
where the antennas go they outline the
top and bottom of the iPhone 6 and they
almost look out of place on an otherwise
clean design same goes for the
protruding camera lens which looks a
little odd and makes the phone wobble
slightly if you put it down on a flat
surface but it's really not that big a
deal the front of the phone is all about
the new 4.7 inch 1334 by 750 screen it
looks great like iphone screens have for
a while I can't make out individual
pixels and it's totally visible outdoors
the screen curves into the edges of the
phone which makes swiping and tapping
feel a lot more natural the iPhone 6
doesn't feel like a box with a screen on
top it feels more authentic somehow most
apps upscale pretty simply on to the
bigger display developers can change
them to suit the screen or text in
pictures just all get a little bigger
but I imagine most developers will
pretty quickly update to show more at
once instead of just the same but bigger
in some places having a big screen makes
a huge difference I instantly started
typing both faster and more accurately
on the larger display since there's just
more room movies look better framing
photos is easier you can see more emails
at a time on the screen it's great but I
can't help but wonder if Apple could or
should have done more with this big
screen you get an extra row of icons on
the home screen a neat recent menu in
your multitasking window and not that
much else there's a strange but sort of
useful reach ability mode where you
double tap the home button and the
screen literally slides down so you can
reach it on the iPhone 6 plus there are
a few other changes like landscape mode
in a few apps but on the 6 even though
there's a bigger display and a lot more
space to play with nothing really
changes it's bigger and better but it's
the same that idea really persists
across everything about the iPhone 6 it
supports faster LTE voice over LTE Wi-Fi
calling and a handful of other new
standards and upgrades there's a new a8
chip which is noticeably faster than
even last year's a7 and the m8 motion
processor can tell you how many flights
of stairs you've climbed in addition to
your steps and lots of other health data
even the speaker is louder which I
actually really appreciate the battery
is a little bigger and noticeably better
I could charge it one night and then not
need to again until midday 2 days later
and that's with pretty heavy use I'm
still charging it every night but I can
forget and not worry about it those are
all updates you won't really see though
they just run in the background and make
the iPhone 6 slightly better and faster
than the 5s the one you will see is the
camera it's still 8 megapixels but the
cameras been upgraded in a bunch of
great ways it uses what Apple calls
focus pixels to do phase detect
autofocus and it is just insanely fast I
hardly even notice it focusing yet shots
always come out right you can take
higher resolution panoramas now thanks
to the faster processor and they look
amazing but my two favorite features
both have to do with video one is that
you can choose slow motion video up to
240 frames per second which turns quick
moving action into this epic replay
footage the other is cinematic video
stabilization which does an incredible
job of taking your shaky handheld video
and making it still and smooth you can
see the frame warp and Bend a bit as it
works but the effect is amazing there's
lots of new software here time-lapse
videos burst selfies a new Photos app
and more the camera has always been the
iPhones killer app and the iPhone 6 is a
big upgrade
the rest of the story the iPhone 6 is
the story of iOS 8 there's now
predictive typing on the keyboard which
is sometimes useful and sometimes
hilariously not useful the health app
plugs into the m8 processor and
eventually into the Apple watch to tell
you your steps your elevation and all
sorts of other fitness data messages
lets you talk with your voice
and leave group messages which thank God
my favorite upgrade though is to
spotlight which now also searches the
App Store the web Wikipedia and more all
from the one pulldown window it's just
super handy Apple software and it's a
Pico system have always been what set
the iPhone apart and that hasn't changed
here the iPhone 6 is weird
on one hand nearly everything about it
is better bigger screen faster processor
more impressive and versatile camera
it's the best iPhone yet and it's the
one I suspect most people will buy for
me at least the 6 plus is just too big I
was hoping that when it made a bigger
phone Apple would do things or change
its plan to really show off the promise
of a larger screen to make it easier to
use and take full advantage of but it
didn't Apple just made a bigger iPhone
the same thing I've used for years
that's ok and again this may well be the
best smartphone on the market but the
f16 doesn't quite feel like a
revolutionary device it feels like Apple
playing catch-up just giving the people
what they want and nothing more
I wish Apple had really taken the chance
to rethink how we use a phone now that
our phones are so big instead we just
got a really great big phone nothing
less and nothing more</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
