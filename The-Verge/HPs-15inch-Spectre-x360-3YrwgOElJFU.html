laptops last year and this year it's
back with a new one with a bigger 15
inch display it's still really nice and
well made with an all aluminum body and
as before it's convertible so it can
flip from here all the way back to here
if he thinks if this is a media machine
for people who want to watch a lot of
movies or something for people who just
need to have a lot of tabs open at once
the one of the big features here is that
the screen can be upgraded to 4k and the
1080p model though which I'm sure will
probably get better battery life than
the other one it's puce in the extra
space on this laptop to add a few extra
keys to the keyboard like page up and
page down but they're kind of useless
keys and they couldn't use a space maybe
he's a little bit bigger and more
comfortable to press over although the
keyboard does type really nice and like
the rest of the laptop it feels really
well made there are actually four
speakers inside this thing HP parted
with an offset on the sound there is
always something that's a lot cleaner
than most laptops but it's still
surprisingly quiet for a four speaker
system and the mids are k'nuckles that's
one of Intel's new skylake processors on
the inside there's also a minimum of
eight gigabytes of RAM and 256 gigabytes
of SSD storage there's also a ton of
ports on this including an HDMI and a
USB type-c and there's a really wide
trackpad like really wide the huge
trackpad on this is really nice but this
obviously meant to be used as a
touchscreen too I can't quite imagine
using a 15 inch tablet on my lap but
propping up like this works really well
the new Spectre x-360 is already on sale
starting at around 1150 although you'll
pay a bit more if you want 4k if you
want more on the spectre x360 Windows
