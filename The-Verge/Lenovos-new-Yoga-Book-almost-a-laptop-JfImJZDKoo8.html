2018 and this is the new second
generation of the Novo yoga book this
has always been quite a particular
impecunious device because it's never
been quite a laptop it's never been
quite a tablet it's a thing in between
what I know has done now is they've
enlarged it they've made it ten point
eight inches instead of ten so it feels
more substantial and now I would really
classify it as a laptop but once you
open it up and the way you open up is
pretty cool they have a new mechanism
where you do a double knock on the top
and the magnets the whole thing together
they reverse the polarity there is some
cool magnet magic and it pops it open so
you don't need a note you don't need to
like fiddle around to open it up once
you do open it up you still have an LCD
but lenovo has upgraded the resolution
now like I said 10 14 inches but now is
2560 by 1600 resolution quad HD and then
you have an e display at the bottom
which doubles as the keyboard the
original Innova book had a Wacom
digitizer down here you didn't have
anything display now has an eating
display and the new keyboard I've just
been trying it I've been testing it out
it's really good like shockingly good
for touch my keyboard usually these figs
are really quite atrocious but this is a
massive upgrade from the original yoga
book it has haptic feedback and has
little animation feedback which really
makes it feel realistic I am able to
type on it pretty quickly and I've
picked that up pretty quickly and I'm
surprised by the chop on the hinge is
that watch band style hinge that lenovo
is used on his yoga books previously in
inside the hinge
no one has woven
my antennas so they're actually
somewhere in in the end it's super
sturdy I've had one of those in over
yoga books four or five years I've had
members of my family using and abusing
it and he has survived so I'm impressed
with this hinge it's sturdy
it has a nice bit of traction and
friction to it in terms of design and
engineering as usual with the original
yoga book that was never a problem to be
honest these were really well-made
really solid devices again made out of
aluminium top and bottom it has an eight
point six hour battery life the novel
promises which is extremely reasonable
for a device of this thinness and this
lightweight and speaking of the battery
you can now charge it with the USB C
port there are two USB ports one on
either side which is brilliant you
should have been like this from the
original really happy to see that from
the Novo also over here on the front we
know has added a new fingerprint sensor
it's not a power button it doesn't have
any sort of indentation it says flush
with the device but it's an infrared
fingerprint sensor which is compatible
with Windows hello and the point of the
infrared part is that it should make
your fingerprint easy to recognize many
fingers maybe bit wet or dirty or
whatever predictably the main display is
a touch screen but you do get plenty of
other things that you can do with the
ink panel look down here the bottom it
can function as a keyboard and actually
that's the main use that you have for it
but also it can accept pen input so an
oval shape see yoga book with its own
stylist unfortunately because it's such
a slim device there's nowhere to stash
the stylus which is quite substantial
it's the size of an actual pen but it
works well and you can get an accessory
you know you can get a case and stash
the two things together it's not such a
big deal and it's good that status comes
in the box so you can do pen input you
can do keyboard input or you can use it
as an e-reader as soon as this thing is
launched which sometimes is going to be
around with so over time you only
support PDF files after that is going to
support epub mobi and text files in
terms of reading there is a bit of lag
it's an eating display you always have a
bit of lag and a bit of redrawing time
with it but still it works well and
because of the portability of this
device I can actually see myself using
it in this flipped mode like this
whether it's on the LCD display or on
the eing display one really cool neat
thing that a number has also done is
because the larger screen you get more
space for the keyboard and they've also
made the trackpad minimize abaut so if
you want the trackpad you tap down here
you have it but then as soon as you
start typing it goes away it's such a
intuitive and simple thing but ANOVA has
really had the time to sit down and
think for his design and improving
things and on the inside the company has
upgraded things in terms of specs you
can now get up to a core i5 seventh
generation into a core processor you can
get four gigabytes or eight gigabytes of
RAM 128 or 256 gigabytes of storage and
it only comes with Windows they used to
be an Android version originally but
apparently the Windows version also
Android buy a lot and the novel he just
chose to go with Windows all the way it
was impressed with you original yoga
book when I was here two years ago with
Eva and it didn't turn out to be quite
so good as a final product but this one
I can't be I can't not be impressed with
it again it's done so many good upgrades
across the board with the device the one
thing though the one huge difference is
that the yoga book the original yoga
book was really super affordable whereas
this is now in two straight laptop
territory its price at $999 in the US
when you're considering this you
consider this versus actual laptops what
I would say is wait for the review to
find out if it's worth it so you do all
the staging and then it just feels
awkward so uh I'll just I'll just
Whisperer for this video so it can feel
more natural it's gonna be an ASMR
hands-on with average first time I've
ever done it for 2018 there's still no
yoga book I might actually kill her with
this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
