as kind of crazy to the uninitiated have
you ever dreamed of having your own
spacecraft I'm Zach a grad student in
aerospace engineering at Cornell and I'm
going to fundamentally change the way
that people think about and take part in
space play the aerospace industry in
particular is pretty conservative
there's ways of doing things that were
figured out in 60s and 70s that work so
people you know sort of take the if it
isn't broke don't fix it mentality i
think a lot
a lot of people say all you know it's we
haven't been to the moon since you know
60 70 s and know why we're not exploring
anywhere what's the point of going up
there but when you start to actually get
into the science of it the things you
can do from satellites it's pretty
impressive
nations kind of a risk-averse these days
we start out under NASA's umbrella but
when the Columbia crashed yes I cut
about a billion dollars worth of
programs the private sector could never
have done what NASA did in this 50s and
60s but the great thing is they did it
so now the private sector doesn't have
to I mean that's the point right I think
NASA existed at that time before any of
this had been done when no one knew how
to do it now private companies can take
that knowledge and that experience that
NASA developed and you know run with it
the project is called sky cube sky cube
is a satellite it's going to orbit the
Earth for about three months sending
back tweets from space pictures from
space we will provide this application
where you can just sent typing a message
press the button if you get delayed all
the way up to the satellite and if you
send it back in you radio and then we
will trigger a special release of a
large balloon and it will become pretty
much the most visible star in space so
these are actually as far as i know the
world's smallest satellites and we're
going to pack about 200 of these little
satellites inside here and let them
loose in low-earth orbit and for for a
donation of about three hundred dollars
you can have your own tiny satellite in
space arta set is arduinos in space the
idea is to create a space development
platform to put something in space that
people can access write their own code
get their own data and just run their
own ideas they will be able to go on to
internet log on to our satellite upload
their code or the application of the
game that they wrote and then run it
receive data receive feedback you know
maybe take some pictures let's do the
satellite around and have a true space
experience right now we're working on
our third generation space suit it's an
IV a suit that means intervi hick Uhler
activity so it's in case of emergency
use only
and that we're designing it to be flight
sort of funny imagine you have a ball on
the string and you're spinning it over
your head the string in the middle stays
straight right expand that to an
earth-sized system the earth rotates
then you have a counterweight satellite
deep out in space with a long strong
string attached back to the earth the
earth elevator we just simply don't have
the materials to build it yet we just
don't have that technology yet about a
year ago our team kind of came up with a
breakthrough and we can build a lunar
elevator now with current technology we
tried you know for a couple of years to
go through the more traditional academic
funding routes writing research
proposals and grants we're coming up
short every time Silicon Valley only
invests in ones and zeros if they can't
predict how you're going to be the next
Instagram you are not getting funded by
Silicon Valley we live in a very rich
world I mean there's there's lots of
resources and there's a long tail on it
there are lots and lots of people who
they can't contribute 10 million dollars
but they can contribute ten dollars and
Kickstarter is a way of accessing that
Kickstarter's really what's enabled us
to move forward with this and fly it and
make the sort of progress that's been
made on the project the last year it
doesn't sound very appealing to me to
give up equity in the company and that
was part of the draw of Kickstarter I
mean we went from napkin to help one
person kicks at our campaign in four
months in you know to a high-altitude
balloon launch in five months to assign
launch consequence six months we
originally set our goal our sort of bare
minimum goal to do the project at about
thirty thousand dollars that's sort of
the bare minimum we thought we need to
build something and we ended up making
over seventy five thousand dollars
seventy five thousand dollars for two or
three months of work is pretty good in
my book it's not a tremendous amount of
money that we raise twenty seven
thousand dollars is not very much money
even for just a space suit we anticipate
flight certified space suits for rocket
companies like SpaceX constantly in the
neighborhood of fifty thousand dollars
from one suit have a hundred thousand
dollars about forty five goes into just
fulfilling the Kickstarter obligations
yeah that's a lot of t-shirts the
biggest pressure was Kickstarter's limit
in donation they have a
ten-thousand-dollar donation lemon I
would have set the suit at 18 to 20,000
for a backer and we were kind of forced
because of that limit to set a
ten-thousand-dollar suit and the public
perception is we're going to build an
elevator on the mode so we better use
the little bit of money that we have as
a catalyst as a resource to go out and
do the rest of the stuff
when I was looking at the options for
for participation I realized that
there's an opportunity to actually hit
the launch button on this fascinating
project and I contributed ten thousand
dollars which was the highest
contribution opportunity that was
available we want to create enthusiasm
about space we want people to know yet
it's up there takes huge rockets to get
up there but you yourself can fund
something up there what we wanted to do
was first check that you weren't as I
said drinking your own kool-aid because
we're all and that's about space and I
love it but we wanted to make sure that
they're actually where people out there
who want to design stuff as well you
can't really structurally think about it
you need a diverse group of people
called you know eight billion come up
with all sorts of crazy ideas and what
Kickstarter allows and crowdfunding and
generally allows is that you can take
those crazy ideas and you just test them
in the market within four weeks you know
do people like it people don't like it
and if people don't like it you don't
raise your money education is an
important piece of being engaged into
this process Space Sciences it was a new
area that I didn't know much about I
think space is just fundamentally
inspiring and cool and I mean it's still
the final frontier it really is i mean
it's somewhere that only if a few
hundred people in the history of mankind
of every band people can participate in
space in a way that they couldn't even
like a decade ago when it gets to where
you can fly into space basically as
easily as you can fly across the
Atlantic fifty years ago
then we're going to see some real
innovation the platform like Kickstarter
allows projects to be put in a domain
out there where individuals with a
common purpose it's not about success or
failure but it's about what the purpose
is and how many people can align behind
it and when you have that working you've
got a very powerful force I think
science and technology so that they're
always been the way forward even if we
don't really know what to do with it
when it comes along the first time I
think it's part of the human condition
that you have to you know keep reaching
for new stuff and keep trying</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
