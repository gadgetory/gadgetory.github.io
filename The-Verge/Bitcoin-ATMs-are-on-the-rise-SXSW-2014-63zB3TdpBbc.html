approximates cash on the internet has
been around for five years now at first
it was just for geeks
then as the price started to rise it
attracted speculators now it's starting
to be used in the mainstream as
retailers like Tiger Direct and
overstock comm start accepting it but
it's still clunky to use and not that
easy to get a hold of and that's why the
new gold rush is in Bitcoin ATMs Michael
Peary I brought the first bi-directional
Bitcoin ATM to the United States we put
the first one in a handle bar here in
Austin then we put another one at
Dominican Joe's coffee shop what we're
doing here with the Bitcoin ATM is
trying to provide liquidity in the
market traditionally the way people buy
into and sell their Bitcoin is through
websites like local bitcoins and they
have to meet up with people they charge
really high prices for doing it we don't
charge those prices we make it easily
accessible you know wherever they're
located you can go to them at any time
and buy and sell your Bitcoin
so who would ever want to use this thing
according to Bitcoin users and business
owners who are putting the machines in
bars and coffee shops it's actually a
lot of people a little over two weeks
now we've had over 400 transactions
almost 500 transactions something like
that I just cashed my Bitcoin out cuz I
have to pay some bills you know I got
rent and other things you can't pay rent
as easily with Bitcoin as you can with
cash I think as a means of making
payment in a kind of a secure and quick
way it's a fantastic idea
just let show the current iteration of
Bitcoin is the one that will be stable
over the long term this ATM is made by
robocoin a company based in Las Vegas
and it has some serious security
measures to use it you have to give it
your cell phone number pin and
government-issued ID let it take your
picture and even scan the veins in your
palm now I have to put my palm in even
if you guys know my cell phone number
and my pin it doesn't really affect it
as you need my palm in order to conduct
the transaction so at this point I'll
use my wallet this is my online wallet
I'll scan it here in the QR code reader
there's my address it's going to send it
to that address right now it's six
hundred and sixty nine dollars and
ninety cents for one Bitcoin I want to
send ten dollars I'm going to insert it
here and I just hit finish
so it's gonna print a receipt this is my
proof of purchase here I got a text
message saying that my Bitcoin is on the
way I feel very secure using this
machine I don't feel like there is gonna
be any backlash from the government or
anything I'm gonna use the receipt to
help pay and organize my taxes and stuff
it's a little bit complicated the way it
works but there's a lot of people out
there that are helping with the tax
portion of how to deal with your money
that you made in Bitcoin so I'm not
really scared that they're gonna come
after me and like confiscate my Bitcoin
in the future I don't think that's gonna
be possible like anything in its early
stages there's going to be teething
problems I mean it's it's very
unregulated at the moment so Mongkok
depending on who you read wasn't
particularly well-run I think what
you're gonna see is an early stage
fallout of probably quite a lot of
businesses coming into it going out of
it and then over time that will balance
out and stabilize as as people become a
little bit more responsible with how
they manage Bitcoin effectively the ATM
is the easiest way to trade Bitcoin for
cash on the spot and advocates believe
the machines will help bring the
currency to the masses therefore
disrupting the government financial
complex still it took five minutes to
register an account in order to buy the
virtual currency and around 15 minutes
to get a transaction confirmed and
cashed out it's a little disappointing
when contrasted with the hyper optimism
in the Bitcoin community and most of the
people who stopped by just wanted to
gawk not buy I like the technology the
technology whether Bitcoin stays or goes
that technology is here to stay it's an
excellent technology
is the ability to send money from here
to any part of the world instantaneously
and at minimal fees to no fees at all
depending on how you send it we need to
do this like we have to disrupt finance
in the same way we've disrupted all
other industries the Internet in the way
and sort of spreading kind of
responsibility for an entire industry
and crowd sourcing an industry has to
happen in finance the same way it's
happened in other industries as well and
it will happen I think the Bitcoin is
the first step to doing that I don't see
why a financial payment system should be
managed
completely centrally there's no reason
why that shouldn't be spread over a
whole lot of different users I just
think that right now I'm not sure I'd
want to put my money into Bitcoin at
this stage in my mind the success is
defined by basically the number of uses
of Bitcoin if you can use it to do more
and more things that will be its success
so now that I can cash out easily that's
success if I can go to like say a taco
truck in Austin and buy a taco with
Bitcoin and they accept Bitcoin that is
success there are now at least four
Bitcoin ATMs in Austin one in
Albuquerque one in Boston one coming in
Seattle they're also in Calgary London
South Korea and other places around the
world
some people believe they'll become as
common as cash ATMs in under five years
the entrepreneurs buying them sure hope
so considering the Machine cost twenty
five thousand dollars just for the
hardware but hey that's only what like
40 bitcoins</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
