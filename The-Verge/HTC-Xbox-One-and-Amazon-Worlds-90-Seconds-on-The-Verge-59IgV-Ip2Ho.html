adrianne jeffries and today is but an
echo of yesterday's tomorrow this is 90
seconds on the verge things aren't
looking good for HTC last week the
struggling smartphone manufacturer lost
its chief product officer it's just the
latest high-level departure in recent
months the problems aren't just with
personnel either sources tell us that
the HTC first has failed to live up to
expectations standout devices like the
HTC One have also faced inventory
problems issues some say could have been
avoided if CEO Peter Chou had listened
to early warnings Microsoft introduced
the Xbox one yesterday but some
important details remain unclear
Microsoft has said that the console will
not require an always-on internet
connection but the company's Phil
Harrison told kotaku that it will need
to ping Microsoft servers once a day
Redmond has since walked his statement
back the other issue is how the console
will let users share games owners can
install and play their games at a
friend's house but they'll need to log
on to their own xbox profile to get
things working anything else will cost
you perhaps we'll hear some concrete
details at next month's III and finally
you can turn that Gossip Girl fanfic
habit into cold hard cash amazon is
announced kindle worlds it's a
storefront specializing an officially
licensed fan fiction so far amazon has
obtained licenses for three different
Warner Brothers TV shows including
Gossip Girl and the vampire diaries more

for full length works and in twenty
percent commission for shorter works
