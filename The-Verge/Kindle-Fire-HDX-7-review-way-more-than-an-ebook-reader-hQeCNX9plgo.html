the Amazon Kindle Fire HDX this is the
7-inch model which cost two hundred and
twenty nine dollars there's also an 8.9
inch version that starts at three
hundred and seventy nine dollars this is
the model that competes with the Nexus 7
in the iPad Mini and to do that Amazon's
tweaked its formula a little bit more
than ever Amazon's try to turn its
tablets into more than just shopping
malls basically screens on which you
purchase Amazon content with the Fire
HDX Amazon's trying to build a tablet
that can compete with the best of them
like basically every other tablet out
there the HDX is a thin black plastic
slab of a device it's a little more
striking than the iPad Mini or the Nexus
7 though the matte back is all angles
and speaker grilles with a pretty steep
taper towards the back it's not
uncomfortable but it doesn't feel quite
as perfectly machined as some of the
other great 7-inch tablets it's a little
thicker than the Nexus 7 and
imperceptibly heavier but it does feel
really different in your hands I don't
hate the look but I do hate the button
placement there are awkwardly recessed
power and volume buttons on the edges
which are just impossible to find
they're indistinguishable from one
another so when you try to turn up the
volume odds are good you're going to
turn off your tablet and since the
tablet works fine in any orientation
it's constantly impossible to figure out
where the buttons are in the first place
the biggest upgrade by far here is the
new display a 7-inch 1920 by 1200 screen
that looks just like the Nexus 7 which
is to say of course it looks fantastic
bright with great viewing angles and
great color reproduction amazon claims
it's not as reflective as some other
tablets but I don't buy that it's still
really reflective the speakers sound
great too even though they're on the
back pointing away from you I really
don't like the origami cover which is
incredibly confusing and lost most of
its magnetism after about three days
which made it basically useless luckily
you don't have to buy it
honestly the hardware here isn't that
important it's fine it's good enough
it's totally usable in one hand and in
either portrait or landscape as always
with Amazon tablets the HDX is all about
the software the Kindle Fire HDX ships
with a new version of Amazon's fork of
Android called fire OS 3.0 it comes with
a lot of really important upgrades from
more enterprise friendly features two
huge upgrades for some of the core apps
for one thing you don't have to cycle
through all your apps and books in a
clumsy carousel anymore there's finally
just a grid view for all your apps the
new email client works impressively well
almost like a faux Gmail app the
calendar and document editing suite are
likewise much improved that by itself
makes the Kindle Fire HDX a lot more
appealing because it's now something you
can use instead of a computer it used to
be just a secondary
for watching movies and buying stuff of
course watching movies and buying stuff
is still the whole goal of the Kindle
Fire HDX and it's still just
terrifyingly easy to buy a movie from
Amazon's huge library or even watch it
for free if you're a Prime member you
can also now download Prime videos and
watch them offline which is huge for me
the experience of reading and watching
movies is fantastic and it's constantly
being upgraded by Amazon to xray is now
more powerful than ever it'll show you
song lyrics the music that's playing in
a movie and everyone who's in the scene
all the characters in a book and so much
more
Amazon's upgraded some of its magazines
to much more optimized iPad like
experiences and they look really great
there's also still a huge Music Store
still more books than you could read in
a hundred lifetimes and a one-way click
to buy diapers it's still an Amazon
catalog yes but the HDX is a much better
overall tablet than ever except for one
crippling thing you can't download a lot
of the best Android apps since Amazon
forked Android and took it in a new
direction there's no access to the Play
Store or Google's other core services
Amazon's app store is growing slowly but
it's a long way from where it needs to
be there's no candy crush no Netflix and
only knockoff versions of about half the
games I looked for even the apps that do
exist seem to be outdated and
unoptimized everything you can do runs
faster and smoother than ever thanks to
a 2.2 gigahertz Snapdragon 800 processor
2 gigs of RAM and an Adreno 330 GPU
that's all pretty high-end and it's all
pretty fast apps load and resume
instantly from the multitasking menu
games play really well movies never seem
to stutter and it does all this while
getting really solid battery life more
than two days of heavy use and more like
4 or 5 in most cases it's not quite
perfect there are definitely some odd
laggy moments in fire OS but the Kindles
used to be slow they're not anymore
honestly though half the fun is when
things break on the HDX that's when you
get to hit the Help button on the home
screen and activate Mayday Amazon's
insanely ambitious new support system
you tap the button then hit connect and
within 15 seconds you're connected to an
actual human whose face you see on your
device they can't see you but they can
see everything on your HDX and more
importantly they can control the tablet
so I had an install for an app I was
trying to download the LinkedIn app and
it didn't download and I'm just trying
to figure out why that didn't work I got
yeah like I can take a look at it sure
don't we yeah yeah it it like I have the
icon on here but it's showing up with a
exclamation point on it down at the
bottom every one I use it's very
friendly and helpful came on quickly and
could either show me how to do something
or just do it for me
I'm still not convinced this can scale
as quickly as it might have to in part
because using Mayday is just really fun
and I did it basically for no reason a
few times but it's a really incredible
system so all of this comes for $229 and
it's a fantastic deal if you're already
invested in the Amazon ecosystem if you
have a big watch list of Prime videos
Kindle books everywhere magazine
subscriptions a music library everything
through Amazon you should buy the HDX
it's not only a fantastic vessel for
Amazon stuff it's just a really good
tablet but if you're not completely
wired into Amazon services you're going
to find too much of what you want on
Android is missing from the HDX
and when the Nexus 7 offers an equally
great display and the full power of
Google and Android for the same $229
it's hard to recommend the HDX to
everyone Google or Amazon you pick and
choose wisely</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
