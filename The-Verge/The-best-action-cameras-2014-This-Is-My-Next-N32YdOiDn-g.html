stunts they make anything you do look
cool you've probably seen people waving
a selfie stick around while riding a
bike or strapping a camera to their
chest for the sporting event or maybe
they're just getting the dogs view of
things sure a lot can be done with your
camera's phone these days thanks to
burst shooting modes and slow-motion
options but having a camera that's more
durable and more powerful to make all
the difference in those amazing moments
you don't want to race good action
camera should be able to capture
high-quality footage have a great
ecosystem of accessories and mounts it
should also be able to offer tons of
functionality that's easy to tweet
should also be able to take a hit or two
or three while being small and light
enough to fit wherever you want to
capture the action from the best action
camera you can buy right now is also the
most obvious to gopro hero4 black
edition the price tag is steep but
there's no end to what you can do with
this camera it's small light and durable
and every setting can be tweaked to fit
the needs of whatever you're filming and
in any mode it takes stunning video
whether you're shooting at 720p or 4k
the GoPros dynamic range keeps this guy
from looking blown out while not under
exposing the subject you're focused on
it handles low-light situations really
well - the GoPros biggest advantage is
with the accessories GoPro makes every
mount strap and suction cup you could
want and if they somehow don't have what
you're looking for there's a number of
third-party accessory makers who have
been supporting GoPros for years you can
shoot with the GoPro in more places than
any other camera and ultimately that's
what matters most
GoPro still is in the perfect action
camera and needs a better menu system
and longer battery life but ultimately
it's about the shots you get in the
footage you capture and GoPro can't be
beaten there but the Black Edition is
expensive so if you don't want to spend
so much there are a few great options
for a little bit less the first of which
is the gopro hero4 silver edition you
trade the ability to shoot in the
highest resolutions and frame rates that
the Black Edition allows but you gain a
touchscreen that actually makes
navigating GoPros clumsy menu system
easier it works just as nicely with
everything in the GoPro ecosystem to
from the mounts to the phone at Sony
actually has the most worthy competitors
to build bro on the market right now the
best of which is the action cam mini
which is great footage and is
inexpensive but it doesn't have the same
ecosystem of accessories and mounts that
GoPro has sony also has the action cam
AS 100 B but it's bigger more expensive
and only offers better battery life same
goes for the ion air pro 3 which is only
a little bit cheaper than the hero4
silver baby sees addiction has an
onboard screen for framing up shots and
navigating menus but the companion app
is pretty bad and the camera really just
can't do that much if you need great
battery life Garmin's verbally is a
solid choice it also collects neat data
like GPS and heart rate but the footage
just doesn't look great which is kind of
a deal-breaker action cameras aren't
just for thrill-seekers anymore people
use them for selfies strap them on their
dogs and even musicians have fun a good
thing is this means that there are a lot
of options out there right now the GoPro
is still the king</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
