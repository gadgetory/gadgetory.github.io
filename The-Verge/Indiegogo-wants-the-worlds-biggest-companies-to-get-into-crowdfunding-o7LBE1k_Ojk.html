we're here at our booth on the CES show
floor i'm here with slava rubin CEO
indiegogo thanks for coming down to us
yeah thanks for having me last few years
CES has been inundated with crowdfunding
or crowd funded projects a lot of
consumer like technology but IndieGoGo
doesn't actually make any of these
products they just help get them funded
so what brings you out here this week
yeah you know became actually three
years ago now the first time and I think
we could count the IndieGoGo funded
projects at that time on like one or two
hands and now at IndieGoGo at CES 20
2016 we actually have a hundred and ten
companies that are funded on indigo
which is super exciting and so we just
you know look to support all of them and
also there's a lot of inbound in terms
of people that are interested to learn
more the other thing is we're super
excited we're making announcement this
week at CES which is we're launching our
enterprise crowdfunding offering which
is we've always been working with
smaller players entrepreneurs
individuals but now the fortune 1000 the
big companies GE anheuser-busch Harmon
are all coming to indy gogo to really do
RND market validation to bring these
amazing new products out to the market
right and so crowdfunding has always
seemed like this this thing for scrappy
smaller startups who want to just propel
something to the masses and get it out
there and help them you know make
thousands of thousands of units why does
this now make sense for a company like
GE I mean what do they get out of
crowdfunding that they can't just do
through the normals their normal
channels absolutely so IndieGoGo when we
created it it's an open platform where
anybody can raise money perhaps see any
idea so we have generosity com for the
personal fundraising we also have lots
of films and creative and theater and
artists but definitely gadgets and
hardware and tech is a hotbed of what's
happening on IndieGoGo like you
mentioned a lot of that is these smaller
earlier stage entrepreneurs but really
what it's about is just an open space a
place to experiment to engage with your
audience to use social to get feedback
to actually understand how is your idea
or product resonating with the market
what are some of the other products you
expect large corporations will you know
take to a crowdfunding platform yeah
it's going to vary so has boro used us
so they're gay toy and gaming company to
be able to find different
innovators to come up with new games so
they actually had a challenge and they
were able to then fund one of the five
games that were the top five games also
you have Harmon was coming out they
announced yesterday they'll be coming
out a probably within a month with new
headphones that will have noise specific
cancellation qualities there is no
concern within IndieGoGo that this might
kind of quash out the little guys or I
give them give the larger companies an
unfair advantage I mean if IndieGoGo is
an crowdfunding was designed for you
know the small player if they have to
compete with maybe a similar product
with a company like you know G or Hasbro
does that create any kind of concern
over what's fair and what's not fair
it's the opposite actually so it's an
open platform where anybody can use it
no matter what so we've already had
larger companies using it for the last
couple years but what actually is
happening is the larger companies are
actually looking for the new hot
entrepreneur on IndieGoGo so they're
actually collaborating with shock top
they actually want to stop the drought
so they have their campaign as part of
analyzer bush where they're actually
identified like drop a brick and ava
which are two different entrepreneurs to
be able to have technology to help
stimulate better environmental practices
with water so drop a brick is like I
prac plastic brick you put in your
toilet it disseminates water away so you
have less water per flush this is an
example where the larger companies are
actually working with the entrepreneurs
so it's actually creating a hotbed
together and where else is is
crowdfunding Benna untapped like
wherewhere can crop phone and go for
from here if there are some specific
items to highlight for example like
shift where this is a sneaker that has
epaper as part of its actual material so
it connects to your phone and you can
actually change the look of your sneaker
by color or artistry or whatever it
looks like on your app so you actually
don't need to have different sneakers or
different any changes on the fly or you
have something like both bikes so bolt
is a equivalent to a motorbike but it's
actually an electric bike so it can
drive up to 40 miles an hour has the
thrill of a motorcycle but has the ease
and the legal requirements of just a
bicycle super cool but there's tons of
other like you said internet a thing
means personal devices but I do think
the next round is gonna be more AI more
robots you have like jebo on IndieGoGo
or buddy you also have chip just came
out yesterday which is a robotic dog for
anybody who doesn't want to actually
clean up the poop or actually look up
for the work you can actually have a
robotic dog that will actually follow
with robotic ball that plays fetch what
sets IndieGoGo apart from you know
competitor like Kickstarter right is you
don't necessarily need a working
prototype it can be an idea I can just
be something small that you have the
ambitions to carry out and you you want
to raise some money and try and do it I
guess what is IndieGoGo doing right now
to make sure that you know a shoe like
the shift where can actually you know
happen down the line so they don't take
in all this money and then they discover
well you know what we can't make an e
ink shape-shifting shoe yeah so one of
the beauties of an open platform is
there's nobody in digo goes that's going
to judge you there's a nobody sees out
there there's enough bankers out there
there's another government constituents
there's another enough high level you
know corporate types and there's enough
other platforms that will judge you I
didn't go go it's totally open where you
get to put up your idea you need to be
transparent about where you're at are
you a idea stage a prototype stage or
your manufacturing are you already
selling and then it's up to the funders
the backers if they want to support you
sounds pretty cool Thanks slava rubin</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
