you're looking at now essentially what
we have is we have the same phone number
on two different iphones i was
interesting about this is this phone
actually has the sim card in it and this
one doesn't even have the sim slot at
all but what we had done is we taking
the stem from this phone slotted it out
put it in this phone and I message as it
turns out actually verified both numbers
is the same so once you take the SIM
card out the phone number actually stays
with it until you put another sim card
or you turn off I message what's
interesting about this as we have heard
on the internet a few times let's go
ahead new message section if I sin from
a separate iphone all three messages
activated any text message and send that
here it actually shows up on both phones
so this is actually that I message book
you've been hearing about so now what's
going on is because both Apple IDs just
go back here because both Apple IDs have
the same phone number attached because
this one had the sim card in and we
never put another sim card every time
you text that number through the IMS to
service you're going to get it now
that's even more fun is that regardless
of which phone i enjoyed you're actually
going to see the entire conversation on
both adult actually all three devices as
hello one and heli 02 well whatever it's
actually a lot of fun with this in fact
we're going to
all right I send this this one gets its
in this listen ah ah all three get it
all right so here's one we can actually
get rid of it essentially just turning I
message off and on with the iphone that
doesn't have a sim card in it so as soon
as I do that send a message to that
number will only go to the phone that
has the sim card now once we've got the
settings let's go back right now it's
trying to verify the number but since
the sim card is no longer in there it's
not going to it's going to be a great
party trick if you're a Snoopy
individual if you're very into learning
all the inner secrets both sending and
receiving of your friends and loved ones
not something i recommend knows I'm
suggest but it could be fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
