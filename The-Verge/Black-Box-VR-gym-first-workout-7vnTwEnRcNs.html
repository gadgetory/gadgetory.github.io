stadium where all these people are
standing around watching me do chest
presses this is wildly unnerving would
you be more or less inclined to exercise
if you were wearing this on your face
we're about to find out this is black
box VR it's a Boise based company that
has designed a VR workout experience the
idea being that if you normally get
bored or you just feel unmotivated at
the gym that transporting yourself into
a hyper competitive virtual world will
make you feel not that way all right
we're ready all right ready yes black
box okay so what I'm gonna do is you're
gonna this is the suiting up here so
this is your left hand so go ahead and
put that out these are hands-free
controllers that you strapped to your
wrist so the app can track your
movements you strap those on you put on
an HTC vive headset which is tethered to
the cable machine and you enter a
virtual stadium that's where your
opponent stands waiting and you're
basically supposed to do more chest
presses than they do okay now you just
can see start doing reps so did you guys
also make this gym equipment yeah so
this is actually a patent-pending
dynamic resistance machine it's
specifically built to work with VR so
the idea there is that there's a dynamic
resistance that can adapt to in-game
elements oh yeah so this is just a
bite-sized piece of actual gameplay in
the full version you'll actually be able
to select which movements you want to do
and the machine will immediately calibre
it's really so machine is adjusting
because it knows my reps yep it's
counting your reps so your I think
probably on 10 or 12 right now there you
go good job so if I and I'm trying to
defeat this person in front of me on the
screen oh good job
oh yeah that's the opponent is that the
opponent okay
can I do as a friend
no it's okay it's haha give it your all
yeah so eventually you'll actually be
able to do this asynchronously with a
friend and you could actually battle
them right now this is just the computer
an AI this basically is measuring your
strength and adapting to it
are you planning on selling this
directly to people like me or are you
gonna sell this to gems so phase one is
we're actually looking at later this
year opening up a our own boutique gym
and so we'll actually have these boxes
inside our own gym we can come in
there'll be a hero trainer that'll walk
you through and make sure everything's
safe and then go through a calibration
phase where everything is perfectly
dialed in for your height for your goals
for your strength for everything so so
you'll be going to a gym that's entirely
VXR exactly and three stations VR
exactly so this pod right here so we're
in about a 10 by 10 space so you imagine
going into a gym and you actually have
you know 10 to 20 of these where you
actually go into your own black box and
you have your private space just like
this it would be literally exactly like
this seems like someone could probably
have the wrong form you know doing a
lunge or a squat or something like that
depending where their knees are if
that's not measured precisely they could
potentially hurt themselves exactly
that's one of the biggest problems and
the good thing is with these space
stations that they can track it's such a
fine fine fidelity that as those sensors
get better we can actually track exact
biomechanics and again course-correct to
make sure that people are dreams
that was a pretty wild experience I
don't think I've ever worked out in VR
before and I think the novelty of it
threw me a little bit at first like I
wasn't really paying attention to the
game aspect of it but that's supposed to
be a big part of this whole black box
experience the company says that they
plan to launch a series of boutique gyms
think like equinoxes Barry's bootcamp
SoulCycle sometime in mid 2018 they
think they're gonna start on the west
coast it sounds like it's kind of gonna
be expensive just to go work out with a
VR headset on but hey we live in the
future I guess the future suspense - so
is this the next level of working out I
just had to say next level tune in next
season TBD</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
