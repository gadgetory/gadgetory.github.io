some of these you know Virgin Galactic
or it will never be you think it has to
be NASA there's a reason for it so I
could I wanted that I mean no private
industry could create this thing I don't
know there's a reason for it it will
never happen that way because going to
Mars has never been with humans has
never been done before the costs are
unknown they're unquantified risks and
its really dangerous this is like the
exact argument against invested in it
right that's right I'll taste this man
here this ago no we're not doing that
exactly that's the whole gonna make a
faster car businesses don't do things we
need to have had all those four factors
together you cannot attract investors
and make a business case for it but a
nation can and the nation says we want
to do this because well in 60s it was
militaristic Lee driven but I want to do
it now without military motives right we
need the military mode well no no we
don't need it we we could have economic
motives is my point it'll also drive the
economy a quite as exciting as a
military mode of that I well this is
right this I don't want to die motive
and the I don't want to die poor motive
right so I'm on the second before part
right yeah now the thing is I don't want
to die port both Democrats and
Republicans can really kind of get
together on that they do agree on yeah
they would so agree on that and so so so
them not for the mean I think our
political landscape is not I don't want
to die poor me the politician it's been
not necessarily like I'm not worried
about other people dying for well sure
but it but this would lift all boats is
what that's what NASA does it's what it
did in the nineteen sixty and you think
just a penny a penny on my mobile NASA's
budget then we can go to monopod your
before penny I mean go to a penny oh
because I'm okay with one fifty cents I
will happily pay I will happily half
your town go all the way up to fifty
cents ah that'd be fine then we could
like you know go to Mars tomorrow really
oh yeah why why don't we just do this
well we want to it's what I'm saying you
can go because it's a great adventure in
any geek set wants to do it because of
that fact but I'm not gonna require the
person on the unemployment line whose
house has been foreclosed to do it for
those reasons but fifty cents is tiny
though it's half the government budget
and we end plus we're really also in the
business of fighting wars
so a whole lot of money goes to that to
space laser that's what we need space we
got sideways face ladies we got that all
real but like a millet or directed
energy weapon is it is it does it exist
he's it on the moon do you know you know
don't you you can tell us no one is no
one's watching this don't worry trust me
okay there there things called directed
energy weapons where rather than send a
projectile which who's then kinetic
energy would destroy a target you find
another way to send energy it's all
about moving energy from here to there
that's what war is all about it's not
about anything else I have energy here
and I want to kill somebody or break
something so you take the energy that
was here and put it there and it
accomplishes one of those two facts
that's what that is the net is more in
it that's the geek geek landscape of
what war is all about and now it tell us
about the energy weapons you still want
to know about the end of July yes okay
so no no don't tell me about the
interview I've ever I'm happy to move on
never hearing about the energy web know
so you do you get an understanding of
the craft that you want to disarm or
disable or destroy and then you being
the laser or some microwave focused
energy it could be a microwave laser we
call those masers microwave
amplification what kind of lazy laser
but well not if you're in the beam you
wouldn't think that right so what do
these exist like so so there are I'm
feeling so you aim it to a sensitive
part not much they do they get you don't
have to blow up the satellite now you
have debris in space that you might run
into gotta shoot out what you don't want
to so you just disable it and now it's
it's it's dead on it's so the weapons
exist they've been deployed are they in
space okay take that as a yes and so
here's the thing I've been very
practical in this book the whole first
chapter is called space politics and it
got excerpted for Foreign Affairs
magazine and I got interviewed by like
the business you know Forbes and so
people are sirs crossover people are
beginning to recognize the meaning and
value of what that investment represents
to our security to our economy to all
these things that people used to think o
space is just for the geeks at
just for their entertainment and it's
got nothing to do with us because we got
real problems down here on earth and
then you so how much are we spending
here on earth 50 times what we're now
spending on NASA we are spending money
on problems here on earth so don't go to
NASA say I need that money to top off my
50 times more money so that I can solve
these problems that's it No or better
yet have them build better space lasers
to solve some of this problem like all
right okay so I actually want to ask you
about some controversial not not that
we're not in controversial territory but
so you're largely credited with killing
Pluto as a as a plan I was an accessory
I mean I all right well well okay so but
I drove the getaway car but I didn't
commit the crime well so there's a
there's a there's a book written by a
guy named Mike Brown it's a good friend
caught how I killed Pluto and why it had
it coming mhm is there a beef in this in
the science community about who was
responsible for the death of Pluto I
mean I got blamed for killing Pluto but
I didn't kill Bluto but he took the
credit he so therefore right so he not
only killed Pluto he admitted it so so
get off my back right you're right how I
got these guys you got the gun The
Smoking Gun and the person who pulled
the trigger and all I did was drive the
getaway car so it in the year 2000 we
rebuilt the Hayden Planetarium into a
whole facility and we said well we want
a future proof it what is the trend line
what are the trend lines in scientific
research so that when we cut metal it'll
have some shelf life for it without
having to redo it every six months we
notice that more icy bodies were being
discovered in the outer solar system who
look more like Pluto that either Pluto
or they look like any other planet
that's an awesome sentence by the way
you follow that sentence me look so so
what anytime that happens in science you
say there's a category just waiting to
be named a new a new bin of identity
just asking for it and so Pluto and
these other icy bodies are part of the
Kuiper belt no comments Kuiper was a guy
who predicted that this belt of frozen
objects would exist beyond Neptune sure
enough there they are chorus and Pluto
was the first among them and we we just
grandfathered it in his planet but it's
really puny it is it is much smaller
than our Moon half of its volume is high
small I imagine Pluto's being like you
know could fit like somewhere on the
stage right over there how small is
Pluto okay I'll tell you if if Neptune
that's that don't use Neptune go with
like a basketball compared to a
basketball no no that's it you don't
know where I'm gonna land that's true so
how would you know not tell me not to go
lodges instant if it's a reference point
I'm just saying okay so if Neptune were
analogized with a chevy impala in mass
yeah of course so now how big is Pluto
compared to that so this Chevy pal
parked at curbside Pluto would be not
like a mini cooper know it would be a
matchbox car sitting on the curb all
right but compared to the moon the moon
the moon is I forgot the exact number
it's like eight times the mass of Pluto
our moon where can we put Pluto in the
world we put it down somewhere Pluto
would fit between like here and and
Chicago okay so you know that big did I
just say that I don't by the way I don't
even have size issues with ike mention
it but I don't have size issues all
right I'll tell you what it should never
invoke size if you're dissing Pluto
because Jupiter is more bigger compared
to earth than earth is compared to Pluto
so if you're sitting on earth poking fun
at how small Pluto is the Jupiter ians
if they were in charge would say the
solar system has four planets and
everything else is debris debris
including earth and its puny earthlings
crawling on its specs surface do you do
you think there's a movement amongst the
Jew batarians that that do you feel like
we've got pressure from the Jupiter I
think we don't stand a chance jupiter
has a storm a big red
store is called and it's a spot and we
call it Jupiter's red spot because in my
field we call it like we see it unlike
the geologist or the biologist stupid
geology or the chemist that go out of
their way to make words this long so you
have no idea what they're talking about
all right with us it's all one syllable
Big Bang black hole red giant white door
there's a Red Spot on Jupiter it's
called Jupiter's red spot there are
spots on the Sun we call them sunspots
okay there's official lexicon because
you know archive that's enough that's a
Blair smokescreen of vocabulary to
distance you from who it is you're
trying to communicate all of its
grandeur to so there's a Red Spot on
Jupiter 2 storm it's at least 300 years
olds arranging store the storm is bigger
than Earth Oh doesn't mean man he added
good enough why we leave it here look
why were you put on the show when we
gonna talk tech getting here man I'm
goes out to gadget air your I'm just
just about to get there and now you've
ruined it are you happy all right listen
backstage we were talking and I was like
you know got all these universe
questions where's the universe and when
are we gonna die is the Sun get a blow
up they know whatever dr. Tyson was not
impressed by my questions he he was like
when we get we got to talk about gadgets
are we talking about gadgets gadgets
yeah I was blown away by and I asked
people for questions on Twitter and they
were like asking what kind of phone to
use it so we're gonna talk gadgets now
we're gonna get deep and I got news for
you this is my wheelhouse this is
you got Pluto you have the universe I
have iPads okay not quite as cool but
you know pretty cool all right so look
what kind of phone do you use I it's
it's a iphone which generation it's the
one behind I've never I don't the iphone
I don't go I think you mean the iphone 4
yes yes now what can I tell you how I
how I first bought an iphone yeah that's
not tell you hi hello it's all right
some years ago back when the year the
iphone first came out 2007 not what that
was so I that year I had semi season
tickets to the Yankees I'm born and
raised in the Bronx so I'm a legitimate
Yankee fan that's just my hometown team
all right so I'm there the iphone had
been out for like a month and would have
been in july i think i would get them on
one of these will find out so so you
know when you have season tickets you
know the other people in the area in the
sections right so i'm there it's like a
wednesday afternoon game and a couple
comes in kind of young ish if i were to
sort of stereotype they might say fresh
out of college first internship in New
York summer intern right so maybe early
20s a couple they come in and sit to my
left she sits a heterosexual couple she
sits to my left he sits to her left this
is important the I okay go ahead
sometimes you only learn that it's
important at the end okay rather than at
the otter named okay so the woman is
especially attractive like on a on a
scale it's just kind of off scale okay
yeah it's not on a scale it's off the
scale all right beyond 10 yeah left so
so it's still on okay I really but no
11 it's not no it's not on the sky off
the scale yeah it's off the scale so he
is kind of soompi okay just that doubt
you would not have paired them but love
knows no battle so I a lot so it's fine
so then looking around like this and
this is my town it's mike stadium and
they clearly they never been i said uh
have you been the Yankee Stadium before
there's my first time ever at any
sporting event she replied so I said oh
ok well that's Babe Ruth's corner and
that's where they and I'm doing all this
ok while I'm saying this it's like this
first and a half inning she's on the
jumbotron so the left-field camera found
her but Joseph it's not just my as
because who ends up on the jumbotron
really beautiful people and crazy people
end up on the jumbotron right right
people like yeah their underwear on
their head and stuff like that ok so it
wasn't just my assessment the left-field
camera two hundred yards away fountain
ok and put her up on the jumbo so she
thinks everybody's turn is a that's
because beautiful people don't really
know what the world actually is like
that right now ok so stuff so what so he
pulls out his iphone and so I look
because I'm thinking about the iphone
but I wouldn't date it they did not
supply to be by Apple alone so I leaned
to him and I say how do you like your
iphone she answers she answers it's his
new girlfriend and I said whoa so that
was a Wednesday by monday I had
my iphone if he's looking at iphone and
not her and she's on the jumbotron
that's got to be an awesome device okay
so so to this day to this day if I think
of this all the time if I have the
opportunity to for the time machine that
i worked with stewie to help build we go
back if I'm gonna meet Isaac Newton I
want to bring one thing back it's gonna
be the iphone really oh yeah which
generation you gotta take the four
Eskimos of that he can beat serious yeah
I mean exactly yeah so Taylor by the way
up by the weight also see now so don't
mean this I'll be really angry ok so
it's wrong it's done you know how was
the iphone has the correct time unlike
the android based phones what what do
you mean you don't know this well I've
been using my phone to tell time and
it's an android device ever so you don't
know explain why I'm always late that's
great you'd be 15 seconds late every
time why well but the bulk of the
androids get their time directly from
GPS satellites and GPS satellites the
system was defined the timekeeping basis
for the GPS satellites was defined up to
nineteen eighty-two and since 1982 15
leap seconds have been added to civil
time and those leap seconds are not
included in the Android timekeeping
because they're getting the time
directly from GPS whereas the iphone
compensates for this puts the 15 seconds
back in and has therefore the correct
time as a result most android phones are
exactly 15 minutes too fast but 15
seconds did I say minutes all this yes
seconds to 15 seconds too fast as
interested I like having if I want to
have a device that's awesome it's going
to have the correct time that's your
guys here wow you know
check it out if you have any any couples
here that have iphone android pairings
dude dude check it out pass the time has
to be sad should be set automatically
though we don't not if you said it
yourself has to be set automatically
yeah no 15 seconds in the grand scheme
of things not really that big of a deal
all right but still there's the
knowledge that it's wrong which is upset
it is that is somewhat upsetting by the
way by the way that calls to mind the
distinction between precision and
accuracy those two words have distinct
and different meanings and science
precision is how many decimal places can
you represent in your in your
measurement okay so let's go to Times
Square and there's a clock that keeps
time to a thousandth of a second so it's
like running continuously all right you
just a blur you said well that's real
yeah that's that's a high-precision
clock what good is it if it's 15 seconds
fast it's completely pointless so it's
high precision but low accuracy us you
don't care about this 15 seconds and
then so your girl if your lady here
about the painting sec now I i ah you've
opened my mind here you've I you've
brought you this right I know but
derived from the fact that the
gravitational pull of the moon is
tugging on our oceans sloshing them back
and forth on the continental shelves
slowing down Earth's rotation in the
process and the response function has
the moon spiral away from us several
inches per year we back to talk about
the universe because I thought we were
talking about gadgets at all the next
doll connection all right what's your
what's your how many monitors you have
it on you and your's okay so here so I
don't want to make you cry but I do not
even own an iPad you want a computer
though I don't know that iPad because I
carry my 70 17 inch with me wherever I
got knock the proud back prayer all are
you all mad I've been I've been max
since perhaps before you were born yes
possible I mean I think I think that's I
think you just said something really
flattering to me that I'm super young
we're engaged since are actually the
woman who would become my wife I had a
Mac 128 and then we upgraded that to the
equivalent of the mac plus so you swap
out the memory snippet snippet resistor
a romantic though so which he has a PhD
in mathematical physics so that was
working and so so so and I've been
macking ever since and so yeah I mean go
figure so here's the thing i got the
iphone it's this big if i want to see
video I'll go to my 17 inch I don't need
to go through some intermediate state
and yes the 78 weighs seven pounds but
it's not seven pounds it's my computer
you know I want to someone Gawker am i
what no he ain't heavy he's my brother
it's not it's not seven pounds it's my
computer it's just it is it is of me
extension yes yes it is it's went when I
way to be a little uncomfortable when
when this is how I knew why I asked
someone what kind of computer they had
said well you know I don't remember as
it must not be a Mac cuz you would so
know it if it was a man first of all
second second uh it's it's I found that
pc people when they use their computer
it's like as a tool to enhance their
work or whatever where's the mac it's
not a tool it just is me it's part of me
by the way so not you not whatever
together Apple about to be clear I think
about being together with it your when
I'm not together like I miss it now you
know I I
do you need to go back yet listen I I
wish we could keep talking because i
feel like i could spend all night having
this conversation we have not even i
even there's so many questions I want to
ask you will you come back on the show
because we don't have enough time to ask
all of them right now oh yeah I think so
will you promise to come back I can do
that okay we got to wrap up everybody
stick around the other the other video
here
hey keep it going here we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
