phone by Google it is a phone
manufactured by Google designed by
Google
technically HTC made it but this is the
Google phone through and through and you
can tell by the Google logo on the back
this is the really blue version it is
the 5 inch version and you can see it
has this big glass shape which I got to
admit picks up fingerprints that's where
the fingerprint sensor is camera and so
on the body is like really nice it feels
really well put together pretty well
refined and you know their flex or
whatever the screen is nice it's got
nice curve on the glass here but of
course the main deal is that the
software here is Google's or came in on
Android so you can see we have a custom
launcher here with circular icons but
what you really want to look at is the
assistance so I can launch it with a
long press show me pictures of cats a
little conversational interface it shows
me pictures of personal photos show me
pictures of hairless cats
they're got that pretty well how about
Siamese cats and to figured out I would
still wanted to look at pictures because
why would you want it
how about cats with hats I mean that is
what you want from a personal assistant
right there the other thing that you
should know about this thing is Google
is talking really big game about the
camera it's a 12 megapixel camera on the
back and it doesn't have a camera buff
and Google says it's got the highest DxO
mark camera score ever given to a
smartphone and you can see here it is
really really really really fast yeah
and when you look at the photos on this
nice screen it is in fact really really
fast photos here turned up pretty well
obviously we're going to need to give
the photos a lot more testing to say
others custom live wallpapers if you
want to use like live wallpapers from
people earth or whatnot and of course
there are as I traditionally as usually
last thing I'll tell you is that in the
settings I will launch here there is
your standard settings and there's a
support tab and you can get phone chat
or you know phone or chat support from a
representative and you can even share
your strings of things so they can see
what it is that you need and one last
trick slide down the fingerprint sensor
on the back yep and it brings down at
the notification shade
which is pretty mean so that is Google
pixel is available for pre-order today
it is going to be in stores I believe in
October 20th and this version it starts
at 6:40 najin and it goes on up so
Google is really intending to compete at
the premium level for much more videos
