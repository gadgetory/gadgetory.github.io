for a few years now, and
every time I make a video,
no matter what the subject is,
people always ask me
the exact same question.
What's that watch you're wearing?
It's different every time.
This time it's a Fossil Q hybrid
something or other, I don't know.
But I like using Android phones,
and I like wearing smartwatches,
but when you use an Android phone,
and you want to wear a smartwatch,
your choices are actually kinda grim.
There's so many of 'em, but none of 'em
are really that good.
So I'm trying to figure out what to do
about that situation.
Now, maybe the first
question shouldn't be,
which smartwatch should I get
if I use an Android phone?
The first question should probably be,
do I need a smartwatch at all?
And yeah, that's a totally fair question.
For a lot of people, it's about fitness.
It's about tracking your steps,
and tracking your
exercise, but I don't know,
that's not me, I care about steps,
but I don't work out
enough, and I don't need
a smartwatch for that.
For me, it's about notifications,
and specifically, it's about treating them
as ambient information
instead of something
that's constantly pestering me.
I really like wearing a smartwatch
because when my wrist
buzzes or my phone buzzes,
I can just glance down
at my watch, see if it's
something I care about or not,
and move on with my day.
I try to have the same relationship
with all the information
streaming into my phone,
that I do with just a clock.
I can look at it when
I need the information
and ignore it when I don't.
So, if you're an Android
user and you want to have
that same relationship with notifications
that I do, what do you do?
So the obvious answer
should be if you have
an Android phone, you should
get an Android smartwatch.
Android Wear.
Except it's not called
Android Wear anymore,
it's called Wear OS, 'cause
Google wants everybody
to know that it also works with an iPhone.
But, it really works better with Android.
Anyway, the problem with
Wear OS is Google hasn't
done right by its users
with this platform.
There's a bunch of problems actually.
So the first one, Ron Amadeo wrote a
really good article a couple of month ago
over at Ars Technica,
pointing out that the
vast majority of Wear OS watches use this
ancient Qualcomm processor, the 2100,
that hasn't been updated in two years,
and there's really nothing on the horizon.
And what that means is if you go out
and just buy an Android Wear watch,
it's probably going to be too slow,
it's probably not going to
have great battery life,
you're probably going to
have not a great experience.
On top of that, if you just go out and buy
an Android Wear watch,
you're probably going
to buy it from the people that
are making them these days,
which are Google's fashion partners,
like Fossil, or Kate
Spade, or Michael Kors,
or whatever.
And so you're paying a premium
for this old technology.
But even if you get past all of that,
the basic experience of
using a Wear OS watch,
doesn't hold up this year.
They're kinda slow, the
third-party apps are
not that great, if you
can find them at all,
and digging through the piles and piles
of watch faces to find the one good one
that you like just takes forever.
It's really just a huge
problem all around,
and I've just been waiting
for Google to fix it.
What I would like to do is tell you
that I've used all of the
available smartwatches
that work with Android and I've picked the
best one for most people.
And I've used a bunch of
'em, but I can't give you
the best one for most
people because I kind
of don't think there is one.
Instead, the best thing
I can offer you is this
decision tree.
And your first decision
is, do you want a screen
on your smartwatch or not?
If you do, you've got two branches.
You've got Wear OS, which
we've just talked about,
and we've got a couple
of third-party options
that I like.
If you don't care about a screen,
but you still want a smartwatch,
there's another branch
over here called hybrid.
And so I wanna go through these
different options with you.
Okay, so you want a screen.
We've already gone over Wear OS.
It's, it's fine.
But if that doesn't appeal to you,
there is a brand new smartwatch
that just hit the scene.
It's the Fitbit Versa.
And I don't love it.
As a fitness watch, it's pretty solid.
It fits into Fitbit's whole ecosystem,
but I think it looks pretty terrible.
The watch face options are even worse.
The third-party app
support is non-existent.
Battery life is great though.
But as a general smartwatch,
I don't think it's good.
A better option is the Samsung Gear line.
This is the Gear Sport.
And I like it a lot actually.
On the watch itself, it's
got this rotating bezel
so you can jam through your
notifications really quickly.
There's not great third-party app support,
but there's a little bit.
The problem that I have with this is
if you don't use a Samsung phone,
in order to get this thing up and running,
you have to install at
least four different
pieces of software.
The Gear software, the notification thing,
S Health, some other thing.
And you could even get up to six.
And that's just a lot of
Samsung crap on my phone,
and I don't love it.
So, the watch is fine.
I think it's actually pretty good.
It does most of the things right
that Android Wear gets wrong, it's just,
it's a lot of Samsung.
Now the last branch in the decision tree
is this hybrid watch.
And so, here's one that I just got.
It's a Skagen, again.
And this is this Fossil I've been wearing.
They're basically the same watch.
And the thing that's
interesting about this is
you don't get to see the content
of your notification, but it
can still count your steps,
and it can still show you a
little bit of information.
So when a text message comes in,
I've configured this thing to have the
minute hand point to the three.
Or when it's a calendar
appointment it points to the nine.
Or whatever, and so when my phone buzzes,
or my wrist vibrates, I can glance down
at my watch and it'll point down to,
I don't know, six, and I know in my head,
that that's a Slack message.
I'll look at it later.
But if it points at 12, it's a call,
and I should pull my phone out right now.
The other reason I really
like hybrid smartwatches is
you don't have to charge
the damn things every day.
A battery in this thing could last
anywhere from three to six months
depending on how many
notifications you get.
It's the watch I've been
wearing the most lately.
So that's the decision
tree for smartwatches
for Android users, as far as I see it.
The place where I've landed
is I've mostly been using
a hybrid smartwatch, but I don't know,
I kinda want to go back to Wear OS.
Which seems like a really bad choice,
but I really like having
the weather on my wrist,
and I really like seeing my
next calendar appointment.
And to do that, you need a screen.
But even though it might
be the right choice for me,
I don't think I can
recommend a Wear OS watch
to really, anybody else.
There's the fact that the
processor is really old.
But more to the point, these
watches aren't that cheap.
Because Google partnered with
all these fashion brands,
it means that you're having
to pay fashion brand prices.
You're paying for the
design and the brand name.
And that extra money just
doesn't seem worth it to me
for a platform that I don't
know where it's going.
It's great that there are so many choices
of different watch styles
and different kinds of
watch bands and all the
other stuff that you can get
with Android Wear, but
if none of those choices
are a home run, then what's the point
of having all that choice?
I really hope that this
year, Google can find a way
to give better options to Android users
when it comes to smartwatches
because looking around,
it's way past time.
Hi, everybody.
Thank you so much for watching.
And if you've gotten this far,
maybe jump down to the comments
and let me know what is
the most important thing
for you in a smartwatch.
For me it was, I don't know, battery life
for hybrids, maybe it's
something different for you.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
