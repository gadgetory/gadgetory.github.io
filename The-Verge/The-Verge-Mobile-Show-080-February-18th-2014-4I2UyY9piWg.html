to the verge mobile show live from New
York and another city in New York and
also London I'm dieter bohn I'm Chris
Hitler why did I go right after you I
said my cadence is off like Peter said
something that I just jumped right in I
was feeling it I'm sorry Vlad and dan I
totally stole your look look sometimes
you just feel it like you feel a really
good slice of pizza that you can get in
New York don't even start with me i'm
dan seifert by the way and I'm
completely out of wood so obviously a
full blast that is a that is a luxurious
beard you're sporting and its various
and compulsory Vietnam that's right
that's right by legally binding
agreement so if you guys aren't familiar
Crigler started a change.org petition to
prevent Vlad from shaving his beard and
it worked how many signatures did we get
110 110 signatures it the thing to
remember is it only takes a hundred and
ten people to do something meaningless
and trivial on the Internet to make flat
do anything look I can be sent a
petition to make Vlad permanently follow
me on Twitter well I don't think wait
that was what I would call a thousand
I'm sorry that's it that's a real
stretch go right there so Vlad real talk
are you gonna keep the beard people have
spoken well I can't let them down and I
think I think I might have to trim it
because it's like covering my lips now
and it's just getting really terrible
yeah yeah and I mean I'm not a big
professional like you Chris so I'm
completely out of habit of eating with
so much for my face um I wouldn't call
me a beer professional there are people
in our organization who are a beard
professional evan rodgers has been known
to sport a really really lovely beard ah
but you know you know who that's the
best i think in our organization at
least out of our new york office
christian maza one of our video
producers it's like the perfect
beard it's an experience yeah this is a
virgin mobile show where we talk about
verge staff that you may or may not be
familiar with now you should be familiar
with all of them though because they're
all lovely people this is our
octogenarian episode steps number 80 and
we are in the week before Mobile World
Congress and it is sort of the calm
before the storm although there have
been a bunch of leaks and rumors and a
very well sourced reports on what we can
expect out of Samsung and the obvious
thing is the galaxy s5 we're starting to
get dribs and drabs of what to expect
with that I'm hearing 5.2 inch screen
we've already talked about how the
interface should be a little bit chiller
and now there's a rumor that there's
going to be a fingerprint sensor holy
cow no I am apparently it'll be used to
unlock your phone launch apps
authenticate yourself yeah because we
haven't seen that idea before no it's
completely original like apparently at
one point people thought it would be
behind the screen which is insane and
now it's like the rumor is it's going to
be on the home button but it's going to
be a swipe which that worked out really
well for the atrix guys well it works
out really well on what was that the one
max the but the position of the sensor
on the atrix was insane yeah well yeah
well yeah it was pretty insane also it
doubled as the power button which is
completely ridiculous I thought it was
kind of awesome it the theory of it was
awesome but it was hard to press like
the theory literally the theory about
everything with the matrix is awesome
and the execution fell apart in on
almost every front like is that the
first dual core android smartphone it
was had the Lap Kok thing that was
awesome and had the fingerprint scanner
it was like on paper gonna be the most
awesome thing ever and then it wasn't
fuzzy OKO by the way well gee Pete it I
don't think you could buy the LG in the
US yet what it was first one of the
first one of the first by the way I just
want to point out the deed and I
literally look like hostages blank white
back on it's like we're being treated
well uh yeah we hope our government
works
uh what do to secure our freedom I mean
this really does look kind of scared we
need we need a decoration why didn't we
put the camera that way with the cool
poster yeah we have a great eboy poster
we're in a Josh's office right now
actually and he has a beautifully boy
poster on the opposite wall it's great
yeah when I think I should see it it's
amazing unfortunately it's pretty of his
from your background that you in the
interrogation position opposite Josh I'm
sure they froze actually he's standing
right there he's glowering at us he's
very mad at how a professional this
podcast tests and I can't blame him
honestly yes yeah so s5 I mean what else
is that that's pretty much everything we
know like I think it's gonna look the
same no no at one time there's rumor
there's gonna be made of metal this time
right yeah but that's not going to
happen maybe I mean they can't just put
out another phone that looks like a gs5
urging why not Chris there's i would i
would like to introduce you to a copy
called Samson well yeah but consider
this and i know that that Samsung does a
very good job of siloing their different
divisions but if you look at their
televisions and how much they've evolved
in the past five years they're their ID
originally they were just a black a
thick black bezel and now they they've
moved like this insane like transparent
like one millimeter thick bezel with
like little like aluminum thing at the
bottom that says Samsung on it so they
know how to iterate ID they haven't done
it for a couple years now with the
galaxy s well dear no I mean in that
respect they have the the bezels on the
galaxy s4 are like the smallest like
they made the galaxy s4 the same size as
the galaxy s3 but increases screen size
so like they're shrinking the bezels
just like they've done on the TV's um
but you know it still has that greasy
slimy plastic bag I think that it's more
likely that instead of a maybe a metal
phone they'll probably apply some sort
of idea of that faux leather back that
they do on the galaxy note and those new
tablets and they even released a version
of galaxy s4 and Korean Russia with that
faux leather back so I'd be surprised
they're not be surprised with galaxy s5
had that yeah
I mean I I am unreasonably excited for
the s500 just feels super iterative but
I mean I'm using a nexus 5 as my android
phone am using an iphone as my main
phone right now and I mean I've seen the
rumors for what HTC is probably going to
do and I'm not super excited by that I
know LG doesn't have anything in the
pipeline that really gets me excited so
when it comes to like android phones
that are going to like float my boat get
my heart racing it seems like for the
next while the s5 is kind of going to be
at the top of the list but you're kind
of achieving your excitement by process
of elimination well I say no everybody
else thinks so let's hope Samsung does I
mean can't you just be content with the
Nexus 5 uh you know I can be content
with the nexus 5 especially if I had the
Vermillion one but I don't is that the
official name of it no it's officially
red but I think you see officially it's
officially hey guys I'm red it's
officially a few red is what I think
it's called I can't be excited about the
nexus 5 because the camera is terrible
we're stuck right but you know that's uh
doesn't really eat the one thing we know
nothing about with the new Sampson GS
Phi which is the camera right and as a
big mystery at us I think that might be
in fact the deciding at least hardware
component for this new device the big
speculation for this year in general
with smartphones and Android smartphones
typically the spec wise is that they
will switch to quad HD or qhd or
whatever the spec is for resolution
which like 2560 x 1440 so a 5.2 inch
Galaxy s5 with that sort of resolution
seems reasonable and likely particular
photo for the time span that we're
looking at be announced let's say a week
from now and then maybe launching a mum
from there but i don't think that
display resolution is going to be
anything like i say that floats people's
boats or when he differentiates it from
the older devices thinner as me
potentially excited is samsung
reinvesting in the camera because i know
with galaxy s2 and galaxy is free those
it was real differentiating feature for
me you know that is the thing that made
us stand out because if if we all
remember the galaxy s2 is the spot where
Samson really took off and split apart
from HTC up to that point it was really
either samsung is in the ascendancy or
HTC in fact HC and you know those are
the strengths on which samsung built
eunos great popularity is having an
awesome camera having its own exhales
process etc so we can see a processor
upgrade because here's green upgrade I
don't think any of us particularly
optimistic about Samsung doing an
industrial design upgrade that is really
special or unique so really the thing
that leaves us hopeful is the camera
yeah which is the thing we're not
laughing about Sarah well I yeah I mean
I'm the last couple iterations of the
the galaxy the camera has been like not
bad it's been fine has been pretty good
but it hasn't been ambitious or risky
and I would love to see Samsung try and
do something ambitious risky I mean I
said no they've added a million features
but I like to just like with the core
camera technology in the core image
processing yeah i mean everything the
samsung did with like the galaxy s4
camera was in the software and there's
all these weird software features that i
mean i don't know how many people use
them I certainly never used them really
when I reviewed I tested them but beyond
the review I never really found a place
for them in my personal life but the
galaxy note 3 has an excellent camera um
so you know I think Samsung actually can
do cameras pretty well it'd be great I
don't think Samsung's released the
camera with like an optical stabilizer
or some of these other technologies that
we're seeing the other companies do so
it'd be cool if they integrated that
yeah so the other thing that we are
expecting out of more bold Congress from
Samsung thanks to interpret reporting by
our very own crazy glure is not just one
but multiple galaxy Gear's this is the
rumor I'm looking at my post right now
to familiarize myself with the post that
you wrote 15 minutes ago Chris am I
going to be able to buy a galaxy gear
for each one of my limbs well so that I
mean maybe it is Samsung the
rumor yeah the rumors multiple new
galaxy Gear's might my gut is that they
are going to release do they're going to
turn galaxy gear into a portfolio prop
of products right and this isn't just
going to be about smartphones my guess
is that they might do a you know a
FuelBand type thing they might do a clip
who knows but I don't think they're
going to just release a bunch of
smartphones I mean it's give me
smartwatches what about a ring why not
again it's Samsung so the other rumor
with the gear is that instead of running
Android it could run Tizen which
initially I went yeah come on no way but
then I kind of think maybe they could do
that because why not well if they can
optimize it better than Android for low
battery and uh let themselves have a
smaller battery on it yeah then not only
am I like do I not care i'm kind of pro
Tizen I am I think I over Tizen I'm
saying it right I'm Pro tising I think
that would solidify it as only
compatible with samsung devices like I I
mean it's already there like the the
galaxy gear only works with Samsung
phones but if they actually do move it
over to a Tyson platform that pretty
much guarantees it will never work with
it with other android phones yeah what
does it no I mean I must say I with
everything yeah they would have to
release an app that would make it talk
to everything and I don't know I mean if
it chooses sales maybe maybe they would
write I mean the problem with anything
Samsung dozen wearables is that they
obviously have a large enough product
and app ecosystem so that they have no
interest or need to make their products
compatible largely with with operating
systems they can just make them
compatible with specifics and products
which is what they've done with the
galaxy gear and I have no reason to
think that these will be any different
but but regarding the tysons which I
mean we've been reporting for a long
long time that Samsung is at risk of
wresting control of Android from Google
right and I think that that day
as real as ever and Samsung continues to
try to make Tizen happen and I'd like to
flash the mean picture stop trying to
make Kaizen happened it's never going to
happen but so here's the day on on a
SmartWatch it sort of contained you want
a SmartWatch to be simple and to do what
it does you want it to be like the
pebble right sure so if if Tyson gives
them the ability to have a smaller
battery and just do things and not crash
because they control the whole stack and
they understand how the whole stack work
so they can cut out extra croft more
easily than they can an Android maybe
I'm not crazy to say I don't hate Tizen
but is there is their first whole
journey is there any indication that
Tyson is easier on battery then then
Android yeah uh so we'll see I mean I
mean frankly it doesn't need to be
either like this all yeah it does why I
mean it was the sort of wearables we're
talking about they could have some
really basic tailor-made software yeah
they could do bacon do basic tailor-made
software but I'm saying like it's got to
be easier on the battery than Android
sure that the galaxy gear is right now
is this yeah it needs to be better than
the galaxy Gear's now for battery life
right and the right place yeah frankly I
just think if this is correct and again
there's no reason to doubt it's as I'm
reading on the verge and there's this
chris sigler guy who wrote it I mean
spreading the galaxy gear name around to
me is like a terrible idea of samsar you
you've picked up a reputation which is
pretty poor I mean I don't know how it
is with the normal humans but at least
among the people interested in
technology Samsung has kind of being
laughed at for the galaxy get because of
its failings and because of its gimmicks
and it's half day battery life and all
of these shortcomings and its price um
so trying to stretch that out across
your wearable portfolio I just I think
that's particularly sage idea like you
kind of prejudicing people against
whatever else you're doing which might
actually be good you know like I mean I
don't know that the galaxy gear is a
very young device at this point it's
only been six months since it launched
yeah it came out
there's a lot of things wrong with it
and you know we panned it pretty hard in
our view as many other people and many
other reviewers um but it's not like
it's been established for multiple years
as a brand I think you know it's so it's
more established as a brand than it is
as a product so the fact that we've had
it like in AT&amp;amp;T stores and invest by
stores like being advertised is almost
as important as it people buying it in
terms of the ability of them to sell it
in the future and so when they these new
gears come out assuming they're better
you know people oh yeah I've heard of
that oh it's the new version okay maybe
I'll try this one because the first one
was too nerdy for me he could actually
help to have it out there even though it
was not very well reviewed and you know
didn't have sales that lived quite up to
Samsung's original expectations and I'd
wager that most average consumers don't
really know the gear name oh well they
know galaxy very well and so they might
say I want that galaxy watch just like
they say they have a galaxy phone
instead of an android phone um bread but
I mean unless you are really in the
thick of things you're probably not
calling whatever SmartWatch at Samsung
releases a galaxy gear it's a galaxy
watcher right or a galaxy fitness
tracker galaxy smart ring and so nokia
will be there they've got the
announcement were they byrdwhistle decks
pretty loudly do they know that motor
will use that name already everybody has
used that name there's a HTC One X yeah
moto X and now nokia X apparently
there's already look at X 7 that's true
that is a completely irrelevant phone
what we need is a new alphabet with more
cool-looking letters agree agree agree
creek is yeah nokia lambda i buy that i
would buy the hell yes uh so what do you
guys think I mean row rubber meets the
road what do you guys think about this
product u Rho Rho yeah I i think i think
i might have mentioned this last week
but tom warren tweeted that you know if
you don't care about nokia's
show line up right now you're not going
to care about the nokia X phone and I
think that's exactly what it's going to
be like that everything that has leaked
and all the stuff that we've seen point
to this being a very low-end device with
512 megabytes of RAM wvga display is
single or low-power dual-core processor
or something uh it's not going to a WVGA
yeah yeah what is this 2000 just 2,000 I
mean it to be honest that's a step up
from Asha phones so if it's if they're
going for that market and which it seems
to be that's very much what they're
going for this would be a step up but
for you know us who might be thinking of
this being the Lumia running Android
it's not it's not going to be and it's
not going to be better tailor
interesting and something let me know
how as a concept of Nokia producing an
android phone very interesting as it
device itself not very interesting this
is this is how the announcements going
to go Stephen Elop current CEO of Nokia
future whatever the hell his title is
going to be at Microsoft now that he's
out of the CEO race there because
Microsoft has a new CEO he's going to
get up on stage he's gonna kind of Mark
out well guys the bunch engineers made a
thing whatever it is SIA do you remember
it'll just amble off the state that's
that's how I want this announcer oh he
just walks out there's like yeah
whatever here you go and the leaves you
guys what I want you guys remember the
Lumia 1020 event when we couldn't tell
for like ten minutes whether he was
really there or not yes no Sundy yeah I
was live blog I'm like look at this
projection of him realize city right
next to me he's like that's actually him
I hope he does that again oh yeah
there's like this period of time where
it's like is it a phantasm of Stephen
Elop or is it the actual food well the
thing is that is the least likely thing
that Stephen Eva forever to the scenario
the detail ain't it because this dude is
spent the past however I was feted is
made for years actually since februari
2011 you know trying to paint a pretty
picture or an upbeat picture about a
company that has been struggling so
mightily but to bring us to the device
if it really is that low spec and low
end is then describes it I am going to
be just angry because to me it feels
kind of like sabotage or like
intentionally ruining the dream right to
me it feels like when you had a century
ago when you had the race between
electric cars and oil powered cars you
no longer the century ago somebody would
produce an electric car and just do a
really terrible job of it and say this
is why we shouldn't have electric cars
alright so to me this is what the nokia
X would be if it's really okay if
he's really terrible specs and it runs
like garbage it's gonna be like look if
look at when Android it would have
looked like this and you would have
hated it was anything that would I i
think i think the dream you're referring
to is the lumia android phone and that
dream just doesn't exist like that's not
a real thing exactly like nokia would
never produce that microsoft would never
let nokia produce that and never let it
sell a lumia android phone and long
saida lumia windows phone and have them
compete head-to-head I mean that's just
kind of like not never gonna happen
might as well get that out of your ideas
now I mean it's not today's really you
know I'm talking about something that we
wanted to see previously you know quite
a long while ago so the apartment the
problem that I have or the thing that
this nokia android phone reveals is a
interesting failure of Microsoft to
build software because the whole point
of this phone is to target the low end
and to make the phones cheap and haven't
run on low spec hardware and you know
sell gazillions of them across the globe
for next to nothing Microsoft should
have tried to do that they did try to do
that with with Windows Phone and they
that was one of the point was the 78
update where they tried to trim the fat
yeah and push it down into work on the
low end yeah i mean if if nokia
microsoft score hardware partner on a
track to getting acquired by them
doesn't believe that microsoft can push
windows phone down quickly enough in
order to work on those lower end phones
you know it's either
microsoft made a strategic decision that
they would try and make Windows Phone
more high-end and they wouldn't bother
trying to reduce the software down to
there again or they tried and failed a
nokia said you know what we're doing
well considering that some of
Microsoft's biggest wins with Windows
Phone have been in emerging markets my
belief is that this project started as
an exploration by Nokia to as a plan B
if if the Windows Phone deal fail right
and uh it you know parts of that project
continued on to this very day and we're
ending up with an usher replacement I so
I you know I I think that this has been
a constantly shifting exploration for a
very long time inside the company but I
don't think it started as Nokia saying
well we need something that can push
lower than Windows Phone can that needs
to succeed Asha I don't think that
that's how that my gut is that that's
not how that that conversation started
we all know nokia is not very good at
canning projects once it started yeah
Vic to the engineers that work on a
project will work on that until there's
a product on the market and then they'll
give up or until I or until they
suddenly find themselves working at a
company called yawa 12 all right so
let's talk about the Nokia Lumia icon
the new phone that's out on verizon
which is the successor to the this is
the 925 I believe that right sounds
right or is it 2899 28 and then the
there it is the horrible ugly version of
the 925 which is the beautiful amazing
well-designed feels great in the hand
feel solid feels like it's like of this
age or slightly ahead of its age phone
and nokia can make great phones but as
David Pierce said in his review instead
of making a great phone they made this
can someone explain to me why it's like
an inch thick first that why it looks
like the battery has bulged like
exploded it all either the camera button
actually shakes and why the the plastic
back came off of its clips
go yeah this is the worst no it's what's
the worst about it is we know that no
keep can do better right and there's
good can you pull your laptop screen
down it's like you're just hiding it
right yeah the cameras far away but like
the worst hand model it's pretty bad
what I'm doing and discussions is he
likely they tried I guess you could say
they tried to keep the industrial design
of their last phone but it was not good
well to me to me what this reeks of is
verizon medley exactly no this this has
verizon written all over it literally
multiple times yeah and you know it's
it's a shame but they essentially oh my
god you know the the phone is hovering
mysteriously in front of the camera so
you can see those you want is going on
there's this floating hand I think
that's actually my hand I'd like my
right hand to rise and saw nokia maybe
thank you everybody evan rodgers our
steam producer I think Nokia saw our
verizon saw nokia released a 925 with
this beautiful metal band and this gap
design and stuff like that and they're
like we've got the 928 can you put a
metal band on that and and make it a new
phone and throw some more logos on it
yeah I take away some features like
everything if the phone looked good and
wasn't so heavy and brookie no you stop
right there don't continue that sentence
any further no you would not buy it no
one would buy it it doesn't matter if it
looks good that's Windows Phones problem
right now that could be the best looking
phone in the universe and you know how
many people would buy it three I wasn't
gonna end with by I was gonna end with
good phone but okay yeah the data that
they know you're like if it wasn't this
phone it would be a good father I just
wanted to say earlier run which
respected nokia and microsoft dragon
witness phone down I just wanted to
agree with Chris because it was maybe
not this so maybe the previous summer
where one of Nokia's developer Chiefs
was saying Microsoft isn't being quick
enough dragon windows phone down into
the price but we're disappointed that
was a quote from him by the pace
which Microsoft is doing this I
absolutely think the Android the
experiment let's call it has been an
ongoing investigation exploration like
crystal saying it isn't something that
just got sprung up in the past few
months and as then we'll say you know
this invested that much time the company
and its phone division is going away
they might as well put something out
there I'm market I mean I think what
solidifies that is the fact that you
know you can buy Nokia Lumia 520
unlocked in the US for like sixty nine
dollars yeah like that is a low-end
Windows Phone and it's you know it runs
like every other Windows Phone pretty
much you know the camera might not be is
good and it might not be as quite as
fast in screen is right wvga but that's
a $69 unlocked smartphone that's about
as low end as smartphones are today and
you know another point I just wanted to
make in terms of Vermillion or red
phones I have a red 720 Lumia 720 which
I don't use because windows phone but
that is one of the most beautiful phones
ever like is it I was thinking about the
red nexus and I remember the red diamond
720 and to me that is so much nicer and
it just shows nokia like dt were saying
nokia is no problems with design it only
screws it up when verizon tells it to
right and that's a disappointing thing
you know because that said its way with
a nice camera battery life and android
you know forget about it i'm gonna be
interested in phones for a couple of
years if i had one of those well nokia
is hurtling pell-mell to its purchased
by microsoft which is moving along just
fine and uh you know Saachi nadella is
gonna fix everything sounds good of
course of course i can't believe how
thick this phone is it's outrageous like
this was acceptable in like two thousand
eight so uh before the show started I
had pulled this out of a drawer it's
it's a nokia trios I mean a palm treo
650 from 2006 I believe diener can
correct me if I'm wrong I I don't know
and uh it is really headphones then it's
probably thicker than my headphones yes
uh but you know it's not that much
thicker than the icon ahaha come on
so I mean if you're on verizon and you
want Windows Phone then it's your only
choice go to town and and you'll wake up
you'll suffer through the brick eNOS of
it but you know apps are way better and
windows phone and the screen i think is
fine the camera is totally passable you
know it's the solid nokia camera that
does all the most most yeah all will say
all the nokia tracks all the ones it's
not like the 1020 map it says it's the
same cameras of 15-20 as far as I yeah
which is and of course it feels fast
because windows one always does so you
know just have fun carrying this around
sorry just don't pocket if you're gonna
go for like a massive cook you know
crazy nokia phone just go for the Lumia
1520 at least that thing is amazing too
bad you cake without icing throw yeah if
you're on verizon this is your only
choice yeah yeah I forgot about your
caps illest ways and okay sorry deal
with it yeah um okay so HTC is not
expected to launch their next phone at
mobile world congress but they have
announced when they will announce their
next phone which is with a save the date
thing for march 25th yay yeah this is
almost exactly one month off to
samsung's galaxy s alright that's it so
it's a while after this is always a
chess match between those two like at
well i don't know that it is but like i
can only assume that it is like I think
it more of a chess match for HTC I think
yeah Samsung does it stay in HGC right
who's right the most disappointing thing
is that this save the date invitation
doesn't have anything any hints that we
can like try and parse out it's just the
date uh no it's on the twenty-fifth okay
two and A five so yes it does two
cameras I'm like and a 5-inch screen and
maybe you know uh it's going to be
called to HTC one two and and because
it's in March marching is like walking
which means it'll have like some fitness
features in it dude half life 3
confirmed right there wait how much do
confirmed dan what was what was that
thing you you tweeted this morning about
I pretty much just said it March 25 25
to two cameras five inches no no no you
had something about like a new movie or
something oh it was it was a half life 3
yes yes that's what I was reciting it
quoted them but you know what this thing
is gonna support PlayStation mobile I I
mean Saudi and support at least possible
because HTC already do that's what I'm
saying look you guys told me with this I
had too bad to have something that's
fair better but guys you know it's cool
here they can call it I mean the rumor
the Bloomberg report from January which
actually pinpoint to the launch will
march and I think that Bloomberg report
is basically as factual we've had and it
mentions the Geo sensor camera that said
there's basically record the AC one
again what I'm thinking is good
literally we called the one again cuz
that would be amazing please tell you
what again bhiwani acabo again see I
would actually like if you ever if be
the chair ever has a yellow moment I
would love to see that happen you know
just again but what they can do is they
can call it the HTC One squared right
I'll put the dude now in superscript
after the 10 because 1 squared is 1
Justin like yo that's really ah
journalists all the time I like it glad
you convinced me that's a really good
idea yeah yeah you see or what about our
names what by a subscript 2 yeah what is
that dice mathematically not give them
the ideas because I'm gonna have to
write about this phone no one crying I
don't want to have to put oh yeah right
and prescription subscripts into every
article that I wrote about oh wait then
you will have to you have to because all
of a sudden now there's a trend
happening because Samsung's Galaxy s5
teaser had everything to the power of
five and it's very possible that
Samsung's branding is going to be galaxy
s5 is a superscript on top of the S
which
like how the hell do you write that in
an article you just write us five but at
the same time lgb pre-announced one of
its embassy launches which that's gonna
do the l-series that mid-range android
not a series of handsets and it's called
the L Series free where the three is in
Roman numerals as a superscript of the
series assistive roman numeral with
amazing yeah Annie will me just kill me
now but guys other than 10 words in
these own names like we've moved ahead
we're approaching the point where
there's going to start pulling an artist
formerly known as Prince we're like it's
it's a completely unpronounceable if
yeah yeah that's where we're going we
already had that we had to smile the
smile that's great you guys won so yeah
it was in the US only I think yeah they
made it samsung smiley is literally the
smiley emoticon it was the name of the
phone so the other thing disappointed
out of here I'm sorry guys the
disappoint up I do feel like we need to
give LG and Samsung a bit of a break
because they don't use the Latin
alphabet the way that we do right so
when they decide to get let's call it
creative with your placement of you know
Roman numerals in whatever to them I
guess it's just more artistry with the
language which we are uncomfortable with
with it but then they're more flexible
with because it's forward to I go back
to my earlier point that we should start
using Greek letters yeah I'm you know
what you can't use alpha and beta
because that denotes things about the
quality of the product but from there on
man I would buy the hell of a samsung
gamma yeah think about it exhale
everything and do it seems like a lot of
dude the LG Delta come on I like hey I
like it um I look like nice free lambdas
oh my god why never makes it was my free
of them that's that's that's that is a
great joke if you guys have nacho kudos
to you nerds um yeah the Greek alphabet
is that there's going to be a bunch of
masters could be like no no that's being
used for something else we already using
that for yeah yeah butBut trademark law
doesn't apply to mathematics as far as I
know maybe does maybe you can trade
market a digit trademark laws all like
screw you math nerds yeah the other
thing that HTC they just announced this
thing called advantage which is us only
for six months after you buy an HTC One
if you crack your screen they'll replace
it they'll they'll even do like send
them unto you ahead of time and and and
you send you a broken one back for rice
brio with the fee is they're committing
to using google drive to get free
storage I think it's max get 50 gigs the
other guys get 25 gag and the third part
of this is they're promising pinky swear
pinky swear that they're going to update
Android for at least two years on these
models autoplay HTC mamas I mean how
many times have we heard that excuse me
regret just regarding the the capacity
promotion yet as a the cloud storage
this is interesting timing because HTC's
promotion with Dropbox with the I
believe is the 1x there was it the one
is the 1 X 1 X is just now expiring from
there's a two-year deal where you got 25
gig if you buy 2 1 X so those people are
going to start losing that storage now
they're moving to Google Drive yeah the
screen replacement thing is clever yeah
it is i mean it's a nice like free like
add on the six months number is a little
like kind of random yeah but still it's
a really good because it you know every
single day in my life i'm walking on the
street I see somebody holding a broken
iphone with the broken screen yeah so
people are breaking their phones left
and right this is a good a good way to
like kind of encourage people move over
to HTC HTC needs to get creative right
like they're not getting the market
share that they need so I think we're
gonna start to see more and more of
these kind of creative solutions to the
problem yeah but I mean honestly do you
think that this is going to sell a
single more extra phone it might only
because uh broken displays are such a
huge prop don't know this is a global
problem or if it's just Americans who
can't hold their phones but literally
every day I see smartphones on the
street with broken yeah displays and
it's a major problem you can cut your
hand up these things so there might be
people who say you know what I dropped
my phone all the time I'm now going to
get HTC because in this promotion I mean
it could happen cannot be a I
just wonder what ever you casio commando
man okay i planned every where you're
going with no good you know i was wrong
yeah the g'zone the jizz one okay um no
I wanted to take the opposite position
where the guy said that this offers
clever and seda is completely analytic
though right because it creates a moral
hazard like I'm gonna buy your brand new
phone I'm gonna use it for five months
in 29 days and then just gonna whoops
drop it no it doesn't run you yeah it no
it doesn't work that way in practice
because you get all you get in return is
a refurbished one that is no better or
worse than the one that you had before
right and you're out a phone for a
couple days so you're just an
inconvenience in yourself okay fair
enough fair enough but still it kind of
makes you breakfast you you said you'd
have a six month insurance for any weird
damage that you do I mean unless you
drown I don't know it's no different
than the insurances that carriers have
sold for years except that you get a
free for six months I mean that's like
you can buy you could pay verizon or
whoever eight dollars a month for the
same type of insurance and you know
they'll replace your phone if you drop
it and break it you probably have to pay
a fifty or hundred dollar volt ductable
um right but they're just offering this
for free for six months exactly because
it's free people are more reckless with
it there's more of a moral hazard even
if you only spend like eight dollars
when your verizon insurance you still
kind of feel like you spent mine so i
don't know i mean look to me I think
that's a good gesture positive gesture
if you're gonna try and get people to
use your device's this is really a
useful bit of security you know hardware
security and you know people invest
money people who don't review phones
every day actually spend money on them
so I appreciate that I'm just say
that every time we see companies do this
kind of forgiving thing the end result
has tended to be the company really just
hemorrhages a ton of money because
people you know exploit it I don't think
that many people are would explain it to
be honestly I think that's a fringe case
and there will be those people that do
that sure but the vast majority people
aren't going to bother with that I mean
I'm hopeful does the case I would be
happy for everybody does this you know
give you six months of security that you
won't you won't just you know loser your
money down the drain when you crack your
screen should I care about the LG pro LG
G pro 2 at all it's up to a 5.9 inch
display now it's a little bit thinner it
has a cool like metal mesh back but it's
just I have a really hard time going oh
yeah I can't wait for this to come to
the u.s. something 55.9 inches is like
ever I've actually unfortunately handled
or reviewed a number of 5.9 inch phones
already and it's just like it's at this
size where it is nobody can manage this
size and not call it unwieldy well I
mean so if you're going to have a phone
that big like Samsung handles are really
well with a note that's just
unapologetically like a little kind of
mini tablet and they put a stylist in it
and they like customized software that
the software customizations that LG
seems to be offering is an option to
literally shrink the display size down
so that half the screens on you so you
can reach stuff with one finger
seriously yeah yeah yeahs note nobody
sees that and thinks maybe we should try
making smaller devices sometime nope I i
think these devices are made for a very
specific market and that market demands
bigger screens okay well i don't think
they're made for western markets at all
mg for a little bit i have heard a rumor
and I can't for the life of me remember
where of a g2 mini and the you know what
I sizes are going to be there going to
be enough I think LG itself said that
that they will be announcing a g2 mini
at Mobile World Congress well then
exciting because if it's like the
experience everyone compact rather than
you know the Samsung gal
this crap minis uh that is something
that exciting except it'll be running LG
software which is like abysmal which we
can fix n I'm writing about the answer
too bad software come on oh it always is
it always is good because there's good
people of it could do this stuff for
free I quote them angels you know what I
would like I would like for Android to
not require you to have to root your
phone in order to do this kind of
customization or just you know I would
really like for manufacturers not to
release crap software that needs to be
exile you know what I can deal with it
guys I'm feeling much more a bit
impulsive about this then you go because
Android is still pretty kick-ass like
the things that we can do to phone
nowadays are crazy yo just compared to a
few years ago and we are actually moving
fast we're looking at the nitty-gritty
detail and as usual kind of lose track
of how much things have advanced but you
can do a ton of things with Android and
you know we having to flash the entire
rom I mean isn't that kind of nuts I'm
trying to cram in West reference here
guys because you'd have to do this
on webos it you could just patch stuff
directly well you still needed to break
out a command line though no you didn't
really you do not all right you had to
do up down left right left right yeah
you type in the konami code or the
launch date and then there was a app for
mac and pc that you just load on the on
board software preware and then you
would just browsed you know the
galleries the repositories kastoria one
of which I built that's the thing with
technology and this is this is a rare
example I'm gonna hear the nikon DF
right oh it's it instead of my face yeah
every time I pick up a nikon DSLR
particular the professional ones I have
to go to remind myself how to get it to
use all of its focus points so this
thing is 39 focus points it only uses
the center one by default so I need to
find the setting what I can tweak them
I'm running around the menu I can't find
it anywhere i'm looking around the
google and finally i find it and here's
how you do it you have to get at you
have this
little switch it between also a manual
focus you have to press the button there
and then use the toggle here to switch
between focusing modes which is like
there is no way too into it that there
is no way to guess that to me is exactly
like economical either you know whether
you don't write or you read like the
instinct menu so a lot of technology has
these yeah cuz routing a routing an
android phone installer custom rom is
way easier now I'm not saying it's easy
what I'm saying is a lot of technology
has these really weird hurdles that we
have to overcome but at the same time
would I use a nikon pro DSLR so I feel
like the t4 or the DF of course no I'm
just saying these are things i do it
that's why i don't like using icons
because they're such a pain to use I
feel like I feel like that whole uh
sidebar Vlad was really just an excuse
to brag they haven't yet you know what
and I respect that what I'm saying is
that this is friction in our interaction
and relationship with technology and
absolutely we need to get over it we
need to move beyond it but the important
thing is that these things are adding
good things to our lives like as far as
I'm concerned android is far and away
the best operating system that i can
have on a phone i get iOS i'm just
broken up when I was until somebody
fixes a ton of things with it and when
this phone hasn't grown up so Android is
so much stronger than everything else
and LG just does really good hardware
and that that would have to wake thing
screw you guys I love it so if energy
does another really nice phone makes it
smaller and keep those fangs I will deal
with the you know it's better than you
double tap to wake flat is when you pull
your home in your pocket and it's
already awake like with the motorola
okay yeah the Moto X has good things
come on me so the last thing I want to
talk about today is this catfight
between the CEO of t-mobile John ledger
and well I don't know it's a really John
ledger it's now not really it's just
t-mobile and they brand promotion get a
new phone if you have a black these 10
blackberry users because they're obvious
targets to upgrade their phone and the
blackberry community got very unhappy
about this and it escalated to the point
where the new CEO of blackberry John
Chen has written an open letter to
tmobile wherein he like thanks his
customers for tweeting angry things at
their CEO and I can assure you that we
are outraged to what puzzles me more is
a tmobile did not speak with us before
or after they launched this clearly
inappropriate and ill-conceived
marketing because she has nothing better
to do like I don't understand this like
he's a CEO of a company that's like in a
tailspin don't you have like more
important things to do then like worry
about this promotion this like limited
time promotion that t-mobile tried to
sell it its own customers a phone and it
doesn't sell any blackberry phones so it
can't offer them blue blackberry phones
like I mean wait t-mobile doesn't sell
any blackberry only blackberry phones
that you can buy on t mobile's website
right now or refurbished models
interesting I it's just such a weird
move like finally to t-mobile I would
like to remind you that our
long-standing partnership was once
productive and profitable for both
blackberry and t-mobile I hope that we
can find a way forward that allows us to
serve our shared customers once again
notwithstanding the current challenge we
remain very excited about BlackBerry's
future like you know what would help is
okay t-mobile needs to sell the punana
982 yeah and then yeah everything will
be good to go hey you uh blackberry
curve 8300 blackberry what does their
low-end curve was like a 9320 or
something like that uh we think this
would be a really great phone for you
it's twenty-five hundred dollars the new
panada with my guard with our with our t
mobile flexpay program it's only seventy
nine dollars a month I predict if I ever
win the lottery if I ever get you know
some random person to invest in my
mobile starter if I ever get to make a
phone it will be called upon uh no no no
or something one you get to the power of
two did you guys realize that blackberry
still sells seven blackberry seven
models yes it sells more blackberry
seven models in it sells blackberry 10
every quarter from mark oh god it's so
sad so it's the like every quarter that
it releases self smartphone sales
figures it sells three times as many
BlackBerry seven models as it does for
blackberry time can you still give this
d30 from what is a verizon so yeah I
mean why isn't blackberry mad at Verizon
Verizon won't even stock the z30 in its
storage can only order it on yeah the
the thing that John Chen CEO blackberry
needs to do is grit his teeth take his
lumps and move on and not let his in
Slyke the insane people that are mad at
t-mobile about a little promotion have
him writing an open letter to another
company like this like this is you get
on the phone you called tmobile ago dude
seriously dude yeah t-mobile goes yes
sorry my bad and then it's over right
but instead it escalated other they're
opening with a major US carrier and it's
just very last person Kuras like glass
newport ever and it's like still has
even under a new CEO it's the same
company i'm just saying the last CEO on
the planet that you want to start a
public fight with his John ledger that's
true like he is not going to take this
quietly and it's going to be kind of
amazing I just the fact that John Chen
is stretching the definition of current
challenge to its absolute limits the
challenge we've been facing since 2008
yeah I mean look just it just kind of
try and play devil's advocate and
present his perspective maybe from
BlackBerry's point of view it feels like
has a very low community of followers
and users and by putting out this open
letter it's giving them a collective
voice it shows that is on their side etc
etc and maybe he considers that part of
user engagement yeah that's fair and
that works for those people but it's not
a good look I mean we'll never know the
answer to this but I would wager that
more people bought new iPhones based on
this from
then there were a number of people that
complained about it publicly ouch ouch
yeah but right but that's not it's not a
good look for blackberry no it's not
that's that's kind of my point yeah
might draw attention that's why even
acknowledge it as black right mo because
advertising costs money dan and this is
cheaper why why did ever know a
blackberry version why not never knows
people to say notes and yes my vision is
already of the blackberry hub yeah I
might have him is HTC's two-year promise
for Android updates if HTC is you know
at the sort of desperation point where
we all kind of think that it is and
we're struggling so mightily I think it
might as well make these folk promises
because within two years either the
company was trading this out and it
will be able to support devices or it
won't and it would have failed anyway so
I kind of feel like libraries in the
same position it's like you can just
talk trash you can do whatever you want
because ultimately to fade above these
companies HCM blackberry seems like it's
going to be resolved over the next year
or so yeah I think I'll sustain the
weather they've been going for much
longer than that no blackberry is gonna
be in a very similar position but with
less cash in a year from now than it is
today I don't think that blackberry is
gonna fold that quickly writing they
like their I mean their sales are going
to continue to decline but like they're
gonna be chasing after the new strategy
and they're just going to keep chugging
along and they fill up a ton of cash
right there like two billion or so yeah
they're bleeding through it very quickly
though and like every quarter they're
bleeding through a lot of that I I mean
I think it's gonna be very dire in a
year for them but I don't think that
like I don't think the cliff is around
the corner I don't think it's like next
month right it does feel like they need
to I didn't mean to turn this new
blackberry podcast but it does feel like
they need to do something a little more
drastic than what they're doing right
now which is just re doubling down on
concrete phones like oh hello it's the
right thing to do
I mean I'd like to see him do some more
drastic but I mean we need to we need to
lower our expectations of blackberry
that's that's the thing that like by
going back to qwerty phones and talking
about enterprise so much there's they're
basically saying hey guys don't expect
us to be so awesome any more like we're
gonna be this size combative method for
company delivery I think that and that's
like that's a message they had to
deliver and I also think it's a true
message like we you shouldn't be
disappointed by blackberry anymore
because you shouldn't be expecting so
much from that right if I guess maybe
we're going to retrench to the
enterprise the way to doubt it yeah
they're kind of quietly pulled out of
the consumer market after it failed
which was very disappointment to me
because and this is an opinion that Neil
I shares with me downs hardware designs
on their windows phone and Android
phones what the venue venue pro really
nice actually now the show some progress
yes yeah the story of blackberry is the
story of the coach who stops yelling
like when Coach yells at you you feel
really bad and then pulls you aside of
snow he yells because he cares but
what's when he stops yelling that means
he's written you off like it's time to
stop yelling at blackberry and just let
them do their thing yeah well that's all
well and good but that doesn't translate
into profit right like I mean just
because we can all agree the blackberry
should be awesome there might be awesome
doesn t they can survive that's that's
the next trick is how you you know there
were a lot of very drastic ideas over
the past 18 months from spinning off
various divisions like BBM and and you
know that they're they're secure
back-end and all this and none of that
panned out of course now they're still
one company Kennex I think orc UNIX
every was pronounced if you were to take
that as a separate unit I think it's
still profitable on its own yes but that
I mean add the bling down the rest of
the curve that the rest to come anyways
down in UNIX oh yeah who knows them they
need other playbook is what Thank You
Man just ultra burn right listen and
they need to realize every two hours
over ah yes yes they do they need to
bring back here's what the
need to do just is okay men's wearhouse
needs to bring back a George Zimmer uh
and and and blackberry needs to bring
back lettuce to a bottle round on stage
and talk about amateur hour being over
and then you can pull out a new playbook
that's that's the key to my great
success I've solved all all gems
problems on this podcast that ladies and
