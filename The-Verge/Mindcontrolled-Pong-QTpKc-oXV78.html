is like a hacker space to open up in the
city maybe six months ago and they've
built something they call brain bats
four sons they call it brain Kong you
we're basically like these headsets that
monitor your brainwave activity and they
can monitor two states like concentrated
or like focused on something or like
meditative like focused on nothing and
that controls the little paddle and
you're just playing you know like your
classic 70s arcade version of palm I
mean that's like really kind of you know
my like long-term fantasy is that that's
where computers are headed some kind of
mind control some kind of brain computer
interface so I got to like train my
brain now to be ready for the for the
singularity brain bats started off with
David Rives one of the members of hack
Manhattan came up with a sketch to do
brain pong and I saw him using it one
day and I was fact that I was really
exciting I mean I really love the idea
of being able to control things with
your brainwaves and I just thought this
was like this incredible new interface
idea
the way that the game works as we set it
up here is that you wear the EEG headset
and the EEG headset calculates two
values your attention and a value for
meditation so what we do is we take that
attention value and so that's how much
you're focusing on concentrating on a
particular thing and it could be
anything and I do math problems in my
head if your attention level is higher
than fifty percent which is sort of an
arbitrary number but it has to be it has
to be higher than that fifty percent in
order for your paddle to move so in
order to beat the computer you have to
maintain a very high level of focus for
the duration of the game it seems to me
like if I'm trying if I'm like trying in
my head just to speak in Spanish that my
attention score was really high math
doesn't seem to work at all but like
translating one thought into another
language seems to be pretty good for for
the attention score vs and meditations
for
and just like focusing really hard on
the computer I'm like trying to figure
out why why my brain is working one way
versus another but really this is I have
no idea what's going on
I mean like the meditation of the
attention are just kind of like
they're going back and forth battling
games are one of the first means of
exposure that children have to
technology it's an area where you know
there's playfulness there's financing
and so it's an ideal incubator for new
technology in interfaces and new ideas
about ways to to interact with
computerized devices it's not about
setting out to do the greatest X or the
greatest y that the world has ever seen
it's about doing the greatest whatever
happens to spontaneously occur because
innovation can't be predicted and we
ain't it to innovate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
