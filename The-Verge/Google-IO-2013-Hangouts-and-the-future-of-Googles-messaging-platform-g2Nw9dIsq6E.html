Google Talk and it really seemed like
they had a head start in the messaging
game but a few years later everyone from
the smallest start up to its biggest
corporate competitor has a mobile
messaging app and Google doesn't today
Google's finally throwing his hat in the
ring with a new version of hangouts a
multi-platform messaging app we started
thinking about the problem you know
almost seven years ago with Google Talk
Google Talk was designed to enable you
know chat within enterprises and and
then we realized that there's
opportunities in voice so we released
Google Voice and more recently released
Google+ messenger and Google Hangouts
since 2005 Google has launched a steady
stream of real-time communication apps
like talk voice and wave
most recently the company launched
Google+ messenger and live video
hangouts I think we've done an
incredibly poor job of servicing our
users here I think that Google has lots
and lots of we have all the code to make
a seamless communication experience for
end users but they live in lots of
different products we're gonna fix that
when you look at a problem this scope at
a human level that even starts at
cultural levels you can imagine that the
team's the infrastructure the culture
the way they think about problems are
are pretty different and so what we've
essentially had to do is create like
it's like the Avengers we had to pull
together these different styles and
these different cultures and this sounds
obvious in retrospect but in reality we
realized that we build a lot of the
communication products and without
smartphones without social networks if
we had to essentially rebuild everything
and so we pulled the project together we
called it Babel which we're launching
today as hangouts it's a new experience
that really is a single unified
communication product across our
properties hangouts is like Google Talk
but your conversations are synced
between every platform you use like
Chrome Android iOS and Gmail where it's
pretty much how you'd expect it to
hangouts intelligently decide so you're
most likely to chat with and puts them
in easy access boxes in a sidebar once
you've started a conversation you can
scroll back in time to the very
beginning
even view an album if every photo you
shared inside Google+ tiny watermarks
indicate how far each member of a
conversation is read and whether they're
currently typing or online a button at
the top of each conversation lets you
instantly start a live hangout with the
person or group you're chatting with no
matter what device they're on neither
what do you think of the spaceship you
can attach photos and pick from 850
hand-drawn emojis one smart feature on
Android is that when you open up
hangouts on a computer or phone to talk
to friends push notifications disappear
on your other devices eliminating
redundant notifications well the new
hangouts doesn't include every feature
its competitors have added like voice
memos locations or stickers in our
experience it's fast and is a solid
version 1.0 our intention is that we
will essentially replace all of our
communication properties with hangouts
so one thing that we've learned on
hangout service or in the past year and
a half since we launched is that people
really love video calling David sushi
bar here I would hope so
so I can say you know like hey Ben and
Randall are you guys around you guys
free and I can see sort of when they
arrive right like I can see that they're
here and they're listening and they're
ready and it's just one click and all of
them are arranged was it always a plan
from the start for video to be a big
part of the text experience as well I
think we knew that we wanted this to be
more than just a messaging product right
like we you don't see hangouts as a
messaging product we see it as a
communication product and we had this
really great video infrastructure that a
lot of people loved right everyone says
I love hangouts but it's really hard and
so we knew that we needed to collide
these two things together
I guess my next question is what do you
guys think of chat heads it mean it's
great right like like chat heads I think
was you know super interesting they did
a you know really good job with the
design and how they built it yeah you
know it follows some of the same
principle that we talked about with the
chrome chrome app right it's the ability
to take your conversations with you you
know regardless of what you're doing in
their case it's on mobile but in our
case it's the same principle you know I
can be on YouTube watching a video
decoding
and and I didn't incoming message or
call and it's about bringing that up to
the foreground the hangouts is you know
it's an app but you do dig into Android
a bit did you consider trying to do
something that felt a bit more
integrated like why is this separate
from say the SMS app I think you know we
have a lot of good ideas that I think
we're gonna you know potentially start
pushing those limits and I think you
know as a as a baseline for what we what
we have right now I think you know we've
achieved something that I think will
work for a lot of people and I think is
gonna work really well and there's a
whole other area of things that we want
to do to kind of accomplish an even
better integrated product with Android
you can sign in to talk from any number
of clients like messages on Mac or adium
or what have you is hangouts open in
that way so hangouts is not built on top
of the XMPP standard because we continue
to maintain talk for the foreseeable
future
the users will continue to be able to
connect into talk we have essentially
made a hard decision to focus less on
the XMPP standards and more on what our
users are looking for and and we'll be
moving hangouts forward with a platform
eventually but likely not based on XMPP
standard moving away from the XMPP
standard means that Google Talk users
won't be able to get hangouts advanced
features and apps like trillion and ATM
but leaving the standard gives one
important thing to Google the ability to
be competitive again in the quickly
evolving messaging landscape is Google
committed to this product long term you
guys have gotten maybe a bad rap that
jumps up if you've done some spring
cleaning and killed off some products
and we've seen a bunch of sort of
experimental stuff
come and then go is this in that
category I think that or should I be
thinking about this is a core product of
Google my usual think about it as a core
product in fact this is probably the
strongest signal that we can give is the
fact that we are releasing it on all of
our properties and making a commitment
going forward that hangouts is the
single communication app that we want
our users to essentially rely on
there's no way to ask this nicely at all
ask it's not nicely what took so long is
there something that made this possible
now in 2013 that you didn't have before
it wasn't a lack of code and it wasn't a
lack of understanding the problem it was
easy for us to make incremental changes
on Google+ or on Android or on Gmail but
they weren't enough and that's when we
took the time to build this project and
essentially come out with you know what
we're excited about but it's only the
beginning we feel so yeah hangouts are
good you're a Google user you're going
to give them a try if you're not you
still might want to because the video
chat features but the bottom line is we
still live in a world where some people
are on iMessage some people are on bbm
some people are on whatsapp and now some
people are on hangouts if you want to
give up on SMS there's no shortage of
ways to make that happen
you just need to make sure that your
friends are doing it in the exact same
way</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
