ross miller and with your written
consent let's spend 90 seconds on the
verge Windows 8 is finished Microsoft's
next operating system has hit release to
manufacturing status and will be
delivered to the company's hardware
partners in the next few days windows 8
officially launches October 26 which
should give om's plenty of time to make
their special edition windows 8
bloatware and digg com is back the
iconic aggregator was relaunched as
version 1.0 last night but only in name
beta works the company behind the
resurrection completely throughout Diggs
old code and decided to start anew there
are no comments there is no dig bar and
all front page stories are editorially
curated by three humans an amazon
instant video is now available for the
ipad users can stream video content and
even choose to download for offline
viewing airplay functionality however is
limited to audio only there is no option
to stream video to your Apple TV just
like with kindle for ipad you'll still
have to purchase all content outside of
the app directly through amazon coms
website and Google Wallet has long been
plagued by two main issues a lack of
supported devices and a lack of
supported credit cards today the company
has solved one of those issues the new
Google Wallet now lets you use any major
US credit or debit card instead of
charging your car directly purchasable
instead go through google itself your
bank statement in will just be a series
of Google Wallet charges you'll still
probably get the amex points and that's
it for today's top stories tune in
tomorrow or will test drive the first
two-door sedan decontrol entirely with
your eyebrows</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
