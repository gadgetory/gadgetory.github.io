days down to the trailer and then just
begin you know there's a flood of news
the LCS States over the entire industry
and because recover the industry so
thoroughly takes over an entire site you
know it's really our biggest event of
the year it's like the Super Bowl you
know it's just total insanity for a week
straight we should request interviews
with people that we think would be
significant or interesting to get our
hands on because we'll have a set up at
the trailer please say a command we
think it's really important to not just
see the products but hear from the
people who are making those products
it's a mandate to ourselves to capture
those stories we're really good at
taking a lot of information making it
presentable making it readable and
you're still showing you what's
important what really is going to make
the coverage great is that we have the
staff a big staff of really smart really
talented very sharp writers that are
putting these stories together that are
building narratives out of these stories
and they can tell the stories better
than anyone else in the industry
