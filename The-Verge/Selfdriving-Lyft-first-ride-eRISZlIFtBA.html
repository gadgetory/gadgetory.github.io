we're at CES 2018 and I'm about to do
what else ride in a self-driving car
assault driving cars are at CES every
year but this demo is gonna be different
this is not just the self-driving ride
around a parking lot or around the
convention center this is the result of
a partnership between the lifts and a
company called active and what they're
gonna do is actually offer semi
autonomous car rides to people here at
CES to one of 20 or more destinations
across the week so people who are
attending the show can actually sign up
and just in the lyft app hail a
self-driving car and take it to one of
these destinations and we're about to
get a preview of what that whole
experience looks like so we just hop in
the car tap confirm it's showing us our
route smooth and simple yeah we're gonna
go to Caesar's Palace
I didn't bring any cash with me yeah oh
and I get to start oh I didn't know that
there was gonna be so much control all
right the driver is actually driving
right now because there's regulations
that say that they can't do it on
private property here one of the biggest
challenges in Las Vegas would
self-driving cars is that it doesn't
have the same kind of lane lines that
most roads have in America it has these
things called Botts dots which are just
little sequences of dots on the roads
that separate the lanes and that's a bit
of a challenge for self-driving systems
which usually need lane markers to be
able to know where the lanes are there
we go and now we're here and now we're
at autonomous driving code according to
the loud computer voice behind my head
so it's going well so far
we stopped beautifully at a red light
and some passengers crossed in front
with no problems and now we're going
again it's very smooth so far like many
self-driving demos it's a little bit
boring if you forget about the
technology and that that's a little loud
and boring it is giving us a lot of
information about what's going on
whether it's here on the screen in the
backseat or in the screen and the front
seat showing basically that the car
knows what it's doing
and trying to like constantly prove that
the car knows that it's doing to the
people who are inside of it the car
we're in is BMW 5-series and the tech
that's powering it is basically all the
tech that this company active has
provided they've been working on
self-driving technology on a few
different models this is just the one
that they have here and active was a
good choice for lyft because they've
been here in different forms over the
last couple years of CES doing rides
demo rides and self-driving cars and so
they have a lot of data about the
challenging environment in Las Vegas in
past experiences usually you feel some
drifting left and right in a lane as the
car tries to sort of keep itself planted
in the right position and there's none
of that which is good because that kind
of stuff those little margins of error
can make for motion sickness come up in
people and when you're lift and you're a
company that's trying to offer ads to
people who are going you know out or
back from a night on the town here
wobbling them back and forth that's
probably a bad idea another thing that
can really challenge some of these
systems is harsh lighting especially
when there aren't solid lane lines and
we've got a lot of light and shadow and
cars breaking in front of us and it's
reading the scene pretty well at least
to the point that I'm not noticing the
car reading it wrong look this guy
actually has to talk to his taxi driver
perfect Hey
the taxi drivers give him the thumbs up
I don't think he's doing worried about
self-driving technology taking over his
job name change checking
it's amazing how much a car like this
makes you realize all the terrible and
terrifying things that are happening
around you like that car that was just
sort of like hanging off the edge of a
curb like is he gonna pull out diseased
not even paying attention to the road
like that car that just crossed in front
of us like it makes you so much more
self aware of how much danger were
constantly near when we're driving or
riding in a car so that's it that
completes our ride in a soft driving
lift we got to Caesar's Palace
and back without losing any money which
is a pretty good feat in Las Vegas also
no crashes for more self-driving cars
weird self flying helicopters and flying
cars and all that stuff from CES 2018
make sure you go to youtube.com slash
the very click subscribe and the virtual
calm slash CES that's where everything
is thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
