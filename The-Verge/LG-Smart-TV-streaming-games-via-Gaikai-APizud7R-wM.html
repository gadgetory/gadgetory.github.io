we are watching Street Fighter 4 playing
on an LG Smart TV streaming over the
Internet
they've just announced a new partnership
with Gaikai which is a streaming game
company competitor 2 on life that's
owned by gamestop and so you can see
some of the games they've got in the
library here although LG is not yet
announcing what games they're going to
offer but it's not going to be gai Kai's
an entire library chances are pretty
good at least this is what guy Kai tells
us that they're going to pick games that
are compatible with the standard USB
game pads and that's probably because
that's how you play games on the system
you use a standard USB gamepad either
wired plugging the USB into the TV or if
you've got a wireless gamepad as a USB
dongle as you can see here the game is
load up fairly quickly we've already
gotten through our standard splash
screens and whatnot guy tells us that
they optimized for a low latency and so
even if they have to sacrifice a little
bit of image quality no matter what they
want to have the shortest latency
possible so that they can have the most
responsive games possible and so they
don't do much caching and whatnot
this should launch on LG Smart TVs later
on this year on the late 2012 models and
we don't know pricing structure yet they
haven't announced that yet so we don't
know what games will be free if you'll
need to pay if there'll be a
subscription service or what so here it
is this is a Gaikai service running
directly natively on an LG Smart TV
without any extra boxes attached thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
