much every phone has it now just take
your phone you drop it on the pad and it
starts charging like magic except it's
real but if you're actually going to buy
a charger for the first time it can be a
little intimidating there's a whole
bunch of specs you need to think about
stuff like wattage and how many coils it
has charging speed looks like what the
form factor is and it can just be really
confusing to just go to the store and
buy one go on Amazon it my one if you're
looking to cut the cord it the first
time and again you should it's great
here's a couple things that you're gonna
want to think about when you're buying a
charger first off cheap it's spelled Qi
and it's the wireless charging standard
your phone uses it basically every
charger out on the plan is going to use
it but just double check to make sure
it's there you'll save yourself some
time later the most important spec for
buying a wireless charger though is how
much power can it push now base charging
for cheese starts at 5 watts which is
fine a lot of devices support fast
charging so Apple phones like the iPhone
10 are 10s can support up to seven and a
half watts which will charge faster
assuming your pad can support it Samsung
phones go up to nine watts some Android
phones even go up to 10 watts pixel
phones basically only just fast charge
with the pixel stand which is a limit
from Google
sorry pixel owners but generally
speaking you're gonna want to make sure
that to get the fastest possible
experience you want at least 10 watts
from any charger you buy there's lots of
different form factors out there for
wireless chargers and where you plan on
using yours is probably gonna help
determine what kinds you want so if
you're planning on charging your phone
by your desk a lot you'll probably want
to standing one where you'll easily be
able to see the screen of your phone
without craning over if you're hoping
for one by your bed though to charge
overnight you'll probably want a flat
charger so that your phone isn't
standing up and blinding you every time
someone text you at you in the morning
and if you're indecisive or just want
the flexibility there are pads that
convert from flat standing so you can
get the best of both
another thing you might want to look out
for when you're buying a wireless
charger is how many charging coils it
has now there's two ways this can affect
your experience the first is for
chargers that are still only meant to
charge one device but still have
multiple coils the advantage here is
that having multiple coils will make it
easier to find that sweet spot where it
lines up and actually charges on the
other hand there are also devices like
Samsung's dual charger that have
multiple separate coils so you can
charge multiple devices at once so if
you have two phones or a phone to
SmartWatch you want to charge at the
same time that might be a good option
for you most wireless chargers use a
standard adapter to plug into walls
which is great
most of them use micro USB or some newer
ones even USB see which is really useful
because those are standard cables which
means that you can easily swap them out
if you need a longer one or you break
yours but some Chargers use weird
proprietary ones or even have cables
embedded directly into a device which
you probably will want to avoid unless
you really can't in that same vein
you're also going to want to look at
what kind of wall brick comes with your
charger if it comes with one at all
a lot of companies don't include a brick
in the box which can be frustrating
because if you only have a 5 watt brick
for your 10 watt wireless charger it
won't matter that your charger can fast
charge your phone because it won't have
the power supply to do that and if
you're hoping to save money by buying a
cheaper charger that doesn't come with a
brick just remember that unless you
already have a high watt charger with
you you'll probably end up just having
to buy a new one anyway which means you
haven't really saved any money at all
wireless chargers come in all sorts of
weird shapes and sizes materials and
designs so a lot of it also just comes
down to personal preference
do you like leather get a fancy leather
charger do you like fabric get a fabric
one you want one that just charges your
phone get a cheap plastic one now
obviously there's going to be some
variation between chargers some will
still charge slightly faster than others
but for the most part if you follow this
you'll end up with a great wireless
charger personally my favorite charger
is this raw power one which we've
written about over on this is my next on
the site thanks for watching and be sure
