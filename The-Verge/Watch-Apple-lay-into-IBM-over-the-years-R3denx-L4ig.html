of IBM and puts those together there's
no overlap there's no competition but
they're totally complementary and we
found a kindred spirit and in IBM and I
am so happy we did
we've come for 30 years ago being
competitors to today being incredibly
complimentary IBM's first product was
terrible it was really bad
in 1977 IBM dismisses the personal
computer as too small to do serious

highly sophisticated office computer and

this is Macintosh from Apple also a
highly sophisticated office computer and

all you have to do is learn this it is
now 1984 well big blue dominates the

about 1984 I think we fit together like
a puzzle</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
