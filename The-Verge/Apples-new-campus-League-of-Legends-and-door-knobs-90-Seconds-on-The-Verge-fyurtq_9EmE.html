November 20th 2013 I'm Nathan psycho den
why don't you spend the next 90 seconds
with me on the verge Apple has received
final approval for its plans spaceship
campus from the city of Cupertino by
agreeing to build the so-called campus
to Apple enter into a 20-year long
development deal with the city you know
I personally don't think it matters if
you use Android or iOS what's most
important is that we build a world of
unity a world of 10 did you happen to
catch the league of legends season 3
World Championship last October because
millions of other people did bubbly the
October fourth event has claimed the
title of largest eSports event ever a
whopping 32 million viewers watched the
live stream CBS's live stream of the
super bowl from this past year attracted
only 3 million unique viewers of course
I didn't catch the broadcast I was too
busy caught up in the works of Oscar
Wilde I'm into literature and finally
before we get going I have to tell you
about what Vancouver is doing the
Canadian city is banning doorknobs
starting in march 2014 all new buildings
erected in the city will have to include
lever handles on their doors rather than
the rounded knobs with this move the
city hopes to make buildings more
accessible to those with disabilities or
dexterity issues I think it's really
great what the city is doing I don't
know if I mentioned this before but I
volunteer at a soup kitchen on the
weekends that's it for today's top
stories coming up tomorrow we do this
again you got my number</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
