we've seen everything from modular
phones to exploding phones even an
iPhone that can get wet and even those
smartphones have been part of our lives
for nearly a decade now there's still a
lot of interesting things happening with
them now so much going on with phones it
can be hard to figure out which is the
right phone for you after all it's
harder than ever to buy a bad phone at
this point any phone you can buy in a
store is going to have great screen
reliable battery life fast performance
and a camera that can take incredible
photos but there's still one phone that
stands out when you consider all the
factors that are important build quality
reliability camera apps and support
after you buy it and it's by having a
similar design as its predecessors and a
couple of new annoyances the iPhone 7
and its bigger sibling the 7 plus are
the best phones for the most people they
are exceptionally well built they have
fast reliable performance they have
batteries that will get most people
through a full day of use and they have
a camera that's as good as anything else
out there you can even get the iPhone
wet this year so if you spill your beer
on it or drop it in a puddle you don't
have to worry about it then the iPhone 7
is familiar-looking and it works pretty
much like every other iPhone before it
but it's also the smart phone that has
the least amount of headaches it also
has great customer support if something
goes wrong or breaks you can just walk
into an Apple store and get it fixed the
two phones are largely identical except
for 130 dollars more the 7 plus gives
you a bigger screen a bigger battery and
a second camera which lets you zoom in
closer on your subject or perform DSLR
type of effects the decision between the
two really comes down to whether you
want a big phone or not and it's really
up to you but not everything is perfect
with the iPhone 7 the biggest annoyance
is the fact that it doesn't have a
headphone jack anymore which means that
you need to use the included earbuds the
included adapter with a different set of
headphones or go entirely wireless it's
a nuisance I will either be a
deal-breaker or not an issue at all
depending on how you use your phone the
despite that shortcoming the iPhone 7 is
still the phone I recommend to the most
people it's a slightly better iPhone
which means that it's a really good
thing but what if you don't want an
iPhone or you really do want a headphone
jack then you should check out google's
new phone the pixel like the iPhone 7
the Google pixel comes in two sizes has
a great screen fast performance great
battery life and a great camera it also
has a headphone jack
it's the best Android phone ever made
and it's the closest thing you can get
to an it just works experience in
Google's world the pixel pixel Excel are
largely identical but for one hundred
and thirty dollars more the excel comes
with a larger screen and a larger
battery but they still have the same
performance software and cameras now as
good as a pixel is are two things
keeping it from the top this year its
lack of water resistance and the fact
that Verizon is the only carrier in the
u.s. selling it if you want to use a
pixel on ATT Sprint t-mobile or another
carrier you have to buy it directly from
Google which means you can't just walk
into a store something goes wrong still
it's an excellent device and it's the
one I use every day but wait I know what
you're thinking it's 2016 and both of
those phones are well over $600 are you
saying that I still need to spend a
fortune to get a great phone the answer
is no and there are a lot of great
phones for $400 or even less
there's the Moto X play with its modular
design and killer battery life or the
pint-sized powerhouse iPhone se from
Apple but the best phone in this group
is from a company you've probably never
heard of it's the oneplus 3 the oneplus
3 has the design and finish of a six or
$700 phone it's got a great screen great
performance great camera and great
battery life you'd really be shocked at
how good it is for this price it does
have limits so the oneplus 3 only works
with AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile and the only way
to buy it is directly from oneplus
itself which doesn't have the best
reputation for support but unlike the
iPhone 7 or samsung s7 line you can't
get the oneplus three wet at all but for
half the price of an iPhone galaxy or
pixel it's really hard to find fault
with it and whether you spend $400 or
$900 you're going to get a modern
capable smartphone that will last you at
least a couple of years now for most
people the best phone is still the
iPhone 7 but if you go with the pixel or
even the oneplus you're going to be just
as happy you ready yeah okay
I hate you so much
it sounds so much better ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
