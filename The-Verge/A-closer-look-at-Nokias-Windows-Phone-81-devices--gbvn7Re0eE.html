and we're looking at nokia's new windows
phone 8.1 devices the first one is the
Lumia 930 and which sees it looks kind
of like the Lumia icon on verizon so
same 5-inch 1080p display but what knock
is done here is at the rear of the
device you've got a lot of color so this
is an orange model there's also a bunch
of other colors including green they've
got the same 20 megapixel camera on the
back here and it's the same sort of
rectangular block e fill with metallic
edges it's actually basically a Lumia
icon for the rest of the world now the
second device that Nokia's announced
today is the Lumia 630 and out the out
the two this is the this is a new device
so to speak and first thing you notice
obviously it's got some on-screen
buttons that's new to Windows Phone 8.1
it's also got dual sim support so you've
got the two separate tiles for each sim
here and two separate tiles for the
messaging now so you can link the two
but that's just to allow people to swat
in the two sims and aside from that a
4.5 inch display at the front here and
at the back you got matte finish and
some crazy in living color here it's a
lot like the nokia X and it kind of
looks similar to the Lumia 620 as well
so you've got kind of angler taped at
the back there 5 megapixel camera at the
rear and other than that it's a it's a
kind of standard Windows Phone device
aside from these on-screen buttons that
allow you to navigate around and get
into things like Cortana so it was a
quick look at the Nokia Lumia 630 and
the Nokia Lumia
on foot</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
