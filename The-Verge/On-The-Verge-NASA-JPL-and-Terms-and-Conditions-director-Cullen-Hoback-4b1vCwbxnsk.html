Joshua Topolsky and you're a rhesus
monkey named Mallory we've got a cool
show today
Colin hoback the director of terms and
conditions may apply a new documentary
sat down with Nilay Patel and in just a
little bit I will be talking to our
writer TC Sadiq who took a trip to
NASA's Jet Propulsion lab in Pasadena
we're gonna take a look at that and when
we come back I'll be here in the studio
with TC so let's get to it we're
standing here on Mars with NASA's
Curiosity rover okay we're not really on
Mars so this is really curiosity's
sister robot but we are at curiosity's
home base NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena California
and while Rovers like this one have
captured the imagination of humans
across the planet scientists at JPL have
even more ambitious goals to one day
have more than a billion human beings in
space
my name is Scott Davidoff I'm
responsible for delivering the user
interfaces for the systems that command
the JPL spacecraft and the challenge is
that the next generation of Rovers and
exploration vehicles are going to be
tasked with doing many many things as
opposed to just one thing I mean sounds
like you're describing basically
remote-controlled
robotic avatars for people well
sometimes that's what it's like though
the avatars aren't always like humanoid
and so the mapping isn't always as real
as natural as a hand to a hand so what
are the biggest challenges you're you're
facing right now trying to translate
human embodiment to robot embodiment
probably the hardest is the delicacy of
certain manipulations and then being
able to not have a full picture of the
environment
so what are you doing with occulus when
I show you three demos today the first
one is seeing through the eyes of the
rover so this is the first experience
we're showing you basically stereo
paired image warped on to a cylindrical
display you can see or your arm you can
see the pebbles on the distance a more
textured environment the more really
pops out at you from something like this
it's much easier to discern whether the
objects in front of you or it's the left
or behind you as opposed to just looking
at it in a 2d window this is incredible
detail from these photos hopefully you
get a good feel what it's like to be on
lunch makes me want to take a hike here
now this is an International Space
Station so I've taken all the US modules
put them in here all right so I'm a
campus robot now that's Robonaut 2 it's
a humanoid robot astronaut that's on the
space station to have helped astronauts
do work that's a copula it's one of the
windows to look outside well now you're
outside this is the entire space station
there you're looking at earth if you
swim around and you see the Sun of the
moon
this one's a little simpler we're gonna
start you out at Gale Crater again but
this time it's a thirty interactivity
environment this is one of the ones
where we think multiplayer could be
really cool is if a lot of people could
be in the same environment exploring
that environment alongside
this robotic avatar which is our Rover
it's very cool I can just feel my
stomach drop when I go up and down so
we're standing here in front of one of
the athletes one of the triathletes
actually athlete is a six legged vehicle
it's actually two robots that combine
together to make one six legged vehicle
right now we have it in the single
three-legged position it was originally
designed as a a multi-purpose robot to
do things like cargo offloading on the
moon so if you imagine you have a lunar
lander that comes down and your cargo is
usually on top of the lander you need to
get that cargo off the top the two
triathletes can come up alongside take
that cargo up move it to wherever you
want and put that down what that enables
you to do is to build a larger base on
the moon from smaller pieces one of the
challenges of you know landing on an
asteroid is that bastards have very low
gravity and if you come down and as you
come to a close approach if you use your
thrusters to slow yourself down you can
kick up all kinds of dust and debris and
that will you know confuse your sensors
cause all sorts of trouble the other
thing is that because they're low
gravity as you come down you have a
tendency to really really bounce and
these bounces can have really long
periods and asteroids are generally on
these these really long periodic orbits
of the Sun so you don't have that much
time to do your science because if that
asteroids on a 60-year trajectory you've
got to land on that asteroid do your
science and get off otherwise you're not
coming back for another sixty years
believe it or not landing a robot on an
asteroid isn't the most difficult
problem nASA has to solve how do you
control a robot that's so far away that
it might take as much as 20 minutes for
a signal to reach it we have systems
that help an operator to predict what
the robot is going to do and understand
the uncertainty and what it might
accomplish that's that uncertainties
being introduced by that that delay but
still accomplish their goals in an
efficient fashion
this is a prototype that we've designed
to allow people to control robotic
spacecraft like the athlete more
intuitively what's sort of unique about
this demo is that it's rendering a 3d
model in stereo much like if you go to a
3d movie you can see how things pop out
at you but one of the differences is
it's actually tracking where I put my
head so it creates a much more
holographic feel and I have a pin here
that's also tracked and so I can reach
into the space and I can actually grab
the robot and manipulate it around I can
grab it slims so we have joint by joint
control so I can sort of fly the robot
around and I can grab a single limb then
I can move a single joint you click on
its head and then click on the ground
you can actually laser things on the
ground so no demo would be complete
without being able to fire the laser I'm
feeling good about this projector a
name's Riley I've run and I've been an
intern here for now there's my fourth
summer and you developed this iPhone app
which makes this thing yeah exactly so
last summer that was my project they
said to me well controlling this thing
is kind of hard right now and kind of
confusing it takes a lot to keep people
in there a lot of different parties who
have an interest and driving the rover
around so making it you know easy enough
for like a media correspondent to drive
is a good is a good thing for us to do
so they said what's a good choice while
an iPhone is very ubiquitous the lab
hands them out if you don't have one so
you can you can get one real easily so
we use the iPhone this is a platform if
you guys have any positions open for
Rover pilots let me know this is my
resume
so this is one of our robots
it's the lemur robot and it has these
micro spine
claws we use that to climb rocks it's
the world's first rock climbing robot
this is a micro spying wheel each of
these little limbs here or legs has a
hook in it and those hooks grasp
asperities in the surface a little pips
ledges bumps protrusions and allow the
the robot to grip that surface and and
climb
the lemur robot is related to the to the
two-wheeled climber the difference here
is that this robot lemur is designed to
climb in any orientation so it goes
upside down it goes on vertical walls
and we're also talking about using it
for asteroids which would be zero
gravity so that's kind of how they're
related this one is we call it a power
tool for astronauts
you know drilling in microgravity is a
really hard problem because the normal
drills that we would use on Mars are not
able to be used in microgravity there's
no weight on bit you know normally when
you drill you're pushing into the
surface so on an asteroid with no
gravity you're just as likely to push
yourself away as you are to push force
onto the bit and it gets even worse when
you turn the drill on you're just as
likely to start spinning around the
drill as the drill bit is to start
spinning on the rock you know this is
kind of an early stage prototype of what
astronauts might one day use that at an
asteroid to acquire samples obviously
there's a lot of work to do before a
billion humans are controlling robotic
avatars of distant planets but the work
is beginning here and someday you might
be an observer in space using
technologies like those you might
already have in your home including the
Kinect the oculus rift or the leap
motion and if NASA's vision comes true
it won't just be robots or humans
exploring space independently it will be
an intimate partnership between two very
cool stuff from TC and from the lovely
people at JPL and joining us now in the
studio to talk about NASA and and maybe
TC is the delightful TC Sadiq TC thanks
for being here thanks so so explain to
me what just talk about what what makes
JPL unique I mean how is it different
than other parts of NASA or you know
frankly other government sort of run or
controlled experiment it's pretty well
what is what am I trying to say a
laboratory I could well it's a very big
area actually laboratories in the name
yes it's the only NASA Center that's
federally funded but not officially part
of the government it's managed by
Caltech California University and they
get to experiment they get to do you
know
some things a little looser yeah bring
in technologies from companies like
Microsoft and oculus is this stuff that
they're working on is it is it it's
private
is it going to private industry at all I
mean are they doing is that that
eventually trickles down I mean NASA in
general is working with private space
industry so that's definitely a
possibility but JPL is working on a
bunch of NASA missions exploration
science missions that includes Spirit
and Opportunity Rovers curiosity which
landed last year yeah a lot of
excitement yeah so they are working on
federally funded NASA projects so so my
impression was watching that piece it
reminded me of when I went to Microsoft
they are their R&amp;amp;D labs and they were
just kind of it seemed like there were
projects going on where they were just
like dumping some money towards a
researcher and just going like just do
some weird stuff just make something
crazy like people would just come up
with crazy ideas and they found a corner
somewhere in a building and they went
off and did it was that the impression
you got when you were there
um I think some of their methods look
like that like they definitely throw
stuff at the wall and have crazy ideas
but they do ultimately have to report to
Congress you were saying that you you
told me before that there was a guy who
ordered who got a bunch of fish hooks
there yeah they have different it's like
a college campus yeah basically they
have 5,000 plus employees there and then
a bunch of contractors but they have
different labs and projects going on all
over the campus and one of them was just
this crazy like mad workshop or they're
making climbing robots and they just
they found out that they could use fish
hooks on the legs to climb surfaces with
very small aspirations so there's like a
dam is on prime order right for 10,000
fish hooks
whenever I imagine some be ordering
something I just think like well they
must have gotten it I understand a
problem appreciate it I just I literally
just ordered soil from my backyard from
Amazon Amazon Prime they came in two
gigantic boxes this is uh totally
unrelated to NASA so so they're using a
lot of consumer technology there that's
something I was actually surprised by I
mean the oculus rift is not straight up
consumer at this point but it is
basically it's something that anybody
can own how much in the of course they
had this iPhone app I mean how much
consumer technology is being used and is
it just because it's cheaper or
you know is this stuff just not
available in some other form or what is
there you know there's a couple of
reasons they they're using these
technologies that are available first of
all it's cheaper because they don't have
to build them themselves available off
the shelf and the other part of the
mission is to educate the public and
bring the public into to what NASA is
doing and they see you know things like
connect and oculus which a lot of people
are gonna get their hands on as an
opportunity to connect with the public
right so you think that that part of the
appeal of using something off the shelf
is that it's more understandable to the
public to the sort of audiences go like
oh I have a Kinect in my living room
right now they're using for this or I've
seen the oculus rift for video games in
there I mean that oculus rift stuff did
seem really crazy to me I mean I don't
know what the experience is like but
watching you look at those the pictures
of Mars you seemed pretty blown away by
it
I mean is it is that a very different
experience than just just looking at
them on the screen
just zoom in you know it is and part of
it is knowing what they want to do with
it you know when they said they want to
bring a billion human beings into space
it's not that everybody's gonna get a
little blue man to control on some other
planet right it's more like you might be
sitting in your living room and you put
an oculus rift on your face and suddenly
you're looking at alive 20 minute delay
they literally get them into space right
I mean you know you could be in their
words standing on the shoulders of
curiosity in the future do they seem I
mean NASA has had a lot of funding
issues in the in the over the last
couple of decades really did you get a
sense that they're underfunded they're
that they're struggling to do some of
these projects I think you know they're
not government employees but they're
close to the government and they tend to
be wary of suggesting that but I think
they obviously could do a lot more if
they had more funding right um one of
the interesting things having been there
is that you know a lot of people have
been kind of outraged that the shuttle
programs are gone and that they they
don't see human beings going into space
but from their perspective robot
exploration really is the future of
human exploration in space it's in their
words it's a it's going to be a human
robot partnership not one or the other
right but the robots actually gonna be
there in the humans
be sitting at home well our first human
explorers to Mars might be sitting in
something similar to the ISS the
International Space Station above Mars
controlling robots right below still not
on the surface of Mars themselves though
but it's a stepping stone they have it
do they have a timeline for humans to
get to Mars I mean what is their current
timeline I don't actually know I would
have been the first thing I asked well I
think I'm going to watch it now you can
tell hello to anybody and just said when
do you when our humans gonna be on Mars
well if you'd elected Newt Gingrich
Gingrich yeah right he could he could
have built his colony his space colony
so what's the what's the future of would
you what was your take away here do you
have a sense of the future of space
exploration obviously it's this robot
human partnership do you get a sense
that they want to go further faster and
are there projects that they're working
on that are gonna put us further out
into space or does it feels like Mars
has become sort of a stopping point
right I mean there's so many so but
there are so many challenges to solve on
both ends you know getting the robots
there is hard enough but being able to
control them in real time when you have
a 20-minute signal delay is a ridiculous
problem to be resolved so they have to
solve things like that before space but
you know even the private missions that
have proposed going to Mars have had
everyone up against things like you know
radiation which will kill people on the
way there potentially so yeah there's a
lot they have to figure out but for me
the universe is really working against
us when it comes to trying to get to
Mars well T see the piece is awesome and
thanks so much for being here to talk
about it really appreciate it up next
something very exciting earlier this
week Nilay Patel sat down with director
Colin Howe back he's the director of a
film called terms and conditions may
apply which is very interesting and
analyzed conversation is fascinating
we've got a clip from the movie and
after that and he'll I will be talking
to Colin check it out doing a privacy
change for 350 million users yeah is is
a really you know it's it's not of him
so I would take the thing that a lot of
companies would do we decided that these
would be the social norms now and we we
just went for it
Google is effectively a $500 a year
service because that's the value of the
data that you're providing if they use
10 percent of that data they're going to
be the most valuable company ever how
many's that you've never claimed to have
about 1,500 points of data on the
average American citizen is it hard to
go through it and actually find specific
details about a person no that's super
easy within a couple of minutes you can
figure out what people voted for about
psychological problems they have what
party stuff things you Center have been
contract decisions they've held that
these terms and conditions are valid and
what if your phone came with these long
terms that condition said well if you
use the phone the government can wiretap
you that would be insane but that's the
kind of world we're living in anything
that's been digitized is not private and
that is terrifying for the government to
get information from a Google or
Facebook is a lot easier than the
government doing it itself and putting a
wiretap on our phones you have to put
these powers into somebody's hands like
social networks in recent times if you
have something that you don't want
anyone to know maybe you shouldn't be
doing it in the first place that's
always what scared me was if there's
some sort of automated system and just
red flags you based on the search term
you can see that surveillance measures
are being used to silence protests
before they even happen boom NYPD smart
bulletproof vests under guns drawn I was
like are you being serious
are you actually holding me because of a
tween so we were locked away in the
police station for 25 hours all these
powerful institutions they're not
subject to the same the same invasions
of privacy as the rest of us are so far
the population seems fine with it if
they weren't I they know who to call
straining out got Colin ho back director
of terms and conditions may apply how
you doing good good well you see seem
surprised well I'm just I'm just I had
to sign this agreement just to come into
your building right yes I'm a little I'm
a little honored about that actually it
wasn't too bad it's nothing like the the
one you have to sign to get into
Google's building so well we just asked
for the your first run child Google
wants two or three children at least so
let's talk about this movie I used to be
a lawyer so the fact that you've made a
movie about contracts speaks to me not a
lot of people make a movie about
contracts why why did you decide this
movie anyway because there's a contract
associated with everything we do in the
digital world now and I think that
that's been happening over time and we
just ignore them you know but most
contracts in our lives of you if you're
presented with and you actually
understand that you're legally agreeing
to something you might actually gloss
over it especially something that is
taking such personal information from
you do you think the services are
acquired because once you think the
services are acquired
it's like operate in the world then that
contract I think becomes way more
important yeah I mean I think you know
the situation right now is either you
get the service you don't and to be a
modern participant in society in many
cases you need to be using these
services well so you don't put some of
these services and I just I guess my
question is if you're gonna run a
photo-sharing service like an Instagram
which comes up in your movie if you're
gonna run a photo sharing service like
Facebook or Google+ or whatever at some
point you need a license to like take
people's photos and use them to run your
service and copy them among your servers
and like show them to other people which
is kind of the point of the services so
you need some kind of contract sitting
there how would you run an Instagram
without like putting that kind of
contract in place like is that even
possible first off they don't need to be
designed to be totally illegible or
readable you know completely impossible
to to navigate and that's what I'm
really getting out with the film you
know the films not really about contract
so the film is really about is the
underlying intent of those contracts
what we're giving to the corporation's
how they share our information what's
going on in the background and what the
government can do with that information
the film is coming out you know it's
kind of like a blessing and a curse the
films coming out into this environment
of like these leaks about prism and the
NSA right which is like it's I guess
great for your movie bad for society
that like these things are happening
well the bad things have been happening
for a long time I mean I made the film
before these things were even revealed
right you know and I think that the film
shows that the NSA has actually been
going much further than even what these
recent revelations have shown us right
so the question I had was at the
beginning of your movie you point out
that in 2001 there was a wave of privacy
legislation in Congress mhm
and then obviously September 11th
happened it you know towards the end of
2001 and all of that legislation like
died on the vine went away and instead
we got the Patriot Act and you draw kind
of a line directly from the Patriot Act
and that sort of sponsored surveillance
to face with Google pretty specifically
Google changing their privacy policies a
well we we actually will keep data about
you and share when required do you think
are we still feeling those effects like
that I mean that the prism stuff the NSA
stuff that feels like a direct lineage
of the Patriot Act but to to draw the
line from that to how Google keeps your
data these companies point of the
Patriot Act they point advice' and they
say look we we have to retain this data
because of because of these laws and and
that's been going on for a long time now
but as long as we have to retain this
information let's make some money on it
in the meantime
so I think that's why we haven't seen
any pushback from from the big tech
companies that have make a maid of
fortune off of user information because
in reality is undermining of civil
liberties that's gone on it has has
produced billions and billions of
dollars and then you see legislators who
may really care about civil liberties in
the state of California for instance
going walking around in and oh my gosh
this is really important revenue to the
state so then they don't make any
changes and I think that you know asking
the question does the surveillance work
is it stopping terrorism we're asking
the question does the data that these
tech companies are collecting make a ton
of money those are not the right
questions to be asking the first
question should be our civil liberties
being violated if the answer to that
question
yes then something is how did you go
about answering that question these are
all independent companies at some point
shadow profiles on Facebook aside I do
get to choose what service I use okay
and the people seem to be overwhelmingly
choosing this small handful of companies
and there isn't really a market for a
more private search engine there isn't
really a market for a more privacy
focused social network I've seen 100 so
I think I mean I've seen lots of
startups show up and like we're gonna be
the privacy phobia social network but do
you burn out because people didn't
understand the implications up until
right now I don't know the film will
help them understand the implications a
little bit more I mean I do think that
the next 10 years are going to show us
that a lot of innovation can occur in
the privacy space because even if a
collection of the data for Google makes
also their service better right I mean
isn't that kind of the important piece
there we should have a much easier
choice in that like do you want to
participate do you want to grant them
that information so that you can get the
the benefit as an opt-in instead of an
opt-out I really think that there are
solutions to these things obviously a
lot of them are smart people graduating
right now I may not have all of the
answers but I do think one idea is this
idea of data mobility the idea that you
could basically take your entire data
set from a Facebook to somewhere else I
think that's actually one of the things
that's really limiting people from being
able to leave Facebook is they feel
trapped do you think that it's literally
your data that's keeping you there or is
it the fact that everyone else is there
I think it's your ability to reach out
to people I mean in some ways it's
becoming more and more of an advertising
tool the Facebook's and the googles of
the world ultimately what we're giving
them is granting access to this this
third party and it's it's which is the
government and it's hard at this point
to separate the two how do we how do we
fix that right I think one technique is
to pressure the corporations into
pressuring the government the problem is
that right now their business models
rely on this data so I think that user
is open push that's the problem with the
business models rely on the data or is
the problem that the government can get
it without due process and warrants and
so at some point don't you want these
corporations to be able with it to give
you the benefits of the big data and
give you the benefits of like Gmail
having endless
cloud storage but then prevent the
government from doing something
intrusive that violates our civil
liberties I think it's finding a balance
yeah you know and right now we've gone
way too far and I think that there are
trade-offs convenience and security are
a trade-off for privacy right like Obama
said recently you can't have a hundred
percent of security and 100% privacy I
think the best sort of analogy is how
many people die from cars every year
right we like in America alone it's
around 30,000 but we keep using cars
because we really love cars so these are
things that are a trade-off and in order
to have a responsible government I think
that privacy is necessary okay so let's
talk about maybe for a second comes out
Friday Friday July 12 in New York but
then it opens up more widely after that
and then we also have something going on
right now which is designed to get
congressmen to watch the movie so there
is a petition that you can go to and
sign it track off dot us we're working
with demand progress on that and the
objective is yet to get as many people
on Capitol Hill to watch it because I
don't think that they really understand
these issues many of them you know it's
funny because I we do every hearing on
privacy we cover in advance it's always
just a show it's partially it's
like a legal story and especially it's
like a technology story and they clearly
don't understand other aspect of it
right I mean and that's what I'm really
trying to do with this film the show how
that you know this sort of evolution of
the the tech and the and the government
worked and and and how it's not like
they were working together necessarily
to make this current state it's that
they were both benefiting from it so
much so the film really does chronicle
the death of privacy and how we got to
where we got and I think that a lot of
people ask this question right I have
nothing to hide so why does it matter
right if it's it's stopping terrorism
then what's the big deal and I think
that the film answers that question
there's a lot of cases in the movie of
perfectly innocent people's lives being
upended because of some tweet they made
right writer from cold gas it's a really
great example right ER from cold case
who was searching for things like
decapitated bodies and how to kill my
wife wife killer and all this stuff
steak and steak and cheese happens in
the middle and you know he's
a writer a cold case and it's very easy
for the things we do in a digital space
to be taken out of context and something
that can be taken out of context is
problematic especially when these
systems are designed to be preventing
crime from happening right at home thank
you so much the film comes out July 12
go to attack my net and request a
screening which you definitely should
also search for it on Google and post
for it on social networks to let the man
know you care thank you so much
if you that is our show I want to thank
Collin Hoback for being here Nilay and
TC NASA for just letting us walk into
their labs and you the human being who
used their eyes to watch this
we'll be back next week with more on the
verge and until then there is no until
then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
