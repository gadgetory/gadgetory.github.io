yours android based game console Ouya
has ended its Kickstarter campaign with
over 63,000 backers and 8.5 million
dollars raised the $99 console designed
by Yves Behar has garnered support from
game companies like Square Enix Namco
Bandai and online 8.5 million dollars is
an impressive figure but it still
doesn't top the pebble smartwatches
record-breaking 10.3 million dollar
campaign from earlier this year the ouya
is expected to ship in April of 2013 if
you didn't back the Kickstarter you can
still pre-order for a hundred and nine
dollars Lenovo is celebrating 20 years
of the thinkpad brand by announcing its
first Windows 8 tablet the 10.1 inch
slate has a matching stylus and keyboard
stand it also uses an Intel processor
which means it will have full Windows
desktop functionality the so-called
ThinkPad Tablet 2 is due out in late
October around the same time as Windows
8 itself so far lenovo has said it's
unfazed by Microsoft's plan to launch
its own surface tablets the company says
it's focused more on business customers
and not consumers we finally google has
agreed to pay the FTC 22.5 million
dollars to settle privacy charges
related to Apple Safari browser earlier
this year Google was caught lying the
safari users installing cookies to
display targeted advertising regardless
of the users privacy settings 22.5
million is the largest fee the FTC has
ever collected but the Wall Street
Journal estimates Google made that much
revenue every five hours last year
justice may be blind but it's also
relative that's it for today's top
stories tune in tomorrow for the
thrilling conclusion</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
