Android which is the first version of a
proper Chrome browser for the mobile
platform and this is obviously running
on Ice Cream Sandwich on the Galaxy
Nexus and it's not yet the default
browser for the platform but it seems
like Google wants to make this the
default browser once they get some of
the kinks worked out so the browser
looks pretty similar to the other the
current Android browser you can see here
it's displaying some sites in their
mobile versions here's New York Times in
its desktop version and it's pretty fast
it actually scored higher or lower
rather in SunSpider than the previous
Android browser and the iPhone 4s
browser some stuff works really well
some stuff doesn't work that well our
page which is a little bit heavier and
also utilizes Typekit does not display
100% correctly they still don't have
Typekit working properly for the Android
browser so you get almost everything
looking right but then you end up with
some of our fonts not rendering properly
but in terms of pinch to zoom and tap to
zoom it seems to be working pretty well
though there are some some weird hiccups
like you're seeing right here obviously
it does tab browsing as you can see here
you can get through tabs by swiping on
the edges these are the tabs I have open
there's also a way to see all of your
tabs by hitting the tab button and you
get this handy a little tab viewer which
is actually quite useful you can swipe
tabs you don't want out of the way and
in fact you can you can use multi-touch
here so you can take a look at one while
you're hiding others and it's a neat
visual effect but it actually has some
some basis in reality and and usability
another new feature they added that's
pretty cool is the ability to more
accurately tap on clusters of text so if
you have an area where there's a bunch
of small text near each other it'll
actually zoom in on it to let you get a
more accurate selection that works
pretty well most of the time sometimes
it's a
be a little flaky in fact the browser
itself is a little bit flaky it's in
beta right now so I think it's leading
to some weird hiccups and stutter enos
that hopefully won't be in the final
version of it once this makes it to
devices
it still feels like a really fast light
browser one of the coolest features
they've added here is a new ability to
sync with other devices so when you're
opening tabs you can go to this mode
this right here this folder with the
arrows and it actually will sync with
other Chrome browsers on other devices
you have so in this case my computer is
synced and these are the tabs I have
open on my computer right now and it
keeps those up-to-date it updates every
so often and you can basically play
shift your session it has specific URLs
that load up this will work with an
Android tablet or with computers where
you've signed in with your Google
account and you're using Chrome it's a
pretty nice feature it also gives you
access if you're if you are logged in it
gives you access to your bookmarks that
you've got here's my some blogs that
I've bookmarked that are on my desktop
and you obviously have access to them
here in the browser so another cool new
feature that Google is added is the
ability to prefetch some web content
when you're on Wi-Fi and using a synced
account using the auto predict here
apparently when you start typing here
and it's looking at the possible sites
you might pull down it's grabbing some
data as well and so it should improve
load times this site we had loaded up
earlier so that might be part of the
cache there but overall I have noticed
that sites seem to be loading a little
bit faster all in all it's a really nice
effort from Google it shows a lot of
visual polish some of the browsing can
be less than perfect and hopefully
that's just stuff they need to work out
in the beta but for now I've switched my
default browser to Chrome Beta and I
don't think I'll be going back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
