are here in Barcelona Spain checking out
the project tango developer device is a
built by a company named Ovidius and a
partnership with Google to develop this
thing and really what's cool about this
is it is taking the motion tracking and
computer vision technologies that we've
seen for a few years maybe in things
like the Mars rover project to use
mapping surfaces and shrunk it down into
a device that you can hold in your hand
and be powered by a mobile battery as
far as technology goes for it's really
the the key here are the cameras and
imaging sensors it's got a standard four
megapixel camera here which captures
full-color images and then it's paired
with an IR sensor and receiver here to
capture the depth and measurements of
spaces and rooms and other things and
then you've got a tracking camera here
which is a low resolution tracking
camera for tracking objects Google is
actually releasing this for developers
to be able to take these technologies
and build applications on to take the
data that's being pulled in from these
cameras and sensors and then build
applications some of the things that you
can do are pretty cool you can actually
in real time map the depth of a room
this is a pretty basic demo that shows
further objects are in blue where closer
objects aren't red and you can see that
kind of changes as I move the camera
around from there you can extrapolate
things like distances and other things
so if you're mapping the size of a room
and creating a 3d model you can get
accurate sizes other things I can do is
a depth sensor as well so this you can
see this is a blasting and IR pulse
across the room to measure the depth of
the room in in a matter of seconds and
it's able to feed that information back
to the camera and back to the phone and
then can be used in an application it
almost looks like a sci-fi type of
scanning going on one of the the other
things that you can do is capture real
time 3d modeling over
it's able to capture a low-resolution
picture and then it uses the motion
sensors and the vision sensors to build
a 3d model as you pan around the room
you can see things that are further away
and closer in front of us here we've got
a table and you can see it's building
that table just as I pan around with the
camera Google is looking to get this
into developers hands in the very near
future within the next month or so and
then it's really up to developers to
come up with cool applications that take
advantage of all of this technology and
all of this data that's on tap
we've seen some companies already have
announced and come up with apps that are
able to map out a space and build a 3d
model for room planning and other
features but it's a it should be
interesting to see how developers are
able to take advantage of all of this
technology and make it useful to us so
there you go that's a look at the Google
tango device with some really cool
computer vision technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
