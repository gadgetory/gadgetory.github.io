here looking at the latest flagship
smartphone from Huawei the p10 now the
p10 comes in two sizes this one I've got
in my hand is a 5.1 inch 1080p display
but there's also a larger model the p10
plus which has a 5.5 inch screen so
you've got a volume rocker and unlock
button on the side is a type-c USB port
on the bottom and here we've got a home
button which also has a fingerprint
scanner built into it
both the p10 and the p10 plus empowered
by Huawei's own octa-core Kirin 960
processor which as we've seen before in
other Huawei devices is about as fast as
they come the smaller p10 has four
gigabytes of RAM with a 64 gigabyte
storage while the larger p10 bumps that
up to six go by of RAM and 128 gigabytes
of storage on the back of the phone
you've got far ways like a branded dual
camera system which again we've seen on
previous Huawei devices it's got a
number of cool tricks including a
portrait mode that keeps the foreground
in focus while blowing out the
background there's also an improved
front-facing camera which Huawei says is
optimized for selfies in terms of design
it's hard not to look at the v10 and be
reminded of the iPhone and that's not a
criticism it's got these discreet
antenna lines at the bottom smooth
rounded edges that feel great in hand
and unlike the iPhone it's available in
a number of new colors including blue
and green pretty unusual for a
smartphone with the p10 and the p10 plus
Huawei is also introducing a new finish
on the back that it calls hyper
diamond-cut now it's a bit of an exotic
name but the effect is basically giving
the back metal a bit of texture while I
says it's more resistant to scratches
and it's less slippery in the hand
however whether you like how it feels or
not will be up to you the phone itself
is running Huawei's own Android skin and
comes with a number of neat software
features the most interesting of these
is probably who always machine learning
algorithms which analyse how you use the
phone over time and prioritized apps you
access most in order to keep
performances nice and sharp
I have to say that although the p10
looks beautiful and feels solid it's
just not that exciting why why hasn't
delivered any wild new design choices
here and overall the p10 feels very
similar to previous devices we've seen
from the company what we've got is
brilliant but it's not revolutionary the
p10 and the p10 plus will be going on
sale in Europe and other markets in
March but we have no word yet on us
availability the p10 will cost 649 euros
or around 685 dollars while the p10 plus
we'll go for 699 euros or around seven
hundred forty dollars that's all for the
moment but stay tuned to the verge for
more of the latest news from MWC</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
