bohn i'm dan seifert and i am chris
sigler but where is vlad today lat is
unavailable just unavailable I think I
think Vlad is what the Europeans call on
holiday oh right right right yeah well
god bless him he needs it so we're here
on a on a google hangout again and we
aren't without or without our producer
who is currently working on the verge
show right now so we're flying by the
seat of our pants and we clearly have no
idea what's going on so I don't know I
don't know if I don't know if I'd say
that I think that you're you're a fine
producer dieter that's very kind of you
to say very very nice of you you're so I
I have a conniver confession to make I
actually have not listened to last
week's show I'd tell me what happened
give me give me the Reader's Digest
version of what I missed um I believe we
spent we spent about five minutes
talking about BBM we talked a little bit
about the droid DNA we talked a little
bit about the nexus 4 and Sinofsky but
we basically spent about 30 minutes
making fun of you for buying a cyan
Lumia 920 that's fair that's fair which
by the way is no longer in my possession
I I believe we made fun of him for his
other purchase as well if I remember
correctly because of the nexus for
purchase I'm pretty sure we uh we
forward to you for that oh yeah no make
fun of me all you want I bet all y'all
would would love to have a nexus 4 right
about now not good it's not it's not the
nexus for purchase it's the fact that
you went bought it from a tmobile store
and paid an extra hundred and fifty
dollars for it oh yeah because more than
that I believe but yeah because they're
readily available right now and nobody
in the right mind would pay six hundred
dollars for a 16 gig Nexus 4 right now
yeah okay that's fair so so how are you
feeling now that you
currently own a nexus 4 I really don't
want it in my life and in fact I don't
have in my life anymore it's uh it's
gone I gotta say Chris it's it's really
remarkable how quickly you're able to
dispose of these devices like in one day
you're able to just like shed yourself
of you know Oh every smart how much of
your time of your day of your average
week is spent either purchasing or
getting rid of smartphones but you
probably somewhere between 80 and 85
percent i would estimate uh no i mean
it's so you know I I you know let me
just defend myself ok I felt obligated
to buy the nexus for last week because
it was there yeah and and that was at a
time you know there was the first day of
retail availability and I knew that they
were gonna be in short supply because I
I was in New York at the time and I
called the t-mobile store on
thirty-fourth Street so right across the
street from macy's i believe in herald
square and and they had five and she
said but they're going fast you know if
you want one you better hurry down here
i can't put one aside for you so I ran
down there and she's like you know okay
it's gonna be it's gonna be you know 499
+ taxon and what's your account number
and I'm like I don't have an account
with you and she's like well then I
can't sell it to you and I'm like fine
give me an account so uh so I bought one
month of prepaid which you know the
minimum for that phone is it you know
you need the 60 the sixty dollar plan to
activate that phone so I ended up
spending 500 + 60 plus tax and I felt I
felt very very bad about it but but
here's the thing i was like ninety-five
percent sure that's gonna take that
phone back to the office and just
immediately unload as like well you know
i did i did the hard work of like going
and getting the phone like I felt real
you know good about that because like I
called him like 20 minutes later they
were all gone because like you know I
don't want this thing surely somebody is
going to want it want to take it off my
hands and nobody did when they found out
that i paid six hundred dollars for it
I'm sure they would love to take it off
your hands for like three hundred and
fifty dollars plus tax yeah no doubt no
doubt I mean like good luck getting one
for 350 right now right so yeah I will
say that like I placed my order um on
the thirteenth and I am still in limbo I
haven't gotten a shipping email I got
the email saying it could be up to three
weeks and I'm just pretty sure Google is
trying to ruin my Thanksgiving possibly
ruin my Christmas uh and I'm afraid that
by the time Google actually ships this
thing I won't want any more the nexus 5
will be out the nexus 5 will be out
where like CES will be here and like
i'll see like a whole bunch of stuff
that i will want yeah okay so you you
manage to offload the nexus for you sold
it yeah the nexus 4 is gone the nexus 4
was out of my life and actually
interestingly i was saying on Twitter
this morning that i have for the first
time since I believe 2002 I don't own
any smartphone right now I am completely
if you call my my line right now it'll
go straight to voicemail the sim is
sitting in my in my living room right
now you don't have like an old phone you
can slap it in you only not a single
phone there's an n79 sitting right here
which I don't actually consider a smart
phone anymore by modern standards i
guess i could put it in here but apart
from that oh no no that's not true i
also have uh this um this c7 that rc6
that i tried to sell down a couple weeks
ago and he said yeah so I mean yeah I
wonder what options I technically have
options I just I choose not to exercise
them so okay um what's your plan because
you bought a 920 no good you bought a
Nexus 4 no good you seem to refuse to
accept a galaxy s3 or an optimist g or
an HTC One X or HTC one x+ like are you
gonna you are you gonna ban at eighteen
t are you gonna just give up on having a
smartphone what's your plan I think that
I snapped to be honest I think that I've
lost it I uh no because losing it would
be actually going out and buying like a
note 2 and using that seriously I'm not
real that's when you're out
that's when you're that's when you're
you know you've lost it or we know
you've lost it at least all options are
on the table at this point I uh I am
like so disillusioned by the smartphone
landscape right now uh like there's at
no time in history have there been so
many options that all like uh you know
shoot a glancing blow at perfection but
then end up failing miserably in one
word other he everything from the iphone
5 to the galaxy has three to the one x+
to the nexus 4 they all have at least
one fatal flaw and and I'm just getting
really sick and tired of it and I
finally snapped on Twitter last night
and leashed a long rant which I won't
recount here to spare our listeners but
the bottom line is that it's like you
know i'm just so like i'm so pissed that
this nexus 4 exists and it's like that
all the technology everything that is
required to run this phone on LTE exists
like this is not science fiction there's
not there's nothing there's nothing
preventing anybody from using from
creating this device with an elf with a
functional LTE radio in it other than
somebody's like stubbornest and or
somebody else's like political BS like
it and and I just you know I started
flipping tables last night and I really
haven't stopped since then and it's
gotten to the point where my sim is
sitting on a countertop that's where I
am right now in my life just like except
man just accept that you're gonna have
to settle no Chris doesn't know I'm not
I'm not settling I'm not accepting
anything you you were settled before the
nexus for existent you had this is true
not this man before he experimented with
a 920 and before he got into the nexus 4
he was actually quite settled from what
i could understand you were happy on the
iphone 5 yeah but I was but here's the
thing everybody including you and I were
like fiddling around saying oh you know
this is this is going to be a fun summer
we get to play with all these phones
before the next Nexus comes and makes
all of our web while this dreams come
true
then the nexus 4 comes and guess what it
doesn't fulfill any of our wildest
fantasies because it doesn't have LTE
radio in it I mean it and and those like
I dropped it over the weekend so it was
all scuffed I'm like I don't want this
stupid thing anymore like my life is
just in shambles theater and I blame
google it's entirely google's fault I
mean listen just look what I've got
right here I've got an HTC One X running
Android 4.1 it's pretty nice I I don't
want get your 1x out of my face yeah
look at this point I don't know even if
even if I guess they think he does still
sell the 1x but if I were to like I
would feel really bad about not buying
the 1x plus if I were to do that if I
were to get back into the HTC game right
now and then I'd have to deal with
unlocking because I really can't
tolerate set like of all the skin sense
is the one that I absolutely cannot
tolerate right so I'd have to get I have
to get rid of of the skin which means
i'd have to you know get into the whole
unlocking skinning thing cyanogenmod and
then on top of that is take with 3 i'm
not i don't want to take with free i
want an s4 pro uh-huh why don't you just
get an iphone 5 i'm done with this
conversation something else I mean I
want to help you ma'am I die I
appreciate that but but the the longer
the short of it is that I cannot be
called or texted right now and
everyone's just gonna have to deal with
it until I figure out what's going on
with my smartphone life I am unreachable
I'm off the end this also means like you
won't be able to leave your house
because we can't email you either right
right i guess i can go use like the
computer in a public library or
something but i definitely not I
definitely do not have a smartphone good
you should totally send a letter to paul
that's what you should do yeah many
people you in polar like very close no
that's yeah that's not a bad idea i'm
going to send him a postcard so maybe
you should switch to a droid DNA dan
recently reviewed it maybe he can
convince you uh yeah so the droid DNA i
reviewed this thing last week
and I spend a good amount of time with
it and actually still have it and I just
want you guys to notice um that it's
plugged in and charging right now ah and
you know it's a very solidly built
device it's got the best screen on the
market without a doubt that 1080p
display is phenomenal and I said this
numerous times in the review um and it's
got you know HD seized 8 megapixel
camera which is okay and it's got a
Snapdragon s4 pro quad-core processor
which benchmarks like through the roof
but uh it really doesn't have great
battery life and I'm reporting what I
saw a lot of people have you know
reached out and said that you know I
don't think it has his bad battery life
as you say and you know other people
aren't maybe aren't as critical on the
battery life as I was but uh it's for
about 450 now here on the East Coast and
I've had this thing on the charger for
almost an hour now because it is died or
was very close to dying today and that's
been my experience since I've had it I
ran our regular battery test but I also
did you know our real-world testing and
I've been using it for quite a few days
now and these results haven't changed
the battery life just really isn't that
great and I don't know what or to say
about that um this day and age if a
phone does not last me from 8am to 8pm
then sorry it's it's a non-starter bingo
bingo you are spot on my friend yeah and
I think that's being very generous
because I Mitch member so generous yeah
I much rather have it go until I
actually have to go to bed and like
charge it by my nightstand um and the
other things that I had an issue with
even though it's got that crazy fast
processor and benchmarks through the
roof it definitely just did not feel as
fast as a nexus 4 there are some serious
scrolling issues and a lot of apps
including Chrome for Android which is
like you know the browser and it just
didn't feel as fast overall opening apps
navigating the interface and things like
that and you know it's sense 4 plus
which
is sense for plus and I don't a guy I
really don't want to say terrible things
about this because I know a lot of
people do like sense but I'm just not a
fan of it uh and I really think it
buries Sean someone who likes sense show
me show me a human being who's like yes
I want a phone with sense who doesn't
work for HTC I was gonna say coming come
up with a couple thousand be you know uh
yeah two or three years ago sense was
great when Android was in version 1.6 or
you know two point O and an Android was
really ugly and kind of clunky but now
Android is not that is that as it's a
different Android than what we saw two
years ago or three years ago so it's
really kind of frustrating that sense
berries so much of what's good in
android 4.1 and as a matter of fact i
got so tired of the sense launcher by
sunday that i just said forget it and i
install the third party launcher on
there and and it's it's been a better
experience but still the battery dies so
i will say that the the dual
notification light is pretty baller yeah
oh god it's awesome we did talk about a
little bit last week I gave a little
preview of that um you can actually see
it's on notes where's my camera there it
is on the back charging and yeah that
was like my favorite hardware features
it's also in the front group so I think
that's awesome and I would love to see
that on more phones because I've never
seen that before but it's it's not
enough to make me recommend you go out
and buy this phone yeah so I mean this
phone is it I don't know if it's in like
it's not on the galaxy note 2 round how
big is the screen again is it so it's a
5-inch display and I think you know it's
it feels more like a 4.7 or four point
eight inch device than a galaxy note
like this is not a lot of people are
calling is that phablet term which I
actually loathe but this is not a tablet
crossover this is just a big smartphone
and I mentioned that in the review with
the software that HTC put on here it's
not attempting to be a tablet it doesn't
have a stylist it's really not competing
against the note 2 in my opinion it's
competing against the galaxy s3 and it's
competing against the Optimus G and
other phones that are in the 4.7 the
four point eight inch size range to the
credit did do a good job of
fitting a 5-inch screen in what feels
like a 4.7 inch phone but it's still
really big uh and then they also put the
power button on the top which I might
have complained about last week but I'm
gonna complain about it again cuz it's
terrible now I was just going to say
like it's all you know that's the droid
DNA in that body and it it's just I mean
does it feel thick to you do you feel
like like the solution would have been
to let it get just a little bit thicker
and get a removable battery or you know
just a bigger battery in there you know
it's not thick that's the thing it's
actually really thin it it's in measures
I think it's about nine point seven
millimeters at its thickest at the the
middle but then it tapers down to like
four mil oh man that I got you know
twenty five percent more battery or
whatever it might be um and I think we
said the same thing with the iphone 5 we
don't need it to be thinner we want it
to be longer lasting and it would have
been much more useful to me at least if
the battery lasted twenty five percent
longer than it does or more because 25
per cents not that much more for them
than what it does well it's the
difference between like a non-starter
and am I still here considering it yeah
we're having lag it's because we don't
have a real producer here you are a real
producer dieter you're giving yourself
too little credit yeah yeah apologize
guys uh apologies but okay I thought I
heard you dieter wow this is terrible um
what else can we talk about there's a
some other like so Steve Ballmer called
Android wild and uncontrolled and
susceptible to malware this week and you
know sure it's kind of I don't you guys
have anything that you want to say about
Ballmer's thoughts on android is it any
surprise that he's you know a tagging it
what i would do is go back to Ballmer's
comments on the i think that's really
much about nature yeah i agree um yeah
no go back to what he said about about
the
iphone but I mean did the thing the
thing that he's going after it being
wild uncontrolled and susceptible to
malware like is that the biggest knock
on android now that I mean is there
still like the app quality is there like
when people go after Android that's
that's what they're going to go for now
hinting at fragmentation and you know
spreading fear about malware I
personally I think the malware thing is
total fud I've never actually know did
we lose Dan I think we lost an yeah yeah
wait up so Dan was complaining about a
really bad connection in the studio
uh-uh he might he might be back yeah I
think that our new york studio is
suffering from a lackluster internet
connection at the moment so hopefully we
can i see his head moving but he's no
loss at face oh I'm shiny yeah I can
hear you Chris can you guys hear me know
yeah yeah I was making a sad face cuz I
could hear you saying how I'm not there
okay my back you're an guys are like
it's like watching like a one frame per
second oh maybe you should leave and
come back I wonder if that would work we
had a producer they could totally handle
that um well so the nexus 4 yeah I'm
gonna I'm gonna try and leave and come
back all right ok dieter you and I can
have a have a man-to-man conversation
about phones well while we're waiting on
Dan well do you want to talk about the
fact that nobody seems to be able to get
a Texas for the orders are still delayed
and I didn't have a problem I I don't
know what all yall are talking about I I
got one just fine ya know they I am
shocked at one of two things happen
either LG legitimately could not produce
phones fast enough or Google
significantly underestimate
underestimated demand I suspect it's the
ladder um yeah just might take I mean
maybe they believed you know the hype
that it sucks
LTE and they're like oh nobody want to
buy this for 300 bucks if it doesn't
have LTE no no actually it's a really
good deal I think John Gruber made a
point that was actually really good he
said that you know since this is only
299 this is sort of like could be
considered the ipod touch of android
it's it's a top top of the line android
phone android device you can get you
don't even necessarily have to use it as
a phone know that the galaxy player is
obviously the ipod touch of the band red
world Oh are we really going to talk
about the galaxy player man I am I am
trolling a little bit I admit dan you're
back what did I come back into what did
I come back into I come back in and I
hear galaxy player talk yeah no I mean
we're just complaining about the nexus
for being unavailable and you know I'm
trying to bring it back patrolling Chris
about his lack of a smartphone but too
much work dieter did you order one no
not gonna do it let me be pretty really
not not at this juncture so I don't know
why you're breaking into a George HW
Bush impression you know a little bit an
impression of Dana Carvey the impression
of george h this is like an impression
twice removed yes yes it is that's ring
and it's also like two decades doll yeah
this is not this is not a current
political reference theater whatever you
guys are the worst um yeah no I'm not
gonna do it I I want LTE and I as much
as I want a nexus 4 and think it'd be
really cool and it'd be nice to get up
on Android 4.2 right away and have a
pure stock Android experience you know
you're suffering by not knowing a phone
at all I am quote-unquote suffering by
you know not getting a phone that's
really interesting and compelling to me
because it doesn't have a feature that I
want I'm taking a principled stand yeah
we both are the difference is that I
can't receive text messages or calls no
the difference is that I decided to take
the stand and I stuck to it whereas you
went out and bought every phone on the
planet
then return yeah well it's yeah i mean
the the 920 I think of all the phones
that I've owned in the past week um that
I was closest I was the closest to
keeping the 920 believe it or not um and
there were just a couple things that
were really killing me one is that so so
Justin Rubio a valued member of our team
uh now owns a windows phone and I was
just observing today I mean I've known
this for a while but I was it was really
noticing today that like if if he
participates in a gmail thread he a
break the thread and B uses this really
silly font in his email reply um and I
like I don't know who at Microsoft is
responsible for this debacle but it
needs to stop right now so so that I
mean that's an issue but but via the app
gap is still very much a problem for
windows phone hey I've complained about
this and I think best two or three shows
but I mean that that ultimately did in
the 920 formulas the app situation I
need I need a Starbucks app dan I know
you're with me on that if Dan still
alive he may know he's dead goodness uh
starbucks up is like without that it's a
non-starter like that's that's more
important than battery life yeah yeah
meet the starbucks app I'm trying here
you need a you need I need over in in
chicago i use uber all the time and the
uber mobile web interface is a joke so
you like a text message interface you
could use it with your feature phone did
this year yeah they did but the promise
that at least the one that i was using
mm goober calm you need to enter an
address it doesn't have any location
finding and half the time I'm like okay
what is this building number where am I
you know um so it's like not worth the
trouble okay we need to move on from
your phone text but we should keep
talking about Windows Phone so we have
reviewed the Lumia 820 which I guess how
do you put this it was no great shakes
yeah Tom did not love that phone yeah
um yeah I think yeah 6.8 not that good
um which is a bummer but I guess it's
not really a huge surprise right I feel
like like Nokia I mean I understand the
need to create products that fit
different arbitrary slots in carrier
lineups but i think they 20 was an
example where they did themselves a
disservice because it wasn't enough
differentiation between that in the 920
like if you look at HTC's 8 x vs 8's
those are like pretty fairly different
products that look different and they're
very different sizes and I just don't
really get that same feel comparing the
920 with the 820 and and I kind of feel
and and also when they when they
announce those phones the 820 was
original was really marginalized it was
just barely mentioned and the 920 got
all the attention and like if you're
gonna you know if they 20 is gonna have
any relevance whatsoever you need to
treat it like a valued member of your
portfolio and they're not doing that
right now I like the only thing I can
think is that they created it because
like Vodafone or somebody was like we
must have this phone that like okay
we'll just make a bunch of them for
everybody yeah and I mean you're right
it's it's it's phone then I the thing
the thing I expect is I don't know what
they're charging for it but like it's
gonna be you know virtually free and
very short order and it could make some
sense there right because the nice thing
about Windows Phone is there's always
sort of a baseline experience right like
there's not a significant Delta of
performance from the low end to the top
of the line in terms right a core OS and
scrolling and other stuff like that
right the other thing I guess this is
the windows phone but Nokia's here maps
is out for iOS I haven't had a chance to
try this yet but it doesn't look like it
is the utter and complete salvation from
people who have been hating apples Maps
that we may have been hoping for right
and all signs are still pointing to
google maps in the next few weeks heater
so iOS users can keep their fingers
crossed for that although I have to say
although i'm not using an iphone 5 at
the moment when i when i disposed to my
iphone 5 I felt this might have been
psychological but I felt like the maps
we're getting marginally better than
when I first took the iphone 5 out of
the box on day one so maybe I'm crazy no
Chris I think you're right oh my God
he's back I'm back back and better than
ever he what he looks like it he looks
like a Photoshop mosaic but that's okay
at least he's here i I've connected to
our faster Wi-Fi network in the studio I
wouldn't give you access to the real
network before you had to thank for to
ask um and the password for it is is
rather amusing it's well don't say it
I'm not gonna say yeah but Chris would
appreciate it that's all I'll to say oh
man now I really want to know the
password is obviously ragequit all
phones so so anyway I think that the
long and short of it to close the loop
on a 20 which we spend far too long
talking about don't buy this phone there
you go um we're telling people did not
buy a lot of phones lately look by Nexus
4 if you don't need LTE and so let me
let me I wanted to say this earlier
before I like went into a bandwidth
nightmare the reason that I'm buying a
nexus 4 or trying to buy a nexus 4 is
because it's unlocked and I can use it
overseas and I've actually don't have
any unlocked phones in my possession at
the current moment so that's a really
good point uh I guess I'll be using a
galaxy nexus for my overseas stuff yeah
that's 4.2 may I add yeah I had to
unlock phones with me at Mobile World
Congress last year and both of them got
stolen so uh yeah don't check any
electronics in your luggage which is
like you know stupid check period we
were there for like a week oh you can't
can't carry on a week's worth of stuff
come on I'll never forget I'll never
forget this year at Mobile World
Congress when dieter like
pulled me aside and taught me how to
pack a bag that I didn't have to bring a
big rips is like I is a really like a
humbling moment from gonna change your
life no I like I've yet to be able to
replicate like I still don't know you're
using some black magic that many things
to do a bag that small it doesn't make
any sense okay I it makes no sense it's
really simple you just fold and roll you
just roll it up into a tight little ball
I'm in here I'll show you right now on
air you just take your clothing whatever
it is and you fold it like you would if
you were just you know gonna put it on
your shelf if then the trick is the
trick dieter I wait I have to say I'm
sorry I have to interrupt you the most
amazing thing just happened on my screen
the the video frame rate is low enough
so that like you're your there talking
to me with the coat on and help son you
should never go Don look it literally
looks like magic it was amazing look
like CGI and then you just you know you
roll it up and then you've got this
whole sweater in this tiny little
package yeah but no but but you're using
black magic because like you do that
with like suits and like mount no no no
nothing leap rest hmm Wow um no I mean
I've had co-workers who have luggage
lost on the way to Barcelona and you
know i'm pretty sure mitcham Barcelona
really sucks yeah I'm pretty sure that
mine was stolen either in Barcelona or I
had a layover for my flight back in
Portugal so it might been stolen there
but what's crazy is i had a camcorder
and a digital camera in that bag as well
and they didn't touch it but they took
the two phones i had in there which were
like garbage phones both did they take
her clothes too because that would be
creepy no they left my dirty drawers um
all right let's move on before this gets
really really weird um we've got a bunch
of like sort of like random carrier news
like so 18t managed Goodell teen hundred
markets at a schedule that's great US
cellular is offering yeah
LTE plan but you know of course there's
like it's time limited and who knows
what other secret annotations are on it
but I think the most interesting thing
is was it who was it from t-mobile was
there is our COO their chief operating
officer basically admitted that they're
going to die like what was it he said
that their four major US carriers won't
last that their quote likely be reduced
to three in the longer term uh so that
sucks I mean I guess it could be sprint
that dies but I think I think this is
tmobile trying to make it a plea to
regulators that put a kibosh on its
merger with AT&amp;amp;T that you know it's
eventually going to have to do this
again and it's going to have to go
through the same process and I think
it's already just starting its plea
right now man yeah I guess I don't know
Chris what do you think well what's
weird to me is that you know t-mobile is
just coming off this PR cycle where
they're like celebrate you know they're
patting themselves on the back to this
metro pcs thing and they're they're you
know they're they're claiming that
between that and the verizon spectrum
that they just acquired as a result of
the spectrum code thing that they're
like they're set they're looking strong
and of course what people fail to to
give t-mobile USA enough credit for is
that they are a profitable division of
Deutsche Telekom they're they're not
losing money uh so you know I don't I
don't know what these guys deals really
are like I don't know if they're like
legitimately hurting anymore or you know
if they're just I don't know and you
know of course sprint just tied up with
Softbank yeah so it's i don't i don't
know what he was driving at with that
statement I don't know who he thinks is
gonna merge with who or who's gonna die
it's not entirely clear to me I think
four is a good number I think four is I
think 33 just basically means that's
going to end up being too right like
that's that I think I think we want for
I
I'm really comfortable with that I mean
that's it I wish they all shared
spectrum better so that there could you
know be more competition amongst them
but right but I mean the thing about the
thing about t-mobile is like how long
are they going to take to get their LTE
network rolled out right right I mean
2013 sounds doable for them and I was
actually just looking at their their
HSPA coverage map last night and I was
shocked to find that it has expanded
significantly like in not totally
populated areas since last time I looked
I mean t-mobile you know not long ago
even when they started rolling out 21
megabit or even for you to make a bit
they you know they were still in like
pockets very urban pockets around the
country and everything else was edge and
that isn't that appears to no longer be
the case but my my classic test is
always driving from Chicago to Detroit
on i-94 which which you know goes
through some pretty rural areas and and
last year what maybe 18 months ago AT&amp;amp;T
was edge for most of that drive and now
their 4g the entire i can't believe i
just had 4g their HSPA the entire way
and can I eject I am the producer I
could just kick you right out of the
show he doesn't know the difference
anymore he doesn't have a smartphone
yeah and it's all really all the same to
Chris actually I can't I can mute him
just in the middle of him talking that
would that would that would work um so
yeah I think I think that t-mobile might
be the same way now too I am I should
test that go ahead I was going to say
that in my experience t-mobile outside
of metro areas is doesn't really compare
to the other three carriers but that
really depends on where you live so yeah
it's terrible here where I live yeah
it's terrible okay explain this story to
me Google and Dish Network in talks to
launch a wireless service so I can't
wrap my head around what why dish has
such a Jones to be in the wireless
industry are they I mean I guess maybe
they're assuming that satellites
die and be overtaken by the internet and
internet TV and so they need to act come
up with a new business model and they've
got a bunch of spectrum and blah blah
blah but I you know I don't know what is
going to happen with them and the idea
that Google might you know hook up and
try and launch something with them is
intriguing it kind of reminds me of you
know the old story that Apple was
thinking about you know launching the
iphone on its own network instead of you
know just going with singular at the
time yeah yeah yeah I don't think so I
on the one hand I feel like dish may not
fully appreciate uh the hell that it's
diving into but I on the other hand on
the other hand they have been locking
horns with the FCC for over a year now
trying to convert satellite spectrum to
terrestrial use so that you know they
have a taste for you know what they're
going to have to go through and they
don't seem to be backing down and
obviously a partner like Google would
really make that entire process go a lot
smoother um I mean they also have like
Arthur isn't the FCC looking into making
sure that they're restricted in a
certain way so it doesn't interfere with
adjacent spectrum I mean it seems like
what the this dish Chairman needs is to
you know get taken out to lunch
literally not metaphorically by the you
know the guys at Ram LightSquared just
so that he can receive an education just
what's in store for him if he keeps
moving forward the way he is i'm not i'm
not sure the guys from LightSquared are
gonna give a whole lot of useful advice
as far as last I knew LightSquared is
still clawing and it still convinced
that it will launch its neck network but
uh yeah yeah they're trying to exchange
spectrum they're like yeah they're
basically telling the FCC that that that
they got you know it's like it's like
they bought like it like a sweater with
like a you know like a pulled yarn in it
from from target and they're trying to
return it hey for another sweater
and it's like a spectrum doesn't work
try a nicer sweater it's like the the
book that George Costanza got took into
the bathroom at the bookstore and then
it got flagged never mind um dieter
throw now these 20 year-old references
like left and right what could I say I'm
living in the 90 you're assuming that
our viewers are aged dieter yeah they're
really not leverage our demographics
tell us or our demographic research
tells us that our average viewer is nine
years old now years old and with very
opinionated about smartphones yeah we're
about a year away from people that were
that were born when I was in high school
being able to drink um it's messed up
not cool it's pretty much ceptable
whatever okay so i wrote this article
about we went facebook had this mobile
developer day where they invited a whole
bunch of developers of mobile apps to
their campus and they let us show up and
i wrote this article how every phone
could become a facebook phone and i make
a couple of related arguments in it we
don't need to talk about it at length
unless you guys want to but I basically
want to throw it out there that like
Facebook could seriously if they get
their act together know more about you
that Google does and be more important
to the your phone and what happens on it
then either Apple or Android or Samsung
or whoever is you know making the phone
itself because they they'll be plugged
in so deeply to so much stuff that
happens on it like as utility on the
back end yeah why I think even without
any developer infrastructure whatsoever
facebook is already kind of in that
position for many if not most of its
users right I mean that the entire like
the entire third party framework is just
icing on the cake for them well they are
making is that it's not icing on the
cake it's also like it's sort of a
defensive move
because if the internet is as much about
apps as it is about the web now Facebook
needs to make sure that it's hooked into
that just like it's hooked into the web
and like it seemed like they're being
pretty successful with it what surprised
me well I guess it surprised me but like
reading through the comments on the
story nobody wants to live in a future
where Facebook knows a lot about you add
is plugged into your phone I I kind of
feel like it's a little late to be
making that complaint if you're if
you're on Facebook and you're using
facebook which you know a billion people
are facebook already knows a lot about
you and and regardless of how you set
your privacy settings and and what you
do and don't share the fact is Facebook
knows a lot about you and I think it's
it's for like average users or like your
average Facebook user which i guess is
average people these days um I would
argue that Facebook probably knows more
about you than Google does be just
because you know people like us are
plugged into the Google ecosystem like
full stop we use google calendar we use
google mail we use all over google
search service a lot of us using google
voice and things like that but for your
average user that just as google
searches and then their whole life is in
facebook facebook probably knows more
about them that yes and when you look at
that perspective like Google+ starts to
make a lot more sense like people like
why is google leading into social who
cares this is you know why not just you
know leave it to facebook all of louts
because like knowing demographic
information about you knowing what
you're interested in doing what you're
going to be interested in potentially
makes advertising way more lucrative and
if you know Facebook can actually
leverage that advantage the Google's in
trouble and so I mean what can google do
to counter that other than to try and
you know have a social network that also
collects that information the
counter-argument though I mean I dan I I
your point is taken about most users or
many users not being as plugged into
google as we are and many of our
listeners far but I mean you know when i
use google not i mean use google now for
10 minutes and tell me that we're not
already living in the in the like effed
up future like I mean
like whenever I go to any city now it
just knows where I want to be next when
I watch Beckett but that's because
you're telling Google all that
information right but you're a dude so I
I checked google now this morning and
it's like oh hey look at that my package
shipped from amazon but that's because
google's reading your Gmail which you
are giving to Google right and like
Google knows that you're going to be 10
minutes late to your appointment because
it's in your Google Calendar right so if
that was in your Facebook calendar and
all your messages were done through
Facebook's awful messaging system ah
Google wouldn't have any of that data
right because it's all siloed over into
Facebook right but the point is like
people are giving it to Facebook to
write like how do you participate in the
internet today and like share stuff if
you're not sharing it on Twitter or
Facebook or whatever like I'm right up
you know or even tumblers cook this
doing this concept like I'm gonna lie
I'm going to host my own blog and you
know try and share stuff that way that's
so 2002 man there's always my space
there's that one I space which we take a
comeback yeah come back yeah um I i I'm
just like made of rough transitions
today but I don't care because I'm gonna
roughly transition have we talked about
um the the Qi wireless stuff no and I
won't cause like that last I feel like
Chris rant is is burgeoning here yeah so
I should temper this and I mentioned
this in my report as well that people
are not universally having trouble with
the with the nexus for connecting to the
nokia dt 900 which are probably the two
like most like public facing qi
compatible devices right now right
because both the 920 in the and the exes
before I've gotten a lot of play in the
dt 900 is the charging plate that 18 she
is giving away with the night 24 free
but the the the gist of the story is
that i had both these devices put the
nexus 4 on the dt 900 the charging plate
and it was doing this thing where it
would like start charging and then stop
charging then start charging and stopped
charging like every second or two
seconds
which rendered it completely useless I
mean for one thing it probably wasn't
taking any charge at all or it was like
you know is taking more energy to like
you know charged and uncharged in charge
and I'm charged that it was like
actually discharging net over time but
some people have had success and we
spoke to the chairman of the wireless
power consortium which is organization
responsible for the Qi standard and and
he says that the nexus for dt 900 have
been validated work with one other and
gadget in their review the nexus for
tried dt 900 they didn't have any
problems but that dt 900 i did use with
two different Lumia 920 20s and work
fine in fact dieter it's the it's the
charging pad that's in your possession
now all right right so so it's we know
that the charging pad works but anyway
that the concern is that you know Chi is
about to go into like this fight against
PMA which is the standard put forth by
powermat and it was recently endorsed by
both Google and Starbucks which is a big
one that's a little soon to be no ando
employed in starbucks was Google like
we're backing were throwing some money
or some some kind of backing behind this
test thing by starbucks to put it in or
is this like a full-on endorsement well
I mean call it whatever you want the
fact is that they are putting money and
effort and their name into a standard
that is not cheap yeah and and and you
know which is I mean this classic Google
move they love to uh you know get google
but regardless wireless charging is a
very new technology right and nobody I
mean nobody as a house full of chia
accessories house full of touchstones
unfortunately yeah well I sad yes and
dieter thank you which wait if I was a
if i was in my home office i'd pull my
touchstone off of my desk and hold it up
to the camera as well and may I add
dieter and many others have had much
success hacking touchstones in the years
since the heavy palm days to work with
other devices but she is trying to
become like this you know
mobile standard where you'll be able to
just drop any device on any surface and
it won't just miraculously charge which
is a very very good goal to have because
you don't realize and dieter I know
you'll back me up on this you don't
realize how like awesome it is to just
be able to drop a device anywhere and
have a charge until you actually have it
set up and then and then like your phone
is just always charged which is awesome
but you know you have these two
standards both of which have the backing
to potentially be the the ultimate
winner and dieter I think that you said
it best you gave me this great analogy
which is that it's exactly like blu-ray
versus HD DVD both of these standards
have all this backing and but only one
can win right there can be only one
envia in the words of Highlander and
well then also and really it's going to
be the one that the porn industry adopts
I really wanted to try you in the
comments on that but I decided devices
are recharging wirelessly okay so know
that successfully gmail think I was
gonna say is it's also like this thing
because I mean I've talked to the power
back guys like years ago back when it
was them and you know palm with the
touchstone and I'd be like what you guys
think the touchstone and they were just
rail about how it was technically
inferior PMA is so much better and blah
blah blah blah blah blah and I'm sure
that if you were to have a conversation
with them about chief or wireless
charging they would tell you the same
thing and I'm sure you talk to the chi
people they would also like their do
these technical to bathe but which
standard is better but you know they
both basically as far as i know are that
different in a way that actually matters
to consumers so what is really going to
happen is we're just going to see these
big companies form these alliances and
then they're going to fight it out until
one thing wins one thing just doesn't
and i had kind of thought that she won
right we saw it on nokia's and we saw it
on the nexus 4 and like verizon's got
all their stuff on it and i thought that
was the end of it yeah so this this
starbucks thing i don't know makes me
crazy if if power PMA is better powermat
is
better than fine just win and so I you
know will not you know so i can treat
wireless charging the way that I treat
Bluetooth now or Wi-Fi on a phone I just
like zoom it's there the idea that I
would be like does this phone a
bluetooth I need to make sure I isn't
safe right and yes you later my random
bluetooth headset you don't you don't
worry about those things anymore all
right and I just wish that one of them
would have mandated magnets in them
because that was like where palm got it
a hundred percent right the magnets held
the thing on and it didn't slide off if
the phone vibrated it didn't like
suddenly like scoot to the side and be
off of the the charging dock um so I
kind of I mean that's a fail on both chi
and PMA i guess that that neither the
mandated magnets to hold the phone in
place but yeah yeah no I I do agree I
but yeah overall I mean the real problem
the one thing where this is unlike
hd-dvd vs blu-ray is that wireless
charging is not a feature that any
consumer like thinks that they need or
like is is you know it's out nobody is
going to say well I'm not going to buy
this phone because it doesn't have
wireless charging whereas you know
everybody at least up until like right
about now when everybody is going to to
the cloud everybody needed some form of
video player in their in their
entertainment stack so uh so there is a
very real possibility that this battle
of attrition could ultimately result in
nobody winning and like there will be no
dominant standard and then you just end
up having to buy you know when you buy
your your phone from verizon or AT&amp;amp;T you
know you'll just have to buy a bunch of
like proprietary you know wireless
charging devices go with it you know one
for your car one for your house which I
mean let's be honest is probably the way
the carriers would like it anyway cuz
that the accessory margins are like a
hundred percent yeah i mean i think the
deals like the starbucks deal are pretty
big for the wireless charging because
once people can see it out there and
they can see what it does and if it's in
places that they regularly go or if you
can buy a car with it built in they're
going to want their phone to work with
that and you know if PMA is able to get
more endorsements like that where it's
in more places and you don't have to buy
special accessories
or and it's just there then I think
it'll become more of a must-have feature
than it is right now right oh and once
you know Apple supports one of the
standards then it would be must have
feature yes I hate to say that and I say
that about NFC too but I mean let that's
really what it's going to come down to
once it's in the iphone that it becomes
table stakes hey do you guys remember
when when Apple made a a bluetooth
headset oh yes that didn't work out too
well for him and their judges was
already standard by then right like now
yeah it was a standard but then they had
that they had some giant speaker too
right oh yeah they've got a good i buy
the ipod hi-fi yeah that was just a
speaker yeah that thing was the worst i
will say that there was one really good
thing to come out of that stupid apple
bluetooth headset which is that several
manufacturers including Motorola and I
think jawbone hacked their way into the
like that the battery level
communication for that so like if you
use your bluetooth headset with an
iphone to this day it will still show
the Bluetooth battery level in in the
status bar which is kind of cool yeah I
have a I think it's a jawbone bluetooth
device in my car that's a bluetooth FM
transmitter and I can see the battery
status on my iphone which is like pretty
novel and useful yeah um so there's a
bunch of legal stuff that happened and I
don't care about any of it maybe you
guys are interested in targeting but
like you know HTC is not paying six to
eight dollars per phone apple with part
of their settlement because HTC settle
with Apple Samsung is hoping to like get
an advantage in their case which is
obvious of course Samsung is looking for
every advantage that it could possibly
get and you know iphone 5 and Android
4.1 jelly bean are getting caught up in
this legal fight so you know same as
usual everybody's you know suing
everybody and it's great actually no
that's a lie it so it's only it's only
Apple and Samsung and a little bit of a
blow and I bowling Google and well no
longer appling she see she's out uh yeah
that's that
11 less lawsuit that we have to write
about and complain about and by the way
of all the companies that needed to get
out of that game HTC was probably at the
top of that list like yeah HTC has
enough to worry about right now the last
thing they need is apple riding there
behind 44 royalty payments so I want to
say like I don't know if I can't
remember if we even talked about this
last week but neva I wrote a really
great piece when the HTC settlement
happened about what could possibly turn
out from that and it'd be really really
funny to see the next version of sense
to be have like apples slide to unlock
feature and the bounce scrolling
features straight up identical yeah I
mean that would be I it would make sense
better I guess but yeah that would be my
plane was there their solution for
bounce scroll is terrible it's the worst
like all those the elements start of
separating and that weird like yeah I
don't know it just accordion type of
that yeah it's accordion but it's not
even accordion because they're like
separate elements are not connected to
each other and it's just it looks
terrible and I hope they get rid of it
and what are we on now since four plus
four plus or plus whatever is a DNA four
plus HD so mmm oh that's deters what is
that I don't even that's whatever on
that note I'm ending this podcast if if
you want to follow us on Twitter you
should I got back on Christa's ads e
power dan is at DC seaford with an e I
we're all at verge on the verge if your
list watching this live is going to be
on tonight I believe they're
broadcasting live am I crazy I believe
in about a half an hour yeah so watch
that and they're at least doing some
behind-the-scenes stuff yeah we'll be
back next week have a wonderful
thanksgiving if you celebrate that sort
of thing later guys bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
