catchphrase stood out high dynamic range
HDR content and equipment means brighter
more vivid images with better color
reproduction than you've ever seen it
home before 4k UHD might be cool with
HDR it's stunning and Panasonic LG
Samsung and Sony all highlighted it
during the week at the idea sounds
familiar it's because another company
was already showing it off last year
Toby with Dolby vision the company
presented a complete solution starting
with the way Hollywood filmmakers master
the material and running all the way to
the television themselves the
demonstrations were insane so it's no
surprise that high dynamic range has
become a marquee feature yet none of the
big manufacturers that talk about HDR
this week signed up for Dobies program
it's a question of standards and nobody
agrees just yet Dolby is interested in a
system that will work for today's TVs
and the brighter more colorful ones that
will come to use ahead other HDR specs
are focus more on what's available today
and customers could conceivably find
themselves dealing with a change back in
just a few years
with so many competing interests no
wonder the adobe and other companies
felt the need to announce the UHD
Alliance to straighten things out but
they're not meeting for a couple of
months and meanwhile 4k TVs are already
on sale the whole thing makes blu-ray
versus HD DVD sound like a
well-thought-out strategic plan but
there is a solution follow the company
that's playing the long game Dolby
doesn't sell products at your local Best
Buy last year ninety percent of its
revenue came from licensing going away
it lends is by creating a comprehensive
ecosystem that works for customers
filmmakers and manufacturers and with
studios and companies have demonstrated
that they have a hard time making it all
come together on their own the always
kind of thinking is exactly as what's
needed granted though is just one
company and HD ours is a small part of
the overall UHD equation but nobody's
pushing audio visual technology forward
aggressively as Golias right now so when
Sony Samsung and rest the UHD Alliance
ask themselves what they should do next
perhaps they should ask a different
question instead what would they'll be</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
