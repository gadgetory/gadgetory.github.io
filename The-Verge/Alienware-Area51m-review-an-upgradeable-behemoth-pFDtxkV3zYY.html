the trend in gaming laptops
has been to go thinner and lighter,
turning a powerful gaming machine
into something that you
can carry around all day
and even consider using
for productivity work.
Alienwareâ€™s new Area-51 is not that.
The Area-51m is the polar opposite
of a thin and light laptop.
It feels like a throwback
to when gaming laptops
were thick, heavy machines
that never left the
comfort of a sturdy desk.
It is really a laptop in name only.
In fact, you probably shouldn't even
think of this as a laptop
because, inside, it's
got desktop components
that will run laps around
any other laptop you can buy
and even give true desktop
computers a run for their money.
It's more like a portable
desktop than anything else.
I mean, even the power brick weighs more
than most laptops that I spend time using,
and there are two of them.
This computer is so much like a desktop
that you can actually open it up
and upgrade not just the RAM and storage,
but even the processor
and the graphics card.
My colleague Sean has
already taken the Area-51m apart
and showed you all what's inside,
and you should really go
watch that if you haven't yet.
I'm not going to do that here.
What I'm going to do is
tell you what it's like
to actually use this
behemoth of a computer.
The Area-51m has a new
design for the company,
but it's still unmistakably
an Alienware computer.
It does look modern and fresh,
but you'll never really confuse it
for anything but a gaming laptop.
And it's got lots of
different lighting effects, a
giant fan exhaust, which
I'll talk about a bit more,
and, of course, Alienware
heads all over the place.
In terms of basic specs and layout,
it has a 17-inch 1080p display,
and the model that I have
has a 144Hz refresh rate,
Nvidia's G Sync technology,
and Tobii eye tracking,
a full-sized keyboard with a number pad
and programmable macro buttons,
a traditional trackpad
with physical buttons
that actually lights up when you touch it,
three USB-A ports, a
Thunderbolt 3 Type-C port,
2.5GB Ethernet, a MiniDisplay port,
HDMI, and Alienware's
proprietary Graphics amplifier
for an external GPU.
I'm actually a bit disappointed
that it doesn't have
even more ports, and
possibly an SD card slot.
That would have made this
machine really attractive
to content creators that
need to crunch through
lots of video edits
and need the horsepower
that this thing provides.
There's clearly room for
more ports on this chassis.
I'm also personally not
a fan of the traditional
non-chiclet keyboard and trackpad.
Both feel like something that
would've been on a
laptop from 10 years ago.
But they work fine for what most people
will be using this laptop for.
The keyboard is pretty standard
for Alienware machines,
so if you're coming from an older one,
it'll be familiar.
And since most people will
instantly plug a gaming mouse
into the side of this,
the trackpad isn't really
that much of a problem.
In terms of size and bulk,
the Area-51m weighs 8.5 pounds,
and it's about 1.7 inches thick.
The 330-watt power adapter
weighs just over three pounds,
while the smaller 180-watt brick
weighs another pound and a half.
That means in order to bring the Area-51m
from one place to another,
you need to lug around almost 13 pounds,
or six kilograms, worth of stuff.
Plus your headphones, and mouse,
and whatever else you want to carry.
That why it's best to think of this
as a portable desktop
computer than a laptop.
You can move it from one place to another,
but you're not going to be
using it along the way.
You'll need to lug both of
those power bricks along
if you want to game.
But if you want to just use the Area-51
for productivity work,
spreadsheets, etc.,
you can get away with just
using the smaller brick.
And believe it or not,
the new magnesium alloy chassis design
actually makes this about a pound lighter
than the old Alienware
17 that it replaces.
Still, this thing is
really not all that portable.
Inside all of that bulk is
where the good stuff is.
Configurations for it
start at just under $2,000
for the Core i7-8700 processor
and an RTX 2060 GPU.
And they go all the way up to a Core i9-9900K
and an RTX 2080 GPU.
Remember, this is a desktop processor
and full-power mobile GPU,
not the lower-power slim Max-Q stuff
or mobile processors you'll
find in those thinner
and lighter gaming laptops.
So if you wanted to buy the lower-end spec
and upgrade that at 8700 to a 9900,
or whatever processor
that fits down the road,
you can actually do that.
Same with the GPU.
Dell developed a modular
graphics card inside of this
that can be upgraded and
replaced with newer components,
which is what really
makes the Area-51m unique.
There's also a large 90
watt-hour battery in this,
but that doesn't mean that the
Area-51m has great battery life.
For productivity work,
you can expect 90 minutes,
maybe two hours max, between charges.
I actually struggled to
write this video script
on battery power before
it ran out of juice on me.
And if you're gaming,
you can expect well less
than an hour of battery life,
probably closer to 30 minutes.
You can easily spend over $5,000
equipping the Area-51m,
but the model I've been
using has the i9 processor,
the 2080 GPU, 32GB 2,400MHz DDR4 RAM,
a terabyte of SSD storage,
which is actually two
512GB drives
in a RAID 0 configuration
for maximum speed,
and a 1TB hybrid
drive for more storage.
All of that will run you
about $4,500 before any sales
or discounts or whatever.
And that's a lot of money for what amounts
to a lot of computing power.
If you wanted this kind of power
in a traditional desktop,
you could spend a lot less to get it.
So, how does it all perform?
Well, in short, really, really well.
Now, traditionally, you wouldn't
expect desktop components
crammed into a portable laptop
to form as well as if they
were in a much larger box.
But Alienware has done a really good job
with the cooling design
so that the CPU and GPU
can perform nearly as well
as when they're in a desktop computer.
That's why the Area-51
has these giant grates
on the back and the sides.
When the fans start ramping up,
they get loud, like, this kind of loud.
(fan roaring)
Now that's not really
unusual for a gaming laptop
and if you're in the
market for the Area-51m,
you probably expect it.
There are some powerful speakers up front
that can overpower the fan noise,
but most people will just want
to use a headset while gaming
so you don't have to hear the fans at all.
But you might not have
many friends in your office
if you try to use the
Area-51m in there.
(upbeat music)
The Area-51m is able to play
virtually any modern AAA game I throw at it,
with the settings maxed out
and not have any problems
maintaining high frame rates.
Even games like Battlefield 5
and Shadow of the Tomb Raider
with all of their eye candy and
ray-tracing lighting effects
can be played with virtually
every setting turned on
and maxed out and still
maintain frame rates
between 60 and 80 fps.
That's not quite the full 144Hz
that this screen can push,
but it's still high enough
for a great experience in those games.
Competitive shooting games
like Apex Legends,
Overwatch, CSCO, and yeah,
even Fortnite, can run at
hundreds of frames per second,
well more than the native
refresh rate of the display.
There really isn't a game
that can bring the Area-51m to its knees.
And if you really want to, you
can either overclock the CPU
or the GPU to get even
more performance out of it.
All of that performance headroom
actually makes it feel
like the display here
is mismatched to the components.
And I have no doubt that the Area-51m
could easily push a 1440 panel
or maybe even a 4K
display in lots of games,
but the only resolution
available is 1080p.
If you're after the fastest
frame rates you can get
the high refresh rate screen
is definitely what you want.
But if you're more into visual
presentation and eye candy,
you might be interested
in more resolution.
Now, for what it's worth,
Alienware tells me that
there just aren't any
higher-res 17-inch display
options with the narrow bezels
and high refresh rates available yet,
and when they are,
it will make them an
option on the Area-51.
But for now, if you want a
game at a higher resolution,
you'll just have to use
an external display.
So where does that land
us with the Area-51m?
It has indeed fulfilled the two goals
that Alienware set out with it:
make a portable machine
that's just as powerful
as a desktop computer
and make it possible to upgrade
the parts in that machine down the road.
There is a bit of an asterisk
on that last point, though.
We don't know for sure
that the next generation
of Intel processors
or Nvidia or AMD GPUs will
actually fit in this computer. 
But Dell has said that
if it's possible to
physically fit the chips
onto its swappable graphics boards,
it will offer upgrade options.
The other thing we don't know yet
is how much those GPU
upgrades are going to cost.
And that takes me to the
real conflict with Area-51m:
it's just expensive.
You could go out and buy a
desktop computer and monitor
with this kind of power
and still have enough money left over
to buy a more mainstream
thin and light gaming laptop
for when you want to game on the go,
and you'll probably still
have some money left over
in your pocket compared to the Area-51.
That makes this machine,
unrealistic for most people.
The kind of gamer that's going to demand
this level of performance
and a portable machine and put
up with all the compromises
and cost necessary to get it
is probably going to be a
competitive e-sports player
or maybe even a hardcore VR fan.
That all said, the Area-51m is
a really impressive machine.
And I'm very curious to
see where its new ideas
and upgradability and
performance and portability
go in the future.
Thanks for watching.
Given all the compromises with Area-51,
weight and size and cost,
do you think it's worth it?
And if you haven't watched Sean's video
on how to tear apart the Area-51
and pull out its guts and upgrade them,
be sure to go check that out.
It's really cool.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
