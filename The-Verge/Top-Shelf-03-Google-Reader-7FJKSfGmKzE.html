virgin mobile I'm David Pearson on this
show we bring you the best in consumer
electronics past present and future
coming up we'll talk the life and death
of google reader and the aftermath of
Samsung's Galaxy s4 announcement but
first the week that was as expected
Samsung last thursday unveiled the
galaxy s4 it's more evolution than
revolution with a similar look to the
gs3 but a larger 5-inch 1080p screen new
features include air gestures for
hands-free control and an impressive 13
megapixel camera Samsung this week also
announced a price for its massive 4k
television the so-called easel set will
be thirty nine thousand nine hundred and
ninety-nine dollars with pre-orders
starting in march you oculus rift our
favorite virtual reality headset company
is about to ship some 10,000 completed
developer kits the test units feature of
5.6 inch 1280 by 800 display and will
support valves uber-popular team
fortress 2 after an update discreet the
father of Android has stepped down Andy
Rubin brought the mobile platform to
Google in 2005 and has spearheaded its
development ever since he's now rumored
to be working at Google's secret xlab
Android will now be overseen by sundar
Pichai who also oversees google chrome
and apps and finally sadly google is
shutting down its popular reader service
as of july first google started to
decline in usage and a desire to focus
on fewer products within the company but
the announcement left many users feeling
lost users like the Verge's own thomas
houston for whom this has all been a
very emotional experience three years
google reader was nearly the perfect
tool for someone who never wanted to
miss the important things on the
internet news hounds could stay on top
of The Times New Yorker Bloomberg
favorite photographers on flickr
anything Twitter it was a world's
largest newsstand mixed with the world's
best in this period newspapers and
magazines it also made me a better
reader by offering your treasure trails
with very reporting inviting that I knew
I should be reading for eight years I
saw the whole internet all the parts i
wanted to see anyway i subscribed to
hundreds of kids giving thousands of
items every day J&amp;amp;K my way through
everything that I'd missed hitting us to
start the best of it occasionally
mashing shift in a to mark everything
read when I
can handle flooding more over time
instead of rousing aimlessly through the
web we're hoping something interesting
was happening on Twitter I done left my
phone jump from google leaders endless
stream of news long reagent gifts that
had only one meter in my I tried dozens
of apps trying to find the perfect way
to read on the go miss I tried were slow
or ugly or missing some key feature but
thanks to google reader the perfectly
reliable and totally invisible back end
I could just install another app and
pick up right where I left off now comes
my first google reader goes the way of
the dodo and rips from the palm pre loss
reports on I'll miss the app itself but
the whole the reader really leaves
behind is in the heart of all the third
party apps I use across different
devices and platforms they're still good
apps for reading your feeds like press
or reader or netnewswire there are even
a few that sync across a couple of
devices like feebly but only if use
feedly apps everywhere gone is the
backbone the underlying foundation will
let you build a system on top of it like
Legos a few companies have offered to
pick up with Google left off big says
it's building an API to replace the one
that powered so many google reader apps
Feelies doing the same thing but those
products were a long way off and this
company need to figure out how to turn
those readers into a business google
never did google millimeter to help us
never miss the thing on the internet to
organize and collate everything we
wanted to reach bring years my corner of
the internet existed on google reader
now i'm not sure where it goes goodbye
google reader and thanks for all the
memories which I starting google reader
and will be able to ever access again
but thanks anyway joining me now to talk
about all of google reader and RSS and
where we go from here is Cyril mushran
from feedly he's the head of product and
strategies Cyril thank you so much for
taking the time to talk to us today oh
thank you for tuning my pleasure so tell
me a little bit about feedly first of
all give me a little bit of the
background and kind of why you decided
to build both an RSS reader and one
that's connected to google reader yeah
so well we we started Philly a while
back you know in 2008 and also we can
add it for a while we saw an opportunity
you know where there's this rich content
on the web today and in our lives we
have more and more devices we are in
your mobile phones
let know the origins Isis preserved in
apparent war and we thought we was a
really good opportunity for trying to
reinvent the way people access is quite
content on these devices across these
devices so when Google Reader announced
last week that there or when Google shut
that house that they're shutting down
google reader last week what was the
reaction within feedly and kind of where
did you you know did you see this coming
was this why do you think I shut down
yeah its heart is that we saw this
coming we actually were preparing for
that possibility now we saw over the
last few years you know since we've been
working very closely with the reader
team now we saw the reader team being
told you know first who does you know
OpenSocial or Google+ so we saw ad
google kind of stepping back you know
and promote the product mountains and I
we saw that as an opportunity for us to
really you know how the users move
beyond the web product the google video
was and trying to be asleep adopt better
with across experiences so we've been
working for where we call normandy for
about six months now which he was a
backup plan more than a back-up plan
it's kind of a back-up plan for the
google decided to retire video but it's
also kind of where we see the future for
four feet to be it seems like to me that
the two pieces people lost with google
were with the reader web client which a
lot of people like to is very simple and
very fast but also google as this kind
of universal ubiquitous back-end that
powered all these apps and all these
different platforms is that kind of what
you imagine Normandy or tell me kind of
where you're going forward with that
yeah that's vehicle to what we see we
see very free legs Toonami you know and
one is definitely an API that filly
could use but all the videos could use
as well so the important building block
for helping people build valuable
content at some chick applications and
so we announced the API you last week as
part of an ahmadi program and in a fee
but we are airing up more than hundred
developers
have asked us you know about it you know
who have expressed interest and so when
the process of formalizing that part we
saw or see also very important place for
nominee to be a better environment for
publishers you know where you will be
the gentry do much in terms of helping
publisher monetize their feet or giving
more alternatives around how our kind of
feed really produce result we are trying
to engage a lot of publishers you know
with Nandi over the last six months and
we definitely see a very strong interest
now you know a system announcement and
we probably turn to provide basic
building block for things like paid in
our content paid paid premium feet or a
few get programs within Almonte the
thing that worries me is that Google
Reader is shut down because Google
couldn't figure out a way that it was a
viable business for them going forward
do you see Normandy is something that's
both good for your business and as
something that people will still adopt
because you know it was a free API for
everybody is that something you can
really offer or you're gonna have to
charge for how do you see that working
yeah so I don't want to speculate too
much about why Google say to shut down
vida but I highly doubt is because it
was not making money it atrophies it was
not making money and was it was an issue
in terms of creating tension between
Google and publishers but I think more
more than anything else I think is the
duration of the product that probably
you know when they remove the sharing
you know functionalities last year we
saw huge influx already of users
typically because showing is a key
component of that early adopters and
people were very a bit of content need
so decide you know in term of
monetization we are seeing with the
different ways you know we formalization
we have a lot of users today that have
been asking us for pro version of fiddly
and wasting your process of exactly
defining what this is be when I when
talking with a lot of issues were been
asking we are we are today at least five
to seven percent of ours you know said
they will
therefore Philly and they don't be tell
us which feature we want to pay for the
existing product now so this heat has an
important part of our life today of the
things that you do and they don't want
it to go away that's right one of you
for us is to kind of figure out what is
that you know full version is it like
guaranteed of service or is that
specific feature that we would put in it
but then haven't they 00 or you know we
really want to go beyond that and we
want to offer a couple other novels you
know one would be a GT dt based model
for developers you know where other
developers could come in and create this
content that we have much more easily as
on normandy and we would basically work
out a pay-per-use you know model for the
api and the third part is really
opportunity to monetize fields so I both
for the vapors not giving them an
opportunity to to create to get revenue
from revving pom-pom feet and giving an
environment where publishers could bring
content at a premium content or create
enough yet programs where you know
they'd be willing to the ski publish on
a model so you know you've announced
they are doing this thing with normally
dig has talked about doing something
similar do do you think like we will you
be working together to make something
that makes it accessible for everybody
or are we gonna see kind of a fragmented
market and we'll have to pick our best
option and hope everybody else does to
know so I don't think the market is
gonna find my necessarily you know I
think there is different layers to it so
as far as Normandy is concerned we are
basically starting to gather two two two
two sides you know since we announced we
have already over android developers
were expressed interest in the API and
we want to create a developer ID
reserved it does a reward we didn't have
you know a conversation with dig or some
of the other players yet but you know
trying to basically better understand
what are going to be the key needs for
the repairs people to create this
feature application that we see
that's it that's a key is key function
of the board and whatever we can do to
push things back into the standard
that's where we want to go and then
there's also a publisher advisory board
which kind of act in the same way but on
the Commission side so when you think
about taking Isis two days great you
know we can still do a lot of things
with ice as it is today as a standard or
at home as it is a standard but if we
think about all the things that we may
do to be able to support different
models then as much as we want we want
to come engage the conversation with as
many people as possible and then figured
anything that makes sense for feedback
in the scallop do it in a standard
because you know in our vision is that
the more we have people believing that
content should be open accessible on the
web and when we believe so you know the
better that other war is going to be I
totally agree 0 thank you so much for
taking the time to talk to us I really
appreciate it and we're definitely
looking forward to seeing what happens
with feedly on july first thank you so
we've seen a lot of android phones
launched recently from the galaxy s4 to
the HTC One to a handful of others and
they all have their differences but
across the board there's one certainty
their version of Android kind of sucks
we just like stock Android a lot better
so we sent our own evan rodgers on a
quest to find ways to make Android
lighter faster prettier and just better
the HTC one is a gorgeous device but the
thing is we're not entirely sold on the
sense interface and the same is true for
Samsung's TouchWiz or any other skin
that a phone manufacturer might lay on
top of Android there's something so
clean and consistent about Google stock
Android experience something you can
really only get out of the box from a
nexus phone but thankfully Android is
highly customizable you can make it look
like Google originally attended with
only a few minutes and a handful of apps
from Google's Play Store no hacking a
routing required
to get the HTC One a little more in line
with my tastes I focus on three areas
the launcher the lock screen and the
keyboard within the launcher the home
screen and app drawer is where you'll
spend most of your time I chose nova
because it looks almost exactly like
google's default launcher nova also
includes a number of interesting
improvements like support for custom
icons and lots of screen transitions
simply download it and set it as your
default launcher it prompts you to do so
the first time you press the home button
and you're set to go as for the lock
screen we've seen a lot of variety of
form and function here personally I
prefer the simplicity of holo Locker the
HTC one's lock screen is kind of busy
for my tastes what holo Locker does yet
again is make your lockscreen look very
similar to stock Android 4.1 jelly bean
now the keyboard there are a lot of
insane third-party options out there but
my favorite is Swift key word prediction
is great and you can easily change the
keyboards appearance with a few tabs
this app is the only paid app on our
list but a quality keyboard could be one
of the best app purchases you ever make
and honestly it's what you'll be using
the most these tweaks only take a minute
or two to install and they bring back
some of the best and most beautiful
features of Android that many
manufacturers cut out it's a better
cleaner experience on almost any phone
joining me now is avi Greengart the
research director for consumer devices
at current analysis to talk more about
Samsung and all things Android avi
thanks so much for being here by blogger
so I want to talk about Android no one's
talked about the gs4 but first I want to
talk about 2010 let's go back at all
carriers so it seems to me that sort of
at the beginning of this run of Android
phones Motorola was like d brand they
kind of owned the Android world and like
people bought droids instead of Android
like that was they had the brand and
then six dates it's important to make
this right to know absolutely and then
it seems like Samsung sort of showed up
and all of a sudden just dominated and
like brute forced their way in is that
fair is that what would happen not
entirely and I actually think you need
to go back probably another 10 years
before that took a half years yeah to
the transition between analog and
digital TV that was when Samsung as a
corporate brand made a big play as a
pioneer as a technologist so that was
when the
digital ad campaign really cemented
Samsung in in Western consumers minds as
as a brand that they could relate you so
then fast forward back to back to 2010
Samsung's strategy around smartphones
has always been to bet on every horse
and whenever possible enter their own
horse into the race bada TouchWiz so
they always supported every known
operating system symbian palm Android
Windows Phone Windows Mobile up but when
they saw a lot of success around Android
they doubled down on Android and they
put a lot of resources there the first
thing that they did that was somewhat
unique in the industry was that because
they had a massive internal supply chain
where they could give themselves good
processors good displays that was the
first thing that they really did was
that they gave themselves the best
displays and then if you went at retail
and you saw an array of smart-phones
sitting in front of you and one was
brighter than the others the retail
store clerk was able to point to that
one that one's the best just simply
because it was it had the the brightest
display and in some cases the nicest
display and is that kind of was that
unique to Samsung like his Samsung the
only company in its space that has that
particular like they you know the
end-to-end we make everything and we
give ourselves the best stuff at unix to
an extent yes I mean Nokia certainly had
a massive supply chain because of the
volumes they did an apple uses its
financial wait to literally buy up
supply chain often several years in
advance but LG is in a similar situation
to Samsung and to a limited degree so
was Sony where they had they would make
some of their own components but Samsung
did this to a greater and better extent
than anyone else so that was step one
step two they started differentiating
around software and that's something
that we've seen a pretty much everyone
do and to be candid the first versions
of TouchWiz weren't very good no I'm and
it's like the kindest way you could have
said that
their stock Android there's a lot better
yeah but it's it's gotten good and
they've added things in particularly at
the larger screen sizes that are
genuinely useful so things like tabbed
calendar on a very large display means
that you can quickly and jump around
around your calendar and and and that's
nice so and you think that for samsung
was because we've talked a lot about
their stuff as kind of meaningless
differentiation but you think this is
actually something that people were like
oh tabs in the calendars I want that I'm
gonna buy a samsung no I think primarily
it was at the time primarily it was the
screen display the displays end too and
the XO knows the really fast processors
and the fact that they have great
distribution and I mean global great
distribution and so with the galaxy s2
that's when they started pouring on the
marketing and there are two aspects to
this marketing what is the sheer dollars
i mean we're talking billions of dollars
but simply throwing money at something
and even having decent as doesn't
necessarily equate to sales i mean you
can just take a look at Microsoft
Surface sure but the they did two things
with that one was yeah they spent a lot
of money but the other was there as were
really good first from a branding
perspective the fact that they may I
made fun of hipsters right said that um
if you're not a hipster then you should
buy a samsung galaxy phone and the
Samsung Galaxy phones have all this
advanced technology that's the brand
promise for samsung but by doing so in a
very clever way they gave consumers
permission to consider an alternative to
Apple I really think that before that it
was really if you thought of yourself as
someone who wanted a hot technology in
your phone yeah you pretty much were
limited to Apple you you were at the gs4
launch event I was so tell me tell me
about that event kind of in this realm
of what Samsung is doing and like how do
what do you see from Samsung well i mean
first of all that is insane yes it was
way over the top it was over produced we
can all argue about whether there were
not enough women or the women were
portrayed poorly the one thing that they
did do a really nice job and this plays
off of what
they've done in their ads is not just
Samsung as a brand they've done better
than anyone else other than Apple
explain the benefits of a feature not
just selling you a spec right and that's
something that if you go to any business
101 marketing 101 technology course they
will sell stay cell features sell
benefits sell benefits not features
that's the that is that is but nobody
does it oh yeah oh you can look at the
palms you know launch webos with a
vampire lady talking about the flow of
her day what is that um but samsung says
we have this phone it does this thing
for you and at Radio City Music Hall
that was that was a lot of what they
were showing off they did a really bad
job in terms of being cheesy but they
did a really good job of showing you why
these features matter how EU would use
them why someone might want them yeah
and so one of the things people talked
about a lot after that event were that
Samsung is kind of mimicking apples
tick-tock strategy right where they have
this big the gs3 was like this big
innovative thing with a lot of new
hardware and software and this was more
of an iterative upgrade well so is the
gs3 from the GS to you think so I do I'm
and the gs2 from the from the original
samsung galaxy okay um I mean the design
and this is not a galaxy s4 tha's a
galaxy s3 but if I just showed this to
you you might think that it is because
the screens a little bigger that's
Grace's I mean it's the same plastic
design no but the gs3 hit a level of
popularity that the gs2 didn't ever
reach I it that I could be wrong about
that but it we did it it kind of vaunted
Samsung into a whole different level of
Fame if it's just kind of an iterative
upgrade how did it get there well I got
there from from the factors i was
talking about earlier that it had the
brightest displays earlier that it had
that that advertising campaign that gave
consumers permission to ask for one and
they literally did if you if you spend
time at retail you will see consumers
walking into the store and they don't
say can you show me what your best
android phone is or can you help me
decide which android phone to get they
walk in they saying saying i want a
galaxy s can HTC and sony and
Nokia and LG and whoever else catch up i
mean we think sort of objectively
they're making a lot of better hardware
and some smarter decisions with software
but it still seems like it's samsung's
you know it's samsung's market to lose
so how does HTC for instance catch
Samsung and then on the flip side has
Samsung caught Apple everybody seems to
say like Samsung is killing apple and
apples going away and weird you know
sounding these death tolls like is that
happening and is that is that even a
thing like will yes let's do let's do
the iphone iphone vs iphone vs galaxy
fight first there's room in the market
for both they they have different areas
where one is significantly better than
the other if you want a really large
display if if you want certain Google
services baked in if you want to do
those things you see in the ads you'll
notice the Santa song specifically calls
out things that it does they're fairly
unique then the galaxy s3 or if you want
to take a photo of your kids with
yourself in it which i think is the
flagship feature of the galaxy they
don't work that a lot it is a great
feature i want that feature i think
that's a great feature yeah i want to do
that then then yes the galaxy s3 or in
this case the galaxy s4 may be a better
phone for you if you want better access
to content if you want a greatly
simplified user experience plus all of
the great apps and in many cases greater
apps or higher quality apps that you
find on iOS then you're gonna be very
happy with an iPhone 5 or whatever is
next Samsung is still doing Tizen
they're getting into watches they're
doing wearables like Samsung still wants
to blanket the market with every
possible option is that is that good for
samsung is that good for the gs4 is that
like how does well where's the fit in
samsung has the resources that many of
its competitors don't to follow blind
alleys and see if they actually go
somewhere Eisen seems like a blind out
it does to me um at least right now the
other aspect of that though is there is
you know we've talked about apple vs
samsung and that's probably the
reason that gook that Samsung didn't
mention the word android more than once
in its right in its presentation because
they're really positioning the galaxy s4
against Apple not against other Samsung
feels like it one and if you only really
see it does it does but with with great
power comes great responsibility or with
great power comes great conflict within
Google's so so so some of the things
that Samsung has invested in are aimed
at maintaining a balanced relationship
with Google's some of it may be simple
negotiating techniques give me a higher
cut on search revenue or don't give
Motorola early access to android because
that would hurt me and that if they do
that then I could for you know I could I
could go I could build I Samsung could
go off and build my own version google
has to listen samsung its samsung
samsung so so there's a lot of those
interplay elements and when you look
outside of that so so that's one of the
reasons why Samsung is investing in so
many of these other areas but when you
look outside of that in terms of watches
and wearables and and things like that
that's simply expanding the ecosystem I
think we're going to see a lot of that
innovation sometimes it makes more sense
to put NFC on your wrist than it does to
have it in the phone sure it for
personal identification for for retail
for collecting data from your wrist for
presenting data from the phone to your
wrist or to your eyes also we're going
to see more innovation in in wearables
regardless so Samsung's gonna make
Google glass clatters what you're saying
will and then probably take over the
market with it and we'll be right back
where we were III don't know um but
that's definitely something to watch for
in terms of yeah I'm not really intended
um but we will see you know glasses and
watches and pacemakers and and embedded
tattoos I mean this is leah looking out
a bit but but yeah i do think that we're
gonna see a lot of innovation outside of
the phone itself
and Samsung is definitely going to want
to participate there and Google likes to
drive some of that innovation and
there's no question that Apple is gonna
be a big part of that too all right
awesome Bobby thank you so much for
being here really appreciate it we'll
have you back to talk might blow about s
glass whatever comes out and that's our
show thank you so much for watching
