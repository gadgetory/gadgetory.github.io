whether we like it or not.
It's how we invite our friends to parties,
how we talk to relatives,
what we do on our phones,
while we're waiting for
the microwave to finish.
But even though we use it all the time,
it's kinda terrible.
It makes you feel bad.
And you feel even worse when you realize
how much data you're giving
off for targeted ads,
and political campaigns.
- We didn't take a broad enough
view of our responsibility,
and that was a big mistake.
And it was my mistake, and I'm sorry.
- Facebook's done so much creepy stuff,
that it's hard to trust them now.
And even if you delete your account,
it's hard to get away
from the company entirely.
It's complicated.
And if you want to know why that is,
you gotta look at the big picture.
(rhythmic tonal music)
In theory, there's a way
to deal with companies
that do things we don't like.
Companies have competitors,
and if one of those competitors
is doing something better,
then either the first company
changes, or it gets replaced.
That's the market.
But, Facebook doesn't
seem worried about that,
and you can see why.
Facebook has no real competition.
If you don't like Uber,
you can take a Lyft.
But, if you don't like Facebook,
you kinda have to quit
social media entirely.
Facebook is the one place
you can count on finding
nearly all the people you know.
The other networks just aren't as big.
About 180 million people
use Snapchat each month, (Correction: each day, not each month)
and that number's actually going down.
Twitter's bigger, with 330 million users,
but in 2018, Facebook
cleared 2.3 billion users,
and it made 13 billion
dollars in revenue off them,
at a time when its competitors
are right on the edge
of profitability.
The only networks that
come close are Instagram
and WhatsApp, both of which
are owned by Facebook.
That doesn't mean Twitter
and the other runners up
are doomed, but it's
hard to see any of them
getting to be size of Facebook.
Once you have a social network that big,
you don't really need another one.
The term for this is a natural monopoly.
And that's when entering
a business is so hard,
that a single winner ends
up dominating the industry.
The classic example is the cable business.
It's really expensive to
lay cable to a building,
but it's pretty cheap to operate,
once the cable's in place.
If you've already run cable
to all the houses in a city,
it's gonna be hard for anyone
else to compete on price.
They'd have to run a
whole new set of cables,
there's just no way to
justify that expense.
And since the cost of
laying cable encourages
a single big provider, you
can't expect competition
to solve problems, like high prices
or bad business practices.
It's hard to be sure if social networks
are a natural monopoly.
They've only been around for 10 years,
and they're still changing a lot.
Unlike cable, it's not
actually that expensive
to start a social network, it's just hard
to get everyone on board.
The barrier to entry is
more about users than money.
But, after seeing a dozen
different competitors
try and fail to rival Facebook's size,
there's a growing consensus
that market competition
just isn't gonna keep
the company in check.
- The problem is Facebook.
That's the problem.
And that Facebook has broken so much trust
to allow you to simply gobble
up every form of competition
is probably not in the public interest.
The simplest form of regulation would be
to break Facebook up, or
treat it as a utility.
We've dealt with natural
monopolies before.
When Bell Telephone started
rolling out the first
consumer phone service in the 1880s,
people were faced with the same problem.
Once there's a network
of phone lines in place,
there's no real reason
to start a second one.
Bell drove a particularly hard bargain
around the expensive long
distance phone lines.
If you didn't buy their local service,
you couldn't use the long
distance service, either.
It was the kiss of death to competitors.
And so aggressive that the
government decided to step in.
The Department of Justice
actually sued the Bell System
as a monopoly, and won
a string of settlements
and consent decrees.
The first one was in
1913, and the regulations
just got tighter from there.
In 1934, 1956,
1974, and 1982, until the
company was finally broken up
into a bunch of regional
companies in the 1980s.
Then those companies were consolidated
into the heavily regulated
telecoms we know today.
Not everything that regulators did worked,
but for the last hundred
years, for better or worse,
the federal government
has been the main force
keeping phone companies honest.
It's hard to say what that
kind of antitrust case
would look like for social networks.
For the last 40 years, the
standard test for monopolies
is that they raise prices.
But Facebook is free, like
everything else on the Internet.
The damage isn't in higher
prices, but market power.
Whether that's driving up the cost
of reaching your followers, or shaping
the entire marketplace to suit its needs.
The sheer size of Facebook
means it can muscle in
to other areas, like
messaging or photo sharing,
or buy out competitors like
WhatsApp and Instagram.
As long as it's impossible to compete,
Facebook can keep expanding and expanding
until it takes up the entire Internet.
And, unless we find some way
to keep the social network
in check, that's exactly
what it's gonna do.
- [Enquirer] If I buy a Ford,
and it doesn't work well,
and I don't like it, I can buy a Chevy.
If I'm upset with Facebook,
what's the equivalent product
that I can go sign up for?
- Well, there's the second category
that I was gonna talk about or--
- [Enquirer] I'm not
talking about categories,
I'm talking about, is there
real competition you face?
You don't think you have a monopoly?
- It certainly doesn't
feel like that to me.
- [Enquirer] Okay.
(group laughs)

it's a huge social network,
it's really important.

You gotta look at the big picture,
that's actually not very big, is it.
You gotta look at the
medium-sized picture.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
