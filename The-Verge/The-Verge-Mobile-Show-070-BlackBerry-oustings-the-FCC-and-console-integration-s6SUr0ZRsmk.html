this is episode 74 the week of November
25th it's a turkey week here in the US
so it is Thanksgiving and lots to be
thankful for i'm dan seifert i'm evan
rodgers what were was flat on that let
it just dropped out at the moment of
truth Oh pro well i am i'm chris sigler
and apparently Vlad has decided not to
join us there was something about Dan's
mention of Thanksgiving that made him
very very angry he just peed yup he
dropped in a huff I don't stare to be
fair Commonwealth countries do
Thanksgiving on different days or I
don't know if it's Commonwealth
countries are just Canada I know the
canada had their thanksgiving in october
yeah but that's because winter starts in
canada like so much earlier that well
they're just in perpetual winter as far
as i know i think there's any other the
great frozen north that's right Oh
podcasts so so this has been a smooth
start I guess we should probably talk
about we should at least acknowledge the
fact that evan rodgers our producer is
joining us for I believe his third
appearance is that right yes yes that is
the case that's a that's very very
exciting and the reason oh and we also
have an infant joining us yeah um
podcasting star that I believe and we're
not gonna spoil the surprise actually we
are gonna spoil the surprise I believe
being told is being fed into my ear as
we speak no it's not the dieter may be
joining us later I I still know why
deters not here by the way this later
yes yes so I am sitting in for dieter
for the time being and theoretically he
will in fact join us good and Vlad uh he
is a person that exists but not on the
internet for the moment he is a person
to exist this is true so yeah that's
what's up that's podcasting what do we
told you guys want to talk about mobile
stuff
I guess I'm just looking at our I'm
admittedly looking at our topic list for
the very first time and the top of the
list is apparently three high-level
blackberry executives have been given
the the old boot and shown the door as
John Chen is the new CEO is starting to
clean house and and right the ship it
seems well you know as they say
rearranging the deck chairs on the
Titanic is always the way to go so
that's my first question I guess you
know knowing not very much about
blackberry um like blackberries
corporate structure I don't know how
much these three individuals influenced
um kind of the sinking the titanic if
you oh well i mean again we've we've
said this in in past week by the first
level executive yeah they are but i
don't think I mean anything that
happened in the the period of time
between the departure of jim balsillie
and mike lazaridis and and black braids
day I think it's very very difficult to
attribute a lot of blame to anyone in
the c-suite up to and including torsten
Heinz because they just didn't hey I'm
een their fate was kind of sealed by the
time those guys were shown the door and
granted there are probably things that
they could have done to soften the blow
maybe but yeah and you have to you have
to second guess Heinz decision to push
the the launch of blackberry 10 out what
by three or four months if not more I
can't remember how long he delayed it
but he delayed it for a while and that
may have heard them a bit but at the end
of the day I mean it's six of one half
dozen the other I mean they're their
fate was sealed I think so that's my
take yeah did we talk about the the the
Porsche Design last week I guess we did
didn't we yeah because Vlad had one ah
for reason I should I should probably
say hello oh yeah he's here nice up here
that's not good exactly but since I am
completely uninformed about what those
three people have blackberry did
or what they value was aware they going
well I mean I just came right they're
the ones that at least one of them has
was a pretty public face Frank boulben
was the chief marketing officer he was
you know always out there talking about
as much as as Hines what's at least
talking about blackberry and its plans
and things like that that's what a very
important role in uh hiring Alicia Keys
I guess um so uh you know it's a it's a
high-level executive position I honestly
if somebody is going to be brought in as
a fixer-upper type of person as what
this interim CEO John Chen is supposed
to apparently be then it only makes
sense for him to you know get rid of the
old guard and figure out something new
so I'm not terribly surprised by this
move but like Chris said uh it's like
rearranging the deckchairs lives Titanic
so I remember talking to Frank boulben
when he was first hired um which wasn't
that long ago he was hired by Heinz uh
if memory serves me correctly and I
can't remember where he came from um but
yeah he was he was a pretty I remember I
think I talked to him literally within a
couple weeks of him being tired and I
specifically remember asking a bunch of
questions and then being like look I
don't know I just got here so hopefully
he was at least able to bring himself up
to speed on the company before you shown
the door here's my question why wasn't
Alicia Keys fired in a very public way
well why hasn't any blackberry executive
said you know what we put a lot of faith
and trust in deletion turn this company
around she wasn't able to pull it off
we're gonna have to let her go my
question is why wasn't she immediately
promoted to like be level executive yeah
she should be the new chief executive
that would be incredible I mean actually
they're specially still tweeting former
iPhone yellow with all of these
approaches is that nobody seems to be
willing to say the word fired anymore
like we all know people getting fired
left right and center but everybody is
stepping aside or
that thing down so this is how it goes
i'm gonna family this is how it goes
with all of these companies and you know
i just finished reading i was saying
this before we started by just finished
reading hatching Twitter which is Nick
bilton's of the New York Times he wrote
a book about how Twitter was started and
all of the executive drama that happened
for like three or four years there and
like on the public side of things
everything is done to save the face of
the executive and save the face of the
company by having them say so-and-so is
stepping aside and so and so is stepping
down but behind the scenes it's like
screaming in boardrooms and definite
firings and things like that but you
know they always seem to give the unless
in like very rare circumstances where
like somebody you know legitimately gets
fired for being violent I don't know but
it's always it's always made to seem
like they step down or stepped aside or
pursuing other interests or will be
spending more time with their family or
some other innocuous thing that that it
lets them save their their face for when
they get higher done then why and I
think a lot of that if yes it is i think
a lot i think a lot of that is tied to
uh you know the departure package um the
louis vuitton golden parachute exactly a
good example is um Sinofsky when he left
microsoft i think this actually came out
in some sec filing that microsoft had to
make where they disclosed that he was
under you know an NDA for some period of
time where he any couldn't disparage
microsoft publicly and in return he got
some ridiculous amount of money and you
know me personally if you give me you
know 10 million dollars to to not say
anything negative about an employer that
I feel treated me poorly I think that's
an offer that I would probably take um
you know I actually actually have a
really awesome crow idea right here
which is that each one of these
executives is part of the golden
parachute should get one of these
Porsche Design vibrates nice to be like
we're going to recompense you with loads
and loads of money
in the form of porsche design
blackberry's yeah instead of giving 10
million dollars they get 500 porsche
design BlackBerry's own that what we
also like to see how long we can love
without acknowledging teeth of holiness
weight is is dieter in the Hangout
dieter is present but but he he's
occupied right now he's ocupado um that
doesn't mean he's not present in his
heart's not with us um yes this isn't
ocupado like Spanish for the bathroom is
in use let's just-okay that's just och
it's just occupied here you're saying
the dieter is is going to the bathroom
right now dieter is going to the
bathroom right now the bathroom is in
use yes this is the this is the micro
studio / bathroom oh no a replacement to
broadcast video what is he doing Lissa
if you're if you're watching the video
of this I apologize and if you're
listening to the audio of this I also
apologize I now have two lads hey I'll
have two months and the real ones I've
got two lads and the real one there is
probably a remnant one of me left over
because it's google hangout he'll hate
me uh but I'm not giving up I'm just
gonna keep coming back and multiplying
until it lets me stay yes awesome guys
ah ok so I've had enough talking about
blackberry so apparently the FCC has
allowed it's it's already allowed
gadgets in the first ten thousand feet
of a flight and now it's considering
allowing phone calls uh which is
apparently well not apparently this is
actually my worst nightmare ever um but
it's up to the airlines right if they
want to allow passengers to make phone
calls while they're on a plane so here
it is so outraged about that so here's
my thought on this the FCC um the FCC
yeah the FCC they gave us they gave us
one you can use your devices on planes
now but you're gonna suffer
through the phone calls of every other
passenger its equivalent exchange glad
if you've ever been trapped on a train
with somebody who's like gabbing on the
phone the entire time and you can't get
away from it uh that's what's wrong with
it just just magnify that little clean
all right fair enough there's a problem
but there is an entirely a social
problem that is not technological
problem whatsoever that it basically
tells you you need to sort out your
culture and your fellow Matt right so
the next time you stuck with somebody on
the train and there gabbing on and on
what you want to apply is a very subtle
very proportionate bit of violence so
that they know not to do that and from
there you evolve your society of of your
culture and things improved don't have
to load you back just because you're
kind of evil in weird and inconsiderate
well I I mean I don't think that's
holding technology back the technology
is there to do it now it's just not
allowed by regulations and the FCC is
considering allowing it and letting
Airlines decide whether they will allow
it on their planes or not so I mean
that's what a generation done the
regulation is holding the technical
thing back which is you know say don't
do my I don't know it's holding people
back from doing the technical thing I
guess but the sea I feel I feel like if
we were just a bit more considerate this
is a bonus and positive thing for people
like if you're on a plane and there
actually is some sort of real emergency
i mean you know listen let's not get
into like the terrorist situations or
whatever but we look at documentaries
people try to leave messages for their
loved ones and whatnot and and I me in
those circumstances it is kind of a
useful thing and in in more innocuous
ones as well I just think if we annoy
one another that's a social problem and
we shouldn't be regulating that out the
way you should be or consider is society
well the silver lining here is that
while it may be you know permissible
from a regulatory standpoint the
airline's do have the option to just
tell you to please please some don't use
your phone
this like a poor like a movie theater
you can still use your phone in a movie
theater you just really should no no
they'll kick you out of the movie
theater they might can't like open the
door well they could I regret about that
I speak would be uh really i mean that's
like a pretty severe penalty for using
your phone so the point that's been made
to me in the past and this is a very
fair point is that until relatively
recently you can make calls on planes
using air so i think is eric called air
cell which was later purchased by
verizon and that spectrum that was used
for that service i believe is what
eventually became go go so go-go's data
service is terrestrial based they just
use their own set of cell towers that
are pointed upward instead of laterally
and that's how you get Wi-Fi in your
plane right now but this service all
effectively already existed and and no
one ever used those phones which is why
the spectrum was sold off and part of
that was that it was just a very very
expensive service i'm sure that lots of
people would have liked to call their
family and friends and say hey I'm
calling you from 30,000 feet but it was
like ten dollars a minute or something
so if they you know I could see a
situation where their lines do allow it
but say you know we're going to put just
a ridiculous price on it and so you know
if you make need to make an emergency
call some business related thing that
needs to happen right now you can do it
it's just going to cost you an arm and a
leg and that's going to keep the
riffraff off their phones I mean like
thinking back over my lifetime all the
plane rides I've been on beclin aerosol
existed i never saw a single person used
any of those phones so they can just
priced it as as poorly as they priced
aircel that'll keep people off their
phones but then there's another point
which is like if I'm in one of those
situations my first port of call might
actually be Skyped using an internet
connection boom
right so if you have Wi-Fi on the flight
already you can you can but they block
the block voice over yeah airline Wi-Fi
has probably blocked almost universe
they block all streaming pretty much and
I mean the the bandwidth is so terrible
that ok game so they block streaming I
don't know if I don't know about that I
see people constantly sucking down
massive Netflix quantities of data who
who is watching netflix on a plane like
what what magical aircraft had everyone
is what everyone is trying to use
netflix on the plane ok not successfully
i guarantee you they're not doing it
successfully a lot of people who buy
movies ahead of time on their iPad or
iPhone or whatever and then watch it on
the plane but they're not streaming
netflix wait I'm sorry I'm sorry how do
they how do you how do they do that do
they use itunes yeah to purchase drm
free music and and mp4 files no wait
what are you talking I don't know what
evidence going I don't know wait every I
didn't know however knows this much
detail about the type of file being
played back when somebody else's tablet
yeah what's going on here at actually
actually this is an incredible segue to
a thing that is not on our topic list
but that I am extremely passionate about
that I would love to talk about Aaron
and pretty do it if we I just have to
clarify for my fellow European podcast
participants because we're all
participants of this my understanding of
this is basically that America is land
of the free but air of the regulated
because all of her so far is we don't do
this we don't allow that we regulate the
other I mean guys I mean it fit with
your hope in all honesty the airline
industry is probably one of if not the
most regulated industries in the US it's
it's like when you compare that to like
the firearms industry it's like complete
different world oh oh so complete
irrelevant aside but worth mentioning I
don't think you guys have the federal
agency for food safety
doesn't have the right to shut down a
particular production food I think
that's done at the state level which
kind of freak I don't know enough about
our own government to say yes or no
that's true or false but I would be
surprised yeah that's the thing let us
yes let's catch this using avocados as
an example yeah there's a there's a
there's an avocado plant in in
California that's producing rancid
avocados yeah you're saying that the FDA
can't be like yo stop doing or no it
wouldn't be that to be the USDA yo USDA
can definitely do that they can
definitely shut down okay that's
producing rancid the USDA has shut down
like entire tomato pipelines for
salmonella okay I like the idea of like
an actual pipeline with tomatoes right
and they just like they screwed on a
valve and the tomato supply just cuts
off it's all routed through like the
USDA headquarters are just like well
made us not today yep well I mean to to
chris's example Bob Mikado's that would
actually be a pretty major impact on the
California economy the tikati if you
have for some time around a Super Bowl
it would be has guacamole consumption
around the Super Bowl is a major deal
for the US economy okay I get I guess it
might be spreading some misinformation
but I don't know this it was part of my
research when the US when the US was
shut down went the state things were
running in like skeletal mode there was
a salmonella outbreak again in
California with some chicken chicken
salmon that well when that when the
government was shut down that was a
major problem was because things like
the FDA didn't have the resources
available to do their job like they
couldn't enforce their jobs and do their
the necessary food inspections and all
that right right because the government
while I was looking into that um I make
somebody pointed out that they didn't
have quite as much regulatory reach and
power is it really should do even when
there
tional but again that was like not today
so obviously it's not part of my memory
and Evan I would just like to point out
I mean you even to post to this podcast
you know it's just tradition to cut off
a perfect segue but not of take care of
that no of course I'm taking care of it
please pick up the same way okay so I I
wanted to speak a little bit about a
recent an antec article by brian klug
about removable storage and removable
batteries on android phones um the one
of them is very important to me the
other one I could not care less about
removable batteries I mean we've we've
talked about this before it's really
great you can you know you're you get an
extra at galaxy s4 battery and just slap
it in there when you're out of when
you're out of juice but removable
storage this is something I'm very very
passionate about in fact it was one of
the main motivating decisions of my
motivating reasons for me to get a
xperia z1 by the way America oh god it's
so great you just don't does he want is
the best cell phone I have ever owned in
my life okay for example I'm gonna come
back to I'm gonna come back to removable
storage in just one woman but
anecdotally yesterday I had this phone
in the sauna for 20 minutes 25 minutes
totally fine asterisks I'm not
responsible if you take your phone in
the Sun and it doesn't work then I took
it in the shower perfectly great listen
to podcasts while i was in while I was
in there oh so good there's no there's
no reason why that is a lie i have to
dispute that because if you're in the
shower the splashing of the water
actually gets in the way of listening to
the podcast well you don't you don't
like bathe with the z1 like as a bar of
soap like you set it off to the side
just do this is the full conversation is
making me really uncomfortable okay like
just don't take your phone into the
Turkish bathhouse and you'll be fine
okay anyway so
part of what brian is saying is that
there are a lot of trade-offs that you
that you give up for removable storage
removable batteries um and one of his
one of its points and that's very true I
mean it's it's really really true he
makes a point about the unibody kind of
product design and I mean you can fit a
3000 milliamp battery in you know a
space that would only allow you to get a
22 hundred million battery from a few
generations ago with the removable back
that's very true um and really I don't
miss removable batteries at all because
I'm not really Road Warrior II that hard
but on Android there's there's kind of
this thing that I wanted to talk about
and that is that that Android is not set
up to integrate very well with external
storage and this is something that I
find it just be like malarkey um first
and foremost watch your language Evan I
know I know it is a family show Evan I'm
really throwing around those uh taking
this to a dork what's a 7-letter word is
it I'm gonna have to get up the courage
for like five minutes call out brian
klug just kind of dodging around the
issue touching around the issue and now
let's get to the meat Evan what is your
issue so so there's two things going on
here and that is a technological issue
like a technological and software issue
and then there's the kind of corporate
strategy issue that i have with a google
and its control over android and its
displeasure with external storage um and
like basically what it comes down to is
like Google doesn't want you to have
external storage and Google doesn't
really want you to have a very high
capacity phone I don't want you to have
external storage that's an original
problem and I take anything and think
about all the horrible things you could
be doing with external storage I mean I
think the world is just better if you
don't have external storage yeah well I
mean it's such a it's such a pain in the
you-know-what to have to thank about
character caucus
yeah do they have to think about where
your your your media is going like it
should just be one contiguous block and
the only effective way to do that is to
have it all be I mean this has been the
windows phone argument to write like
babies that is not true that is
absolutely not true if you remember the
original windows phones that came the
windows phone 7 s yeah that was it that
was a nightmare that was that was a
nightmare and and Samsung got into a
world of hurt because of it right well
like what do you mean okay why was it a
nightmare it seems like not it seems
like the actual opposite of a nightmare
in that that was part add Revis dream it
was a dream know what you can do is you
can absolutely um format and and contain
your storage even with on two different
volumes you can format it and either
stripe it um or just make a 22 logical
drives into a one logical drive it's
very possible from a software front um
it could be it could be integrated into
android very very easily that does
prevent you from ever taking it out if
you ever take it out all your all your
stuff gone so then what is the point of
external storage i think evan is on the
brink of like suggesting you know raid
storage and multiple so that my crazy
cousin it can totally be done that chris
just brought up with the samsung's was
that the uh care to remember the name of
the phone right now but the first
Samsung Windows Phone had a micro SD
card slot and you need a card in and I
mean I said it was so good and it would
format it and then you could never use
that card for anything else and it was
like your card was just shot okay so
that okay so what you're talking about
is one poor implements one poor software
implementation from Samsung and who ever
heard of that a and B like it can be
done better like I can absolutely be
done better and I feel like this is a
conversation an argument you should have
made it like 2009 man okay yeah guys I
need to I need to make a point here hold
on Facebook point which is quite aside
from the really in-depth and techy stuff
that everybody
talking about micro SD cards are just
tiny and i'm thinking around for them
right now and I can't find it and the
thing is I can get behind the whole
let's have removable storage i said like
i have one card with all of my movies on
it i have another card we'd like my
dubstep albums on it and such as such
and if we do a really good
implementation so hard just for your
dubstep takes more work TX of dubstep at
least you thought you got it's only like
this I will find my songs on one card
okay nope same card adapters ahem are
you really struggling to find your it so
here's one right now yeah they're good
see okay thing yeah there we go I mean
look at how freaking tiny these things I
mean the best the most common thing
people do with them is lose them when
they're not in the phone so this is how
Asian disk yeah but we I don't know any
stock in sandisk so I can keep going and
we'll listen so basically the point I
want to make I was just trying to make
my opponent man and let me just finish
it quickly do it it's very brief it's
removable media made sense back in the
day will remove a media with something
you could graph like you know something
you could handle a cartridge like a see
ya a minute disk or whatever right SCF
yeah perfect example what is this
freaking tiny it just way too easy to
loot so the removable aspect actually
just becomes a pain in a chore I mean
that is true that is very true and
really like once you put in your micro
SD card it's kind of just like in there
and and I don't know very many people
that are like actively swapping like I
take so many pictures then I have to
swap to the next card so I can blast
through three thousand more 8-megapixel
he's also one of those people I would
like to note into well I mean I mean
there's lots of people that fill up
their phones with pictures all day long
you know my wife does that all the time
but I think you know I understand what
you're saying Evan uh but I think that
external storage is really not going to
come back outside of the world of
Samsung anytime soon what I do wish
would happen is i wish that
manufacturers especially manufacturers
like Apple would not charge such a huge
premium to get a decent amount of
storage built into the device well so
here's here's what I would just cause a
hundred dollars to put 16 gigs more
story and it costs like three dollars
and twelve cents so it's like the
difference in price between a base level
iphone and iphone that's like got a
usable amount of storage is like
ridiculous the same can be said for the
iPads I mean it's very true and but
here's here's my like real kind of
larger problem with this is that you
know the first when you talk about
removable storage on Android the first
thing people come back with is well I
mean phones come with 32 gigs now phones
come with 64 gigs you know storage or an
option that you can get it is super
expensive but Oh rose uh-uh he can't
make his point poor evan bayh android
phones are not google hangout what do
you expect Google shut down that
conversation ah so let's let's move on
um well actually it's really anti climax
again to that Randy okay before we do is
squeeze in an extra rent which is on the
sim extractor tools so up like in
looking for the microSD card I dug up
for all of mine and like I say I would
like dozen of them and the one of the
drive the one level five is really
really tiny hello hey Evan side on that
and it is really skinny and actually
using the LG g2 Simic structure to on
the Nexus 5 it's too thick and I find
quite a lot of dimension too thick then
there's this nokia one which is like
really shallow and bent at this point
which doesn't get deep enough on some
phones and this is the thing i
discovered that there's actually
fragmentation in sim extraction fools ya
know i discovered this i discovered this
exact issue last year with the nexus 4
because the
the nexus 4 is a really tiny sim slot
hole and I couldn't so ignore that I've
always kept a nokia pin on my keychain
at all times for this exact reason and
you i couldn't i confited into the nexus
4 I carry around this bed paperclip
because I can never managed to hang on
to sim extracting tools and this works
for like ninety-five percent of phones
except for the stupid Nexus 5 and even
sometimes a nexus 4 because it's
literally this tiny little thing is too
thick to fit in the nexus 5 slot so yeah
fragmentation man and and wind enough
i'm a christian this one I think no kid
Apple make the best instruction to lose
if he cares and evan is so you know
dismissive and since I conversation
let's what what they really not do do
iphone TV come with a sim extraction
tool I got anymore they used to write at
one that maybe I don't know how did they
must what would he talk about demo soon
I don't know because the sim is already
in the phone when you buy it from yeah
but for you guys I get the left on
phones yeah it's gonna say Apple is
selling a a sim free phone now this just
happened in like the past week they
started stocking the sim free phones and
Us stores so they I mean yeah they must
include a tool with those I guess but
i'm ninety-nine percent sure there
wasn't one in my box yeah i don't think
there is uh in in most retail boxes i
think that uh apple just expects you to
either have one if you're looking for
one or their apple store employees will
handle this insane keep in mind this is
the company that's been trying for at
least two and a half or three years now
to move to embedded sims so it's little
surprised that they would make the sim
is difficult to get to as possible i
have returned we'll see how long this
one lasts yes yes witkin so uh it's um
well catch me up you're really talking
about sim extraction tools right now yes
which i'm sure you have some strong
thoughts on heaven I have duh no item I
mean so whatever I keep it I keep a
Nokia in an apple one on my keychain
both yes but aren't they interchangeable
the problem is that i will do know that
nexus the next
five or you need to have a super thin
one like the Nokia one that comes with
the Lumia 1020 to get into it's like no
my nokia one is way too thick for LG
phones look sorry man sounds like a
personal problem i still haven't um i
still haven't bought a nexus 5 should i
buy nexus 5 absolutely no because are
you out of your mr. opportunity to spend
eight hundred dollars on it from bestbuy
and now you would have to buy it for a
reasonable three hundred and fifty
dollars so i don't see why you would
purchase one I still like the Nexus 4
and nessa this on a bed phone you can
buy my activities in wage inviting
school but but Evan I'm intend to hooks
do you want to wrap up the microsd point
here yeah yeah yeah I totally do I
totally do so in America um you know all
of the flagship phones pretty much come
with 32 and 64 gig options- the carrier
galaxy s4's but if you um if you know if
you want something cheaper than you're
buying phones off contract it's really
hard to find storage options the HTC One
mini is a good example like that only
comes in 16 gigs uh and a lot of lower
end phones either lower end phones
either have removable storage to keep
this the costs really low and those are
like true low-cost devices or smaller
phones that you would imagine to be a
little bit lower cost they really only
come with 16 gig options and if you're
like most people I would imagine if you
have constant access to LTE LTE then
you're great you can you know you can
use all the Google services and you can
contribute to their data sets and that
is super fine and peachy but if you live
internationally and a you don't have
access to google music or some of the
streaming options that are available in
America then you know you're screwed you
get 16 gigs and that's all you can get
um Wow so the rest of us outside of
America I just completely off the web as
far as you're concerned as far as what's
concerned we need our storage because we
have no web services whatsoever but if I
just popped up in the States one day
yeah that's true there's no there's no
wireless outside the US didn't out
gorvan spotlight yes brother sunday from
fact yeah they're still communicating by
a carrier pigeon in the UK I mean come
on we can because the other fingers we
also don't have any food infrastructure
so we kind of tend to eat our pigeons
particular there's there's a really good
joke about terrible English food in
there but I'm gonna leave it alone no
you do know that actually one of the
famous curries is invented in Birmingham
in the UK the bounty curry so um there
you go but what does that have to do
with LTE we had to do it takes up so
much longer to order it yeah it's true
all right so you guys want to talk about
Windows Phone instagram is easy as it is
so last week instagram finally came to
Windows Phone in a official capacity uh
and there was a bit of a confusion
initially about how the app actually
worked but it turns out you can indeed
take photos with the instagram app on on
Microsoft Windows Phone but you can't
record videos which is kind of a bummer
and kind of a pretty big feature for
Instagram these days yeah it's it's it
the whole thing was just a train wreck
from beginning to end so that they
actually Instagram was telling outlets
including us that that you could not
take photos from within the app and
that's still like tesnem take room yeah
because you you go to the you go to the
camera roll and then you can take a
photo from there but like why would you
mince words against your product like go
ahead and you know just take the take
them all again and say yes you can take
photos with the app because in reality
you can this is on a technicality you
have to go outside you have to do it but
still from within the app so it is
really weird it's a different order of
things and say like on Android or iOS
where you you get to like take your
photo immediately but it's I mean at the
end of that you can still open yeah I ok
the button and take photos it's just so
funny that that was the kind of turn of
events because this is such a you know
an anticipated moment for Windows Phone
and then it just gets immediately so
weird trashed and even so though you
still can't do video recording with it
so they're not at future parody and it
seems like it seems like there was some
rush imposed most likely by Microsoft
keep to get this product out of the door
probably in time for the holidays
because Instagram is such a big name and
was the you know the most important
remaining hole in their app lineup but
it's it's kind of a hollow victory
because they didn't close the gap
completely they wanted the name without
regard for making sure that the app was
every bit as good as it is on other
platforms then of course there's ongoing
issue and Tom Tom Warren pointed this
out in a report that he did on quote
unquote closing the app gap that once
the app is launched be it Instagram be
advised be at Twitter or whatever none
of these developers are as committed to
keeping those apps updated on Windows
Phone as they are an Android iOS for
good reason because they have a tenth of
the users so there's not you know the
impetus and the incentive to keep those
users happy isn't as strong
mathematically as it is on other
platforms and that is going to be an
ongoing challenge I mean we even see
this with Android Android you know they
might Android might have all of the the
same big-name apps as iOS but when new
features come out they come to iOS first
and then be a months later show up on
Android I think instagram has been
pretty good about keeping its Android
app sort of concurrent with with the iOS
one but there's still some things that
it's missing uh and you know other apps
are much worse offenders where it'll be
a long time between the the feature
parity so it's it's you could just like
magnify that for windows phone and
you know we've seen that with the just
an example is like the official twitter
app the official twitter apps on iOS and
Android generally get updated the same
day they're the same day they get the
same new features and then months and
months later they'll come to Windows
Phone I think it was just recently
updated to let you set get alerts when
somebody tweets so now you can finally
get like mobile alerts through the app
when you set say so when a Barack Obama
tweets or whatever it'll alert you
through the app which the Android and
iOS have had for a long long time and
when of course the other problem is that
they're they're still Microsoft is still
chasing these big name apps that are
already out but when new like really
buzzed where the ABS come out and the
example that I used on Twitter when I
was talking about this last week is
quizup which is a really hot app for iOS
right now that won't come out for
windows phone for months if ever I don't
know like I don't know if quizup has
plans to launch on Windows Phone
although you probably don't want to
download it right now anyway the privacy
but yeah I I regardless the point is
there you know these these the
developers that are trying to get these
new apps off the ground naturally choose
I OS and to some extent android on day
one rim capsules another example of a
you know the temple run 2 way to uh
incentives go ahead then well the
biggest one that's that's the most
amusing to me is a mirror's edge which
is is now available on Windows Phone and
came out I believe or less this past
summer I believe if I'm not mistaken
that debuted with the iphone 4 in 2010
on iOS and it goes either early two
thousand thirteen or middle 2013 when it
got to Windows Phone which is like but
what were you gonna say about incentives
well i'm about to stay and wait wait to
Christian Susan okay are we done here
the Christmas point he's talking about
incentives and you know why developers
will keep the development part going and
I think we all know even though it has
been
fish do that instagram coming to Windows
Phone was incentivized by big piles of
cash from Microsoft right that's pretty
much given but their payment most likely
related to just bring Instagram to
Windows Phone like that sentence and
from both perspectives you can see the
strategic advantage it's about the
conversation of the bus where two guys
talking trash about well I've got my
windows phone and I've got my iphone and
yeah but mine has the apps and then you
know they start comparing which apps
which platform has etc because that's
actually happening out in brio
conversations to real people and you can
say I've got Instagram Windows Phone
even if it doesn't have proper feature
parity is there so strategic advantage
for Microsoft is there it's fine and you
can justify what Microsoft has pushed so
hard to get the app onto its platform
but Chris identifies a real big issue
which is what happens after version 1
point 0 because with the iphone what
keeps happening is here's a is 7 update
and then two days later here's our iOS 7
update with a few fixes now that we've
seen a few errors and whatever it just
really in stood and this responsiveness
and people are working to vol would
improve the app and what I'm noticing
happening is with Android which is
becoming a stronger more prevalent
platform a lot of the developers also
using android phones so they have that
kind of unprompted stimulus to keep
developing their rap on a different
platform that iOS everybody knows that
iOS is the one that you made the most
money on it's one of Mexican sense to
develop for developer but if you
yourself use Android like me for example
like I can't use an iphone anymore
because I'm so addicted to the Android
Gmail application so if you're stuck
with Android for whatever reason and
you're a developer um I'm stuck with
Android for very positive and a happy
reason I'm not complaining it I think
for me for my users is more useful than
the iPhone because they also don't screw
around with premise evading apps like
quiz up
thank you for the challenge by the way
Chris but that being the case that's a
little advantage for people if people
are using your operating system it
encourages them to keep developing for
and developing from plea for it so it
kinda comes down to is Windows Phone an
attractive operating system of people to
use it just comes back to the basic set
yeah I mean really this is this same old
story that we've had since since Windows
Phone came out uh it does seem like you
know they are getting more and more of
the apps that we've been looking for in
addition to Instagram vine is now
available the same day that Instagram
came out ways came out uh which i'm not
sure why you'd use ways but it's out uh
and there are other big-name apps that
have come along you know they now have
pandora and paypal and and all these
other apps that that we're listening for
a long time but to be clear ways is like
the netflix of of navigation apps like
they're their sole goal is to be on
every platform imaginable so it's like
to an extent i'm like you know when when
I hear that weighs comes to Windows
Phone I don't think that's and that's
actually indicative of any trend well
the only thing that's really interesting
about ways coming to interest about
Windows Phone to me at least is the fact
that ways is now owned owned by Google
and Google has pretty much said that
we're not really developing for windows
phone until it gets more right well part
of ways this whole deal is just
acquiring massive quantities of traffic
data so I mean maybe that's google's
play or waze's play is like well you
know maybe nobody will use it but we'll
still be able to suck down a bunch of
traffic and you know public transit data
well I talked to Tom a little bit about
that and his theory and I think this is
probably a reasonable one is that they
had windows phone on their roadmap prior
to the Google acquisition hmm so it's
even though and and Google as we've seen
from Motorola has a habit of running
some of its acquisitions as independent
companies anyone know that's the case
with ways or not but they do still
identify as ways not as Google
I think yeah so here's one another
question actually have about Windows
Phone now that the Xbox one has happened
first of all any of you guys buying have
you obtained an xbox one yet yes yes
Chris you care about the synergies that
things like Xbox SmartGlass and whatever
other carpeting apps types of those do
you care about those things I use
SmartGlass quite a bit but only because
the xbox one's um control like AV
control environment / ecosystem is it
just an enormous bag of hurt as Neil I
did a pretty good job of laying out in
his report a few weeks ago so having
smart glass as a tool to help control
that is a good thing but what do you
used on hers Oh on my iPhone yeah so
things like there's no there's no reason
for you to buy a windows phone in order
to use your Xbox you don't you don't do
gain anything by having Microsoft's own
phone yeah that was my question to
Microsoft's gaming system and I think
the answer is going to be no because
microscope was wise enough to realize
that we need to release this out on
Android and iOS because that's where the
users are right it's funny going all the
way back to Windows Phone 7 Microsoft
had made such big big promises about
Xbox Live integration and none of that
really materialized right well it what
one thing has there's a there's a halo
game on Windows Phone and you can't get
that on Android or iOS so if you really
want to play halo yeah and you you know
you can see your your avatar and your
your gamer points and all that nonsense
but it's not like it's nothing like I
mean if Microsoft had been really smart
in that regard they would have done
something similar what Sony is doing
with Vita and remote play it's 18 they
never did that what's really interesting
to me is like this kind of goes to
Microsoft's play on it all of its
platforms they all look very similar now
even though
the xbox dashboard looks very much like
Windows 8 which looks very much like
Windows Phone 8 but the xbox dashboard
doesn't really talk to windows 8 and
windows 8 doesn't talk to Windows Phone
8 and it's like they have all of these
products that look very similar and
maybe function very similarly but
there's no benefit to you to have a
windows phone 8 and a Windows 8 tablet
at the same time like you can't share
your apps your data might be shared over
through the cloud but you know if I'm
storing stuff in SkyDrive it can also
access SkyDrive on my Mac and I can
access SkyDrive on a ipad and etc etc so
it's like there seems like there's some
sort of opportunities that are not being
taken advantage of at least not yet
right well talking about incentives like
if if Microsoft can't incentivize
developers you know on a massive scale
to develop apps for their platform
perhaps they can incentivize consumers
with a tighter integration between there
are three platforms exactly i mean if if
like if I'm playing like if I'm doing
something and I just want to like share
data between my windows 8 tablet and my
windows phone 8 or you know share a nap
across them or something like that like
that that kind of makes sense but it's
not happening not now at least well
let's just point out the fact that
nobody is really doing that beautiful
integration across devices well the iPad
and the iphone i can buy and I an app on
my iPad and I can use it on my iphone if
it's a universal app in place yes but
it's incomplete it's incomplete is what
I'm saying so yeah that there are some
strengths but for example if you go and
try to rely on iCloud you quickly
realize that Google services so much
superior what are you talking about okay
and and the other thing is I work for
iCloud is just a joke it's like some kid
trying to copy Google Docs it's terrible
it's is so far from being useful um but
yeah I mean my in my experience again I
find the most useful implementation
should be Google's so I can mess around
with some notes on my phone on google
drive and then jump onto my
a chrome on my desktop and the notes are
there and things like that but it's
still really rudimentary still a sort of
thing where you feel like you're just
getting some basic sync between your
devices and that's it whereas I think
the vision that Chris had as well with
the initial introduction Windows Phone
something like perfect design for me is
the xbox live arcade right so those are
lighter games simple games once it don't
require as much storage if you could
just you know bring that onto the phone
and have games like braid and whatever
just accessible and your phone it opens
up so many more possibilities and and it
frustrates me as well when guys that
Microsoft promised things like well we
now have direct x compatibility in
Windows Phone 8 and I keep waiting ok we
have direct x compatibility now where
are other more advanced games where is
this awesomeness that I can't get on the
other platforms and Alex who keeps
missing I mean that's the story of every
build conference you know for the last
couple of years I mean you guys remember
that that demonstration where they
showed a game being played on a Windows
8 machine at the initial windows 8 BUILD
conference and then you know kind of
seamlessly transitioning over to
continuing the game on the subway but
those kind of features like never really
materialized and we know we're still
waiting for them now Chris let me ask
you this have you tried using um the
xbox one SkyDrive and integration for
game streaming no so from what I
understand you can record you can use
the like five minute DVR a feature of
the xbox one to record five minutes of
gameplay and then I think that you can
have that automatically deposit that
five minutes into SkyDrive and I think
there's pretty tight integration with
Facebook so you can very seamlessly post
those game those game trailers to order
this game that gameplay footage directly
onto facebook so like these little
integrations are like starting to make
their way but I think what we're all
realizing at this point is
it's like really hard and that's why no
one is really doing it but I mean
Microsoft is at least trying yeah I
usually isn't alone well I was just
gonna say I use I use so the xbox one is
a built-in video sharing service called
upload and you can choose like when you
save a video clip you can choose to save
it to upload or to SkyDrive and I don't
think I've ever opens SkyDrive in my
life at least not intentionally so I
just I'm using the upload service this
guy drive is good don't hate SkyDrive
yeah SkyDrive is actually one of the
better cloud backup if you're listening
to this podcast like two months from now
maybe in 2014 or some point we'll
probably be talking about a new service
whatever the new name is right because
they were name is cod right all right
but yeah just to just to add to the
point meiosis isn't alone in capturing
these gameplay footage things Sony did
the whole extra hardware layer so we can
do game recording and the ps4 which
device I am totally not a gamer and I'm
like a self-proclaimed not a gamer uh
but there's just like I just cannot
grasp the appeal of watching somebody
else's recorded gameplay footage like I
know I know and there's like millions of
people that use this twitch service and
things like that but I'm like why would
I want to watch some guy running around
through whatever game it is uh but
there's reasons there's reasons
particularly for like guides if you're
struggling with overcoming about a
particular boss fight or whatever else
and like hyper competitive gaming like
Starcraft is huge because people want to
see other people's strategies and it's
like a big deal well I uploaded a sweet
video of me doing donuts in a 90 91 GMC
typhoon our cyclone excuse me so I but I
don't know what you guys are talking
about like why people wouldn't want to
see that I don't know that's 15 seconds
of your life well spent that's the thing
i think i'm totally booked with dan what
i am the opposite of that is
far as game system work for my
upbringing than proper education has but
i I don't I don't get the appeal of
particularly like streaming your gaming
session like not doing something clearly
focused such as a guide or such as Chris
is showing up from whatever else I've
already watched I've watched Tom Warren
successfully defend his his goal in in
fifa 14 so I mean I like I'm all about
it I every time I see one of my friends
upload a video I'm I'm all up on it I
love it but it's just so wrong and okay
but also to mention on the pc nvidia has
this shadow play feature which a lot of
people quite enthusiastic about which
pretty much does the same thing i'm just
trying to convey the idea that everybody
seems to be getting on board with it and
then and i completely don't get it chris
is being a troll right now but I mean
particularly with games if you're going
to show a video of it you're really just
showing off your experience of the same
thing that other people are most likely
going to experience as well it's kind of
like um yeah bring it back to like it's
but it's it's no different than wine
watch a replay of like a really good uh
you know touchdown in a football game
like there are there are epic moments in
games that are that have entertainment
value like you know a good a good
overtake in in a heated force a match
I'll watch that yeah that is valid
that's fine i'm not going to argue with
that I'd like I guess the thing is with
games most of the time you don't have
these highlight of things so right i
guess if you're being selective and just
uploading the particularly juicy bits
then i can get behind that but also
since we are under this topic very
briefly i would just like to point out
this entire hoop around the new consoles
is completely premature as far as I'm
concerned nobody should care until
titanfall shows up on the Xbox one and
just
blows us all away these consoles don't
have that amazing game which is going to
keep you locked in next to you TV
throughout the holiday season which i
think is you know the hallmark of a good
console launch and if you want the
absolute prettiest and best graphics you
still have to consume pc and play
battlefield 4 which looks stunning I get
a good graphics card play battlefield 4
no true settings it will make you forget
about the consoles seriously but there's
also the other proviso / caveat that
better fit for its gameplay is actually
like stupid horribly horribly stupid I
haven't gotten to the multiplayer but a
single player missions just lay it's
exactly like the stunning supermodel
stereotype amazing to look at completely
dumb and hollow on the inside actually
just give them my chest so uh kind of
going back to to this integration and
consumer incentivizing thing really
quick Chris have you you can you could
you watch your friends uh like DVR or
live streamed footage on smart glass I'm
smart glass I don't think so but they're
you like third party apps can integrate
listen with SmartGlass i think and xbox
one ships with twitch yeah so there
might be some integration point there i
don't know i don't use twitch and I
don't have twitch installed on that's
box but it's possible okay well I'm just
trying to figure out which is like who
has the tighter like the tighter app
integration because the PlayStation app
just came out the other day and it will
allow you to throw to you stream uh but
but aside from that like aside from the
smart glass app I'm really at a loss to
to kind of understand who is who is in
reading better because Microsoft has the
advantage i would i would think because
the design language between Windows
Phone and the Xbox like you I and the
windows 8 UI is like very contiguous it
feels very cohesive uh and Sony's kind
of trying to deal with their own closed
ecosystem but also Android and but I
mean the PlayStation app will let you
Lena will let you see what your what
your friends are playing and it'll let
you buy games right from the app why I
agree I agree with you that there's
design synergy between the xbox one and
Windows 8 Windows Phone but I don't
think that any human being on the planet
with an Xbox one is saying ooh I like
this you I I'm gonna go buy a windows
phone now like then that's not that's
not happening hmm I just need to call
out Evan on his use of contiguous it was
misused I apologize you've been docked
one point so uh if you guys don't mind
let's let's move on I've got a question
and it is as I fall my face to this
transition this is this is on topic and
I just I just make sure this isn't an
embargo I got an email from bestbuy they
got two special offers launching
tomorrow if sin embargo whatever like I
devices but guys guys that okay they've
got a free samsung galaxy s4 deal with a
two-year activation of best buy and best
buy mobile species to starting wednesday
free saturday do you guys swing the
galaxy s4 is worth buying at this point
I'm curious what was the deal i was
listening it's a free galaxy s4 with a
two-year contract presume that that's a
better deal than pretty much any any of
the carriers are offering on the galaxy
s4 i mean i think the the this is my
best buy so whatever carrier specify
offers but the i think the galaxy s4 is
very much like the iphone in that you
know Samsung will release it in June or
whatever it's going to be a competitive
device through to almost right up until
the next June when the next
comes out uh you know if you look at the
actual specifications of it it's got a
you know powerful processor really high
res screen a good camera and everything
like that so if you liked the galaxy s4
six months ago there's no reason not to
like it now you know Nelson has
removable storage the galaxy s5 is going
to be curbed isn't it no no and actually
on that topic there has been a couple of
stories is coming up careers saying that
the first generation of flexible screen
devices are flopping now the reason we
didn't cover that is because they seem
to be very flaky in terms of sourcing
it's anonymous sources and nobody sounds
particularly confident about the numbers
but at least one occasion out I mean
well it's been a month over a month but
they're being sold in really limited
quantities right i mean like it's not
like it's available all over the world
they're being sold just in korea i think
right and they're being sold alongside
their flat equivalents which are
presumably much cheaper in store it's
possible it was i'm just saying again
with the proviso mentioned that at least
the earliest feedback we've heard about
them hasn't been that positive which as
far as you're concerned cruise is a
positive because it would probably put
them off i mean again cease fire there's
no chance of do curve because they just
can't do that mass production levels it
CJ the mass production levels geneve
Evan record a record the last ten
seconds of this podcast I want to put
that in Vlad's face when the galaxy s5
is curved no problem we'll have a
breakout alright thanks awesome but I
actually am concerned this into a pretty
nice transition here into pretty nice
segue provided nobody interesting which
is to say that the google play edition
of the galaxy s4 just out of getting the
4.4 kitkat update as has the HTC one
which is a credential the past week a
whole bunch of phones got it the nexus 4
finally the role that started for that
uh
I've had it on my Nexus 4 for a week or
so and the Moto X's right now it's
available from Verizon t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T
moto x's ah so it's just leaving sprint
out of the equation for their so and
then it just started yesterday i believe
the google play edition HTC One and
Galaxy s4 started getting that's right
android 4.4 so uh you know it's good to
see it's making its way around um I
doubt we're gonna hear any more about
android 4.4 kitkat rollouts um for a
while because at this point it's the
carrier or the manufacturer customized
versions that are are the majority of
things left so that's gonna be a while
before those get it yeah and also my one
either so pissed here's the thing my
sincerest hope about android 4.4 is that
come see yest in january nobody comes
out with a phone with an android phone
that doesn't have it oh my god you are
so high there you're gonna that's all
having definitely hungry the best yeah
dude i bet you we're at CES we're gonna
see some chinese manufacturer release a
phone with android 4.1 I guarantee it
but but no I there are they're not going
to be any major phone announcements CES
there aren't but the Chinese
manufacturers doing else thinks okay see
cnet now ever keep recording oh yeah
because we're in it we're gonna need to
vote is back in Chris you know what's
gonna happen is like Sony is going to
announce yes like it did last yes and
Sony and Sonia to announce the phone
with android 4.2 okay first we'll only
to qualify a statement to say there will
not be a new phone and see yes that is
that launches or is available to buy
before April and a client but wait what
what does sony have in the pipeline
right now they're they have a fresh
megaphone and they have a fresh well
guess nose so the song that is precious
something and the Russia Sony rumors
right now that's what the freshest Sony
rumors on out in the Sony the Saudi beat
is a refreshed xperia z1 uh either
called the Xperia z2
or possibly the z1s that people thought
was the z1 mini uh I guess that's pasta
it's people are kind of not sure because
this is all rumery and shady and that
sort of thing and then there's also the
international xperia z1 Mini which
please I need to Heidi one so bad so the
way our vision what the rumors say it's
nobody's gonna know I mean best phone in
the world right now till they come out
with one that's the size for a human
hand but it existed the van as it for
Japan the mini version yes well you want
to kokomo it's I mean it's a docomo
exclusive there's no guarantee that the
international one will ever come out so
just man up a move to Japan that's cool
hey so while we're deep in the sony i'm
just going to use this in steamroll this
transition right into the the sony
smartwatch 2 which I i reviewed and it
went up today and if you haven't read it
go read it um and I just I'm just going
to sum this up by saying that it breaks
my heart because the SmartWatch 2 is in
my opinion at least the best-looking
SmartWatch we've seen um the one that's
the least embarrassing to wear ah but
it's software is so clunky and so
difficult to use that it is not worth it
and that's it's sad it's better than the
SmartWatch 1 by leaps and bounds but it
is not I don't even like it as much
usability wise as a pebble and certainly
not where I would hope that a new
SmartWatch would be at this point no one
understands what a SmartWatch should be
except me I'm literally the only human
being so nice is this is where smart
watches are smart watches it is smart
watches are the two thousand were in the
2005 smartphone world of smartwatches
yeah we're in the 2001 tablet world of
tablets and we're still a couple years
away until somebody really figures this
out and you know there's always there's
all this demand and all this interests
and all this intrigue and nobody seems
to get it right and then somebody's
going to figure it out and there's going
to be its iPhone moment and then you
know it's going to be it's going to be
great and then
and everybody a want one but we're not
there yet and all of the things that
have been tried are really not not it
but I'm convinced that's not I see where
you're going with that I'm not convinced
it's a perfect analogy because I think
what makes wearable shine is when they
are our put I mean there are things
you're literally wearing like clothes
and like jewelry they need to be
personalized to the person that's
wearing them is why uh but you know
glass looks juice well let's look stupid
at anybody but yes it isn't personalized
to the person that's wearing it there's
been talk about ending it with
prescriptions that's hard to figuring it
out I mean maybe maybe that's what needs
to be figured out it should make these
things successful but they also need to
figure out usability and functionality
and features yep ah that aren't there
yet um right so I think I nice with this
battery life yeah and battery life I was
gonna say with SmartWatch to Sony did do
a number of things right uh in my tests
i got easily got three to four days of
battery life which is acceptable at this
point for these things and it charges
over micro USB which means it uses the
same charging cable as my phone uh which
is such a stupid thing that i have to
bring it up but no other SmartWatch does
that so or none other that I've used at
least so that's it's kind of a major
convenience that I like the Sony did but
i can't stand using the software here is
my contribution and it particularly goes
to the software side the sony smartwatch
2 is probably the saddest out-of-the-box
experience that I've had with any gadget
over the past how many years 23 years
overlooked as Ben it's just I pulled it
out first of all I got that metal strap
on my review unit where his thang got
the plastic one the silicon one the
rubber one yeah brah okay and the metal
strap I had no idea of how to adjust it
so it was way too big and it was cold
and it was unpleasant you know my gentle
gentle wrist just weren't ready for it
but aside from that you turn it on you
start looking inside it for things to do
and it's just so barren it's like we
have a wallpaper we
have a time app and a timer app and we
have like four watch faces and that is
it you're on your own after that and
then you have to go and search and dig
and enhance the functionality and
getting notifications set up and all
this other baloney and nonsense which I
just wasn't even interested in doing
because I don't find it that attractive
I don't like the fact that you have the
free Android buttons on it there's
absolutely no reason for them to be on
their it needs to be clean like chris
says it is something you would want to
just wear for the sake of keeping time
like get that right first compete with
the guys who are already doing that
correctly yeah and then we want to try
to enhance things yes I do not Chris we
were you picking your nose yes what just
happened what you're not familiar with
this gesture have you address your
raisin you got it this means not it I
mean yes no yes I mean international
nose goes territory none of you guys
have played charades did this this means
yes that's it you have it right like if
you're if you're playing charades and
somebody has a word right in a phrase
you go like that meaning spot on I've
always just seemed people point and be
like no you guys are if you're onto if
you're listening to the show right now
and you're on Twitter will somebody
please back me up that this means spot
on Chris who play charades we all have
extra spirits I trust Chris and his
Wikipedia sources I'm down with them
listen if needed i'm sure it's come on
and I'm very happy to just collect the
endorsement from Chris that that makes
my day um I'm basically I don't sit what
can I say what gets it why do you and I
are going to kick-start a proper smat
watch yes that's what k underneath
another SmartWatch project yeah but they
good how else i should thinking about
that today and it's kind of depressing
to me when you think about the 90s yeah
i mean it's gonna be like to 22nd
century or whatever and i'm gonna have
artificial hearts and artificial
everything else and i'm still gonna be
in a state
think about 1990s that was my decade but
as I just mentioned that he's going to
be alive in the 22nd century which is no
less than eighty seven years away wait
why not glad glad plans to be absent
Orion at least dude I am definitely
eating the right day for this is no
cabbage to survive wait isn't that Ryan
like a like a Roman warrior or something
second area is that what I'm trying to
say centenary maybe yeah but since
ensuring is so much cooler so I'm down
with it no but seriously in the 90s we
had feet we had already figured out
anyone before the 90s it's just that's
my recollection we had already figured
out how to make a watch work without any
extra power right you could just with
the movement of your hand you could
recharge watch now that actually
happened decades before that but I just
talking about the freaking nineties man
whatever I was saying that one didn't
happen as far they did they figured it
out decades before maybe it trickled
down to actually accessible for
Norville's by that but ok listen if the
90s citizeness minutes had kinetic
watches since the 60s i'm pretty sure i
didn't say we invented kinetic watches
in the 1990s so stop bugging report man
all I'm saying is if that's the last
relatable decade for me we'll have you
wanna do have an even younger audience
let's not push it too far back my point
is is because we had figured out how to
have a watch keep going perpetually
without needed to recharge it or do any
extra special things we have figured out
how to have a contact book without
requiring any power whereas the way
we're moving now is every single one of
these things that we could do
mechanically or is some other automatic
fashion now requires power now we need
electricity to power off just for a
watch just to keep time just to keep you
know our contacts up to date and all of
these things and it's like we lose the
tactility of having an actual nice
notebook in which you give your contacts
we lose the ability to write because we
no longer need to do it like can you can
any of you remember writing like
physically writing or other than signing
signature on a bill I take notes in a
notebook all the time yeah I take notes
yeah okay well good you know that my
hand right now hard y'all's plan nation
but I don't know I mean I guess I'm just
kind of having one of those nostalgic
anti-tech moments where you kind of
think well why does everything need a
freaking battery in it why does
everything need to be powered whereas we
figured out ways to do these things you
know adequately already without power
you know and and that to me is the
fundamental issue with smart wishes is
they start sucking down power they start
demanding disturbing yet another device
that you need to keep recharged on a
weekly basis or wherever else and like
like you guys are saying we need a
really compelling feature a real must
have additional value or benefit that
makes us want to do the extra charge
again that extra fuss mm-hmm I think it
just is what makes it so hard right now
because on the one hand you want a
SmartWatch to have like this this great
functionality right out of the box you
want it to look great you want to be a
fantastic time peace um and you also
want it to you know kind of have a
couple of staples of like smartness you
know you want to receive notifications
and you want to be able to like accept
and receive calls or accept and deny
calls from your wrist um but what makes
it really challenging is that inevitably
people will want to do so much more with
it so you have to kind of know Nadia vut
ibly this Samsung has put it in your
head that you need to be able to do so
much more with your SmartWatch you don't
know you don't know i'm not saying like
you don't need to do more things with
your SmartWatch like I don't want to add
and remove contacts I don't want to like
flick through it to change music I just
want the applied I mean you know G to
each their own but like you need to at
least have the capability of extending
the functionality to things like when I
you know get in proximity of my computer
unlock it ohh
or if if I'm in proximity of my door you
know automatically unlock that or start
up my car or whatever well so motorola
kind of took a baby step in that
direction with its trusted Bluetooth
device concept right which is pretty
cool like I remember for wild eater had
his pebble set up as his trusted object
I I must I must note that you do not
need a motorola to do that you could
there's there's apps for the pebble and
there's actually apps for the sony
smartwatch i mentioned in the review
that let you do the same thing with your
phone but it doesn't open my house door
and it doesn't sign me into my laptop
and things like that that it could do
best buy is now selling uh what is it
called chemo or Kibo or Kiki go or
something like that it's it's the it's
the Bluetooth deadbolt so in there
they're slowly moving that direction but
it's going to be just complete nightmare
because they're there will be no
standards for it uh and you know that
that's why earlier today on twitter i
was i was saying that it we need harmony
irobot nast and Dyson to just merge and
like take over the home oh because no
one else is going to do this in a way
that makes any sense anest obviously has
like a plan a road map but they're
moving very slowly so maybe with some
additional horsepower they would be able
to move a little quicker but yeah I mean
all these companies are coming up with
their own solutions for it it's it's a
great idea they just need to move faster
and they need to do in a way that is
standardized would you say how many do
you mean a logitech comedy yeah yeah
butBut logitech logitech said like six
months ago that they want to spin off
harmony right so spin it right off into
miss nest yeah just yeah spin it off in
the Internet's nest and then maybe James
Dyson will air blade it into a I don't
know come up with some dude you kill
your bagless vacuum yes all right guys
before we do wrap up I I do think that
there's the cool
no a utility here with using the
SmartWatch as a security device that I
mean you guys remember a couple of
podcasts ago diesel was asking what is
the smallest tiniest bluetooth you know
transceiver that can have in order to
you know do that security and unlocking
thing and if you put it in the watch
that is the thing that is most secure
among all your devices because it's
literally strapped to you you know if
even Google glass isn't you know strap
to you I I don't really have another way
of saying that so I personally if you
make a smart watch that yeah is syncs up
with the computer and just unlocks it
powers it up from sleep when you're next
to it etc and just does these things
really smoothly I could say I done what
the Sony SmartWatch to experience where
everything is better and then I have to
go and hunt around and do things I just
needed to be out of the box working
beautiful and lovely and impressive to
nearby ladies I think that is where you
know smartwatches committee start take
it off and on that note impressing the
ladies wraps up this episode of The
Verge mobile show so we thank you for
