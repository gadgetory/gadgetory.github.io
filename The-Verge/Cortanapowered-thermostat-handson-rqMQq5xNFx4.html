we're looking at the Johnson Controls
glass thermistor this is actually the
first Cortana powered thermistor as you
can see it's got translucent display and
so you can see straight through and
that's actually a 5.9 inch samsung
manufactured OLED panel so it's kind of
unusual we haven't seen any sort of
thermostat that looks like this and to
be honest we don't really see many
translucent displays anyway so it's made
by Johnson Controls now these guys have
been manufacturing thermostats ever
since the very original 135 years ago so
you could say they probably know what
they're doing and now they've partnered
with Microsoft and it's running on
Windows 10 IOT core that probably
doesn't mean a lot to you but what it
does mean is essentially it's running on
a Qualcomm chip and so it's really like
a Internet of Things device but it's
gonna be a thermostat that's going to
sit on your wall control your heating
your calling and everything else so
we've seen a bunch of different smart
thermostats one from the nest that's
obviously the big player in the market
echo bees got one with a lexer
integration and the difference with
Johnson Controls they're kind of really
digging into monitoring your house in a
way that perhaps the other thermostats
are and so this free sensors inside here
this carbon dioxide sensor and there's
other sensors they're going to monitor
like your air quality but they're gonna
work out what the air quality is inside
and out so that will help with like cool
when your cooling systems are coming on
or even your heating systems there's
even stuff like emergency stuff for when
you're away so if you're in a really
cold city like New York City has been
recently and then if you're away this
thermostat will like spin up and keep
your components like all safe and safe
and sound so this just dig into exactly
what you can do this thermostat
obviously you can control it with your
fingers and with touch as you'd expect
and you get all the sort of information
you would expect from like an interface
on a thermostat and what's really
different is obviously the Cortana
integration hey Cortana what's the
weather like in London
okay so at the moment of the quarter no
integration is fairly basic and Johnson
Controls tells me that that in the
future and there's going to be a lot of
visual cues the sort of stuff you'd
expect from Cortana on the PC but the
moment it's only voice and it's going to
respond to us in terms of the user
interface and you've also got a lot of
the energy-saving settings that you'd
expect and you can dig in work out what
energy you saved you can even set smart
controls on stuff like your heating so
you can edit a schedule similar to sort
of sort stuff you'd see on the most
smart firm steps and you can copy those
across to other days pretty easily and
there's also a mobile now that will be
the exact same sort of user interfaces
what we're seeing here and so you can
set all those sort of things from afar
as well if you don't want to constantly
play with the screen and but yeah as you
can see it's a pretty I'd say we've said
before it's a pre beautiful diverse and
I think that plays for it's a pretty
unique because of translucent display as
well so Johnson Controls is actually
pitching us in the consumer space so
it's gonna be sold through the Microsoft
Store and through their own retail
outlets and you innovate to get this
installed by a technician or you can
actually do it yourself and there's
going to be like visual cues on the
screen it will tell you which wire's
you've connected in which you haven't
and so it can be available for pre-order
in March and it's going to run for
around about $319 and for that you're
gonna obviously get all the cultura
integration of translucent display and
just a kind of really unique thermostat
that we haven't really seen elsewhere
okay so it's a real quick look at the
Johnson Controls glass thermostat which
is obviously cool tanner powered and
four more devices at CES this week don't
forget to subscribe to our YouTube
channel and you'll see a lot more just
like this hey Cortana
hey Cortana hey Cortana</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
