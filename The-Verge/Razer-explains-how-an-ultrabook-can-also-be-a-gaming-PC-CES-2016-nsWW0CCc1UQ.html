at CES 2016 and vlad savov and with me
is kevin savor from razor thanks for
joining us Kevin and we have to really
quite exciting products right yeah we
got the razor blade stealth a new
ultrabook yes it's kind of a new thing
for you guys you don't do otra books
yeah we're just running shredding new
ground with it you do gaming devices and
the razor core yes so tell us about yeah
so starting off with the razor blade
stealth as you mentioned it's our first
ultrabook and what we're calling the
ultimate ultrabook so really the concept
behind this was taking portability to
new extremes so with our 14 inch razor
blade we really pushed the boundaries of
portability and performance what we
wanted to do with the razor blade
stealth was pushed those portability
boundaries even further into the
Ultrabook domain so it's just point 5 2
inches thin in 2.75 pounds of beautiful
cnc aluminum chassis very portable
system and a lot of performance in there
as well right so the big highlight with
the laptop itself in terms of
specifications is it has 4k display
correct yes 12.5 inch 4k display but and
this is something that we're all aware
of you can't really make an ultrabook
that can play the latest games at the
highest frame rates and this is why I
have this poor correct and how did it to
work together yeah so the concept really
was to provide an ultrabook for everyday
kind of productivity casual gaming on
the go but to allow that to really
expand for a full desktop gaming
experience so when you connect it with
the razor core it gives you desktop
graphics power also gives you connection
all your desktop peripherals like your
keyboard and mouse and external displays
as well how does it work so use bees how
you power the laptop by itself and
regular charger and when you connect to
the court that powers it yep it powers
the notebook as well as handles all the
data so thanks to Thunderbolt 3 with
speeds up to 40 gigabits per second
plenty of throughput for all the data we
need and USBC providing that power
connection as well simplifies it so when
you get back home and
connect to your desktop is just one
cable between the two devices and what
sort of graphics cards can I put in here
yes you can put in the latest generation
from both AMD and NVIDIA so full-length
dual wide pci express cards will fit
into the chassis how much of a power
supply is inside inside the razor core
got a 500 watt power supply 375 watson
that is allocated for the graphics card
the rest is to power the notebook as
well as I mean peripherals connected via
USB okay so proces here you can have a
skylight pro so with the laptop yeah so
all of them ship with the 6th generation
skylink cpu and i7 they have 8 gigabytes
of dual channel memory and pci express
solid-state storage ok so one of my
concerns with this sort of a setup it's
the dream really is but you will
eventually come up with bottlenecks you
know you Propst the won't be as far as
you remember it won't be as awesome so
can you make a promise to us that you
keep this thing going and I particularly
use bc its exchangeable but keep this we
can go with further devices and you know
you can buy quote today and then maybe
you can buy a plate laptop you know if
he is down line and we still work
together them still be something that
people can build on down the future yeah
definitely future proofing was something
we considered with this concept so it's
great about the razor cause it's super
easy to upgrade the desktop card and
then since its using Thunderbolt three
and USB see very Universal connectivity
other notebooks that are willing to
support the solution we're more than
happy to have them there's nothing
proprietary we're doing that would
prevent other people from taking
advantage of what we've designed with
the razor corn well no proprietary but
one of your signature things that you do
is the chroma which is the RGB lighting
yeah so you have another keyboard with
the lab to do you have it with the core
why do you do this isn't it because I'm
a gamer but I'm going to care about
lights is it like that much demand for
lighting in one of this defender there's
a lot of things you can do with chroma
just to run down the list roll
like one personalization so 16.8 million
colors and that's perky on the razor
blade stealth it's the world's first
individually lit RGB notebook keyboard
so you can have immense personalization
you can also do really cool effects with
it you can create your own you can
download ones and others created it also
we have an SDK for developers so it's
integrated into some of the great games
that are out there today call of duty
overwatch and a ton of other titles
allowing for really immersive
experiences with the keyboard like if
you're taking damage in the game the
keyboard could flash red if you're
waiting for a spell to cool down the key
could be not lit when it's ready to use
the key lights up is a visual indicator
and then there's even individual apps
that can run on the chroma key board so
you can play snake right on the keyboard
itself you can play whack-a-mole it has
a music visualizer so you can get kind
of an EQ affect all of that thanks to
chroma and your company logo is free
snakes triple headed snake load trip
ahead to snake and you can play snake on
the keyboard you can play snake on the
keyboard well that's pretty cool thank
you free time Kevin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
