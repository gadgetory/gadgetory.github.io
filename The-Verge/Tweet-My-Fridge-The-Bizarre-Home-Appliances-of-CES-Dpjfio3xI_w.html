how much this dishwasher home get
settied I'll walk away cook a roast my
electronic they picked up the dirt you
never knew you had
the
so home appliances have been a big part
of CES over the past four decades or so
right back to the time when they were
aspirational devices that made a big
difference to people's lifestyles and
that's not going away you think that in
the 21st century we'd have solved the
problems of how to chill your beer or
wash your clothes but that's not
stopping companies trying to infuse
these products with new ideas and
someone inevitably this tends to be
inspired by mobile we're seeing
companies make major announcements for
so-called smart appliances that
integrate functionality such as
touchscreens a home control Wi-Fi remote
and a whole bunch of other features the
frankly it probably never occurred to
you to ask for but the real question is
are these companies doing anything to
actually improve the core functionality
of these appliances like will sticking a
touchscreen on your fridge keep your
food fresh for longer will NFC tagging
help you cook better food Samsung and LG
say it will you can do things like keep
track of what's in your fridge and get
recommendations and one to cook the memo
app for these touchscreen fridges lets
you write notes on the fridge so leaving
sticky notes on the door is a thing of
the past and pretty unconvinced by a lot
of this functionality there are people
really willing to put in the time to
catalog every last detail with the stock
in the fridge is it really more
convenient to look up a recipe in your
phone and then tag your Robin with NFC
instead of just entering in the timing
yourself so these hyper expensive
fridges washing machines and dryers and
so on they're undoubtedly really good at
what they do and the companies do talk
in terms of trademark names like their
speed spray power wash and true steam
technology but really they're not the
headline feature we went to higher on
the other hand and although they did
show up a wireless charging blender they
showed up some other things which proved
that the company is focusing on
improving their core appliance
technology in areas such as energy easy
to be the noise performance their 3d
washing prototype for example has a
ridiculous name but it shows the company
has its priorities in order
and when I'm buying my next washing
machine I think that's the kind of thing
i'll be looking for rather than whether
i can turn it off with Wi-Fi on
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
