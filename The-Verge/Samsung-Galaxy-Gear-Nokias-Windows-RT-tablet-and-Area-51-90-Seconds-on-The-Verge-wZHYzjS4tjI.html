jeffries and I once rewired a microwave
to freeze thawed food although now that
I think of it that may have just been a
freezer this is 90 seconds on the verge
the samsung Smart Watch is rumored to
finally be coming according to Bloomberg
the Samsung Galaxy gear will be
announced on September for the
android-powered device will be able to
make phone calls access the internet and
handle emails according to Bloomberg
Samsung is rushing his product market in
order to be Apple which reportedly has a
hundred designers working on watch of
its own the surface RT may not have been
a huge success but that hasn't stopped
Nokia from getting in on the action
sources tell us that the company will
unveil its own tablet codenamed vanquish
at an event in late-september the 10.1
inch tablet will have LTE and will be
made available on AT&amp;amp;T in the US Nokia's
partnership with Microsoft hasn't
exactly proved to be world-changing but
maybe an RT tablet can be that little
extra kick that turns things around and
finally you know that government

document instead names area 51 as a
secret base for spy planes like the
YouTube which of course is exactly what
you would say if you were running a top
secret alien research facility and
wanted to keep your Xenomorphs under
wraps that's it for today's top stories

a house haunted by the snapchat ghost
