we are looking at the new Samsung Galaxy
Note 4 it's the latest in Samsung's
Galaxy Note line of smartphones and
tablets Note 4 actually has a number of
upgrades over last year's Note 3 same
size 5.7 inch screen but now it is
actually a qHD 2k display as opposed to
the 1080p model from last year really
looks great it's got great viewing
angles great colors it's Super AMOLED so
it's very vibrant and saturated and
there are visibly no pixels and then the
other big design change here is the new
all metal band around the side of it
this may look familiar if you are
familiar with the Galaxy alpha that
Samsung announced a few weeks back but
it's an all metal band here really
improves the quality of the device as
far as holding it in your hand feels a
lot better than the plastic material
Samsung used to use on the back here
it's got the same kind of soft touch
material but gone are the fake leather
stitching which is a huge improvement if
you ask me the camera has been improved
to a 16 megapixel module up from last
year's I believe was 8 megapixel and
then it's got these integrated heart
rate monitor that we saw on the Galaxy
s5 samsung says that the camera is one
major improvement in that it has optical
image stabilization which is the first
that for samsung so it lets you zoom in
further on digital zoom as well as get
sharper pictures in low light we've seen
a couple of manufacturers use optical
stabilization but this is the first for
Samsung and then on the front facing
camera you've got a new higher
resolution front-facing camera that has
some new tricks up its sleeve you can
just tap the display to take a picture
or you can use the heart rate sensor on
the back Samsung's also improved the
battery charging on this and now it can
charge from zero to 50% in just 30
minutes with a rapid charge technology
and of course it's got a big removable
battery just like any other Samsung
Galaxy smartphone in the past so you can
take the battery out you can add a micro
SIM card if you need to Samsung is an
announcing exact price and release date
for the galaxy note 4 just yet but it
will be available here in the US as well
as across the world in the u.s. you're
going to be able to get it on Sprint
