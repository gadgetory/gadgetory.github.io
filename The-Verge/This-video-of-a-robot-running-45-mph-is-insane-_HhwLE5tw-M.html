have built the fastest running robot in
the world outrunner the six legged
machine that can run up to 45 miles per
hour on a treadmill and 25 miles per
hour outdoors the company behind
outrunner is raising 150 thousand
dollars on Kickstarter and the creators
say they'll stage a race for the world's
fastest robots if they make that goal so
who would win MIT set a speed record in
1989 with a robot known only as the
planar biped it reached speeds of 13.1
miles per hour but only when running in
circles while tethered to a pole that
record held for 23 years until was
broken by cheetah a robot built by
Boston Dynamics the company that was
recently acquired by Google cheetah can
hit 28 point 3 miles per hour on a
treadmill faster than Olympic runner
Usain Bolt it needs a power tether
however the unleashed version of the
cheetah called wildcat can only run up
to 16 miles per hour that still beats mi
t--'s current four-legged robot also
named cheetah which clocks in at
thirteen point seven miles per hour when
indoors and tethered elsewhere in
quadrupeds the Italian Institute of
Technology is working on the high q-- a
versatile animal like robot that can
squat rear up and jump it's not that
fast though it only runs up to four
point four miles per hour over in
humanoids the toyota partner robot can
hit 4.3 miles per hour
beating Honda's Osmo which can run up to
4 miles an hour meanwhile there are
experiments with robots that run on
quote wegg's wheel legs or wing legs
that imitate bipedal running with spokes
and some of those can reach up to 6
miles per hour right now it looks like
outrunner may have a lock on the land
speed record at least outdoors but with
all these creative approaches we'll have
to see a race before we know for sure</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
