here with the nook simple touch with
glowlight know as you can tell it's
actually about the same as the milk
Simple Touch it's actually a little bit
lighter seven ounces versus about seven
and a half and the big difference here
is that it's actually got you're not
going to see in the daylight the big
difference is you can actually have this
kind of glow a screen that actually
uniformly comes down and provides light
actually a very impressive a
technologies patent-pending they won't
tell us how it works definitely can tell
there's a little bit of a LED glow at
there in a comment a new strip along
though that's not lighting up a some
kind of reflective stuff kind of show
you that a that layer right there sort
of most the lights coming in you just
the Brighton's all the way down it's
actually still slightly readable make
sure the difference between this and a
all the way off I'm actually quoting
about a month and a half of a consistent
reading so this is actually still even
amid brightness pretty good so yeah it's
still it either brightness it's actually
pretty impressive beyond the glow line
there's actually an anti-glare
reflective screen this is more or less
the same simple touch for getting about
the same kind of a little tricks the six
page refresh in the e-ink is actually
really fast it's got touch it's got the
nook store software glow lights easy to
get to just from the menu system and it
looks good day in night it's actually
looks really impressive at night when
you're reading in bed or I guess you
know on a midnight stroll and you've
really gotta finish hunger games before
the movie starts yes that's nook simple
touch with glowlight it'll be on sale
early May uh next to the Simple Touch
star going to sell both look simple
touch will still be 99 this will be 139
and it's going to have obviously the
glow light the anti-reflective glare and
