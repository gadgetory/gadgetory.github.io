taking a look at the HTC one VX which is
a successor to the one v the hardware is
different from the one be it looks
slightly similar from the front or on
the back you can see that it's got this
tapered design and the back is now a
removable plastic lid as you can see
like that which the one we did not have
it was only sim card accessible the back
is a 5 megapixel camera around the front
we have capacitive touch buttons and
it's running android 4.0 ice cream
sandwich with the sense for skin the
phone itself is running on a 1.2
gigahertz Snapdragon s4 processor has
one gigabyte of RAM and we don't have
any pricing or availability information
just yet but it's a very similar phone
to the one be the one big difference as
you'll see is the screen size the screen
is a 4.5 inch qhd display which does
look a lot better than the one b is 3.7
inch straight that's the one VX from HTC
we've also got a chance to see the 1x
plus for AT&amp;amp;T we got to see the
international variant before which has
some red accents this one doesn't but
otherwise is very similar to the 1x the
difference is all internal the phone has
a 1.7 gigahertz quad-core Tegra 3
processor one gigabyte of RAM and it has
a 720p display at 4.7 inches thick it's
super LCD just like before and it's a
beautiful screen around the side we'll
just see that the phone is very much the
same the major difference is that this
only comes in black it's a soft touch
black finish as it has Beats Audio of
course and the back is not removable it
just has a sim card slot on the sorry
volume rocker on the front we have 18
which is going to be there to stay
unfortunately on the software end this
is running jelly bean Android 4.1 and
HTC's skin is called sense for plus and
the major difference comes to the camera
which now it will turn back on if you
lock it and turn it back on you'll be
back at the camera the gallery's been
tweaked a little bit and of course you
have google now we don't have any price
or availability on the HTC one x+ but
that's a first look at the device</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
