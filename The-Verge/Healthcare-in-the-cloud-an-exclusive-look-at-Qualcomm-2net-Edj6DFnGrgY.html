at Qualcomm life and we're talking about
what the company is doing in medical
technology Qualcomm life is actually
cool comes new new company to in
wireless health and we're really working
with medical device companies to get the
data from those devices moving that's
you the plumbing you're not that you're
obviously I mean we're not making
medical devices are making their medical
devices connected to the world so that
information can be used by folks used by
healthcare professionals that's what's
really key what are the components and
how do they play together we have two
components in the two net system at this
point one is a hub and this is actually
used to get information from medical
devices you would have in a room and get
that information from those devices up
to the class it's got cellular radios
for what we would call the backhaul
getting to the Internet right and then
it's got local area radios in the form
of Bluetooth Bluetooth Low Energy Wi-Fi
and ant+ so for local area radios that
can be used and then it also has a USB
plug on the corner so if you need to you
can plug directly into this the goal for
our tuna platform is to have literally
hundreds if not eventually thousands of
devices that will connect into the two
net cloud platform show me how and where
I would use this so I'm gonna start with
just a couple of devices and just show
you how simple is the first one I'm
gonna go is to a known in pulse oximeter
little Bluetooth pulse oximeter it's
actually a very simple device we're
gonna plug it in like this and it's
going to come up with a reading my heart
rate which you can see is a little bit
high yeah if I'm looking right you're
making me nervous John am I good let's
see if I can make you nervous about
think about so a very exciting film an
action movie yeah exactly I wonder how
high we get this so this little device
is now transmitting to the device on the
wall the little on the wall and it'll
end up in the cloud and then end up on
one of our our displays here and I'll
show you this is an FDA approved device
is that what you're telling me that's
correct it's a class 1 FDA listed device
and so is the cloud platform so this is
intentionally designed by the government
is starting off
absolutely it's part it's meant to be
part of a health care delivery system
this goes around the neck right just a
neck yeah it's it's prep and I you try
your arm what was your leg it out or
better if you take your clothes off but
I'd rather not are you propositioning me
oh this is actually working I didn't
think this would actually turn it off
yeah you're actually gonna get a reading
then this is you're gonna oh man this is
really tight it's just gonna wrinkle my
jacket is this even in the right place I
can't believe you let me do that this is
probably illegal well there we go
actually you're within normal but you're
a little high on the diastolic they're
so bad should I be worried I don't think
so oh one rabies terrible this is always
how it starts you go in to do an
interview you put on a medical device
without being allowed to the next thing
you know you're in the hospital taking
one reading on any medical device is all
that's all this is one reading rest
friends what are important and being
able to enable folks to collect data
routinely trending it over time is
really where the value comes and this
and this this reading that I just got
this gets beamed to the cloud it gets
beamed to whatever service I have that's
capturing this information and this is
something potentially I'm at home I can
do this whatever I want correct this is
my blood pressure here that's right this
is my dangerously high blood pressure
yeah they go to the doctor for
immediately after you take your clothes
off that's right and this is accessible
by healthcare professionals or by me you
know it's it's designed to support any
use cases the different manufacturers
want to support so most of them today
are looking at solutions that will have
a consumer screen a screen that could be
shared with say caregivers that are in
the home or family members that are
functioning as caregivers right and with
health care providers all the devices
I've shown you today are already in the
healthcare market as standalone devices
what's new is getting the information
off the devices talking up to the cloud
assembled together in combinations so
now we can actually look at you not only
can we look at you around a single
parameter we can look at you around many
many parameters and we can trend it over
time right we can apply clinical
analytics to that and essentially give
you and your healthcare professional
information of what what should be done
next yeah if anything very cool very
cool
thanks again really awesome stuff
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
