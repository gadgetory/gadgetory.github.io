next big rocket the Falcon Heavy this
vehicle can create more than 5 million
pounds of thrust at liftoff and is
capable of putting around a hundred and
forty thousand pounds into lower Earth
orbit that's more than twice the weight
that any other rocket currently on the
market can carry
so right now the Falcon Heavy holds the
title for the most powerful rocket in
the world I'm very excited about this
launch because I think this is it's
gonna really show that we can do giant
Rockets gain most space organizations
government or commercial and set their
sights too low they've really gotten
built relatively small rockets and
Falcon Heavy is the first time that
there's there's something that's
arguably even in the super heavy class
or somewhere between a heavy and super
heavy and showing that you can launch a
giant rocket and and have it be
commercially viable carry satellites
potentially carry people
Falcon heavies capable of actually
taking a dragon mission taking people
around the moon by the way I'm not yet
we're sorta baiting weather to do that
on Falcon Heavy or bf are all sort of
depend on how well the VFR developments
going as to whether we focused on VFR
for deep space here in flight or whether
we do that on Falcon Heavy what do you
see has been the biggest challenge for
for making this rocket fly the biggest
challenge of getting close pad has been
that we had to completely redesign the
server core so the the load going
through the center core is much greater
than would only go through a falcon 9
rocket each of the side boosters is
putting in half million pounds of thrust
into the center core so you have an
incremental million pounds of force
going through that center core which
means we had to really redesign almost
the entire stage all the way through the
interstage that had to be redesigned to
strengthen okay one more question but I
want to know what you're most excited
when you've watched this rocket fly
tomorrow I'll be really proud of the
SpaceX team for having accomplished this
incredible task and and hopefully we
inspire the public to get excited about
space game but it's not just the public
getting excited about the Falcon Heavy
some customers like the Planetary
Society are planning on using Falcon
Heavy for their next flights hoping that
a successful test launch will spell
success for their missions as well
we are tied to SpaceX we wish us the
best today so the guy you know SpaceX is
really visionary
but it really is a fantastic idea you
Rockets should be like airplanes where
you you don't throw them away use them
and then reuse them and so it's it's a
it's visionary if everything goes well
today how will it feel to see that
Falcon Heavy great no so you know we
flew the first light sail almost two
years ago
and it's just it's a thrill we're very
excited about it and the idea is to
democratize space to lower the cost of
getting to many destinations in our
solar system and the reason you do this
everybody the reason the society does
this there are two questions Lauren that
we have all asked where did we come from
where did we come out we all get here
where did we come from and are we alone
in the universe and if you want to
answer those two questions you have to
explore space
we're finally here at NASA's press site
after all of the hype for so many years
of waiting and it is intense I've been
to a couple of launches here before but
I've never seen it this packed just
getting in here today there was a huge
traffic jam and the vibe here
everybody was super anxious we're really
ready to see this thing get off the
ground
originally the launch was set for 1:30
p.m. Eastern
then it got pushed back to 2 then to 20
then to 50 it turned out upper level
winds in the area were too high for
flight and SpaceX was trying to wait for
them to die down
people started worrying that they'd have
to come back the next day so we've all
been on edge today SpaceX kept pushing
the launch time back and back and back
and now we have a new team minus 0 which
is 3:45 p.m. but our lunch window only
lasts until 4 p.m.
however the rocket is loaded with
propellant so I think it might actually
go up today cynical relock still
complete Lauren has done its time x88
point 2 degrees
I never guess eyelids are complete have
you guys configured translate a minus 15
what's retro nine eight seven six
we go I'm gonna keep rolling
