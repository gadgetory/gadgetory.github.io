would eventually become the modern idea
of the Smart Watch the first bevel was a
watch that worked with both iPhone and
Android and mostly let you see
notifications on your wrist it was also
super plasticky and felt as cheap as it
looked
now pebble is launching the pebble time
it's most refined SmartWatch yet mostly
it's just a better pebble but the time
does have a couple new tricks up its
sleeve the biggest most obvious
difference between $199 pebble time and
the models that came before it is its
new color display it's not a brilliant
vibrant screen instead it displays only
very few colors and it's pretty muted
it's not particularly bright or readable
indoors and it's fairly low res so
pixels are easily visible but it is
always on and it's perfectly readable
outdoors because it reflects this on
back at you going from black and white
to color sounds like a pretty big deal
but it doesn't really change the pebble
experience all that much the times
design is also significantly more
refined in the first pebble or the
pebble steel that came out last year
it's light and slim with a slight curve
to better hug your wrist it's
comfortable to wear and it's reasonably
small so it doesn't look like a giant
computer on the average-sized arm
there's a steel frame surrounding the
display but the time is mostly plastic
and it can be a bit creaky feeling
you're either going to love or hate the
times Digital retro techy aesthetic but
I don't think it's a look for me there
are four buttons on the time one on the
left and three on the right along with a
microphone for voice recording the time
is impressively water-resistant the
company says it can go as deep as 30
meters underwater I didn't test it
beyond wearing it in the shower
it takes standard 22 millimeter straps
and the included rubber strap comes with
quick-release pins to make changing them
a snap the charging port has been moved
from the side of the watch to the back
and it now supports data transfer that's
potentially a big deal as pebble says
other accessory makers could fabricate
straps that take advantage of this new
port but it's still just unfulfilled
potential at this point pebble isn't
making these so-called smart straps and
you can't yet by any from other
companies aside from the freshly
designed hardware the time is running an
all-new software interface gone is at
utilitarian means to an end software the
earlier pebbles instead the time
software is full of personality with
whimsical animations and fun little
touches it's built around what's called
the timeline a running track of
everything in your life from the recent
past to the near future at the center of
the timelines your watch face of which
there are thousands to choose from but
only a handful support the x color
display press up and you can see the
past 36
hours of events sports scores weather
information and more press down you can
see what's coming up next on your agenda
what's hot on TV tonight or what
tomorrow's weather will be like it's
designed to give you a lot of useful
information at a glance without
burdening you down with navigating a
grid of apps and waiting for loading
screens the most part it works before to
really be brilliant pebbles going to
need a lot of third-party apps applying
data into it and right now only a
handful do notifications on the time are
no different than they've been on older
pebbles they just have a little more
color to them you can get alerts whether
you're using an iPhone or an Android
phone but Android users have the ability
to send quick message replies or take
actions on their email alerts from the
iPhone can only be dismissed from the
pebble which is a bummer if you're
hoping to manage income email without
touching your phone also exclusive to
Android is the ability to dictate voice
replies to incoming messages which works
just as well as it does on Android wear
or the Apple watch which can't use your
voice or anything else like launching
apps or searching the web which is a
little bit of a bummer compared to older
pebbles the time is fast and snappy and
its battery life is just as great I was
able to go for days without charging
time which isn't quite the seven days
the company claims but it's still far
more than the Apple watch or Android
wear smartwatches despite all these
improvements the core purpose of the
pebble doesn't really change with the
time it's best function is still getting
smartphone alerts on your wrist which is
something you either really want or want
no part of the pebble time is mostly
just a better pebble which is great if
you're a fan of the first pebbles but if
you haven't bought into the idea of a
pebble yet or you're just on the fence
about smartwatches in general the time
isn't likely to change your mind</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
