you mainstream iPhone which starts at
$750 excuse me are you already typing
are you already leaving a comment about
display resolution and pricing and OLED
versus else can you just stop we can do
that later we'll have a great time down
there for now just hang out a second and
ask yourself how much do you really
really care about the display on a phone
I know a lot of people have questions
about the 10r size this weird not huge
and not small 6.1 inches and I'll get to
that but I'm telling you the deciding
factor between the 10s and the 10r is
the screen like if you could put a
dollar amount on how much you care about
the screen with that dollar amount be
two hundred and fifty dollars because
that is exactly how much you need to
care in order to buy an iPhone tennis
instead of the 10 or let me explain and
then you can all do your thing okay so
last month I review the iPhone 10s and
10's max which are Apple's new flagship
phones they have new h-12 processors
edge to edge OLED displays Apple's
latest camera system that does smart HDR
essentially everything Apple can fit
into a phone and the iPhone 10 R is
basically the iPhone 10 s with a
slightly worse display that's it that's
the whole thing it's got the same a 12
ionic processor the same main camera
with smart HDR the same iOS 12 but
instead of that edge to edge OLED
there's a 6.1 inch liquid retina LCD and
the display is fine it's lower
resolution and pixel density than the
OLED 's and new flagship phones like the
10s and galaxy s 9 and pixel 3 but if
you're upgrading from a previous LCD
iPhone it's gonna look really familiar
I do think it's a little worse than
previous LCD iPhones when you look at it
off axis it shifts a tiny bit pink and
the brightness drops quickly which means
it can sometimes look a little shimmery
but honestly you have to be a huge
display nerd to really notice that what
you will definitely notice is the larger
bezel around the entire display in
Apple's notch the notch is the same deal
as the iPhone 10 and
acid house is a face ID system and the
front-facing camera but the thicker
bezel is there because Apple had to fit
the backlight for the LCD panel
somewhere don't get me wrong that bezel
looks gigantic and especially silly next
to the 10s but the backlight engineering
is actually really clever you don't see
a lot of LCD phones with perfectly
rounded corners and no Chin's out there
and Apple did a bunch of crazy Apple
stuff here one of the major differences
between LCD and OLED screens is how they
produce light OLED pixels are their own
light source and you can turn them on
and off individually you can't do that
with an LCD because there's just one
backlight for the entire display so you
can round off LCD corners by shutting
out the pixels but it's super tough to
get it perfect because the backlight
will still shine through but check out
the 10r
we literally put it under a microscope
so you can see this see how some of
those pixels look smaller that's true
this Apple built little apertures to the
pixels around the corners to mask some
of the light coming through on top of
anti-aliasing the curve in software it
looks great is any of this necessary no
but it's super cool and it's super Apple
all of that screen reengineering means
that Apple had to take out 3d touch and
says there's something called a haptic
touch which is a fancy way of saying
long press with haptic feedback now
there's only two places I ever use 3d
touch on my other iPhones and I didn't
really miss it here I use it to scroll
around a text field which works with a
long press on the spacebar and turning
on the camera and flashlight from the
lock screen which you can do by just
holding on those buttons Apple has the
best haptic feedback in the industry and
all of this sort of feels very
convincing
I did miss previewing links and Twitter
and Safari but Apple tells me that
haptic touch will come to more in more
places in iOS over time hopefully that
gets added back in overall I've always
been a fan of how accurate and balanced
Apple's LCDs are compared to the ol Ed's
and most Android phones and the 10r is
definitely another Apple LCD if you're
coming for an iPhone 6 7 8 it's gonna
look very familiar
but after spending here with ya phone 10
I'm gonna tell you it's not as good as
Apple's Oh heads
it doesn't have the deep black levels or
infinite contrast to the iPhone 10s it
doesn't support HDR or Dolby vision
video playback and in general that back
light means you can always see the
border between the bezel and the edge of
the display even when you have a dark
background the display does have true
tone but it's always a little warmer
than my 10s again I think you have to go
really looking for some of this stuff
and if it bothers you you can just spend
more money in a better screen which I am
definitely going to do okay so that's
this fight what about the rest
size-wise the 10r sits right between the
old iPhone 6 7 8 sized phones and the
bigger plus models now I have pretty big
hands so this feels like a nice size
compromise but if you've been using one
of the smaller phones the 10r is
definitely going to feel bigger and it's
a taller screen and a narrower body than
the old plus phones I would definitely
recommend going to the store and holding
this thing before you buy it because
it's a totally new size of iPhone and
it's different than anything you might
be familiar with if you're a small phone
person you're basically going to be
stuck with last year's iPhone 8 or
paying more for an iPhone 10s I kind of
hope Apple fixes that next year and does
small and large and both models of thumb
there's a glass back in aluminum border
that comes in a bunch of colors I love
how mean our black review unit looks but
I got to see the other colors and
they're really nice I like the blue and
the coral the best but the Projekt RED
is striking and I know people are
excited about the yellow just keep in
mind that while the screen on the 10r
is made of the same glass on the 10s
that Apple says is the most durable ever
the 10 ARS back is not the same glass
it's the glass used on last year's
iPhone 10 and the back of my iPhone 10
shattered even though I keep it in a
case all the time so you know be careful
up there
the phone supports wireless charging
with the same redesigned coil for faster
charging as a 10 s and it has ip67 water
resistance which is a little worse than
the ip68 of the 10s but it's fine for
the occasional splash you've also got
Apple's new wide stereo speakers which
are much louder than before
not quite as loud as the tennis backs
around the back there's the single
wide-angle camera which is basically the
same as the iPhone 10's wide-angle this
is our third shot at reviewing Apple's
new smart HDR camera system after the
iPhone 10's review and the pixel 3
review and we wanted to see something a
little bit different so verge video
producer mario abdul cough and i ran
around brooklyn and took a bunch of
photos that look a lot like what you'd
see everyday in instagram using the
pixel 3d in the iphone 10 arm and while
I think Apple smart HDR still isn't
quite as good as the pixel 3 I think I
finally understand what Apple's trying
to do it flattens highlights and lifts
shadows so aggressively that everything
looks evenly lit and that can sometimes
reduce detail and make photos look a
little bit artificial here's a good
example of the iPhone doing better than
the pixel shooting out over the
waterfront these photos both look really
good even quite similar at a glance but
the iPhone is a little bit warmer and
all the shadows by the fountain and in
the skyline have been lifted resulting
in a less contrast image with more
detail the pixel 3 is more dramatic but
the iPhone 10 R is more even but Apple
Smart is always get it right this photo
of Mario against a bright backlight
would be challenging for any camera and
you can see how the iPhone 10 are
brought down the highlights in the
background lifted the shadows on right
his face and warmed everything up while
the pixel exposed Maria correctly and
let the background highlights blow out
way more naturally the pixel also
captured more detail on why his face I
much prefer the pixel later it's the
same thing with selfies the iPhone
brought it the shadow so much that it
made the black jacket turned gray it
almost looks like we shot this photo
with a fill flash and there's far less
detail in why his face again I really
prefer the contrast II look of the pixel
3 photo there was a bunch of controversy
here on the front camera on the iPhone
10 s which people claimed was smoothing
out and beautifying skin but Apple tells
me that was all above and that iOS 12.1
will improve selfies on the 10 Arendt
and s by picking a sharper base frame
instead of a blurry or long exposure I
don't have iOS 12.1 yet so we'll just
have to see how it works out ok here's a
really hard one low light with weird
lighting in a bar I think most people
will prefer the iPhone here but it also
doesn't actually look like reality the
iPhone found Mario's face exposed it
correctly with the right skin tone
and then flattened all the highlights
and lifted all the shadows to make the
scene look even again it almost looks
like we run lights to the bar and lit
the photo the pixel three on the other
hand does a much better job of capturing
the strange red light in this room even
if the photos a lot darker and weird
Matt do you want a photo that's more
accurate to reality or more pleasant to
look at I cannot tell you it's a really
subjective decision the 10r only has a
single lens in the back and I'm just
gonna come out and say that I don't miss
having the second lens from the 10s at
all
it never really took zoom photos of the
10s and the 10 our single lens portrait
mode is actually really good in fact I
prefer the 10 hours portrait mode to the
10s because shooting using the brighter
wide angle lens means it works better in
low light and takes more interesting
photos check out this photo we took on
the river front where I was able to
capture the sign in the background it
just wasn't possible to get this shot in
portrait mode on the 10s or the pixel 3
which crops in for portrait mode and in
low-light the 10r is obviously better
than the tennis this photo in a bar it
looks like a grainy dark mess using the
10s telephoto compared to the 10r which
did a half way reasonable job the 10
horas portrait mode also has apples nice
fall-off blur which looks more like a
real bokeh than the sort of bad cut out
blur you see from the pixel 3 now I
don't really use portrait mode on any of
these cameras I don't think any of it
looks terrific or perfectly cut out but
the 10 hours portrait mode is kind of
the most flexible and useful of the
bunch
after three rounds of testing apples
smart HDR I'm beginning to understand
what it can and can't do and I'm
starting at better photos out of it it
can definitely take photos no camera has
ever really taken before but it still
crushes detail and produces artificial
looking images way more often than I'd
like
while the pixel 3 just produces winners
consistently as always I can't possibly
tell you what to like better but I know
that I prefer the consistency and
naturalness of the pixel 3 over the 10r
and this is all just the first stages of
computational photography so I would
expect the competition between Apple and
Google to be fierce over time right now
I would pick the pixel 3 the iPhone 10 R
has the same video capture as the iPhone
10 s it can shoot 4k 60 when you shoot
in 24 it adds frames to create greater
dynamic range
and it records stereo audio if you want
to record video on your smartphone
you should get an iPhone in terms of
performance that 10r was essentially
identical to the 10s as I used it day to
day and even hit basically the same
benchmark numbers and some quick tests
it has slightly less RAM than the 10s
it's three gigs instead of four but it's
pushing like half as many pixels and
honestly I think the RAM spec matters
away less with iOS than it doesn't
Android phones apples chips are so far
ahead of the industry that it's clear
the hol Bionic has tons of headroom to
spare
I think 10 hours going to feel fast for
at least a few years the 10r also has a
larger battery than the ten in the 10s
and it ran for about 13 hours my
everyday use of browsing and email and
slack in apps with about six hours of
screen on time that's slightly more than
10s and even more than the 8 plus from
last year the only major performance
difference between the 10r and the 10s
is LTE the 10s supports the faster
gigabit LTE speeds and the 10r does not
now I don't live in a city with gigabit
LTE but maybe you do and it's something
to be aware so there's a lot of iPhone
6's is out in the world like more than
you think and I think a lot of people
are going to upgrade to the 10r from the
success so I have to mention there's no
headphone jack which I think will prompt
another round of annoyance and are also
basically no accessories for 10r yet
Apple is even have its own 10 are cases
ready which is a little strange and
there have never been official battery
cases for any iPhone 10 which is a shame
there's also no third party headphone
adapters there's just a bunch of stuff
missing so if you're upgrading right
away it's worth noting that the
accessory ecosystem there's a little
thin right now but I would expect that
to get a lot bigger fast
if one thing is clear about the iPhone
10 are it's an apple is going to sell
tons of these
there are huge upgrades from the iPhone
6 7 8 generation with Apple's latest
processors and cameras a big screen and
updated design and a competitive opening
price of $750 and honestly when we first
started making this video it felt like
the big question would be what is the 10
are missing compared to the 10s but now
that I've used this thing for a while
its flipped in my mind the real question
for iPhone buyers is whether spending
two hundred and fifty dollars more on
the 10s is really worth it over the 10r
because the 10r offers almost everything
you would want in a 20-18 phone - an
OLED display I would pay that extra
money in a heartbeat because I am really
really picky about screens but I think
most people aren't I think most people
can find way better ways to spend $250
than infinite black levels and 60% wider
dynamic range in photos for all of those
people the iPhone 10 R is a no-brainer
the real question is whether you yeah
you think the better screen on the 10s
is worth $250 now you can leave a
comment everybody thank you so much for
watching we talked a lot about the
iPhone 10s and the pixel three in this
review those reviews in full are up on
the channel go check them out subscribe
