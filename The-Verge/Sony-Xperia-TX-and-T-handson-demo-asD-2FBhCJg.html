ready for 2012 in Berlin and what i have
here with me is the xperia TX and the
Xperia T from Sony these are the brand
new flagship phones that the company is
introducing here in Europe they're kind
of hard to keep track of this one right
here is xperia TX this is the one that
you're going to see all across europe
mostly apart from germany power button
is mounted over on this side it's four
point six inch 1280 by 720 display
resolution which is also matched on this
the Xperia T but this is Germany only
model it's physically a little bit
different power but and is now on this
side don't ask me why they've done it
but that's how they've done it but
otherwise the displays exactly the same
resolution four point six inches 1280 by
720 and it has a bravia engine above
once again another significant
difference between two models this has a
1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor of an
unnamed variety whereas this one has a
Qualcomm gioco poster it's also a little
bit thicker you might be able to notice
here take a look at the sides both have
this glossy / reflective / chromed
outlook frame on the side physically the
more or less the same but I kind of
prefer this TX it seems to be a slimmer
a lighter device and it's just more
angular and sharper to look at and this
is the more popular one we'll stick with
this one well it's going to be one
distributed more widely looking at the
interface this is under a four-point-oh
it is Sony's rather familiar skin also
familiar you will find the curvature in
the back this was first introduced we
Xperia it's more understated now it's
more subtle but it's still there and
turn it around to the back it's got a
soft touch plastic cover I find this a
massive upgrade over the xperia arc
which had a really glossy and really
plasticky feeling one this is a much
higher quality feeling cover you notice
that there's an NFC label just
underneath the LED flash and is also a
13 megapixel
auto focus camera down at the bottom
there's a loudspeaker so just looking at
so many tweaks again I've always been
quite a big fan of Sony's UI changes
however I'm not really sure this is
necessary now to have ice cream sandwich
and as I say this is running onto a
four-point-oh everything including the
multi-tasking menu has been kind of
changed in ways that I just change for
changes sake in my opinion it functions
just like the android version but why do
they need to be done in this fashion I
don't really know there's the
applications drawer again everything is
quite smooth and responsive although I'm
noticing a bit of Chuck Ennis over here
on the side which can be replicated but
we just put that down to some early
software it's a good-looking phone it's
an attractive phone four point six
inches if you want a smaller one so when
is also introducing the 4.3 inch xperia
v the underling to the 4.6 inch Xperia T
with its battery running low also comes
in a fetching pink shade but it is also
white versions and black versions of
both of these phones which we both
joined by the xperia j which is the
four-inch variety lower processor lower
spec four cameras and all of that stuff
on the xperia j so it's clearly an
entry-level model but off we're coming
out in approximately two weeks they're
being introduced he ready for ballet in
the beginning of december so we expect
them in europe middle of September the
special thing about xperia v is that
it's water and dust-resistant so you can
take quite a few splashes it also has
the Mobile BRAVIA Engine it also has a
13-megapixel camera sensor just like the
big four point six inch device so for a
lot of people myself included this is
just a better form factor a minor go for
in pink as it's being shown here but I
do prefer it to the somewhat too large
for point six inch device so that's a
quick first look at sony's brand new
range of experience coming out in the
middle of September
