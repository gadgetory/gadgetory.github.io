here with the structure sensor a
Kickstarter back 3d scanner that can
quickly create 3d models of objects the
structure sensor is a Kinect light
camera that fits on the back of the iPad
and augments the color camera on the
iPad to create and texture 3d models one
of the most basic uses of the structure
sensor is to create scans of solid
objects so here's a bust of Julius
Caesar that we can walk around with the
camera
creating a mesh as we go the result is a
3d model that you could send to a
videogame or a 3d printer you could also
theoretically use it for a virtual pet
or any other kind of augmented reality
game by scanning an area and then
creating a 3d model of it that means
it's going to semi realistically bounce
off of actual objects in the world you
can also scan an entire room with
accurate measurements so this means you
can either just tell how big the room is
or you could create a model and then use
it for something like a furniture
catalog so once this mesh is done it's
going to create a full texture and
collar map so just from doing a quick
scan I've got a rough model of the room
that I can either see as a panorama or
as a 3d object these are all demos
because the real idea is that there's
going to be a structure SDK that can be
used either with other people's cameras
or for by developers to create games or
software the first units shipped out in
December after the Kickstarter ended in
November so we're going to be seeing
some people playing around with this to
see what it can do
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
