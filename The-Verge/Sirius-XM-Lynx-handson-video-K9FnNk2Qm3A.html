I'm here with the Sirius XM links it's
the new portable device from Sirius
it'll plug into your car or in at home
or you can just use it all by itself
it's got Wi-Fi and satellite built-in
plus Bluetooth and all kinds of stuff
let's take a quick look at how it works
here so basically the device has a few
different modes if it's plugged into one
of Sirius is docks and there are a
couple of new ones just for the links
it'll connect to the satellite radio and
show you all kinds of the you know the
usual stuff you expect from Sirius and
if you're off of one of the docks you
can use Wi-Fi to use serious internet
radio unfortunately all the connections
here terrible so we're not on either of
those but you can still see these radio
replays so you select up to 15 presets
on the device and then it'll
automatically record up to 200 hours of
radio split between these various
stations that you like so even when
you're not connected you can just jump
on and listen to you know NFL radio as
you want to even when you're offline and
then you get back on it'll rerecord and
just dump off old stuff as you keep
going there's all kinds of other cool
stuff you can flip through channels it's
like a TV Guide the whole thing runs a
really skinny version of Android as you
can see you can flip through you see
your own shows stuff you like and it's a
pretty simple it basically works like an
iPod when you're not connected to
anything you can side load content
there's an SD card slot in the back and
otherwise it's just a pretty simple way
to watch Sirius it works with they have
a couple of new docks for it that if you
plug them into again you get satellite
and there's also one that is basically
just like an iPod dock but also has an
antenna so you can get the satellite and
stuff like that and otherwise it's just
this little sand alone device it'll be
two hundred and forty-nine dollars when
it comes out in February and there will
be docks available for $49 each</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
