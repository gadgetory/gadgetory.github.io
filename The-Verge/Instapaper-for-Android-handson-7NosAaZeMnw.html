checking out Instapaper for Android you
open up instapaper for android you'll
notice that it looks a lot like
Instapaper for iPhone even though it's
not made by Marco Arment himself you'll
see read later liked archive you won't
see friends which shows what your
friends are reading and you won't see
the feature which shows what other
people are reading that's popular on
insta paper you also won't see web which
helps you find things online and search
which helps you search through your
things so from this screen you can hit
the plus sign to add folders you can
remove those folders just as easily
using that pencil up there if you want
to dig further into the settings menu
while you're reading you'll notice that
it looks pretty much the same as the one
on the iPhone there's margins there's
line spacing there's text size there's
dark mode for reading at night there's
brightness and you have the usual
selection of fonts when you go into
Instapaper for Android settings menu
you'll see that most of the things
you're accustomed to on iOS are here
like relator limits for how many
articles you'll download locally the
most glaring omissions are there's no
full screen in instapaper for android
and there's also no eye book style
pagination where the page turns over
which is a really important feature for
a lot of people so you can see that here
when you're scrolling through an article
you really don't have much of a choice
besides to just swipe through it and you
also can't go fullscreen so you see the
top menu bar as well as these two bars
down here this one doesn't do anything
since there aren't any settings menu for
this specific screen as you might expect
Instapaper has integration with the
androids share menu so it hop down to
instapaper
and you see saved so there's no need to
install a browser bookmarklet like you
would on iOS if you want to copy a URL
from another site Instapaper on android
will not recognize that you have a URL
pasted into your clipboard the iOS
version does do that which is a nice
feature Instapaper for android also
works on 7-inch tablet
and as you can see has a really similar
interface to the iPad interface it's
just thinner as you can see into one
column if you're on a 10-inch tablet
they're actually more boxes since you
have more screen real estate to use just
like on your iPads so if you turn it
into portrait orientation screen flips
and it's a little narrower but you can
browse through just like you'd be used
to instapaper for Android costs $2.99 in
Google Play the Android app store and
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble's Nook app store it's a
pretty good 1.0 release but it's still
missing some of the key features that
make reading using Instapaper so special
like sepia tone fullscreen pagination
which is huge friend recommendations and
most of all just the fact that the UI
chrome is stuck on the screen and you
can't go fullscreen which is really kind
of the thing that Instapaper does best
we have been reassured by developer
mobilux that these features are coming
and the app will soon be on par with its
iOS counterpart until then it's a better
option than any of the other Instapaper
clients for Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
