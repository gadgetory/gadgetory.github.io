announced the next generation of its
Android wear platform and it promises to
make smartwatches much more independent
from your phone now that's not gonna be
available until later this year but you
can kind of get a taste of what's to
come with LG's watch urbane second
edition LTE now unlike every other
Android wear watch this LG has a
cellular radio inside of it which means
that if you don't have your phone with
you you can still use your watch you can
get the watch urbane from 18t and
Verizon right now and it's pretty
expensive either way 18 t sells it for
360 bucks but they'll sell to you for
$200 if you sign up for two years data
service on it and Verizon is even more
expensive they sell for $500 or 450 if
you sign up for a two-year data plan
both carriers charge 10 bucks a month
for service on it which is pretty pricey
for something that's not your phone or
your tablet or your laptop at its base
in your main is just like any other
Android wear watch it here's where it's
different if you go out and haven't
leave your phone at home and it's
connected to Wi-Fi or cellular your Bane
will act just the same as if your phone
was in your pocket and paired over
Bluetooth you can see your notifications
you can use apps you can perform boy
searches you can even make phone calls
and send and receive text messages but
if your phone isn't connected to the
network for whatever reason the watch
becomes much dumber and only lets you
use its offline functions the AT&amp;amp;T model
will still let you make and receive
phone calls and send and receive text
messages but the Verizon version will
only let you receive forwarded phone
calls you can't perform voice searches
you can't use apps you can't launch
anything it's really just a watch on
your wrist now I've been using the AT&amp;amp;T
model well it definitely works when it's
not connected directly to my phone it's
much slower especially when it's looking
up information or transcribing text
phone calls are usable in a quiet
environment but it can be hard to hear
the watch's speaker when it's noisy it's
definitely not something I'd want to
rely on or use more than 130 times dead
now as a watch that you're bein it's
pretty large it's got a nice round sharp
crisp display metal body the battery
lasts all day and there aren't any major
frustrations with lag enos in the
interface or anything like that but
unfortunately the rubber strap is pretty
stiff and uncomfortable and you can't
change it which is a bit frustrating
now there's two extra buttons on the
side of the urbane that you don't get
with other Android wear watches LG's
programmed one of them to launch your
contact list and other one to launch a
physical activity tracker unfortunately
they can't be reprogrammed which is the
way more useful if you can send
apps that you actually use so here's how
you should look at the watch urbane
second edition LTE it's a preview of
what's to come I would recommend you buy
it right now it's just too expensive and
it's extra options over regular Android
wear watches don't justify its monthly
service cost but it's going to get a lot
more interesting later this year when
Android wear 2.0 comes out at that point
you might even want a cellular connected
watch that has all of its functions
without your phone and lets you install
apps directly to the watch but for now
you're better off choosing one of the
other many Android wear options that
don't carry a monthly service fee follow
