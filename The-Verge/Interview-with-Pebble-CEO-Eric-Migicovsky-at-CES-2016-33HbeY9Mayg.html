Vegas CES 2016 I'm here in our booth on
the show floor and across from me I've
got Eric midget Kowski you may now know
him as pebble he's still CEO one of the
co-founders been making pebble for how
many years now eight years eight years
eight years of pebble and wearables and
even before pebble Eric was building
wearables so we're gonna talk about
wearables and let's do it that's some
fun so we're here at CES you're kind of
just your pal and around having some fun
that's exactly see anything says you see
anything fun here drones a lot of drones
I really like this drone that had like
styrofoam on the outside so it doesn't
cut people oh that's nice let's consider
it yeah I appreciate that yeah yeah
they're like drones there's cars
everywhere and stuff like that but
there's also a ton of wearables and like
everybody's putting wearables on like
their product lineups and everybody's
getting into it but you know you guys
have been doing it for a long time and I
want to talk about last year
specifically 2015 which was crazy busy
for you guys you correct me if I'm wrong
you launched four products three new
watches three new watches and then a
bunch of software new software platform
yeah new software interface you just in
December launched an initiative with
health and tracking and you really kind
of change the way the pebble talk does
Fitness start you can talk to me about
that so our our our approach is you know
from the hardware perspective we
launched three new watches we've got a
broad offering now all the way from $99
up to 250 bucks a bunch of different
options but for us like again and I've
reiterate this pretty much every time I
talk to you it's like it's about
software because these things are tiny
computers that are on our bodies we we
put them on for a cup of for a variety
of different reasons you know fitness
tracking sleep tracking notifications
music control those are they're like the
simple they the bass use cases but over
time it's growing it's doing more you
know we've seen a lot of people groups
start using pebble as
as a means of collecting data for medic
for medical studies and for research
research projects as well as seeing like
the benefits of what happens when you
have an open platform so we're combining
that together I think with peplums okay
so speaking of you're wearing the pebble
time round yes now this one is kind of
like a departure from your earlier
designs in number of ways it's really
different than like the original pebble
which I think you've seen a lot it's
like that's the sporty that's the that's
the runners watch and this is yeah
pretty pretty different yeah so you know
it's round it is ready obviously it's
got a little bit lower battery life but
it's a lot slimmer and thinner kind of
just a different appeal and aesthetic
we've seen a completely you know a
completely different take on on people
looking at pebble like when they looked
at us with the original pebble it was
mainly the crowd of runners and people
who are a little bit more into fitness
and it's colorful there's a lot of color
options so it brings in a kind of
younger crowd couple times steel you
know offers that a little bit more style
but pebble time round has just for
people that never considered a
SmartWatch before it catches their eye
as not a SmartWatch but it's something
that they might want to actually you
know where ya know one of the things
that you're talking about being a small
company is you have this this idea when
the time launched of these smart bands
that kind of like snap in and other
companies and make them we haven't seen
a whole lot of oh there's a bunch action
kicks at CES actually and there's Aria
health which is a a sensor a gesture
sensor smart strap okay they launched on
Kickstarter about six months ago they're
actually gonna be shipping in two or
three months you can control pebble
using gestures on your finger so it's
even more hands-free than it was before
there's fit pay which announced launched
about a month and a half ago it's a
payment smart strap for pebble they've
integrated with MasterCard and Visa
Networks they've added an NFC NFC chip
onto your onto the strap which means you
can pay with your pebble that's coming
out in a couple months they also did
something cool I think a lot of people
are gonna buy the fit pay not just for
the payments but also because they did
something completely logical that we
haven't done which is add a USB port
onto the back
so that you don't have to carry around a
cable it was cool I mean but that's kind
of the power of what we've what we've
done we've created this open platform
that other people can build on top of
from a software perspective we launched
that yeah we launched that like three
three years ago yes you can now you know
with the hardware it takes it takes a
little bit longer because of the lead
tons of building hardware but it's it's
it's starting it's pretty cool
what what's next for 2016 for wearables
and then what what do you think is next
for pebble so we see a massive
opportunity right now kind of in the
convergence of the activity tracker
space the the fitness health tracker
space and more of a multi-purpose smart
smart device this is our bread and
butter we've been working on this for as
I said eight years we see the biggest
opportunity for pebble kind of that you
know Apple watches here there's no doubt
about it that Apple has created you know
a great product a strong product it's
you know they've sold millions and
expanded the entire market for smart
watches which has helped us out we don't
see ourselves as necessarily then you
know side by side hundred percent
competitors you know in that higher-end
300 400 dollar space we're very focused
right now in the 99 to 200 dollar space
that's our bread and butter we think
that because of the choices that we've
made on the technical architecture of
the product we can provide a much better
product a much more fully featured
product that has just different
capabilities like the battery life the
water resistance the always-on screen
thank you for taking the time to talk to
us Expo is a blast
