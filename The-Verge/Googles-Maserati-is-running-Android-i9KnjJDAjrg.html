Verge and I'm inside a Maserati probably
the most expensive car I've ever sat in
but what I'm actually here to look at is
this new system and what Maserati and
Google have done is built a concept
system that shows some of the things
that might be possible if a car
manufacturer wanted to do a whole bunch
of cool stuff so for example here you
can see we've got a very similar basic
homescreen to what we've seen before but
when you start jumping into some of the
apps it goes into a split screen so on
the bottom is like the current activity
like say you know the Google music
you're looking at or your navigation and
then the other stuff that you're doing
actually shows up on the top here so you
can jump around between the different
things without having to keep hitting
the home button or hitting one of these
buttons on the bottom so that's pretty
cool in addition to that it also is an
example of how Android could could
directly control some of the parts of
the car so what we have here is we can
control the HVAC system so I'll turn the
fan way up and there it's pretty loud
turn it down you can adjust the
temperature on each side and you can
even turn on the heated seats which is
pretty cool there's also a smaller
screen on the driver's side behind the
steering wheel and it's able to show
current stuff from its activity so if
you're navigating it'll show you your
next turn when you switch to the next
song it'll slide over the album art so
you can see what the you know the next
song is and it'll also even when you're
making a call it will show who you're
calling for a brief bit in your next car
which won't be a Maserati you probably
won't have this massive screen but
you'll probably get a lot of these cool
features and you'll get a lot of these
animations and maybe control your HVAC -
if you'd like to see more cool videos
