question that humans have been asking
for millennia we may not have a solid
answer yet but luckily nASA has been
working on it
they've sent Landers to Mars and are
planning to send a probe to Jupiter's
moon Europa in the 2020s
but how will NASA or other space
agencies know an alien if they see one
that's where planetary protection comes
in it's the idea of limiting the amount
of Earth organisms we bring to other
planets even before NASA's Apollo
missions the agency realized that earth
contamination could muck up the search
for extraterrestrial life life exists
everywhere on our planet so that means
any vehicles we send into space will
probably have earth life on them too
that will make it hard for a spacecraft
know if it's found an actual alien or
just a stowaway microbes from Earth
planetary protection became
international law back in 1967 with the
signing of the Outer Space Treaty the
treaty set up a lot of key rules for
space law like prohibiting nukes in
orbit and forbidding countries from
cleaning other planets it also saved
that country should conduct exploration
of other bodies so as to avoid their
harmful contamination for NASA that
means adhering a guideline set up by the
Committee on Space Research or Coast bar
the committee lays out rules for what
you need to do if you want to send
spacecraft to another object in the
solar system and the rules change
depending on where you want to go to
make things easy
NASA classifies missions based on where
they're going in the solar system kind
of like Star Trek Landers going to the
moon or an asteroid are considered class
two missions that means the destinations
have a really low chance of having life
so if you want to go to those places the
rules pretty simple document what you
brought with you and where you left your
spacecraft the rules get extra strict if
you're doing a class 4 mission those
involve landing on the three places that
have the highest potential for life
duggars moon Europa Saturn's moon
Enceladus and our neighbor Mars it's all
because of liquid water an essential
ingredient for life on Earth
both Europa and Enceladus are thought to
have subsurface oceans and many studies
point to water on Mars
so if you want to land on any of those
worlds you'll need to go through
extensive sterilization to make sure
your spacecraft
this is microbe three as possible for
Mars there are different rules depending
on where you want to go on the planet -
it's because NASA's define certain spots
on Mars as special these are places
where temperature and water conditions
are just right so that earth life might
grow like Mars is recurring slope lineae
areas of flowing salt water that pop up
during the planets warmest months to
visit those places spacecraft have to go
through an extra sterilization step
getting baked it's the same procedure
the Viking spacecraft had to go through
in the 1970s when NASA sent those first
liners to Mars the spacecraft were
heated in an oven for about three days
this reduced the amount of organisms
clinging to the spacecraft those Viking
missions revealed Mars to be a hostile
environment though so the rules for
visiting world relaxed for a while but
after finding these special regions on
Mars NASA made it a requirement to bake
any spacecraft that may want to visit
one of the planet's hot spots still
earth microbes are resilient just before
NASA launched the Curiosity rover 377
strains of bacteria are found on the
spacecraft and 11% of those strains were
shown to survive UV radiation extreme
cold and other crazy environments that
means many of the microbes likely
survived curiosity's trip so planetary
protection may not be able to eliminate
all the earth organisms we send to other
planets but it can least ensure as
little contamination of our galactic
neighborhood as possible hey it's
wilderness week on the verge we're
celebrating the 100th anniversary of the
National Park Service so check out all
