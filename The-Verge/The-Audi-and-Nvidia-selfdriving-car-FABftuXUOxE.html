up to help out ease cars learn how to
drive better using artificial
intelligence lucky for us there's this
huge parking lot across the street from
the Convention Center and we're going to
check it out so I'm here in an Audi q7
with Nvidia artificial intelligence
self-driving hardware and software
alright let's take it away and so what
they've built is this small track it's
almost peanut shaped and it's got a
couple of different driving environments
in it
one is this half circle here with lines
painted on the road for the car to
navigate and then as it heads around
these two curves it goes on to a gravel
section and then sort of an artificial
grass section and then an area without
any lines so it's a bunch of different
environments for the car to navigate and
it's doing it quite well hasn't left the
track yet you can see the wheel makes a
bunch of small Corrections as it goes
around it amazing how many little tiny
Corrections it makes that's unhuman like
a little different every time I here and
then as it goes around this corner
sometimes they'll take this giant
Construction sign and put it in the cars
way where it used to be able to go
without any problem and so then the car
has to look at that sign decide what to
do and avoid it I think they're putting
the sign out we'll see if the car which
apparently doesn't have a name which is
a little disappointing and videos other
car is called bb-8 after the Star Wars
robot so we're coming around this corner
there's a Construction sign in the way
we're gonna have to take a detour figure
out where to go see if the car nose
knows what to do oh it does
the interesting thing about this car is
that it's using invidious artificial
intelligence machine learning technology
which is a lot of fancy buzzwords to say
that the car learns how to drive like a
human would it learned by watching
people drive it around and it only had
about four days of training they were
out here just driving it around this
course and it's a pretty simple course
but if it encounters an unexpected
situation the car needs to know how to
deal with it and with the machine
learning they can do that in a much
faster way than needing to program for
every single circumstance that I might
run into
outtie and NVIDIA believe this
artificial intelligence learning
technology could really speed up how
autonomous cars can learn how to drive
and get them onto our streets much more
quickly for a transportation reporter
it's a little hard to believe that this
was my first ride in a self-driving car
but it was totally normal the wheel
turned and we went around the corners
and it was fine I didn't feel unsafe at
all it wasn't unnerving getting on a
highway with traffic might be a little
different but if this is the future I'm
all-in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
