SmartWatch in conjunction with LG called
the LG watch sport now there are
actually two new smartwatches the sport
and the style but for the purposes of
this review we're going to focus on the
$349 sport watch why well because not
only does it run on Android wear 2.0
which is the latest wearable software
from Google but it also has LTE GPS
built-in heart rate sensors basically
the same way that Apple put out an Apple
watch last year that was focused on
health and fitness Google is making a
stronger pitch to the fitness crowd with
this now that's all well I'm fine in
theory but unfortunately there's one
simple thing that makes me want to take
this thing off its design let's talk
about the good stuff first it has GPS so
it can accurately track your distances
when you're running in cycling it has a
barometer which means it can track your
elevation and it has LTE which means if
you're paying for the wireless service
you don't have to take your phone with
you when you're working out you can make
phone calls and run apps just from the
watch and the new Android wear 2.0
software has really optimized the
fitness experience and you can set
complications on your watch to be things
like your active minutes throughout the
day or your daily step count or you can
just set a complication for something
like google play music so when you're
ready to go out for a run you can just
tap that and listen to your music you
can also run popular health and fitness
apps like RunKeeper or Strava
as standalone apps right on the watch
itself all this activity tracking data
is synced to google fit which is
Google's own health tracking software
and you can run that on an Android
device or on the web Google's biggest
brag I think with this watch is the fact
that it automatically classifies your
weight training exercises a lot of other
smartwatches and fitness watches you'll
just put other or weight training but it
doesn't really know what you're doing in
this case the watch knows if you've done
squats or bicep curls and things like
that you look down at the watch it knows
the exercise that you've done it'll say
how many reps you've done now it's not
always accurate and Mike's
variants it worked maybe half the time
so I still had to do some manual input
but still it's a pretty cool feature to
have but the thing that kills me about
this watch is its size I mean this thing
is huge and it's not even the
circumference really because I kind of
like a big watch it's really just how
thick it is and how uncomfortable it is
to work out in it's got these wide lugs
the band is pretty stiff and unforgiving
around here I mean it's really as though
Google and LG got into a room and said
how much stuff can we put in this watch
and oh by the way it should look like
this or maybe they just all got into a
room and said let's design this for big
wristed people and forget about
everybody else it's even hard for me to
tighten it to the last loop to get a
good fit because of how fat it is
underneath which negates some of the
fitness features I mean for example does
it track heartrate through the wrist yes
but you need a good fit for that to
happen and it has GPS for tracking
running but I don't want to go running
with it because when I run it slides up
and down my wrist which is really
annoying and in some cases this button
right here which is the voice controlled
Google assistant is accidentally
activated when I'm bending my wrist
doing push-ups cycling that sort of
thing just because of how big it is
basically my biggest gripe with the LG
watch sport is the look and feel of it
which is a shame really because inside
there's some interesting stuff going on
but that's the thing with wearables
unless you're motivated to wear them all
the time you don't really get the
benefit of wearing them I'm curious to
see what other manufacturers do with
Android wear 2.0 and I'm guessing there
are other smartwatches out there that
are running this software and have some
of the same benefits but are better
designed from now I'm taking this thing
off but then there is the air vent care
bed just open up our video shoot your
