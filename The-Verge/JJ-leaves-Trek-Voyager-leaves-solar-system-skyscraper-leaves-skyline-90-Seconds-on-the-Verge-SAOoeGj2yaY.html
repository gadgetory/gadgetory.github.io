I'm adrianne jeffries and I was born
under a ladder so no superstition scare
me this is 90 seconds on the verge JJ
Abrams is abandoning the enterprise the
director of the rebooted Star Trek film
says he will not be returning to direct
the next film in the series instead
putting his focus on his next project
Star Wars Episode seven he will however
stay on as a producer for the film this
comes with great news to Kirk who will
no longer be blinded by lens flare
Voyager 1 is out of this world no it's
out of the solar system literally nASA
has officially backed up claims that
Voyager 1 which was launched in 1977 has
gone beyond our solar system's the event
is believed to have happened on or
around August twenty-fifth of last year
thanks to a solar storm scientists at
the University of Iowa were able to
detect dense plasma around the probe
indicating that it was outside the
bubble of solar energy that surrounds
our system prior to NASA only the Magic
School Bus have traveled this far out in
space and finally South Korea is
building the biggest skyscraper you've
never seen the South Korean government
has greenlit the building of a quote
invisible tower the building will use
LED lights and cameras to reflect the
surrounding area onto the skyscrapers
glass covering while the building won't
be completely invisible it will seem to
disappear when looked at from a very
specific vantage point when it's done
the high rides should be the sixth
tallest building in the world and even
have a water park inside that's it for
today's top stories coming up tomorrow I
celebrate the anniversary of my decision
to start celebrating anniversaries of
random days that aren't typically
considered anniversaries</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
