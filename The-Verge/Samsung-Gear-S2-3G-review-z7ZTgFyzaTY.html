whether it's an Apple watch an Android
wear model or a pebble needs to be
connected to a phone to be smart if you
disconnect it from the phone well then
you kind of lose the smarts and it just
becomes a regular old watch
well Samsung's got a gear s2 that has a
cellular radio in it now it's means that
it doesn't need to be connected to your
phone to do something you can place
calls you can text message you can do a
couple of other things when your phone
and your watch are not in the same place
cell for about two hundred ninety-nine
bucks you can get it with AT&amp;amp;T Verizon
or t-mobile support I haven't had the 18
T model here and it lets me leave my
phone behind and still have some smart
functions mostly what it lets me do is
make phone calls and receive phone calls
on my wrist when my phone isn't around
and I can also send and receive text
messages but other things like alerts
from my phone notifications apps stuff
like that I really can't do that when
it's separated from my phone the design
of the 3G model of the gear s2 is very
similar to the Wi-Fi model it looks
really similar it's got the same
circular bezel controls same round
display that's really vibrant and
brilliant it's a little bit thicker than
the other one but it's not totally
uncomfortable to wear functionally it
functions exactly the same as well it's
got the same apps available the same
interface the same features and stuff
like that you can control your music
with it you can get your notifications
and stuff like that when it's all paired
to your phone over Bluetooth of course
it also has the same drawbacks meaning
there's not a lot of apps here still
that's kind of one of the biggest faults
of the gear s2 model is that Samsung
doesn't have any kind of apps available
and that actually becomes a bigger deal
when you're using it as a cellular
device because if you want to take it on
a run you can track your activity you
can still get text messages and phone
calls and stuff like that when you're
out and about but it doesn't have a lot
of fitness tracking apps available
you're not going to find Strava or
MapMyFitness or other popular apps that
you might want to use when you're
tracking your run pretty much you're
left with Samsung's s health app and
that's about it other things that aren't
really great about it the battery life
when it's on 3g is really poor it's not
going to last much more than three or
four hours when it's disconnected and
out and about on the side
network you also always have to have
your phone on whether it's at home or at
your desk or in your car to connect to
the cellular network to make any of
these functions work so it's not really
a fully standalone device you have to
pair it with your phone to set it up you
have to install all the apps to your
phone yeah change all the settings to
your phone it just lets you separate
your device from your phone every once
in a while
personally I didn't find that
particularly useful most the time I have
my phone with me anyways the only times
that I might not have my phone is like I
mentioned when I'm out on a run and then
I could possibly use the wireless
features on the gear s2 3G the other
downside of this is you're gonna have to
pay a monthly service fee to use this
with ATT it's ten dollars per month the
other carriers are about five dollars a
month personally I don't think that's
particularly worth it for the features
that it gives you right now in the
future all smart winters will probably
be connected meaning you can use it
separate from your phone and completely
standalone device right now we're still
a few steps away from that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
