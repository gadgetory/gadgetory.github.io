surface is a no compromise solution that
scratches your laptop pitch and your
tablet itchy Quilly but this year's
surface pro 3 brought a change
Microsoft is directly challenging the
nearly ubiquitous 13-inch MacBook Air
during its keynote today the company
took pot shot after pot shot at the
popular laptop going so far as leave a
scale onstage showing just how much
lighter the surface pro 3 is but how do
these 2 devices actually compare well to
start one is a Mac and the other is a PC
but if you can set aside your software
preferences and just look at the
hardware
the comparison gets much more
interesting the MacBook Air is almost
universally considered the best
all-around laptop on the market it's a
thin light powerful workhorse that gets
super long battery life and it's pretty
fast it's also well a laptop meaning it
works really well on your lab the screen
stays where you put it and the keyboard
always feels sturdy the surface pro 3 is
this amalgamation of a tablet and a PC
it has a keyboard dock sure and has a
kickstand this year Microsoft made a
kickstand that uses friction to stay in
place which means that it can go
basically in any position you want and
stay there
Microsoft says that it has great lap
ability which is their word not ours and
basically the company wants you to feel
comfortable using it on your lap it also
did this clever thing with the keyboard
cover adding extra magnets to make a
sturdier connection oh that's great but
unfortunately setting up the surface pro
3 is still a multi-step affair you
pulled on the keyboard you kick out the
hinge and you spend a bit of time
fussing around is it way better than the
last surface absolutely is it a laptop
no not really it's a fairly big tablet
and maybe not exactly something you'd
want instead of an iPad air either but
there's so much other stuff that's great
about the surface it's getting harder
and harder to complain about feeling a
little awkward on your lap it's lighter
than the MacBook Air it has a high
resolution touchscreen and it even
accepts pen input microsoft says it
should have all-day battery life too
frankly it's the best PC hardware I've
seen since well the MacBook Air but
which one should you get we're not quite
ready to answer that yet and certainly
not ready to restart the great windows
versus Mac OS debate but we're intrigued
and eager to give this brave new PC a
shot you can expect a full review soon
and yes we'll do our best to write it
from our lab
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
