we're here with welt it's a wellness
belt
essentially it's something you put
around your waist and it tracks your
steps how long you've been sitting your
waist change over the course of the day
and if you've been overeating so I just
put the belt on and within seconds that
identified my waist 32 and a half and
over the course of the day if I change
the tension of the belt either purposely
or if I eat too much the app should
reflect the change in belt tension and
it should tell me how much I've been
overeating so the well is part of a
samsung creative labs project that means
Samsung employees get to work on
basically a pet project of their own and
they develop their own technology they
developed the product and then they get
to showcase it and see if it's going to
turn into a company that Samsung will
spin off and do its own consumer
technology outfit weld is made by three
people free Samsung employees and
they're still undecided on whether or
not they're gonna turn it into a
consumer product so that means there's
no pricing or availability right now but
compared to some other smart objects
we've seen it's one of the most advanced
I've ever tried you can't even really
tell that it's a smart object at all it
just looks like a regular belt so again
we don't know how much this will cost
because it's not decided whether it's
gonna be a consumer product or not but
for more weird products like the well
