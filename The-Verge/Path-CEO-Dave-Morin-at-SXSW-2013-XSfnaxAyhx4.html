at South by Southwest with path CEO Dave
Morin thanks for coming on with us and
so you guys actually have some news this
week once you tell me about it indeed we
rolled out path 3 this week which we're
very excited about it includes a new all
new messaging private messaging feature
stickers feature and then some nice
little easter eggs all around the app so
so do you think that down the line
people are going to have one social
networking app that they turn to for
their most meaningful communication or
are people going to have half and
Facebook and Tumblr and Twitter and
snapchat I think it'll probably grow I
don't think that there will be an
infinite number but I think there will
be quite a few I think that each each
context that we all interact in every
day has different meaning different
different requirements I really like the
analogy that you know Facebook built the
cities we're trying to build the home
our friends over at next door are trying
to build the neighborhood our friends at
couple or building the bedroom or the
bed as it were and you know there's a
Yammer doing the office right and so I
think that as Facebook's done a really
good job of providing an identity layer
for the entire internet and now there's
an opportunity to build these contextual
experiences around these individual
pieces of our lives where you want to
walk into a different room to have a
different experience and what's your
take on some of these ephemeral apps
like snapchat or poke that kind of
remove the permanence of some of the
kind of standards for communication that
we're used to today on facebook where
something loads forever what's
interesting is if you think about all of
the conversations that you have in your
real life you don't remember a lot of
them right like which neither
conversations that you had yesterday
even with your closest friends a lot of
it just kind of disappears into the
ether and so I think that these
applications sort of represent the you
know more of a human take on how things
act things actually work just because
you can store all the data doesn't mean
you should
right and so I actually think on a more
philosophical note one of the
interesting things to think about is
we've sent the last ten years or so in
the internet figuring out how to store
as much data as possible and now you're
seeing the popularization of these
applications which actually create the
absence of data and so it's an
interesting question to ask is is this
trend going to be a big one over the
next ten years are we going to see a
proliferation of applications which
create the absence of data rather than
storing it what do you kind of see as
being something that is going to be
awesome like down the line but maybe
we're not quite there yet or like what
stuff do you really like these days that
that you're really inspired by it's kind
of out there I'm pretty inspired by 3d
printing I think that it's a I think it
represents something much further off
than what we're seeing with it today you
know with you see you look at it today
and it and it's a you know it's it
prints some little pieces of plastic
right but my sense that the killer app
for 3d printing is probably food I'm
still waiting for someone to build a 3d
printer for chocolates or over Christmas
I saw somebody did a 3d printing of
Christmas cookies or clothing you know
why can't we replace the closet like
with the 3d printer these kinds of
things are even a house you know I can't
wait for the day that a 3d printer is
like the size of a semi truck and can
build a house right so there's I think
there's some really interesting and
disruptive ideas in that realm and I
think more than anything it represents
the idea that manufacturing is no longer
needs to be centralized it doesn't need
to be in a factory you can sort of push
it out and have it in everybody's homes
when you look at how people are using
path today versus let's say at South by
a year or two ago how is that changed
you know I would say a couple of years
ago amongst you know a small set of
people it was probably a great way to
figure out where the good parties are
where the you know where everyone's at
right now I would say this year last
night you know i was actually noticing
that i was getting more information from
path about where the good stuff going on
was
than I've ever have been and I think
there's been a big shift there you know
we've got a lot more people on the
service today you know we're well over
six million users now growing really
fast and I make for us this year is
going to be a lot about refining and
purifying and simplifying everything
that we're doing and we've got a few
other cool things up our sleeve for the
rest of the year yeah well thanks so
much for joining us Dave yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
