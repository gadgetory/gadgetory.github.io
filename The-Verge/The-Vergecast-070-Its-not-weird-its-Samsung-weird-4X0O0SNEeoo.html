the week of March 18 2013 I'm Josh
Topolsky I'm nilay patel and we have a
very special guest with us adrianne
jeffries am I saying that right no Sam
it's adrianne jeffries I'm sorry it's
not Jay for us that's what I've been
pronouncing at this adrianne jeffries
who is one of our one of our writers a
human and uh and also also my own person
also her own person and a female human I
just say a female human yeah any adrian
is that adrian is here she wrote a big
piece on any ribbon this week that we
wanted to talk about yeah which we're
going to get to and and I don't know
what the topic list is I rushed over
here because I was waiting at home for a
package and it never came yeah it's my
happy hacking keyboard oh is that one
which is a three-hundred-dollar keyboard
you're a maniac which I probably won't
use very much because I use a laptop
yeah and so it's been very upsetting
it's been a very upsetting day let's see
if it's been delivered I keep checking
I'm checking for live updates yeah we're
gonna get live well I'll be very
disappointed if I can't make it back in
time to get it still on vehicle so
that's well actually I just tweeted that
we had a surprising amount of chaos as
we like began and it's a lot of in for
this yeah yeah well this is oh I would
say we should talk about this it's our
first show guys so weird i don't know I
there's so much distance between you
guys it's our first show in the new
studio yeah which is still in we're
still unpacking there's stuff to be done
here is literally man sleeping in
blanket there's a guy over there who
worked all night but it's very exciting
yeah it's extremely exciting
professional from from the camp it does
based on these cameras I feel like I
just working in the background yeah we
could see bother me
monitor here I me know what camera I'm
looking at right now is the left or
right camera where my one this one yeah
no this is my that's mine okay i'm still
getting so I we haven't seen any of
these shots these are all news to us
obviously the our crew our team who does
this has seen it but it's news to me so
when I dress the viewer I guess I'm
addressing you in this camera that right
does that look right great fantastic
okay so we should get started we've
loved stuff talking about Neal I we had
it was a big big crazy we can use we
like came storming out of the gate now
it was a week of not of major news
events right but of a lot of meaningful
interesting yeah there's a lot going on
yeah and ie it's pretty obvious that the
the stage is being set for like the next
wave of like big news events I'm and you
know we'll start right off with I think
Samsung which why can't I love talking
about my did we have we talked about
Samsung yeah so they watched gs4 last
week yeah but talked about that I talked
about it we had the big livestream yeah
the phone looks like people were very
people are very confused by the way they
were like is the verge cast dead now
yeah it's like listen we're only doing
the verge cast completely after samsung
is just one just one show yeah well we
were building this to any way sir they
had a big event there's a lot of
controversy immediately after the event
and then I ran a big report on Monday
because I it called Broadway people
which is not something you normally do
know that's right i mean this week's
been so long i completely forgot they
have you had this report so so i talked
to the director and the writer the
writer is now in la working on an atom
sample you wrote on and let me live
let's be clear you wrote a behind the
scenes of their extremely sexist of the
galaxy s4 sexist event which was which
was written and produced by broadway
right bit major Broadway talent Broadway
talent well you know it's people who
have Tony just people well yeah the
director directed Newsies I thought was
he was very into talking about Newsies
because it's one year Adrian your big
news your big news this area right do
you like Newsies seen you've never seen
news about the movie I haven't seen
seriously you know Christian Bale's in
it as a child that's how and yeah it's
really interesting
i feel like nazy now a couple anyways
but so so look even aside from the the
controversy over the specific content of
the thing I think it's crazy that
Samsung is like putting on these lavish
productions to launch a phone you you
that oh there's only one company and
technology that does that who is it
samsung like it's saying only samsung is
like well I've answered everybody does
their events everybody does events but
like the idea that samsung will have an
orchestra that literally is under the
stage and they'll raise the orchestra
and be like look what we bought yup well
they were they were in radio city music
hall but that's great that's crazy teen
the word on the street is that they're
spending 400 million dollars to promote
yeah to launch the galaxy s4 yeah 400
million to the number do you have any
idea how many starving children they
could feed with four hundred million
dollars well I'm sure they'll feel I'm
after like sell the phones and collect
like the billions of dollars like 10
like you gotta spend money to make money
kid I guess so haha sure okay that's
what Samsung's telling with starting job
so like regardless of the contours I
thought it was interesting I want to
talk these people and then this massive
controversy erupted over the portrayal
of women in the show yeah and so I
called Ivan Menchel who wrote it these
the guys writing Adam Sandler movie and
Jeff Calhoun news directors God directed
Newsies currently directing Newsies and
they're both like basically what they
said to me was a regular Broadway show
that we're used to working on we open
like out of town like we open and yeah
he worried yeah you give it a we do
reviews and we like get feedback and
then we change the show sure but because
this was a product launch and it was
basically being written in Korea we
didn't have any opportunity to do any of
the stuff and nobody ever mentioned this
like crazy like all the way our super
did that controversy get started did
start with the cnet story it started
during mean I was looking at least why I
was live logging I mean I was look at
Twitter own life while you to see what
people want to like to know about um and
it was like all of it would like the
whole time I feel like I also feel like
people sensitivity to how sexist this
any event might be now was turned up a
little bit because of the Sony event and
and this was like if the Sony event
seemed like subtly sexist and that there
were no women on stage out of the night
teen companies that they brought up on
stage this one was like but what if we
weren't suddenly say what if we were
overtly crazily sexist right i mean this
is the link better yeah well look at
least they're honest i'm sure they're
like look ladies you can wave at it
while your nails dry ladies here's a
week we're just gonna be straight and
you know is really interesting is it so
they got you know the right on the
director they told me like this whole
skit this big controversy with the the
bridesmaids party in the waving your
nails and a drunk lady ugly naked guy
which is fine did that happen I didn't
see the entire that happen um they're
like we wanted to make fun of section
city we want to make fun of bridesmaids
but literally we had to send Korea a new
script every day and was his big line
was there was not a pair of socks on
stage that hadn't been photographed sent
to Korea and approved yeah so it's like
they engage its I think I think those by
the way it was like I'd like to get some
selections you have the socks just laid
out I mean I think saying so that all
happened and I think people who are
watching this podcast probably read that
story and know about that and loved it
loved it but what's interesting is that
the next day samsung South Africa
apologized to sites in South Africa like
for an event that Samsung had held in
that country for refrigerator
refrigerators and washing machine and
the washing machine was called the
wobble and they had a troop of bikini
girls come out and like shake it still
like demonstrate their so it's like
Samsung has this like problem where well
I think the world has a problem samsung
is simply no I system of the world no
problem I'm that yeah it's a symptom but
i think the specific time you saw a
woman on stage at an apple event well
there's that but samsung's problem is
that they're they're putting on these
like incredibly low rice production
right and they're trying to engage art
in this way without ever realizing that
by doing like the most crass like a
lowest common denominator thing that
they're going to get this criticism well
here's what I here's what I feel like
I've learned from watching like the
Qualcomm CES keynote and the Samsung
thing what I've seen a samsung think I
really think that these company should
stay away from Thea
Rick's I think that I think it is a I
think it is a toxic terrible mixture
when they think that they're going to
put on like a show for people it's
always off-key right we have always and
it's because you can't make me maybe you
can but it's really really hard to mix
the direct commercial message of
everybody should love our product with
like this game you're trying to play
like well we're also engage in culture
yes they're still like supposed to be
like trade events right right hi Mary
audiences journalist so like I guess the
way it used to be is it would just be
specs yeah technical stuff right does it
do you feel like now they're actually
hoping that some customers you're gonna
buy phones I do you know there were a
couple to that point I agree that they'd
are thinking that there were a couple of
things I think mat Honan wrote something
in map you can and wrote something about
like this is I'm so bored with this like
there was this big launch event it's
just another smartphone and I was
thinking that's true for us in the
industry we've seen a million smartphone
launches but I think part of putting on
this spectacle was not to say hey look
at all of our amazing specs it was
almost to say like Samsung is here and
we've got awesome products and we're an
amazing come and put on a big show the
radius anything to do with it'll 6,000
people and they invited the United fan
yeah right so they streamed it and like
like at the 500,000 people watched it
live which is nuts and then yeah like
that can't be right that's right 500,000
like that one time or torrent people
that was the number that uh no shocker
told me that they were watching a live
streaming that was done but worldwide
it's not actually he seems insane and
then I don't know how many people
watched it since I'm so you'd watched it
today actually you were you were like I
did I cramming for the verge past yes
what so what you think I thought it was
um I mean it was super campy like
Mollywood makes the point that you know
it's not just women who are portrayed of
stereotypes it's every single type of
person um and yeah I thought it was
annoying reminded me okay so we're
talking about the women in tech stuff
now um it reminded me of like do you
remember when Del had that like della
yeah the new site that was for women
yeah and it was just like you know
it's not it doesn't like it's not like a
huge deal it doesn't really impact my
life but it's annoying it's late really
it's it's like if you have if you're a
smart modern I mean anybody not a woman
a man anything like it just seems so out
of touch with reality and what like life
is actually like right you know that's
so it just off-key it's like you know
you write the you're going back to this
these portrayals these stereotypes it's
like the thing with Qualcomm where they
were supposed to know the young hip kids
and it was you don't know what you don't
know what those people are like and so
your portrayal of them is is insulting
to the people that you think you're
portraying it is stupefying to the
people who don't know what you're
portraying and it just comes off as
totally off color and totally bad and
and that's the samsung stuff just feels
that way but I think there is also you
know we've got to admit that there is
you said it's a trade show it's a trade
event and and I think we're probably
going to talk about this yesterday's
yeah sandwich sexism kerfuffle yeah but
I do think that in in our industry I
mean let's just be on it's like we all
know there are things that were battling
in the industry of Technology and
internet culture and and and technology
culture and a lot of that stuff is
sexism and like really late and sexism
and racism and even not so late in
sexism and racism and just like general
general conditioning that is has been
can I just say that this set right now
is like super set up like a cross fire
and I feel like I need to be arguing
with Adrian yeah everything's fine why
don't you ladies just shut up Adrian
you're in support of women's rights Eli
you feel women should have no right you
said before the break a very hungry and
I quote lock them away yeah and take
them out only when we need them why your
face double a quick me we can't get him
some chicken I don't know that means I
go to Paris yesterday and I did it
really that's us that's not sure that's
a SP I was a soften our situation but uh
but uh but there is like this kind of
this thing it's like Indian what's most
frustrating about it is that people in
the industry don't don't like what do
you mean
there's no problem our commenters drive
me well commenters but also you know the
people who are like we're colorblind
there's no sexism you know my heritage
Shane like CBS women would show up to
our stuff that when women would be
included it's like well women don't shop
to yourself because you don't include
them right because your home that's
awesome it's like a little bit
forgivable here because like you said
before I was overt and the really
insidious sexism in tech is the you know
the more subtle the kind where it's just
like it's it's not obvious and people
are like oh what's the problem I don't
see the problem and the problem is
actually just that there's you know
there's not women visible on stage
there's not a you know the jokes are
aren't as funny to women as they are to
a room that's full of guys like it's
like that kind of stuff that's worth so
we should do if we're talking about
jokes that aren't funny is it really
anyone this controversy yesterday yes
can you any launches yeah so we ran the
Samsung piece and I actually think this
is this story begins not at the
controversy that yesterday or even what
happened at this event the controversy
for me begins at the immediate reaction
to what happened in this event right
yeah so we ran the Samsung story and
we're like there's there sexism attack
right it's like a thing that we've been
talking about right and also but I chose
it yes they're sexism attack and I think
we can all say we could all do better
everybody can get better at being better
with like modern life yeah we're not
we're not perfect when it comes to
there's no sexism a NASCAR and I think
we all yeah I mean we're not perfect
anywhere Annika patrick has given
through the glass I think we can clasp
retaining wall we can all do better and
be more cognizant of how we behave right
was it right this is this is exactly
right so we ran the story and there I
got a lot of emails and then there was a
forum thread and a lot of forum threads
about why aren't you guys equally
covering this Adria Richards story so
Adria Richards was a developer
evangelist for company called SendGrid
is an email marketing company SendGrid
they're actually over 100 employees
they're not tiny right so it's like
should with she's a developer evangelist
for this company and she was at was boss
unfortunately um was a developer
evangelist for this company she was at a
Python conference called pycon and she
overheard two guys at
another company I don't play Haven yes
it from a company called play Haven
sitting behind her telling jokes about
dongles and forking repos it was like
there is a sexual innuendo using the
term dongle and I'm not gonna say I've
never made a dongle joke and you know
like cuz I can totally make dongle jokes
all you know check out this huge dongle
I mean that's basically kind of joke
there it's all you can about my
apologize Adrian go ahead gone uh wait I
have to look up this exact headline okay
while you're doing that this is
important so she was thinking about it
she likes saw a picture of like okay
good which are you ready yeah for my
uncle joke from January 18th 2011 Jack
Dorsey's dongle growing in popularity
you're fired like a beta beat headline
that's in her still way we read that
headline ah so good tune anyway she
tweeted course there you go yeah you win
we blew it here the big winner we should
have run that head uh anyway so she took
a picture of them she tweeted it like
repeatedly and was like please Pikkon
organizers come talk to these guys like
I'm really uncomfortable with this yeah
she made a big fuss when she written a
child she she publicly shamed them she
took a picture of them and tweeted it
yeah and was kind of like hey this is
not right sure anyway so they got kicked
out on one of the guys who's still
nameless I believe got fired the other
guy didn't get fired nameless offender
got fired it was finna got fired this
story got picked up magically it arrived
on like hacker news and paste bin uh and
it just started just building and like
controversy and like hatred and rage
yeah until you know anonymous got
involved well so it was a nanos
anonymous it was just what nonnamous
people but they call themselves and
honest yeah well that's pointed you know
the thing about anonymous that's so
tricky is that carry not I think if
anybody could say that anybody could use
it well it's your right yeah that's why
they ultimately anonymous like is gonna
have severe problems in the future it's
like what Leanne say to have severe
problems but they're not so big that
it's like a thing when there's like
actual terrorist activity under the
guise of a non
this is going to be problematic anyway
so I SendGrid was d dost Adria Richards
herself to get deservedly so by the way
because they fired her to write so then
they fired right so they got they got
she literally they threatened her
company until it afraid she was fine
yeah and there's a lot of hazy in there
too and just to be clear what we're
saying is that that she was attacked
started be to be attacked online for
issues report for getting this guy
getting this guy fired when she did not
ask anybody to do right um and and
attacked in a way that wasn't like hey
was wrong for you to shame those guys
you should have told the organizers like
that what you're a jerk for doing that I
decide more and more and more like like
you know you bitch how dare you you
deserve to die like that way you guys
are both gonna get flame emails i was i
got one what all I did was tweet about
it I mean I get all I did was tweet that
russell brandom was writing a story yeah
that's all I tweet you you don't
understand what my inbox was like yeah I
get a welcome to LA emails okay fair
enough and I cannot even you know and i
also have to get i also get emails for
you guys yeah about your behavior
because imagine because i'm supposed to
be in charge of you hey you know the
emails about your behavior really really
circling I don't get emails that rifle
start forward emails that are like you
know Joe how can you allow Joe flatly to
keep writing his liberal screed you know
his stop stop letting Joe flatly push
his agenda stuff like that so so also
Joe flatly agenda was crazy as you
know we read his post to know that he is
in a major political agenda right Oh
anyhow so they were violent mean nasty
attacks that were way out of sync with
the situation and a lot so my my tweet
summary which i got paypal 42 was woman
tweets about men creating hostile
environment men respond by turning
internet into the most awesome Byron
posse yeah I think that's what happened
with anyone mad at her degree of
complaint that you know you should have
just talked to them and in response
we're going to literally tell you that
you should kill yourself and take and
remove
like destroy your comp I mean there is
there is this thing of well it's the
Internet I mean when we were talking
about headlines for that piece we were
one of the first headlines was the
Internet is terrible or something along
those lines these lightly use that
headline ones though it's true okay for
killer every right to you that's like
yeah it's like a series the interwar
story series but there is this there is
I just make that story strange the
internet is terrible and just all like
they're really rotten stuff and I like
that idea there is this thing that
that's just like it's so easy for these
guys to just say whatever they want just
say the first thing that comes to mind
just you know and i know this is
internet mentality but internet
mentality needs to like chill out i mean
basically the problem is that we are all
going oh it's the internet it's like
yeah the internet is life now like we're
all there we're all living there I mean
we work on the internet we live on the
internet we communicate with everybody
that we know on the internet so it's
like you can no longer get away with hey
it's the internet you know how that's
how people get in a room full of people
they wouldn't be that way and the
Internet's a room full of people so it's
like there needs to be some better than
one way to excuse your description for
the show we are talking and we're like
no one in the actual situation seems
particularly likable like right we
should make clear we're not endorsing
know they also do sighs I think she was
I think that I think that that her did I
decision do shame those guys instead of
saying it's I do think she should have
turned around and said hey guys i just
thought would have been effective it
would have been more effective made them
think twice ii-i'm that situation I do
feel like she overreacted by making it
into a public thing when it should have
been a conversation between three people
right you know i mean that's in regular
real life and maybe the internet has has
dulled us in some way to these types of
interactions but you know if you're
sitting at a restaurant somebody next to
you is saying something really offensive
or upsetting i mean i've done this like
every time we go out every time really
bad okay or some he's being really loud
or whatever you say listen I hate to
bother you but if you could you know be
a little quieter or you know hey what
you just said it's really offensive
could you keep it down I mean they don't
meet a few times I remember I was
standing in the deli um
I stand in a deli ordering a sandwich
and this guy next to me was talking to
his friend he's like yeah you know I
drew them down a little bit I was like
listen I don't want to be a jerk but but
that's really a pretty offensive and
Jewish and it's not cool to say and he's
like what would he talk he got really
mad if he's we talking about I got a
little have a lot of Jewish friends he
actually said I was like okay well they
probably in any way they probably think
you're a dick you know try that hard oh
yeah he's like that guide it was like a
Hasidic Jew is standing there by some
potato chips Eddie how terrible that
happens it's New York but anyhow but the
point is that that's in normal approach
would be hey guys I think this is really
offensive that I can hear you so can you
keep Russell and I were like working on
this piece um I was like you know in
high school like you make these jokes
like I was a boy in high school I've
what I continued actually emotionally to
be a boy in high school you were obliged
school no I mean like the nature of
social interaction as you learn what the
boundaries of acceptable behavior yeah
and this is just like that that's
boundary setting but I was so on the
flip side let me argue the please do
contrapositive yeah I don't know what
that means I don't either um but if
we're saying but we're saying hard just
just to prep just I want you to do this
but just to cap off what what Adrian
said and what you just said is that
we're not we don't think anybody in this
situation who's actually involved is
like necessarily cool or greater likable
or when I actually don't see why any of
their the people who got fired was this
is like a last straw situation I had
open Brian I owe me but yeah so we're
not I don't think this is not a question
of defending one side of the other it's
a question of like how the internet
treats people right and how they mean a
particular and in particular how men on
the internet respond to and react to and
treat women whether they like them or
not right and I think that by extension
women and I mean how men treat women in
general whether they like them or not I
think the Internet is just an amplified
version of reality yeah well so here I
think those reactions are and here's
here's the different amplified publix
and we're if if the the massive outrage
that is taking place on Twitter and our
comments and other sites and hacker news
is about how she should have felt fine
just turning around and telling them to
shut up right maybe
there's there is exist in the world like
environments women don't feel
comfortable doing that right yes and we
are we have now turned the internet yeah
like this place of fun impression in a
roomful at a hacker conference in a room
full of but that's that's assignment
what I'm saying but like I think it goes
it works in both places you know it we
say like you should have turned around
and said hey guys can you chill out that
might not be an environment that's
comfortable for a woman to turn around
to two guys say hey guys can you chill
out right you know I'm saying but we did
would it what we've arrived at is like
the vast amount of retribution here
we'll chill the speech of other people
regardless of what their complaint and
it's not that the sad thing about is
it's not new it's not infrequent it is
basically the norm right you know it is
the norm to shout somebody down when you
don't like them or agree with them on
the internet and it seems to be doubly
severe and I'd say violent when it comes
to women I mean it does there is this
thing that's like a certain kind of
subtle violence in it that is shocking
and weird to me that's kind of scary
looking I was looking for chance
discussion why that it I mean fortune
can't be counted on to not be but I was
trying to get an idea of how many people
really felt that strongly about it
because and it's and it was really hard
to tell because these are people who are
very good at making themselves look like
more people on the internet so like
there's like this change.org petition
that was signed by 1,500 people and
you're like but are some of those yeah
not really port edition uh fire fire
adria richards and then it was like ah
blow me and then it was like you know
she was saying that people on Twitter
who were uh arguing with her like
somebody had made a fake Twitter account
for a woman who was like arguing with
adria it was like pretty obviously fake
and then there's like there's all these
arts and then there's emails and it's
like but how many of these people are
the same people is it's just like a
group of five hundred like truly
terrible guys or is it more than that
yeah and it's and the interesting thing
is it I mean it is kind of impossible to
know and it does give to Academy you're
actually looking for very specifically
at things and you're thinking about
this is but to a casual observer it's
indistinguishable from reality well the
fake the fake Twitter accounts and the
fake petition is is not there's no way
to verify that it's to say that it's not
real right you know basically so you
know it's it's it's a to me so the I
read a lot of our comments and i got
into twitter arguments last night which
was stupid and I apologize far goofy on
Twitter last night I don't really
apologize but I given this context I
feel as I should not apologize I'm not
apologizing I never apologized never
apologize wrong you are uh and so here's
the this the thread the strain that I
picked up on that was I thought was very
interesting um which is basically like
I'm a really shy guy and I feel very
uncomfortable speaking to women and now
I feel like if I say the wrong thing
they there they wield so much power in
this environment of feminism that they
will get me fired that's the idea the I
yeah yeah yeah and I think that's so
like deeply weird and wrong and it's
it's like it's it's shyness and fear now
mixed with like a different kind of fear
uh Russell was saying to me like this
when he was writing a piece he was like
there's something very old here where
it's like they keep saying he's a father
of three without assigning many other
qualities yeah so he's like this like
breadwinner noble father figure yeah
taking down on this woman's go iowa came
and cut off his hair exactly and it's
like that's crazy like this is the
oldest kind of like sexist like it is
worried there is something i was just
thinking as you were saying that like
it's weird that we're almost having to
like relearn lessons yeah or deal with
things that you think are like in
reality have been most not most not
totally dealt with but are more dealt
with you know it's just mean you know
that in an office environment in certain
environments like there are there gonna
be guys who say the wrong things or do
the wrong things or ya asses to women
you know that's going to exist right and
they're gonna be women who are meaner
than they need to be or whatever like
yeah those are people that exist in the
world but like overall like I don't walk
into rooms full of men and women and
think that there's gonna be like we
don't all know how to speak to one
another none i think it's like it's like
this is a meander
all yo really is i think that's it
i think it's um it's i think what's
what's happening here and this is just
pop psychology so it's forgive me pop
armchairs happen on psychology
psychology there's it's a group of women
or a group of men who are saying why why
do we have to recognize this like
pervasive sexism in the world when we
already feel women have so much power
over us because we're so afraid of them
we don't oughta talk you think it's a
type it's a type I think it's a type of
person matter cause you couldn't talk to
girls in high school yeah and now they
can i desert some palette i also have a
little hesitation at ascribing this type
like saying trying to pinpoint a title
that's what i was reading or and over
but i think it's much I get that there
is those may be the loudest voices I
think but I think there's a picture I
think I think that's what drove this
particular incident into the spotlight
because like Adria Richards is not a
perfect spokesperson or the other side
right so i think it was like this
hardcore group of people who had this
like very visceral reaction but who is
who is driving in this case who is the
perfect spokesperson I mean you look at
you know what was the girl's name sandra
fluke she did one of the brush number
called a oh yeah the right to
Planned Parenthood the plan right and
this is this is this is like part of the
problem and I'm saying like that you
could say it's a type and maybe those
are the loudest voices but we have you
know widespread issues in this
department like you don't call a guy you
don't find whatever the equivalent of
 is forgot there is no equivalent as
far as I know which is part of the
problem with whatever I but you know
Rush Limbaugh you know Rush Limbaugh uh
calling someone a for something
that is I mean there's no is no reason
for him to do it it's just like he
wanted to be mean and he wanted to like
hurt a woman and so he found like a
really great hurtful word and I think
that that type of mentality is is like
kind of bubbling under the surface it's
not just with guys who you know couldn't
talk to girls in high school it's with
guys who are in positions of power it's
with regular guys once you know I mean I
threaten you definitely got some what
evolved you have to be somewhat evolved
in your brain has to be somewhat evolved
to not think that way and feel that way
I'll friend you like that you like to
think that we get to that point me all
the people that I know I feel pretty
confident
that the people in our company at our
company don't feel that way and don't
walk through life having these kinds of
insane weird dated like Neanderthal
thoughts but I mean I'm sorry I mean
except for you but um but but you know
I'll be other people don't a lot of
other people don't the problem is that
the internet gives them amplification it
gives them illusion of sighs I think in
many instances and it and it is that and
that's the thing we are the headline
ended up being thug mentality which is
like you know a mob can be good and bad
there are good moms and begging a
crowdfunding is a mob doing great things
yeah um you know tomorrow I use a lot
doing bad things this to me is like a
mob of thugs yeah and and that that
mentality that mindset needs to be
squashed it really does yes i think it's
it's it's super hurtful to the people
who are victims of it heard the direct
targets of it but it's also i mean it's
look I mean you say what you will about
anonymous and you know this kind of
citizen you know this these the Rising
Voices of the citizenry there is a lot
of negative that goes along with it and
it's not just like cut and dry that we
say like oh it's great that we can
organize and push our ideas and our
agenda forward it's it needs to be more
than just we have a group so let's use
them need to be like what is the group
for what is the group do what do we
stand for what what will we and won't we
tolerate it's cool like I think that's
the thing about the anonymity of the
internet which I support which I think
needs to be there but you get to a point
where you start to say okay anonymous is
a group of what is it what does it stand
for you want to be formless like water
well if you're formless like water then
you're also terrorists and not everybody
who thinks that anonymous can do good
things wants to be a terrorist right
they want to do good things you know
they want a petition for and fight for
the things that are really valuable so
you get into situations like this and
it's like you either going to take shape
or not and I think part of the problem
with the internet is anonymity gives you
it's easy to take a vague form but not a
specific form and it totally reminded me
of I mean this was the terrorist attack
kind of an like Russell made this point
that you know SendGrid like gave in like
you're not supposed to negotiate with
terrorists
but syndra didn't even try to do that
they just gave in I mean at first I had
this theory i was like maybe it's a fake
firing and they're just trying to get
the hackers off their back yeah and
they're gonna be like haha now where l
shored up like bring it on we're hiring
her back or we never fired her in the
first place like we're standing by her
no but no that didn't I mean I actually
think that so I mean she's I feel like
this is not a fire bowl I mean again it
feels like she has a pattern she might
have a pattern but he might like it's
really it's really pretty raw for them
to say like hey we you're fired because
we think you somehow now are threatening
our business public firing is a big deal
a public Myron is a bikini for both of
these people be surprised if there's no
compile something well yeah I'm kind of
wrongful termination both of these
firings I'm sure there were reasons
beyond this incident but the timing is
awful and stupid on the behalf of the
companies like if i worthy you know if
let's say something like this happened
and i had to let somebody go because of
some terrible situation that occurred on
the internet they said something racist
and horrible or whatever I wouldn't I
mean I don't know if I would take that
moment when it was when when tempers
were hottest to let them go no no I
definitely let simmer down unless you're
negotiating right unless you're like oh
she ate here like peace offering for you
like which is which is like I think if
it was something that's so obvious like
man this like if it wasn't me was just
can I do a firing transition here
obviously racist or something like you
might go look this person is obviously
bad a bad person to have here we don't
want them around this is not and we want
publicly disassociate right but nothing
about these these two people is is
publicly obvious that they're terrible
people and that's the thing that the
firing on the bath of the guy makes him
seem more terrible than he was probably
and her fiery makes her seem more
terrible which just fuels the fire of
this this artist debate in a bad way I
think right anyhow so I'm going to say
we have a hard out I know we have a
heart we have a heart stopped today
because somebody else has to do a show
because we have since we have a fancy
new studio visit is scheduled so
speaking an iron i was late it's all
weird that's a weird fedex fedex well
there's two things and no Chris she's
gonna go ahead join us on skype so on
Andy Rubin left Android
last week you did a big profile over the
weekend tell us about it what you learn
what why hung boy leave why did homeboy
leave um basically Android got he
Android outgrew him I grew his abilities
and he stopped being the kind of work
that he wanted to do yeah um so it's I
still don't know whether the initiative
first came from andy rubin side or
whether it first came from larry page or
somewhere else at Google but um somebody
I didn't put this in the story about
somebody close to the situation would
know said Andy could have stayed at
Android yeah um so it might have just
come purely from him he might have gone
a gone to Larry Page and said you know
I'm ready to do another thing we still
don't know that but um it does seem
clear that the whole Android experiment
had gotten to a new phase a more
complicated phase like one of the lines
in story was that the way forward was
less clear um and he was Andy Reubens
like kind of more of an entrepreneur
startup guy he gets he's like the first
leg of the relay race yeah um and he did
a great job also and it's totally
brilliant um but yeah I just got to the
point where he was no longer interested
in the the types of problems that were
confronting Android which had to do a
lot with working with other people well
it turns out that it's it's funny
because you've got Sinofsky and
forestall and now Reuben Reuben wasn't
fired or let go he didn't quit he's
moving to industry google he's moving to
another project Google and a secret
project and I think this is in your ops
this is in your story this is in your
historian and I've heard as well that
that what he's doing is from sources
familiar with the matter that that what
he's doing is him is important right
it's not like it's like he's going to do
uh you know they're gonna shuffle him
off into the background that eventually
he's gonna leave to go starting to do
everything to start the history of
Android suggested what he's best at is
like we have this crazy idea go make it
a success yeah like how much money do
you need what we trust you well that was
kind of the gist of Adrian's articles
that like he's really good at the
starting part and maybe gets a little
bogged down when you get into the right
now and I can go in there has
it has material has real problems like
it is it a real classroom dancer in a
way that is like striking dan frommer
wrote something on splat F on his blog
with spliff it's bleph but um about sort
of you know what the issues are with
android you're right it does and I was
reading it today as i was perusing but
but he made some great points and i
think there is a point to be made that
android does have real problems that
it's getting you know it's disappeared
behind the brands of samsung and amazon
whoever else grabs it and uses it it's
not a profit Center for them it's not
making the money they don't they can't
exert control over it right I don't know
how much is playing into search I assume
a ton I mean everybody who has an
android phone is using google to search
unless you've some for some strange
reason about the fascinate on verizon
which comes pre-loaded with Bing um
which a lot of people bought weirdest
phone Robert no that was the one that
that's the phone that went up against
the iphone went up verizon have the
iphone no yes that is the medical side I
no more pills the droid the original
droid was they know that was that was
that's pretty much the original droid
that was we're gonna that's you know
anyway that's bragging volume parties in
these details the point that I was
making is that my mic is like sliding I
don't don't happen in here um what was I
said what was I saying oh and crossbones
yeah it is at a crossroads and and but i
don't i just got a mental image of the
little robot like at an actual cross
just saying their left or right what am
I gonna do name one of those kind of
yeah can that robot look sad yes I've
only ever seen the mouth goes his mouth
he doesn't have a mouth it's kind of
like where his head connect yeah but it
basically goes all the way around it I
don't know how it could frown yeah his
eyes could probably do sigh mean I
definitely seem like cartoons of that
like the little robot like it's like
staking an apple like in the face if you
have a if you have an image of the
Android looking sad at a crossroad that
a crime either at a crossroads you're
looking sad please send i'm looking into
my camera here if you want to use it
because i'm addressing I'm addressed in
here if you have an image of the Android
looking sad or standing at a crossroads
looking sad send it to a verge cast at
the verge calm yeah we'd love to see it
you'll get also tweet at us yeah at ten
i had at verge thanks in advance yes
thank thank say please and thank you uh
but
yes so android doesn't problems but
they've but they've put in sundar what
is his last name is Pete Pete Rock epic
I ok I just want to make sure I had it
right yeah I was there's an end in there
hi when I see it I immediately think of
Pikachu so it's a real problem which is
a Pokemon if somebody can make the
android robot looks like a Pikachu I
think we'd that definitely exists I need
to see that as well please send it to
vered verge cast at the verge calm up
and what is what is your take on him as
a leader on sundar Pichai yeah he seems
a lot a smoother a lot um so Andy Rubin
is a technical guy and he's sort of
unusual and that he was able to do both
like about halfway through his career he
was an engineer at first he was at Apple
a couple other places and then about
halfway through his career he
transitioned in management and then
eventually became CEO danger and then
later Android and was the head of
Android and it was able to manage a lot
of people yeah this is ruben and so like
that's pretty unusual to be able to take
a company to the point where he took
danger and and also like be basically a
technical guy at heart so but sundar
seems like more of an advanced leader
like you know he's he's like a product
manager Mourinho type he is really
smooth and we've I've talked to him a
handful of times and he does a lot of
the he just he did a bunch of google i/o
presentation the fig he did a really
long one last year I can't remember but
he's been running chrome and apps yep
and I mean you gotta say it to of
Google's most important yeah most
valuable business I mean apps has been
their whole thing has been we got to
take on Microsoft right we got to take
on office and then I think that they've
been making some inroads I mean that's
my strong feeling immediately really wow
that is that is really that's details at
a 3d rendering do that on a hand or can
get this on the screen I feel like
somebody just had that on hand I I don't
that wasn't made for us but anyhow but
he is um he's a real leader he's very
even-keeled like it my impression of him
is that I mean Andy Rubin seems like he
could have you know he could be a bit
mercurial in the sense that he seems
like not a hothead but
he's very passionate yeah and and sins
are seems like smooth he's really funny
thing cucumber sad android email this
one's crying is a smooth as a cuke of
her i said he is cute she is a cutie
upper sundar is a cucumber if i could
get on a shop of that so obviously the
wow with so many these it's happening
are they pouring in yeah they're good uh
anyhow so that the we there's some
breaking news we need to address oh well
queer we have chris sigler on the phone
oh my god but before we do that it's
like this moment now earlier today we've
got Chris but just to wrap this up okay
the big now thats indoors in charge of
both the obvious speculation is that
they're going to merge android with
chrome OS which i think they're gonna do
very soon and you I think it's far off
you think it's far off I think it's
Farah first of all I think it would be
hard to do and the the thing about the
Android team is that they're kind of
there like running at breakneck pace
there and they're trying to keep their
head above water training you know
they're having trouble coordinating
getting updates out to all the carriers
and they're they're just going really
fast and they don't really have time to
stop and integrate with the chrome OS
team yeah I think I agree that it'll be
a lot would be a long time before that
happens I think Eric Schmidt just denied
that's impossible that I think it's
possible that Chrome OS could begin to
get some Android functionality there's
nothing stopping I mean there's there's
you could see a situation where they
have an emulator and you're taking this
look they just made the Chromebook pixel
it's got basically the same resolution
touchscreen as a samsung as the nexus 10
which is a touchscreen android tablet
you could see a situation where they say
like hey you have a touchscreen it's
running a google OS you can run your
tablet out on on the screen do full
screen you know apps or do the windowed
as stand-alones as you know in whatever
emulator they cook up or however they do
that that to me seems like a i almost
kind of can't figure out the explanation
for the pixel otherwise yeah and i think
that so that's what I'm expectancy at
i/o which would that would come from the
Chrome OS team right like I mean it with
a Malaysian would be a discrete
collaboration with it I mean it's not
like you don't need the whole Android
team to implement android on and right
you need some help yeah I mean duh good
buddy I mean oh and right and then
already and that already you know it's
obvious that Android is easy to get up
and running on just about anything you
wanted to run on yeah so but it's but
that's it x86 right are there any
difficulties there I guess they've got
android for x86 and uh Motorola's
shipping and brightens and you know who
owns motorola yeah google it's all
coming together it's all happening
they're gonna make finally this plan and
plot notable individuals going oh I know
what they're gonna do they're gonna make
a new yeah they're gonna do make a new
hey Trix right there runs that is a
Chromebook and Android I'm metro area
here tonight breaking there's your
breaking news can I just check by saying
I believe motor oil acquisition is
complete fiddle here I don't think yeah
I don't think it's yet that's it so
that's other thing I think is
interesting i know we have to move on
but i think i think what would be really
exciting and interesting is if andy
rubin decided to take a major leadership
role in turning google's hardware
business into a real hardware business
instead of that would be cool instead of
like ugly fake hardware business which
it is now which it seems like you'd be
into um you know he was hoping that
Google would be able to sell phones
directly to people over the internet
which did not work right so it seems
like and they have and there are some
things happening now I think there is
and by the way well we're pregnant I
know we have at the FCC is that we're
talking about yeah that's okay well as
gonna say there are changes having at
the FCC you know we are kind of at a new
going towards a new age the government
wants you to be able to unlock your
phones you know there's definitely a new
age of awareness of the need for
interoperability and people are no
longer I think just thinking of phones
is something they buy their carrier I do
feel like there's an opportunity they
botch the Nexus Q they've had some
success with the Nexus 7 maybe some
success with the nexus for the 10 i can
imagine has not sold anything because
they just started promoting it there's
at least one out there because i got
mine stolen that's true needle eyes was
stolen so mad about but but but to see
them do what closer to what Apple or
Microsoft is doing or rim at this point
which is like hey we're we're actually
really involved in this not just LG has
aspect that we're a chassis
they were going to pull for our next
phone because let's be honest that's
they did they talk about working really
closely together but I don't believe
that and if you look at the Galaxy Nexus
and you look at the nexus for you see
the chassis of a phone that already
exists that's already going to market in
some other form that's just been given
like a slightly different yeah form
basically so I would like I would like
to see that happen I think they can do
it I think they should do it I think the
Chromebook pixel is an incredible piece
of hardware yeah I wish it was more
functional because I like it more like
if you wanted to have more android stuff
I like it more physically than my than
my macbook air my macbook vandread was
as good at the web as chrome and Chrome
OS was as good at apps as Andrew yeah
there's something there okay let's get
Chris on yup you got it we were let's
get dressed let's get Chris for this
breaking news no power hey oh my god
buddy hi Chris Chris how are you how is
everyone do we not have a still frame of
Chris's face that we can put up on the
screen we do not have one I've just been
in forest here I can pull up Chris's
picture on my computer and turn around
you can uh Chris tell us what's
happening with our government is going
down that's a pretty broad question this
happens every what's going on to CPI
what did Obama something's going on in
Cyprus yes Obama is in Jordan today I
believe know so um Julius Genachowski
our esteemed FCC chairman for the past
four years has announced that he is
stepping down and this should come as a
surprise to no one because his term was
up in July anyway it's just that he is
stepping down a little early and there's
some speculation Washington Post which
of course is a Washington dc-based
publication has been covering this
pretty closely really you need to stop
you didn't say I I'm just glad I could
be watching to say it if you have never
lived on the planet Earth they've been
covering this situation very closely for
the past couple weeks a Republican
Commissioner FCC Commissioner just
stepped down a few days ago and there's
speculation that Julius was waiting for
him to step down to tip the balance of
the voting in the Democrats favor oh but
that's that's just speculation at this
point so okay we'll see what
happens janikowski is replacement has
been named yet so to me interesting few
weeks for for people who follow this
kind of thing so Neil I you you know
Julia star I'm just checking my package
is very important you know Julius you
guys are good buddies we are we've
talked uh you have spent a lot of time
together you summer together in the
Hamptons what do you make of this how
will this impact the the world um so you
know I think Julius has had a mixed
tenure I would call it I think he's he's
been very successful at the broad
strokes of he's turned the FCC from
being this super corporate like a
regulatory agency the talks to like
mediate disputes between satellite
companies and cable companies and like
talks about technical standards of like
RF transmission which they still do but
he has made it a consumer-facing agency
like they're out there they're talking
about cell phone unlocking they're
talking about broadband across America
they're talking about what our standards
should be well but but but but it also
comes at a time I'm not to take it away
from him but it also comes at a time
when the awareness of those things as an
important right now I'm not saying I
mean like I you know the timing was
right and I think he was I think as much
as he could have he did he was the right
guy but they're incredibly there an
incredibly lobbied incredible of any of
our government I create mean Chris and I
sit sit around dreaming of things the
FCC could do yeah in our private moments
yeah and they don't I ever knew here
they're heavily lobbied by right private
interests right by the way Neil I I
cherish our private moments can I just
do you also summer in the Hamptons with
Whitney like our and Julius but you know
I'm I I feel like they've done almost
nothing so I disagree with you right
there yeah I also do whoa uh well no I
mean if you think about the things that
you guys had time to talk about this at
the beach house yeah well Julius got to
me yeah i mean like look they presided
over the 700 megahertz auction yeah
which went pretty badly and except for
the fact that there's LTE like no no
they don't say they sold united states
that you need the world
all the things but the things that that
that the things that they should have
done to protect consumers right choice
no for that in that office is working
we're definitely and this is what I'm
saying is that happened I Chris that
happened during kevin martin's tenure
right yeah Julia took it over did so
that happened during the previous
commissioners tenure so he took over the
implementation of this thing that
happened right so like they so they sold
the spectrum de Vries and now we've got
to build it out and that's when he began
turning the FCC into this consumer
organization right where they're saying
we need net neutrality where they're
saying we need massive broadband
deployment you've got to stop playing
with each other go ahead sad android is
fine go on uh no and that's what he
started talking about what the SEC needs
to do in order to protect consumer
interest and I think he lost a lot of
battles like I lost that net neutrality
man he lost a ton of battles and I mean
maybe he could never have won them in
the first place right but it's you know
I'd love to see an FCC that's a lot more
brutal to carriers right well I have to
say I think that I think that Julius
Genachowski legacy is going to be the
failed AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile merger which is
obviously seen by most is a huge win for
consumers yeah and t-mobile is a
resurgent carrier now at least they
appear to be all right I mean are they
do we have any data to back that they're
gonna watch LTE or doing all that
uncarrier stuff right yes there's a
spectrum position is much much stronger
than it was 12 or 18 months at what
point can I confidently switch to
t-mobile for great LTE service 18 months
oh really I'll be dead in 1881 I but no
but Chris like I agree I mean you think
that will be his legacy the just his
legacy is is is ending something which i
think is interesting well yeah I mean I
think that's the the most sort of
blockbuster Hollywood thing that
happened during his tenure for lack of a
better word yeah it was a big deal yeah
I mean anything it was good but I think
there were a lot of places where he you
know I mean look maybe the instant
possible forces you to him at the
government chamber knows is in the
government what know what I think is
interesting is that you know the
he transition I don't think we ever
talked about the FCC when we were at
engadget we probably like Chris and I
would run like we definitely did the 700
megahertz whether there's a huge story
but like we never talked about it I
painstakingly photoshopped an ebay
auction that was for the 700 megahertz
bad when they're like you know uh you
know highest rated seller and I have
like that's very funny it said look and
it had like now I gotta get it hey puss
puss yeah a plus closet no look I think
I think he loved this transition where
the FCC started stopped being a
technical standards organization which
is what they were yeah and they started
being this like we're in the mix like
the internet was this vast unregulated
space and like now like we need to like
decide how people in the united states
are going to get connected it's true ass
they're going to connect what the
companies that that regular that control
those connections can and can't do and
