the other singularity because we talked
about this singularity itself it gets
really heady fast right you're talking
about raspberry site to let you like to
stay in a water for 20 minutes or
solving social ills or even internal
life then there's the other singularity
hey everybody it's been popping from the
verge we're here for the opening night
party at South by Southwest Interactive
this party is put on every year by the
folks at frog design and it's two things
it's a chance for nerves to get really
drunk together and it's kind of a chance
to talk and think about some of the
bigger ideas and technologies so this is
an interactive books project to put
together by frog and the idea is that in
the near future light is going to be
cheaper than ink so the way the books
work is that their projections and as
you turn the page it changes to a new
image so I think perhaps in the future
instead of creating something with
expensive costly in
we just have these books made of light
that can always change so what you guys
see behind me is an installation called
zen and the art of the robot now this is
a Zen garden you rake it you think you
meditate you find the meaning of life
but why would you do all that work if a
robot can find inner peace for you the
folks at frog design had their partners
in China make this it's kind of like a
giant light right people have these
electronics paint brushes and they can
go up there and change the lights to
whatever color they want what's really
interesting about it for them the price
right now is about a used car but next
year the price of building this could be
as much as they used smartphone</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
