Berlin I'm checking out one of the crazy
things in the show Sony's new hmz -
three head mounted display you have two
OLED displays up here not 0.7 inches
they're HD now 1280 by 720 resolution
and as usual with trade shows Sony has
one of these show up this is a
third-generation actually I tried it on
today I have to say it's quiet and weird
experience I've tried oculus rift I
haven't actually tried the earlier
generations of the these Sony headsets
the oculus rift was an amazing
experience I can't say the same for this
one you have all of these soft
attachments which are flexible and
adjustable and you also have these
adjustments for your eyes down at the
bottom as much they'll try to adjust
them I never managed to get the 3d look
to be crisp and proper it does to the
video as well however the whole 3d
experience just isn't that great and the
other thing is you still have most of
the weight of the headset resting on
your nose which is kind of an issue if
you want to use it for longer than a few
minutes so what's new with the new head
mounted display from Sony one of the
major things is that you can actually do
Wireless easy transfers now there's
still whatever here it actually connects
a battery pack which gives you a few
hours worth of endurance but still needs
a connection to get the power from the
battery onto here you also don't have
audio so this is why we have two cables
connected to the set one of them is for
headphones with a headphone jack on the
headset itself so actually once you get
this on your head together with one of
Sony's large / your headphone sets it's
a big old crazy set of things to have
carry in your head and all the new
features is the ability to connect to a
smartphone by an MHL cable which hooks
up to the battery pack which in turn can
then transfer any HD video or anything
else you have on your phone over to the
headset so as usual for Sony
it's a massive headset it's not all that
comfortable actually the company
you might want to push this with
together with its PlayStation and the
PlayStation 4 for gaming purposes
however I'm not all that encouraged and
one of the reasons for it is also the
price here in Europe is going to cost
$12.99 it releases on October I believe
it's something like a hundred thousand
yen in Japan as well same release date
sony says they'll be a global release
you you'll probably be able to get it
from the Sony store but I would advise
trying it on first just to get a feel of
how big chunky and overwhelming this
thing can be so that's it Sony's latest
head mounted display here at E for 2013
