I am NOT the guy who usually does this
introduction greetings mobile
accomplishes i am glad sabbath this is
episode 65 of the verge babu show and
i'll let everybody else introduce
themselves wow I'm dieter bohn i'm dan
seifert i'm chris sigler and we are we
are so very fortunate to be joined by an
esteemed industry colleague a former
direct colleague of Vlad's and mine and
just an overall wonderful human being
miriam jar of pebble hey hey is it going
everyone welcome the intro Chris I was
really awesome I I do what I can I do
what I can I look I had to make up for
that flub by Vlad I had to do something
when in Vlad's defense we actually had
to we are without our amazing producer
Evan and so we're kind of flying by the
seat of our pants here and buttons that
some of us should have aren't showing up
we're all very confused and lost and it
put me in charge of the controls I mean
it was completing advisable but what can
you do and so then we just can't take a
patent to dieter line and make it your
own he throws us I have you can't patent
a line you get copyrighted I actually I
tell you guys I got permission to use
that line just just in case did you I
did well you know it's the thing i said
back since trio central and so you know
it was the thing I sure they're so it's
sooo freakin line isn't it greetings
mobile copters welcome Miriam so we're
here to talk about pebble for an hour
and a half right right of course well
actually I'm on my lunch break right now
so you know you caught me at the right
time before the show is over we are
going to our goal on this show our only
goal is to press Miriam into giving up
the goods on pebbles future plans yeah
well no I want to know when are we gonna
see the sweet Iowa 7 juice yes um that's
actually next up this is the biggest
priority right now so stay tuned it's
coming very soon all right
well I mean technical purple already has
the perfect iOS 7 design because
everything is flat there's like nothing
freely about it it's true it's so simple
monochromatic flat I think I don't think
that was dealer was talking about
frankly blood are you with us I am with
you I've just had a very very long day
I've had kind of an HTC One max sighs
there you go buy the HTC One taken to
the max yes have you max out how did
that happen I mean tell me one good
thing about this phone it has great
better than one battery low the screen
is actually really nice just far too
large yeah I'm sure it is yeah I mean
you can tick look at it look at that
thing Miriam do you have a regular sized
one yeah that's what i call them one
medium now cuz we now go here is the
google play edition one ready look at
that size different hang on hang on hang
on I'm lining them up can we see this I
don't know why yeah yeah they can see
that it's pretty absurd so you're so
Nikolas like I have given up on
complaining about big screen phones like
the the Galaxy Note has convinced me
that yes there's a market for this and
if you do something interesting it's
cool when LG makes their giant phones
like whatever its LG just go make your 4
by 3 aspect ratio stuff I'm not just not
gonna worry about it but HTC like come
on guys I thought that you were better
than this I thought that you knew
exactly what it was your doing and no
you don't it's kind of a terrible mish
mish mash of things this fall well I
mean I credit where credit's due like
HTC recognize the need to have like a
multi size portfolio and they they kind
of heard the call for you know a small
flagship a medium-sized flagship and a
large flagship all in in the lineup and
so you know Vlad I know you like the
mini right
that was a question for you I have not
seven be okay second i love the meeting
I love ya any Union fact and I got to
tell you having to review the one max
and then going back to the one makes you
appreciate the size and lightness of the
one so much more mmm so that's maybe one
of the best impacts of the one max is it
makes you appreciate the other devices
and how could those designs are so you
would take you would take a galaxy note
3 over a max yes any day of the week yes
and I'm not a sense on person hmm but
well actually if I can pull us back a
little bit actually like Jesus question
which was tell us something good about
the one max because it's so easy to talk
about the bad things and everybody's
going to you know tear it to pieces that
things are easy it's way too heavy way
too awkward it just doesn't make sense
in any sort of ergonomic way but the
good things whether this as many of them
so the display is still very good it's
still super OCD the battery life all of
us should be reviewing this device we
should be in comparing notes and
everybody just wowed by it it's
phenomenal extremely long better life
but then you know is that big you can
fit a big-ass battery in it so it kind
of makes sense and it was a third part
kind of issue for carcass it's a
boomsound speakers i've got to say i
have a bluetooth speaker in my kitchen
which i usually whatever phone i'm using
hook it up to it to the radio I don't
need that with the one max or even with
the one those boomsound speakers are
just really good it's like the best
because you can get on any mobile device
so those are the good things yeah also
expandable storage microSD that's a good
thing um arguably the speakers I agree
the display I agree the camera is decent
but they unfortunately completely
destroyed it by omitting i/o is which
look if you're gonna have a 4 megapixel
camera and you're willing to sacrifice
on some detail at least you know
compensate for all civil i experienced
by having oh I
and that's what the one did but on the
mini and the butterfly ass and the max
they remove that and I don't understand
what's the adventures of ultrapixels
when you don't have a weii ass I mean it
gathers a little bit more like big deal
the 8-megapixel 1x and DNA camera was
good enough already I I can understand
it with the mini because it's a lower
price point camera or phone and maybe
it's a smaller size and their size
issues there I don't understand it at
all why it was omitted from the one max
but here's a butterfly ass now I mean
the one max is a very confusing device
is something that is the HTC is this
your new flex your phone and they were
like what do you consider a flagship and
they were going to do so metaphysical
conversation about what your flagship is
it's like okay well your head about the
stage where your current flag should be
started to grow a bit tired you want to
replace it with something but then you
go with a device that is so much bigger
it doesn't really fit into a smartphone
category but then you also upgrade it in
some respects and then don't in other so
things like optical image stabilization
is missing but then you put the
fingerprint sensor on this you put your
latest sense 5.5 software on this it's
like I mean what are you doing I am
Brady's new unit yes okay so the thing
that I mean the fingerprint sensor first
of all that's it like they it's terrible
very poor implementation but here's the
problem i have with the HTC max we
learned how many years ago seven years
ago at least maybe more if you want to
give almost some credit that you can't
just take and I bet you do dieter little
you can't just take we learned you can't
take a giant desktop operating system
interface and shrink it down and stick
it out of phone you look at the early
versions of pocket pc and windows mobile
like really start menu I that come on
like you can't take a giant desktop
interface and put it on a phone and so
now the max is the perfect example of
going with the same problem in the other
direction you can't just take a regular
smartphone interface and blow it up to
you know six and a half inches or
whatever whatever the hell size are like
you need to think about what a device of
this size should have foreign interface
that's in between
a tablet and a smartphone and the reason
that the galaxy note and note 3 managed
this a little bit better is they have a
stylist and so they have a sense of
using it in a sort of a tablet e way and
yeah they need to go further they need
to think through those you I things more
but as far as I can tell HTC hasn't
thought at all about the era nomics of
either the software and not enough about
the device itself although they did
finally put the power button in the
right place um and but they just they
just made a big phone and like that's
you can't just make a little desktop you
can't just make a big phone anymore
you've got to think more about what it
how it should work and what it should
look like well Joe I take exception to
that I have to correct you a big phone
is the samsung galaxy s4 this is a big
vote right I can put it in front of my
face you can still see parts of my face
yeah one max I put it in front it's like
this it's not a big phone its massive
its massive is anything the displays
actually five point nine inches on this
thing but then dieter is right it kind
of feels like as a six and a half inch
display because of the fact that has a
bunch of bezel and I mean it isn't
really officially designed at all I mean
the 6.4 inch xperia z ultra is we made
as still as possible and it actually
feels like a fundamentally different
device whereas HTC have literally
inflated every dimension of respect so
weights has been inflated thickness
width height everything and this is what
problem got is really it doesn't work
like the you know the note 3 has a lot
more screen to surface area like a
better ratio right and if you put it
next to the max that's it's amazing the
size difference considering is only
point 2 inches difference in screen size
it's kind of it's like comparing the g2
with a 5.2 inch screen to the the one
the regular one right there the same
physical size more or less phone wise
but one is completely covered in
displaying well the other one isn't and
and to me that's that's the future I
think that and they've missed the boat
there on that but here's the other thing
that kind of bugs me about the what the
one
except one of the things that the HTC
one was so awesome about is that
machined fit and finish the fact that
they molded the plastic inside the metal
and machine the whole thing as one so
the seams were perfectly seamless
basically between the materials this
because it has a removable back cover
it's all seams in and you know you can
feel the where the metal ends and the
plastic begins it doesn't feel as
luxurious and as well made so you've
lost kind of the advantage of having a
phone made out of metal almost because
it's just it just doesn't feel as well
made so at that point you know I think
the again I've been sioned the butterfly
ass a few times if the butterfly has had
a slightly bigger screen had oh is it
has a faster cpu it's got a 1.9
gigahertz Snapdragon 600 versus 1.7 to
me that and it has micro SD to me that
would be that would be a better choice
you know so I don't know I don't know
what they were thinking again it's just
to me it's a too much of a good thing
it's not a good thing what I get I
totally get the need I mean again going
back to like I totally appreciate the
spirit of what HTC is trying to do by
taking like a single great ID and
turning it into an entire portfolio form
factor so you can just say well I know I
want I know I really like what HTC is
doing with ID in with their you with
their UX and whatever I just need to
pick the size that's right for me the
problem is that they can quite execute
on that correctly right but like that
the spirit of what they're trying to do
is there and it's a good thing like
being able to to say I want a great
phone I just want to choose the size
instead of being or having to say why I
want the best phone so it needs to be
4.5 or 4.75 inches they having that
entire line is a great way to go I think
that's true but well sometimes don't
scale well and this didn't scale well I
would like it better if it had been made
in solid gold god that thing is a
monstrosity I don't know glad me read
you guys got to see that that monster I
got to touch that thing and go to touch
it it's wrong
now you know the gold live phone feels
okay right like you've seen it it looks
it's not tacky it's that goal it's gold
champagne it's a blast don't call it
champagne the champagne peoples are
going to sue you for calling you
champagne now don't call you a sparkly
bubbly wine made in France yeah also I
mean my boy life is also gonna get mad
if you call it champagne let's sure Lulu
champagne the gold HTC one is really
over the top and it scratches really
easily well so it's like a 24 karat gold
plating is easy Oh 18 yeah that's no
pretty soft but it's it's been finished
with some kind of coating to prevent
scuffing or whatever but I don't think
that really worked one we saw was
already beat up oh you start beat up
they only make it like what is it four
or five of these 18 karat gold plated
HTC one's to celebrate some music awards
here in the UK but i'm pretty sure the
flesh of my camera scratched the surface
the photons did damage yeah haha yes is
it is it considerably heavier than a
normal one or i mean it's it's just
plating right so it's not like solid
gold or anything I i would consider
buying a solid gold HTC one just for the
novelty of it you know like a
hundred-thousand-dollar HTC one that was
just pure gold that might be down I
wouldn't use it I would just you know
keep it in its velvet box you'd wear it
around your neck I quick lead we're a
second ninety thousand dollar hc1
kristas are interested but as soon as
again six vegas he's like okay then i
made a market for this yeah yeah we're
talking yeah yeah so i guess we should
round out the aged I mean I have nothing
else to say about a gold wait wait wait
I had a great I had a great I had a
great transition that I will reuse do it
um so you were talking about like we get
credit for transitions that we call out
before the transition oh yeah so we
don't get credit if others don't
interrupt
stealing somebody else's transition uh
glad you'll be rich and i will be almost
as rude I hate all of you guys I think
my transition was that word you were
talking about how like the the 1x the
the one max is it one x max for one max
mon- okay with a lowercase M you were
talking about yes with lowercase F what
I was how the one the one max doesn't do
a good job of scaling up to that screen
size however something that is
attempting to scale up to a bigger
screen size is Windows Phone 8 Update 3
i'm going to talk about the Amazon HTC
hook up first look that's not Chris I'm
looking at our topic list dude what do
you want me to do I rearranged it no you
didn't i see HTC a man i see windows
phone yeah but we this is the worst
transition i hate you guys I don't care
anymore oh dude they put me in charge of
the red button so quickly sis we go okay
the patients have taken over the asylum
now that was very good that was a very
good transitive we don't HTC maybe he's
working with Amazon our phone who knows
we'll worry about that later but ya know
so what do we think of this update 3
like I am feeling kind of like renowned
like is it the way I feel about it is it
is there's there's nothing significant
for existing users and it's all for the
new it's all for new users is everything
that's involved with this update as far
as I'm concerned and with user facing
features uh which is like you know
Microsoft needs to do that because it
needs more new users but it kind of
sucks for all the people that have been
waiting for features for a long time and
then Microsoft's like here you go you
can lock the rotation of the screen now
update 3 good onya yeah I mean it's just
like so does it's like it's almost
depressing like at how little I think
there's like two major new user facing
features if you have like a 925 or 920
or whatever you can lock the screen
rotation and you can now close apps from
the multitasking
function you had a lycra user ringtones
can we swear on this show in moderation
all I have to say about the update is
whoop de doo yeah that's
appropriate uh-uh he's like where's my
notification center yeah that's a lot
yeah but but that would be if they were
doing that that wouldn't be like an
update three two windows phone 8 right
that would be 8.1 or nine or sign so
he'll be like Windows Phone 10 how long
since eight came out I left you remember
yeah over a year so like we need to see
a one pretty soon I mean we rag on
Windows Phone a lot but it's always from
a like a place of they not love and
secretly hoping they're not even secret
like hoping that they'll get their app
situation figured out and we can like
really like get behind this platform in
a real way and it's like well they just
can't get there but I'm like I'm
starting to lose that like faith that
trust in the platform like the core
platform like Microsoft needs to like
add stuff to this and and and not just
like put out a you know another update
that just gets it ready for nokia to
kick out a giant ass phone like that's
what that's the real purpose of this
thing right right I'd like to make a
proper the proposed something a
Microsoft is that they need to call the
next version of Windows Phone Windows
Phone X because 10 no because Xbox thank
all the windows found metro that's what
they need to do just pony up and pay
villa I was trying to make a joke Teeter
I'm sorry I'm the derailleur today
that's okay we love you too bye um so
what do you think you think it's almost
not the thing that users can't see yet
because there's nothing that supports
yeah but yeah I mean like Peter said
Windows Phone 8 release update 3 or
whatever they're calling it now now
let's now supports 1080p displays larger
displays with three columns of data and
new processors but nobody can take
advantage of those yet until nokia kicks
out a big ass phone which they will next
week I in Abu Dhabi right she's just
largely expected to happen next week and
a tablet yeah which won't be running
Windows Phone 8 like that's another
question that they need to answer right
like
how are they going to merge they can't
continue forever pretending that Windows
Phone and Windows are separate platforms
particularly now that windows phone is
on the NT kernel they need to like push
RT and Windows Phone together and and
maybe the reorganization that Ballmer
put into place a few months ago this is
the you know the final step in making
that a reality but we're not there yet
so that's still like a really confusing
message for for customers I think so
maybe that's the reason to be optimistic
here crisis you know from our outsider
perspective it kind of seems like when
the small development is happening
slowly but maybe they're doing exactly
that they're bridging the gap there
putting things together pretty things in
place so that arm-based windows devices
and windows phones over on the same OS
same software and all other stuff
basically is who come together behind
the scenes before they just unleash it
on the world and take over and kinkos
was asked your tells me I don't want
column delays but if these like these
long waits are to them genuinely and
actually doing that as opposed to like
you know talking about how other stuff
integrates and how there's synchronicity
between them but not actually like
having it just be simple and
straightforward for developers and users
that you buy one on one thing it's on
the other platforms and it's all the
same they're actually getting to that
vision that we've been talking about
with Microsoft for god I don't know how
long forever then for a I am super happy
to have update 3 and wait for the grand
plan but I think the theme of today's
mobile show is pessimism and hate and
sadness and so I know I did have of just
just this feature is the book what's
your butt well the butt is the thing
that you guys mentioned this is in
preparation for not kicking out the big
ass Windows Phone nobody else is working
a big ass windows phone does anybody
else really even working on a windows
phone I mean how Samsung and HTC won't
even comment on on the fact that
Microsoft is buying Nokia and it's like
I mean why bother at this point I mean I
I know I was a ZTE or Huawei they
release some sort of windows phones in
China but and also thanks maybe series
here's what what might my take is I
think whatever that device is that we've
been seeing floating around the 15 20 or
whatever so it is 50 look yeah that's
what all the rumors honey I've been
saying I bet you that thing has a six
inch display and is better implemented
and more sexy than you HTC one max and
that's what saddens me about the whole
thing because you know that the u.s. is
just not gonna live up to it well yeah I
mean you mean you mean that the actual
hardware design will be nice yeah yeah
yeah yeah because like you know uh
unless unless no key does something
really crazy what we expect to see based
on these uh update 3 is just like a
bigger a bigger windows phone 8 with
more tiles on the screen so it's like
yeah from what I from what I think I
think we're going to see something like
the 625 I stretched bigger basically and
while I said that's pretty generic
design is actually pretty attractive
design my opinion I mean it's that's the
one that matches your glasses right do
you really think that that Metro works
at that size I mean it works on a tablet
size and then they added more tiles like
inside the apps like the actual app
experience of the big type and
everything they've made a lot of changes
in a bunch of little apps to do that but
I've I'm you know there's a lot of
corners that they've got a hit a lot of
eyes they've got a dot and T's they got
across to make it so it doesn't feel
expansive weird well considering how
slow it's been for the apps to it to
adapt new adopt new features and Windows
Phone like the Twitter and Facebook apps
are barely good enough now and for a
while we're terrible act than the native
the default clients right so I don't
have high hopes about these apps looking
anything like more than just scaled
versions really at that point at this
point on these big phones you know so
it's I don't know why I think that's
definitely something you bring up a good
point which is the you bring you brought
it up earlier with the HTC One max which
is like you know HTC didn't do anything
to optimize for that screen size and
with their software and I don't really
think windows is going to do anything
except for maybe the home screen you
know
the TAS right we know they're gonna do
some stuff in inside apps so like in
that and the Xbox music app they can fit
more stuff in there and like in other
apps are good but that's their own apps
what about third party apps that's
that's the big question like you know
the popular third-party apps well that
that maybe gets to the fact that they're
they're giving developers early access
to well Matt early access but like on
time access to the updates so they don't
have to wait for carriers to roll roll
it out which is nice and it's kind of
like a backdoor for any power user not
just developers because it's it's free
you can go sign up for it and then just
download it to your phone voids the
warranty but hey you know I I know that
if I were using Windows Phone I'd be
doing it Yolo yeah Chris you really need
that rotation lock and individual
ringtones well but but I mean come on
it's not just about this update though
right like presumably this is something
they're gonna be doing going forward and
they mentioned that I know if there's
every reason to believe that like in the
future they might be doing like beta is
not just like final version yeah right
it's a good present and Google do this
as well when google announces a new
android version it releases the source
code like almost immediately and people
can load it on their phone whether their
photo they can't come nerds can no I do
this I'm gonna work Microsoft like this
is a bigger deal than apple's beta
program because cheaper and and like
that's cool and it's a bigger deal of
what android does with source code
because like you can't can't you got to
wait for somebody to build a rom for you
unless you're a super nerd um yeah it's
like a curry our absolute somebody both
robin like three hours yeah and it's
buggy and terrible because you have no
idea if it's actually a work on your
phone and you need to be rooted and blah
blah blah like this I don't think it's
going to be a massive revolution and
carriers pushing stuff out but I do
think that a lot of regular people are
going to find a way to like oh if I
could just do this thing and get update
I'm going to do it think you think of
how long plate think of how long 920
users had to wait for GD dr to write
like this
yeah got 18 listed on ATT I'm talking
about yeah biggest show with OS updates
for Microsoft is just like people
complain about waiting for them right
right one of the that's one of the
problems they like the people that are
most likely to complain while waiting
for a nose OS update are the people are
most likely to install this thing early
and so like all of a sudden like in one
fell swoop Microsoft may have like
stopped most of the complaining about
waiting for carriers to approve their OS
updates and yea big when even if even if
it's a tiny percentage of their user
base right I think Chris is just trying
to say that he's secretly a major
windows phone user look I I want to come
on Chris pull out the 1020 that's in
your pocket I've got one right here well
you know nokia i was so sad no key maybe
said send back the 1020 i had me made
you send it back yeah they were
insistent that I return there in Chicago
they sent somebody to his house knocked
out as a hchildress noogler you can just
be like Shah look I well it was it was
actually really cool because they did a
special 1020 launched at the ATT
flagship store in Chicago and some nokia
folks were out there and i just went
down there and picked one up and then a
couple weeks later they were like hey we
need our tent or ii back um but uh all
kidding aside and I've said this on many
many occasions I would absolutely be
I've tried on multiple occasions to be a
serious windows phone user and I would
be a serious windows phone user uh if it
if it were you know if they would just
closed a few like huge gaps the biggest
gap being on email and I don't know a
lot of this stuff isn't really their
fault because they have these spats with
Google that are ongoing and I'm so
heavily invested in the Google ecosystem
both personally and you know with our
work stuff so it's very difficult for
someone in my position to take Windows
Phone seriously it's just it's hard to
do yeah for someone in any position yeah
yeah I mean yeah if you're if you're in
exchange if you live in exchange and you
love outlook you know windows phone is
obviously the best option for you for
email and calendar and contacts and
stuff like that the problem is that the
average consumer doesn't live in
exchange maybe their employer uses the
iphone does a pretty decent job with
exchange it doesn't
job but I think you can do more with
windows home yeah okay um I was just
going to point out very briefly I think
because I've got the red button here
broadcast have a hangout is whatever I'm
seeing on my side yeah so just make sure
that you don't click on faces because
then it gets stuck in those faces
because because my face did dominate the
first minute and a half whatever it was
that's it anyhow you wanted to add you
go yes that is some wise in those tiny
little boxes under my face but yeah I
think the connections come back and
improve but for a little while they're
at least of my computer there was a
hilarious lag between the video and what
you guys are saying so because you live
in the UK were 3gs about like pop point
five megabits as a last show that we did
but the last show that we did Vlad's
power went out or something so he went
out to the street and used his phone and
was on the show from the from his
phone it was crazy how it was gigantic
c-note free credit where credit's t-that
was and then I I was worried that he was
gonna get mugged and then he pointed out
that he was the most dangerous person on
the street so we're he was fine about
that technically I was also the only
person in the street so yes that was
that was accurate so speaking of
disappointingly minor wait can I
interrupt your transition meeting here I
just wanna I just wanted to turn out
like I could have like finished that
transition like that but I drug it out
because I knew that somebody would want
to interrupt me so you're welcome a
planted interruption opportunity I say
yeah yeah speaking of disappointing OS
updates KitKat looks completely boring
to me so in the leaks I am I do I just
need more hope in my life Nemo hope you
just well I did look I still think and I
mentioned this on a recent show if i
remember correctly i still think that
the that the the ux that was introduced
in ICS looks and feels modern and fresh
like really
what's happened is Google Apple and
Microsoft are all on the same page
regarding stuff being completely 2d and
flat and shadow free and so we're in
this sort of state of you know I don't
want called stasis but like where
everybody is on the exact same page
regarding how apps should look and feel
and and so I think for that reason I
that that design language doesn't feel
stale yet and so I'm okay with the
design being the same but there are some
basic features that Android is lagging
on at this point most notably in my
opinion ble which is becoming
increasingly important and Miriam I know
that's near and dear to your heart being
a pebble yeah it's been spinning a
challenge for us that you know there's
no standardization yet in android
obviously the sooner the better right
for everyone yeah but so so ble is
rumored for KitKat or am I crazy wait
you like it well I think it is soo came
in android 4.4 point 3 ah specific
devices only so device specific thing
it's not an OS specific thing as far as
I know man yeah just just to say ble
meez bluetooth low energy which is the
real stuff is the stuff that you would
write it is the good stuff yes um so
okay I mean we're gonna see like a new
dialer a brand new dialer we're gonna
see there's going to be some new weight
of handling default SMS app which means
we're gonna have SMS integrated into
hangouts but then you can change it out
easily I guess I'm sure that then
hopefully more google voice integration
will come along with that i guess maybe
snapshot integration we're gonna see
Miss bidding I think isn't google now
gonna be like like the leftmost
homescreen didn't i see some rumors
about that the new home screen
experience a google experience sadly so
terrible no well so here's the deal it's
like getting to getting to google now
from like a non nexus phone is oh my god
oh my god my motorola x is listening to
me right now because it heard me say
google now that's they'll teach you for
using a moto x theater seriously what is
wrong with you anyway where was I going
Oh still it's a pain to get at it from
an odd
sis phone but if you just can swipe over
from the home screen that maybe we'll
make more people yeah but again once
they start skinning right one samsung
and HTC and LG start skinning or more
like you're not going to get that right
I'm betting that the Google Experience
launcher is going to be available in
Google Play that would be ah that would
be a pretty damn awesome that way this
was somebody picked apart something
somewhere and I apologize deeply to the
Android site that was a leaking this
stuff but that is I'm guessing that's
the whole of kit but guys and I'm like I
don't care you know this brings on a
good point though is that to me it looks
like Google's trying to make Android
more and more modular I mean well Google
Play services thing right it was a huge
like such a great back door for them to
upgrade stuff behind people's back in a
great way so by passing the carriers and
the manufacturers this is kind of cool
like how they like made the keyboard
available now they want to make the
launcher available I'm all for it so if
you got by the way news 10 that yeah you
went out the first search result is for
from this song is on my god oh my god
which is what google now search for me
it's not sounded go and I was going to
say if you go to google.com / android
and they've got that nice new website
that goes through the history of all the
versions of Android and you go all the
way down to the bottom that 4.4 kitkat
the the one line that it says about Kit
Kat is that they want to bring Android
to everyone or make it available for
everyone or something silly insane like
that right um which would perfectly line
up with what we're saying here if you
know the launcher becomes something that
you can just download in the Play Store
just like the count the calendar and the
keyboard and all these others then you
know everybody can no matter what phone
they have get pretty much a uniform
experience if they want it so that's
cool and then and you know maybe they'll
people will stop I don't that solves our
upgrade problem completely I guess it
solves it enough whoa I mean oh yeah is
there an upgrade program anymore but i
feel like the upgrade problem nowadays
is our expectation and what we
anticipate they will get from these
things should just have one nice things
no no no I think things are growing a
little more incremental and a lot less
noticeable nowadays a great example for
me actually was the aforementioned HTC
One I dug that out I hadn't turned it on
since I think it was April whatever it
was shame on you Vlad her i'm a terrible
human being to all android devices but
what i noticed it had yo gmail client
before the update and and I was like
whoa this looks wrong and I can't see
all my labels properly they kind of
constricted and then I updated it to the
latest you go plan it was like ah this
was right this was good you know and
these changes you don't really notice
them because it's like it's like a
random Thursday and oh this GMO updater
looks nicer okay I'm moving on with my
life I'm getting on with it you kind of
go from a the let's say great for gmail
to grade 5 gmail but then you never go
back to check how much of an upgrade you
got you know and this was the experience
with me and I noticed it and I feel like
you know Gmail keeps evolving the giro
up the maps app keeps evolving oh these
things keep improving and Google isn't
really holding things back for
standalone events where it's going to
like blow our minds with it I think
perhaps iOS with the i/o I was seven big
redesign is like the biggest milestone
software changed on the scene but
otherwise but we really need to kind of
free Alana expectations for is sort of
thing we're seeing we're going to spoil
an Android these are maturing platforms
which adding features as they go along
and I think it kind of makes sense like
if you have something done in February
you're not going to wait until you're
big you know keynote event in May to
unleash it or to reveal it if you can
actually push it out as an app update or
whatever it is right all right I'm just
asking too much and I listen the most
exciting thing with KitKat for me is all
might be the nexus 5 because i love the
g2's display well it's not gonna be the
same size of Vlad it's pretty much clear
there's going to be a 5-inch instead of
a 5.2 which is fighter she's ok but it
might not be the same grade remember the
Nexus has got to be affordable and I'm
concerned
perhaps you're going to cut some corners
in terms of quality like last year the
nexus for the camera wasn't as good as
the the optimus G right so I'm excited
about what I'm seeing but I'm concerned
that we're gonna they're gonna cut
corners in some way but why you're
caught in the corners in the battery as
far as we could tell ouch what white
white does the Nexus have to be
affordable why can't they do why can't
they do a true flake ship like I I
totally I mean done me wrong when the
nexus 4 came out like the pricing blew
everybody's minds and I think that it's
sold very well because it or not very
well buts so better than it would have
had it been priced differently but very
good for LG too yeah but you figure I
mean this is google why can't they have
multiple Nexus phones and multiply mean
maybe what they're thinking is they want
the nexus to lead on price and then they
save the you know that the flagship
experience for the GPE devices maybe
yeah I mean I'm very excited about the
nexus 5 I really can't wait to get one I
think what I've seen from the camera
specs the the mems-based autofocus the
fact that supposedly as is which I
thought they would throw out for cost
reasons uh the g2i is one of my favorite
cameras right now um it's not very
consistent but when it does work well
it's very good um and and you know I
really can't wait I think even if it's a
slightly scale down screen with a
different camera I mean it hopefully
they retain the essence what made the g2
great and hopefully that smaller battery
is not a deal-breaker because on the
nexus 4 it certainly is a pretty
challenging to get a day out of that
phone so we'll see right yeah it's very
weird to me that motorola is still the
only company that is taking a big
battery phones seriously I mean of
course there's the notary and there's no
31 mess but I the butterfly ass too it's
really good a better life why you know
I'm talking about like a four to five
inch class device that has an
unapologetically giant battery yeah that
sacrifice is a little bit of thickness
like I every company should have this
option like I'm so tired of owning
devices where I have genuine fear that
i'm not going to be able to make it from
you know
6 30 or seven a.m. to eight or nine pm
honest thing in fact you can't make it
that long at a single charge underneath
us that I that I am so sorry I'm just
venting I have no point no it's a very
fair point it's in 41 what's your
experience been with the g2 collectively
so far uh so the battery life on the g2
when I read it was phenomenal it was for
me to the best battery life I'd seen on
an android phone this year and so when I
reviewed it I obviously gave a very high
scores for that and then when these
Nexus 5 specs started leaking out and
things like that and the battery is
significantly smaller recording price
charts that gave me a real pause for
concern because you know like you
mentioned the nexus 4 really didn't have
great battery life it had actually in my
experience a terrible battery life it
would die in like six to eight hours for
me yeah um and so with this not having
the same size battery as the g2 I'm just
concerned that the battery life is but
my point was that you know Chris they
like the g2 is an example of a phone
that's thin and not doesn't have like a
special option of a larger battery and
you know delivers the goods in terms of
both battery performance and like mm
Jews is a 5.2 inch display like it's a
big phone like there's I mean it's not
like like if I could get a moto x with a
3,000 milliamp hour battery that's
slightly thicker than the normal Moto X
i would buy that over g2 at heart
because i could use it in one hand yeah
right right well to me it doesn't matter
because the g2 is the same size than HTC
One and to me that's fine or the gs4 for
that matter that's kind of really i
really like the the size of the Moto X
actually is for you know ease of use i
love my one I you know I own one I think
the design is phenomenal it looks great
and things like that but uh but it's a
bit too big for you huh it's a bit too
big yeah cool they just have me
questioning actually with the existence
of the Moto X Y google is too going
along and having energy build the Nexus
devices but I guess it goes to
because he goes with LG's credit and to
those guys you know technical acumen i
think i think LG's reputation is long
established reputation and the one that
sounds like we're working to shake off
is you know of being the random korean
supplier of you know washing machines as
such things try and sounded promise
nowadays hey man don't they have the
blast chiller or is that seems like the
blast that that's all g I think the
blast chiller you know the beer in like
three minutes you're right flat except
that remember there was that big dust-up
between Google and there was there was a
he said she said situation on the Nexus
4 um was like his februari or march of
this year were like the two companies
seem to be at each other's throats and
so I was actually as soon as I saw that
happen as like welp there goes LGDs
changes that to ever make a Nexus device
again but like I was like really
surprised to see it go this way i do get
that sense that there is a bit of
tension between them yes yes but i mean
just to bring it back to my thinking on
this something is it's just that LG I
don't know maybe in Europe it never had
the same sort of down and dirty breaking
bad reputation like every burner
Breaking Bad is an OG phone it seems
like actually they have samsung flip
phones um and and so just it's like
every time I see Walt talking on the
phone it's that like it was just a
really basic sampling flown that was
like free on contract for three years in
a row and there's a there's an iphone
there's an iphone in a hello kitty case
in the last season yeah well the thing
that the 15 LG was popular in the US let
is because verizon and LG were like best
buddies in the investigating the
shittiest spoons never they would make
things like the envy and the voyager and
at this time verizon didn't have the
iphone and this was back in like 2006 to
like 2009 when verizon was selling
messaging phones hand over fist and LG
made almost if not every single one of
them and they were these qwerty devices
and they sold like hotcakes
and so that's where LG's cachet I guess
in the u.s. came from and then when
smartphones came around and verizon
finally got the droid and finally got
the iphone it kind of like was like
alright that's cool see you later LG uh
and LG's never really had the same level
of popularity and sales with smartphones
in the US as it did with its messaging
dan the original LG prada come on bro
could you buy that on the US carrier no
no yes it was a LG view on AT&amp;amp;T it was
cheap and and turned into the LG view
but now movie but yeah but not the vu ii
no not the optimist view not the not
just the view remember guy and remember
yes I never that yeah and it had media
flow right that's right had media flow
Qualcomm's TV thing with a retractable
antenna was the shittiest thing you know
I actually have one floating around
because one time at Bernie man a couple
of years back we were cleaning the cafe
and i found this LG vue 18t like buried
in the dust and i pulled it out and it
still worked like i just had to find a
charger for it which is pi by i bet the
media flow didn't work the media
floating word and the sink art of course
the sim card had been deactivated but i
was like oh my God look at that blast
from the past but I was gonna say about
LG you know the thing to keep in mind
about LG is that they sell last I'd
heard I think it was a year ago so might
have changed since then but about a year
ago they were selling more LG phones in
Korea than samsung phones well like
they're there like if you think LG is
not isn't LG knows how to do phones like
it's just that we just don't get wait
until in the Nexus we didn't really get
the good ones here you know yeah but in
in China they're selling wares eet EEZ
than you know I mean like I don't know
and well Chris is really saying is that
people outside of the USA don't have
taste so they don't count Wow yeah I was
trying to say in a more and more you
know politically correct way but yes
speaking of to the boat wait wait oh I
got it no I lost it no I just had cut to
the Bowman who could have used that as a
pun is like cut to the deets a bone but
anyway okay it's gone now it's good but
you make a transition i've got a good
role is it to the galaxy round and or
the g flex no it was but thank you no
that's ok there is a serious point to be
made here which is that while we still
sit in this kind of perception of
samsung and LG as these followers and
these guys who are trying to emulate the
big dogs what we're actually finding and
experiencing is that the new technical
innovation is kind of emoji and Samson
like honestly Samson in energy of the
new leaders they are the guys who used
to be Sony Panasonic back in there I
don't think you can lose his mind quiet
Chris needs to talk this is going to be
amazing if Samsung made a pentagon shape
phone would you say I mean they're
they're leading they're they're out
there innovating this is not wave Asia
if you know Chris that is rejected I
understand your argument I don't think
like lay it out fully because everybody
agrees with you that's fine but it's
completely wrong it's just right because
here's the thing the guy who won the
Nobel Prize for science oh my god okay
the hit Peter Higgs the guy who
predicted some 50 years ago the the
existence of the Higgs boson particle
right when he commented on it he said
it's a recognition and appreciation for
blue sky research and you know Neil
deGrasse Tyson as being extremely
eloquent telling people let's do the
research let's do some science ya know I
know some new things that we can do or
vomit can find our operations for them
we're all about research for recert like
pure research IKR science center k
german by the way six month anniversary
of verge science congratulations she
just went to the Institute for Advanced
Studies at Princeton and like hung out
with people that were like doing pure
research and it's amazing but to like
connect that up to like Samsung making
insane consumer products I don't know
like that sounds like yeah you're giving
away too much credit widows but but
let's let's break it down a little bit I
mean Samsung yes Samsung probably out
getting too much credit because they're
not really doing that much unique
damaging to wake unique stuff they
really take on the go sign up free kind
of punched it into the middle and a
there's a curve that way would but you
know if you look at the LG G flex and
it's cause you that's going into that
that's curved more like a regular phone
like a landline phone it's gonna be
awesome in your pant pocket can't wait
to put that in my pocket it's all right
6 inches it was going to be
uncomfortable anyway if you can put it
on your back pocket that would actually
be pretty fly you know just wraps oh you
put in your fly up so that's that fool
is just that guys I just outside to
remind you I have the red button today
so and just to mention LG has already
announced a curve battery I know but
that thing go into G flex oh you don't
say no no I'm not saying like yeah but
like the renders that we see the thing
is like it's like ridiculously curve yes
it's like a banana it's ridiculous ring
ring ring you're gonna sit on it and
crack it in half the instant you do that
no it's so well what I was saying oh I
went on a mini twitter rant about this
last night and i'll say this much i
think this vol people right of all
people i think the i think that these
curved displays are very important
stepping stone to flexible devices which
i think we can all agree hold promise
for a variety of interesting reasons for
these devices specifically are not
something you would ever want a regular
consumer to buy and that's why Vlad I
reject what you were saying about like
you know this is like this awesome blue
sky researcher has parallels to it
because Samsung and LG are actually
going to ask consumers to spend real
money for these fake products so fake is
the wrong word here's the but like bad
idea products which everybody knows are
bad idea products and the most concrete
evidence of that is the fact that these
two phones are curved different ways the
canonization forests I mean
I was right back if I if I had the
ability I would go and find our
commentary on the original Galaxy Note
and what we thought of it and put it on
exactly how because we would have been
calling it ridiculous we did we're like
nobody wants it came out wrong so like
maybe Samsung's not totally crazy and
LG's not totally crazy just throw a
whole bunch of crap out there and if it
doesn't sell whatever and if it does
like surprise we you know like at for
every ten Continuum's there's one note
and maybe that ratio works for them but
but eater you could say the same thing
about the galaxy gear and we all know
how well that turned out yeah but we
don't know if it's sold but it's like
legitimately a bad problem here here's
the thing about the note with the note
even though we may have thought it was a
bad product you can make like you can
very easily grok what the use cases for
a big screen with it with the galaxy
round I cannot tell you what the purpose
is of a screen that's curved that way
samsung will tell you or chris you could
tilt it and then and then the screen
will light up and tell you your
notifications rot it what's what's their
turn port round interaction which is
like the best me for something that's
even better than s or like a what is
there I thing called smart stay right
yeah yeah I like LG's widescreen better
cuz let the dats why just wanna know is
not gone well how the big war between LG
and Samsung is going to get Chuck Norris
for the commercial and do a make a
roundhouse kick joke cuz that's gonna
happen they might definitely are we
gonna air Korea yeah yeah I would just
like to point out here that piece of
software that Samsung is trying to
introduce it like revolutionary the fact
that you can tilt it you don't actually
need a curve display for that you should
see the curve back yeah yeah you have an
accelerant on your phone you have a coat
back you do that you can do the exact
same too so I mean I do with the motor
works right here now is to support
Chris's point the fact that these guys
aren't really you know breaking any new
ground fine fine but to me is still the
case that these guys are introducing
variety in the hardware variety we
haven't seen
elsewhere and and I totally agree with
data and I think actually samsung as
well as much as it tries to appear
haphazard and completely without any
clue or idea or strategy a road map it
does seem to have a rhythm that where
every single year it tries something
that's kind of out there and just you
know just hopes that it work so it was a
Galaxy Note one year then II for the
next year was the galaxy camera and then
it was a galaxy gear I don't think the
galaxy camera gear have been anywhere
near as good as the note but again that
was one of those devices I reviewed it
and I said it's a terrible idea but it's
just done extremely well you know the
same could be true I actually have I
might be the guy who has the most
anticipation for this G flex I really
want to see this crazy freaking oh I
hope looks like floppy I can go like you
know get hit one of those about 20 you
know ok I'm on a bloody phone well no
kids need to have the guts to bring that
phone out because it exists so I've
played with the prototype yeah yeah yeah
me too it at were more Congress a couple
of years ago right yeah I remember that
yeah yeah the twist one yeah yeah yeah
no it's just a matter of time and it's
probably gonna be Samsung or LG that
does it but my question is is Samsung
going to rip off LG and and take its
axis and then make a bowl shape phone or
is LG going to do it because someone is
going to make a phone shape like a bowl
it's just a question for one way dude
what it is a bamboo back HTC a bamboo
pad that would just become like a whole
thing unto itself you'd be like a design
piece at a phone at the same time it
doubles as a holder for your soy sauce
if you're getting sushi I want the
screen on the convex sushi like I want I
want just the screen to be like this
yeah Oh bulging out at you like fish eye
lens I mean you could do that if you
just make your battery overheat well I
guess I me scream what I want them you
know what I want I want to take it one
step further than dieter I want the
screen to bulge out at you and be
circular like the or I was
oh yeah why not just haha way around
your wrist yes like a watch yeah watch
matter time that's gonna happen it's
just a question of when who was an MIT
or somebody already demonstrated a
flexible full-color OLED now wasn't my
dyslexic batteries too you know hey foo
foo color obed Sam second OG have had
those for ages flexi is but they cost a
fortune and yeah yeah flexible batteries
flexible circuit boards and flexible
chips and flexible cameras you know you
focus by flexing the phone that's the
crazy yeah didn't didn't nokia
demonstrate that or somebody did uh oh
yeah you're right that was nope yeah now
we're the point is that these flexible
ideas have been around for so long that
we can't even remember who came up with
them in the beginning because yeah we've
been hearing about flexible displays and
flexible phones for years which we get
really i read that i read the headlines
about the galaxy around before actually
looked at a picture of it I'm like and I
imagined a phone that looks like the g
flex and then when I saw how it was
actually curved as like you've got be
kidding me why is it shaped like this
that would actually fit in your pocket
better than the g flex in your front
pocket yeah but then it but there's no
point in being curved why is it curved
that way Goodwood Cup but we'll just
wrap you you're like I know I wonder if
it's easier to use in your hand because
you can reach like like the curve of the
screen brings the surface closer to your
thumb but you know what isn't shaped
like that are like hiding like you can't
see you know what isn't shaped like that
is your face and and and also yeah not
shaped like that is you're like well no
never mind no I'm here beautiful shape
to stick in a bag of Cheetos and uses a
funnel to just exactly like so i'm
waiting for the first person to that
samsung phone as a container for their
yo soy sauce you know yeah yeah we did
we did put sushi on the uh what was the
verizon version of the 4.43 aspect ratio
LG and
no no that's right the intuition was it
called yeah yeah we put sushi on that
for our photos for our views yeah
logical next step would be to put a bowl
of I am still in super though I'm so
bothered by just how offended in
distress chris has v by this curve folks
I'm deeply affected by it because
because frankly okay you could have you
know defensible thinkers like myself who
unjustified and completely rational fair
enough but you you from your perspective
Chris you don't really lose out much
because if you don't want the curve you
just get the guys look free which is
issue the same phone as the galaxy round
just like why does its very existence
target use hot strings it's like Samsung
has wronged my family that's right it's
like it's like somebody as Samsung was
like I think we should make a curve
phone just to see ziegler loses freaking
mind on their freaking Twitter's yep and
and it went down I mean late they
mission accomplished my heads off this
is huh what a crazy SIA what if I what
what if they made a cyan galaxy brown uh
that would be that would be bad for your
wallet yes that would be bad because
yeah I probably would buy it I don't it
for somewhere between two and three days
and then I um I'd either ebay it or put
out a staff wide verge email saying who
wants to buy and I cyan loss yeah damn
ass applause you could always take it to
the night like in the backyard and shoot
it or something it's true stir make
youtube video I could boss is the is the
galaxy s4 active bulletproof because
it's supposed yeah no I forgot about
that phone I just reminding me Chris I
think AT&amp;amp;T is pushing like it was pretty
good actually yeah it's like people like
that phone and I think that I remember
there was a period of time where 18t
wasn't pushing the s4 at all
they were just talking about the active
yeah and then they got into trouble
because the phone wasn't actually water
resistant but i think that issue is
fixed now oh no I threw it in a pool and
it still worked after that oh yeah nice
I don't really want to talk about
blackberry sad letter other than to say
it exists and they let you meet
blackberries advertisement no one of
fringe makers you know what I'm bummed
about the most is that I wanted them to
do a q30 oh god was i enlarged like with
large cheese and our large keyboards and
and and and then you know Brad was
really good because on my last podcast
on the engadget mobile podcast he said
and he would come with a stylus called
the q-tip Oh God and I have to give him
credit for that because that was very
funny so imagine a q30 can you imagine
that that would be painful no it'd be
awesome like it so if they just
literally took the q10 and blew it up
like it they're just like they did was
eat n in the z30 yeah yeah that the
keyboard would be big enough so you
could like touch type on it be great
yeah like you know it's like pulling out
an HTC one max but with a half of it
being qwerty keyboard yeah I'm down I
either anteater is so offended by your
talking about like naturally left look
oh my god they have you possibly search
the great styli of the mobile world by
suggesting one that blackberry have one
and two that he called the credit is due
oh it's fantastic fragile early if
literally all black we have to do he and
I are gonna have to get pistols at dawn
you totally need to have styli at dawn
and it should be resistive not
capacitive right oh yeah yeah and
speaking of which by the way have you
guys seen the quote unquote stylus that
they ship with the HTC One max no is it
a cat glad you can put it in the review
no good everything is in the books is
optional no but it still exists
positive stylist right listen listen
first of all it is garbage nondescript
irrelevant putting people to sleep etc
but what do you think about the stylist
it's not called the cute it should be ok
but I was discouraged probably called
the boom tip oh man the ultra boom tip
all right i mean does ship i don't know
if they still do this but at one time
they were shipping capacity of style I
what their big screen phones they were
with the view of the headless ring you
and they are the w3 has a stylist silo
that's the proposal you woulda stylo in
it yeah good but it's not about it's
like proper style is now with the new
view right right remember so dude it's
we come welcome on the topic though let
me let me do a couple of series
disclosures here first of all
experienced at ultra because the big six
point four inch tablet thingy sony has
you can use a regular pencil as you
started so you can use a pad whatever
anything days pointy and can do to you
can use your status that's very cool
yeah it's a serious consumer buys don't
care about that anymore because sony has
given up on the US so yes yeah
completely but apart from the fact that
is just that set in 20 20 us but that's
kind of irrelevant it's only like
today's news and but continue with the
hard consumer advice i have also found
out i've tested this it works you can
use the AC one as status on the one max
is serious it is absolutely brutally
stupid and hilarious but i think is just
as ridiculous as the one max itself and
it's just such a fitting thing to do on
that lovely note nice bookend start with
the max and with the max that is full
virgin mobile show you can
