this is first well we're back first the
verge morning show I'm Josh Topolsky i'm
ross miller and it's been a crazy couple
of days it's really a disturbing couple
of days I know wish it was over already
it would be great if the CES just ended
right now and we can go home and go to
sleep for several thousand hours but let
me do that we're here we're here to
serve for you this is of course first
our morning show where we recap the
events of the previous day we talk about
what's to come for today and this is the
point where CS really begins to slow
down a little bit people are walking
slower because of injuries and you know
I think that this is the point where I
think we start to have a lot of fun
because we get to go find weird my
stories and weird things out on the
floor but we're not done with events yet
no bill stuff happening we're so there's
uh there's a tmobile thing today yeah i
think but that is kind of a last
controversial t-mobile yes and we'll
talk about that later this this is
though the show floors and open for one
day most the press conference really are
done yeah it's now the time we get to
look at things last year when we're at
this point it's when we found the
pebbles where we found the oculus rift
like the real big stories that we really
enjoy the smaller companies actually had
an impact throughout the year this is
the time where we'll start finding them
yeah i think you know once would you get
through that the kind of haze of samsung
and LG all these like companies with
their curved whatever's you do start to
you know it's like you see the little
guys are sort of out there and the
noises died down you can actually go
find them right and and and i think
speaking of little guys speaking of you
have something here in the studio which
i'm pretty excited about i'm very
excited about this is well got that
we've got the new pebble yeah guess deal
new pebble steel we've got a couple
options here you have the whole box but
i actually have this is this is cool
bunch it up we got the retail packaging
i don't know if anybody can see that's
probably not should I just throw this
over to you uh actually you've got you
can get an overhead I can't I do want on
ball man
I've on the show so it's the package
once you open that lid give it back to
it you got it all right now hand it now
hand it back to me that is beautiful
that to me anyhow so this is the silver
one know i'm i'm more of a fan of the
black soap a boat last year was kind of
a big story of the show and we were very
excited I'm gonna break this this is
broken I'm not good at unboxing things
it's been a long time no it's been
you've been on box works as a
professional for many years now but I
then there's some other stuff in here
which I'm not going i'm gonna i'm not
it's a charging cable I need you say it
but up I have to say this is I said I've
said it a couple times now you know last
year pebble was a big story for us
because it's this it's this Kickstarter
thing that became a real product and
it's a real product that actually works
I've never been a fan of the design the
plastic design right this one is
definitely the one you've got here we
have the black version of that black on
black I think this all of the all metal
with the the metal face and metal strap
actually a pretty handsome look I mean I
could see myself I could see myself
wearing this as an as an actual watch
which is a big change for me mm-hmm
because I would not there's not another
I can't think of another SmartWatch that
I've looked at and said yeah I could
wear that right and we've seen a number
of smartwatches this week especially um
metawatch which brought in Frank nuovo
the rare to designer try to watch which
I've eviscerated on several broadcast I
have seen that if you mean I mean the
weird thing about metawatch is that is
that here's a company that brings in
this virtue designer and it's supposed
to be like oh my god they're gonna
create something amazing and they create
this which i think is it looks like it's
from 1996 you know I was completely
dated I will say the staff has somewhat
divided because I think it is a very
classic looking design not this kind of
classic not refined luxurious but it is
something that stands up more than say a
Fitbit flex or a fuel band and many of
those which is what we're seeing as I am
I'll what are the help tracking features
the meta wash must do like fit well
actually I don't know what I'm assuming
there are i don't think there are any I
don't know but area more there any
health tracking features the Fitbit flex
it does not signify was the matter wat
gotta wash do you know you don't know
right exactly Miriam zwar an old friend
of ours who's also works is now Pavel PR
gone to the dark side switch sides um
but you know I gotta say I'm looking at
this I'm liking it really surprisingly
you know half the staff is already
bought one no I know people want to be
when a little bit crazy so you actually
got it you you you know how some of the
new functions work right and why don't
we run through some of the features of
the pebble I clips sorry I clearly have
not had enough sleep you know hi this
year that I'd say I know maybe but I
feel completely insane right yeah and
the first speaking also cut like most of
our staff is like critically sick right
now and yes I'm recovery to have
actually sick for the last three days so
but there's nothing to do with this no
not one made the delightful pebbles
let's go ahead so we've got obviously
we've got the old pebble here in the new
pebbles what pebbles dice and FLOTUS
tears run through a few of the software
demos yeah get these out of the way yeah
cuz show this off I'm gonna put this box
away so the big thing here obviously
have all the same watch faces that we
had before you go with this notification
menu is much closer and only that you
can actually look through the old
notifications you had so once there that
you've had them they don't immediately
go away go all the way down here and we
start getting some of the apps that are
available there's dr sandwich for me
mercedes-benz we don't have a car here
we can use that with but now that's a
one yeah that's a shame pebble can't
shame we don't have a Mercedes I know
here pelicans got an interesting one let
me go ahead and real quick oh yeah
pebble cam this is this is a new thing
is this is a third-party app this is a
third-party app guy small little company
actually and what you do is it connects
to your phone camera make sure it's
working right now seems to be good to go
and then it becomes your viewfinder for
your camera which is actually really
nice like a very slow updating view
finite
yeah sorry light skin too soon let's
connect going down this one time yeah
also apologize for that it's going to
take us a couple of seconds to get this
working that was like it's working it
looks like it's working yeah so we faced
to you right now great and so we can
actually use the watch right here so I'm
double handing this real quick there and
we got a beautiful picture okay but I
have to ask is this is this really more
convenient than just taking a picture
with it with a smartphone no I mean the
night it doesn't feel like it is I will
say that it cool it's very impressive
tech demo though it's cool but it
doesn't actually feel like it's it's an
improvement on pulling your phone out of
your pocket just snapping a picture no
but look I you're putting it's like this
is the kind of its own en X lynZ
argument we had before where it's like
we look at this where we put the lens
somewhere here yeah i think that i think
that i think what's interesting about
that as it shows the potential for um
when you've got an open an open system
that you can develop for right and it's
a watch you know you start to think
about what are the different things you
might do with it and that's you know
it's a weird idea it might not be the
perfect idea of it but it's cool to see
people trying to do new things and this
is the surprising about pebbles like
they're very very early on like they
have an open API they're very so far
very accepting a warm of like people
develop for in this this app store is
obviously a testament to that yeah and
for a small company to kind of come out
and like kind of find what the
SmartWatch industry is going to be in
these housing on days like before
Samsung really got a hold of it before
Apple yeah obviously has done anything
with it yeah it's really impressed to
say the least what I wonder is how
pebble will fare I mean if Apple does
the iWatch or xfer I mean the galaxy
gear doesn't seem to have made much of
an impact I mean clearly there's some
people that are buying it i doesn't seem
like too widespread adoption or anything
you know they're very different devices
in a lot of ways but i am interested to
know how something like the pebble or
the matter watch are these do any of
these smaller companies how that's going
to fare when you get into you know
somebody like Apple who really knows how
to do hardware and really knows how to
do interfaces right now Samsung is like
struggling a little bit i think with the
galaxy gear they wanted to be first I
don't know if there's best so they're
definitely not best so you know the
so it'll be interesting to see how the
market reacts to that and how these
watches change i mean i will say in the
span of a year going from the plastic
version of this to the metal version you
know it's like a huge leap in design
it's a huge leap in in style right in
the face wise it's still very similar
though right I do function i think they
nail like the simplicity part of this
and this is a watch that you know you're
gonna what have for at least a couple
years like it just looks that good it's
great well but i but i wonder but i
wonder with a SmartWatch you don't need
a year the idea it seems to be like in a
year's time there's gonna be a new one
it's me a better one so you know that's
the thing i mean this israel thank you
it but these aren't you know these are
expensive they're not they're not as
wildly expensive as a Rolex you know
you're not five thousand dollars but
what the one you have right there what
how much is that I i I'd rather not say
but come on my grandfather's watch it's
well i didn't i didn't pay for it so
that's the important very nice that's
the important thing to remember is that
i didn't pay for this and but but the
point is nice watches are expensive
these are expensive for most people
would not spend two hundred fifty
dollars on a watch I mean the majority
of watches like you go by the
fifty-dollar Watchers I mean I have a
bunch of psychos that I love that were
like eighty dollars right but then it's
like hey next year there's an upgrade
and the watches you know has a bigger
phase it's faster it's whatever I don't
know how much we can upgrade every
single thing that we write that we buy
especially jewelry you don't normally do
that you buy a watch and you keep it for
10 years or 15 years you know I mean
historically watches her are the kinds
of things that you keep it in the family
you know that you keep for a really long
time and so I think it'll be interesting
to see with stuff like the pebble is
what's the what's the life span of this
watch right you know I think you know
it's obviously this is so early with
smart watches that we don't know like if
there are they gonna hit a plateau
technologic where people are really
happy with what they have right like
it's going to be obviously very early on
this is double the ram the are bringing
the app store to the old pebble so that
does expand its ban I think we're in the
I think we're in the very early days of
of these devices but I gotta say I think
people got a lot of stuff writing them
and I'm
relatively excited about what they're
doing I do okay yeah go on no no what
were you say I would say like we did
type of the pelvic am the one thing I
wouldn't want to shop before that is
some of the other apps that they're
talking about which are more practical
real quick okay yeah it was like on
foursquare you can check in without
having to like go you still use
foursquare are you a Foursquare user I
started again really because i was using
recommendations oh yeah i don't know i
just can't get in the habit of checking
in places i feel like i don't know i
just can't think of it when i'm at
places I never think of it and then I'm
like oh I should have checked in their
income at the airport then I leave I'm
like oh I should have checked in there
just doesn't happen right it's to me
it's the airport it's the gym and then
it's like looking for places to eat and
I don't want to auto check in like I
don't want to have anything where I'm
auto jacketing because that would just
be a nightmare beyond description
exactly or well within the realm of just
being described either wet alright so so
so foursquare what else Foursquare and
then Yelp of course recommendations yeah
now that that I think you'll be very
much and the thing here if you shake it
a little bit it'll actually give you a
nearby recommendation so sushi samba is
apparently a good place around here you
see sushi samba yes there's a sushi
samba in Las Vegas it's point nine miles
away and here's the phone number that
makes sense yeah let's give them let's
all give them a call right now right and
we get the reviews from there because it
there are currently five several hundred
people calling sushisamba all on the
local Vegas inside this jacket yeah yeah
um all right what else anything else
those are big was right now ESPN that
one only shows like the day's scores
right now so everything looks kinda
rozier oh that's great that's those are
that sports scores it sports course
sports ball okay but you can choose your
favorite sports what other kind of
scores might you show video game scores
i guess if you have a I mean that could
be something if you are big into eSports
Paul Miller you know it would love that
he Paul Miller's scores can check on us
dota starcraft yeah all right what's
that what else with that there's the big
ones right now was it a watch face as a
watch face this is a again Miriam our
old friend it's a domo watch face I
comes with some of the standard watch
faces but also we have a couple new ones
that you can always download this is
probably the nicest one we've got right
here at the classic look that's very
cool so you guys see the one before that
yeah no the other way
it's gonna hear yo oh that is awesome
that is I mean I wouldn't use the head
face but its cool the face exists right
basically all right so I think you know
that's a little look at the pebble we
actually have a more in-depth feature on
this we have an interview with the CEO
and and all sorts of hands-on photos and
stuff you can check that out on the site
right but very very very cool to see it
in person right a chance to play with it
and this is going on sale in a month but
he would reduce this is on sale now it's
on selling apples website and its
shipping january twenty eighth if you
bought other so they're like basically
sold out down right and so they're
chipping in February's what it's telling
people right but late january if you
have your pebble the app store should be
launching right let's feel amazing by
the way of your pebble yeah and you're
like yeah we wanted to make a SmartWatch
we started the kickstarter project and
then a year later you introduced a new
model and you're selling out like the
day it goes on sale right you know
that's pretty incredible it's pretty
credible story and i think pretty
incredible example of how much
technology has changed i mean i remember
a few years ago talking about hardware
startups and everybody was like it's so
hard to do a hardware startup it's
almost impossible you saw a lot of
people fail and now you're starting to
see people succeed now let's see if this
is chris only in a span 12 months like
pebble was a story from last CES
actually i think the wednesday of last
see is we really got a time like to look
at it after the whole kickstarter thing
happened with them and it's they had 12
months you've really kind of like
changed like how we talk about these
small companies right no it's pretty
incredible alright so up next there is
an event happening when the last events
is event happening today jon was here
yes we'll see i mean i think that's how
his name is pronounced I don't know for
a fact i see Legere we have some people
say ledger yeah mom st. Lazare english'
from t-mobile yes who is a you know wild
maniac rather audacious completely
insane he actually one of the big
stories from CES this year is that he
went to an 80 mclemore party right which
I by the way Macklemore said it right or
so I'm told I don't know if that's
actually the right it's not Macklemore
it's apparently not Macklemore it's
apparently McLemore
unless I'm being trolled by Soviet apart
I think that somebody would be Laura
which is possible down that I think
about it so at any rate either Mackel
more or McLemore was doing a show here
at CES and it was an 18 a TV show John
Legere went to it and was promptly
ejected yes I eight finalists quite
heavy security which was great fodder
first fire obviously we were going with
my hair I just have to fix this of
course ok really driving me crazy it
wouldn't be it wouldn't be a broadcast
with me if I didn't there i'm a much
happy can bring him I care if you want
any asset to any how so Legere shows up
it's like I just want to jam to
macklemore or McLemore whoever he is and
then Ralph de la Vega kicked him out
personally personally personally threw
him to the ground d CEOs are rough threw
him out add to the ground right so
actually sewed relatives I that's
another story that happened just as he I
think March was the first big speech
that we saw I think Dan see for myself
our director John wind yeah not know
John was years like a new guy on the
seat yes he's not he's not been around
for a long time but he is something that
we just can't help but talk about now
he's made a real impact for better for
worse yeah I me a lot of people think
this this chick is old I actually don't
like it as you then do you enjoy it I
mean how often do you see a CEO like
this you're him you're hearing people
like Intel try to be like that right
trying to be a little more open I think
it's better than like I is easily he is
kind of refreshing yes you know because
he's not pulling punches or at least he
seems like he's not pulling punches so
we actually have a video compilation of
lose years greatest hits yes so take a
look at this holy I don't have
wireless industry experience there's not
a goddamn person in the world besides a
wireless industry person that would
understand why the hell this mess works
this way this is the biggest crock of
 I've ever heard in my life it's
everybody's blogging holy crap I can't
believe you just said that oh he said
 that's how I lost the family pool I
bet he'd only swear five times look up I
feel like I'm the teacher Hey look at me
I don't want to hear a single one of you
tell me after I announced this next
so what are you gonna do if they respond
you can't do the next to this because
you host chapter one on algebra get
ready for another profanity-laden tirade
on AT&amp;amp;T I can't resist it's not the g
rated version it's like hey kids is it
better for your network to be crap or is
it better to have a good LTE high-speed
network in New York and then this is the
one that comes up with a great answer
I'm gonna explain how stupid we all are
but not make us feel bad holy crap what
happened to my phone cut the crap on the
prepaid postpaid we can do it just a guy
like you hey Billy what's what's better
bigger or smaller I mean come on how
about not coming a crop as angry here
haha if the way you want to respond to
this tactic is to say no there's a
contract on the device it's not really
good go for it it's hi I'm AT&amp;amp;T
and my customers hate me what's keeping
them up at night is us pig Macklemore
fans I've already told you about the
spaceship and the aliens coming in
please stop the you know how I
spend my times tweeting skyping blogging
posting googling facetiming go
frankly you're just pissed because the
little girl sitting next to you has a
better phone than you yeah yeah okay if
you're typing I didn't say we're going
completely into the prepaid business
watch out boost so we're gonna make you
pay your bill later in a very
complicated way with a contract so we
can take the out of your pockets
for two years it's so beautiful for me
because this is just a broken industry
with a bunch of arrogant people that
don't know how to tell it like it is i
call them oh moments oh it's
really an abbreviation not necessarily
because your phone fell in the toilet
it's short for oh i'm tied into an
epic contract and I can't get out for
two years and I'm gonna hold that toilet
written phone to my head for the next
two years haha frankly they don't have
the balls to say it either to the
manufacturers or to the customers you
are now you are the first broadcast on
television to say balls right there so
we're a pair by the way my daughter is
here today you young bloggers after the
speech today if you find yourself
hitting on attractive young girl whose
tag says leger you're dead I mean we can
track you down with these cellphones
don't let them kid you I mean like I
have to say I maybe it's an act but it
makes me want to be his customer I feel
like like just salad first up he doesn't
sound insane I mean not saying is right
right and they have actually changed
t-mobile plans to be somewhat less
restrictive and crappy it's not as it's
not like what you would expect after you
see hearing that it's not like this huge
sea change maybe today will be the huge
sea change we don't know but he is
really likable very lightly funny and
he's like the FX network a cos he
doesn't mind swearing a lot yeah i'm the
same thing in the highways but he's just
bringing a much more blunt yes and
frankly it's just refreshing to see some
buddy who is in so rehearsed trying to
work through their script right you know
this guy's just kind of he's just
riffing ran and it works and like what
the weird thing is of you see people's
reaction to it you know in kind of the
broad market sense people are like i
like i know of the CEOs existence and i
like him which is something you
basically don't hear anywhere right you
know i mean nobody's talking about how
much they like Mark Zuckerberg no you
know and like many long mas people you
don't love him but again it's another
hot day like flamboyant very fun boy an
audacious character right so you know
it's it's it's pretty incredible so so
John Legere is is as you can see love
social media let's agree that there's
the two things like the press conference
on Legere everyone loves people loves in
the speeches that's never been a thing
Twitter in this day and age of course is
a huge deal very active on Twitter you
cannot stop we have some John Legere
right some John Legere tweets here and
this is this is the one right before he
got kicked out here's the me and I said
this I said this last night on the verge
cast but I think we should be concerned
about the fact that he's doing the bunny
ears yeah that is problematic here I
think in this day and age so um yeah and
this is what his reaction to it yeah
what happens in Vegas will be on the
Internet in seconds is the 18 th
challenger especially when you're
kicking in the competition kicking out
the competition for your party right a
tee hee I mean there are a few things
you learn from Toddlers error reading
his tweets the first thing is he really
really does hate 18 really a teensy he
hates more than anything I alright what
else do we have here right this is him
just going to the ball he's went to a
mall in New Jersey took a picture of an
empty AT&amp;amp;T store and tweeted it that's
greatest role what else uh for the
breaking bad finale yeah he's suggesting
a TT 4 burner phones yes and they don't
know what the what is this mr. he's to
pay me like a cool jacket looking at so
he does a couple selfies there's one
hears I'm talking about his turkey
changing the phone deals they kinda
brine a turkey for the first time
changing wireless industry was easier
than being the chef yeah I mean I guess
it's a little bit i need using this in
this is a sign of his hashtag obsession
he does a lot of
hashtag cover girl katie is that even a
real hashtag er to John Legere invented
i'm not sure but i think he's like let's
start this trend i think so alright what
else do we have here we've got oh yes he
also a big fan of the Batman yeah Batman
he's like obsessive Batman he fashions
itself is like the Batman of the care of
the mobile carriers but it gets it gets
really weird another hashtag example
hashtag spinning hashtag power hour what
is spinning me that's the that's like
this already like soul ii soul spin
class I've learned so much about John
Legere like the last one what else what
else we have here um this is where the
Batman obsession gets a little bit weird
yeah this is the Batman look at some
point DC is gonna take action I you must
have cuz here this is his office he's
got Batman logos also like a bright pink
which is like you know that magenta
Batman Batman you know at times Batman's
costume gets weird but little weird
typically not like a hot pink or magenta
now it's like when you're even here when
you're uh searching out criminals in the
night and attacking them and being them
they do a lifeless pulp right feels like
magenta might be the wrong color it's
not bad I'm not saying it's effeminate
I'm saying it's just really bright
that's a mission like it you know it's
just it's extremely bright color like if
you're sneaking around magenta is
probably not going to be the tone you're
going for not to mention his hatred of a
TD he said going to actually beat up
ralph de la Vega no he might he might I
mean let's put it this way if there was
a story today through the story today
John Legere punches ralph de la Vega in
the face right it's not like we'd be
like what I can't believe that happened
no it'd be like yeah that was the
logical conclusion of what was going on
like the early morning we find Ralph de
la Vega it's like hanging from a light
pole yeah string yeah with a sign for
the police yes exactly that's what's
going to happen are there any more
tweets we've got unfortunately if you
were this is his own t-shirt know yet
