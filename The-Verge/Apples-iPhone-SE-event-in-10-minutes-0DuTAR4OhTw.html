loop campus I'd like to address
something that I know is on the minds of
many people this morning about a month
ago we asked Americans across the
country to join in a conversation how
much power the government should have
over our data and over our privacy we
did not expect to be in this position at
odds with our own government but we
believe strongly that we have a
responsibility to help you protect your
data and protect your privacy this is an
issue that impacts all of us and we will
not shrink from this responsibility we
understand that we have an opportunity
and a responsibility so we want to get
started this morning
by talking about two initiatives where
we are working hard to leave the world
better than we found it we'd like to
start with the environment and I'd like
to invite Lisa Jackson up thanks so much
just like everything we do at Apple when
we think about the environment we think
about innovation now the solution is
energy efficiency and renewable energy
in Sichuan Province China we found a way
to build a 40 megawatt solar farm
without disturbing the local population
that solar project is producing more
than enough electricity to power our 34
retail stores and our 19 offices in the
country that makes our facilities
they're carbon neutral now while we're
focused on conservation let me tell you
about another way we're working to
preserve our planet's resources
and that's the reefs and recycling many
recycling systems today waste much of
the material they collect so it can't be
reused let me introduce you to a pretty
cool R&amp;amp;D project we call him Liam when
it's time Liam you can structure eiffel
Archer detected and removed and
separated the second initiative we'd
like to talk about this morning is hell
I'd like to invite up Jeff Williams last
year we introduced research Kidd the
research studies that we launched became
some of the largest in history with tens
of thousands of people signing up the
very same tools used to advance medical
research can also be used to help people
with their care let me give you an
example in the Parkinson's study
patients do test several times a day on
their iPhone like that simple tap test
you saw in the video so today we're
launching care kit care kit is a
framework to build apps that empower
people to take a more active role in
their care we have been absolutely
humbled and inspired by the response to
research kit and we can't wait to see
what great apps get created with care
kit thank you now I'd like to talk about
products and I'll get started with the
Apple watch today we're introducing some
brand new colors and a new band that's
made from a whole different material our
new woven nylon band features a unique
four layer construction it comes in a
variety of vibrant colors there's new
sport and leather bands in all new
colors and there's a stunning space
black Melanie's Lou so beginning today
Apple watch will start at just $2.99 now
I'd like to talk about Apple TV since
the Apple TV has been shipping we have
5,000 apps on the App Store now of
course TV OS powers the Apple TV and at
the heart of the Apple TV experience is
Siri
with Siri you can just ask for something
great to watch we've added some great
contents app for Siri to search we've
got more coming and we'll keep adding
more over time now we've got some other
great features coming to Apple TV like
folders and dictation so you can now use
your voice to enter text on the screen
this includes usernames and password and
now you can access your entire iCloud
photo library including live photos
right on your big screen all of this is
available as a free update beginning
today now I'd like to talk about iPhone
iPhone is the most loved smartphone in
the world and today we're welcoming a
new member to the iPhone family and as
you may have heard we're calling it the
iPhone se so we start with this blob
aluminum design but we've made some
beautiful refinements including this
gorgeous rose gold finish we've added
matte chamfered edges and an inset
stainless steel Apple logo just like the
iPhone 6s so at the heart of the iPhone
se of course is our chips are amazing
Apple a9 chip this means that the iPhone
se has the same processing performance
as the iPhone 6s and the iPhone se also
has the same incredible graphics
performance as the iPhone 6s which is
three times faster the iPhone se
delivers incredible battery improvements
across the board and of course people
love taking photos with their iPhones
more than any other phone or camera
we've given it our incredible 12
megapixel iSight camera with focus
pixels and we have a course that image
signal processor from the a9 that
enables all kinds of great features like
the panorama pictures up to 63 megapixel
but also improvements to video slo-mo
time-lapse and of course your photos I
didn't know what you're thinking that is
not Phil Schiller skateboarding to work
and the iPhone se can capture live
photos so you can take your photo of
your still photos and have them come to
life
it can even capture 4k video and just
like the iPhone 6s you can edit up to
two simultaneous streams of 4k video
with iMovie right on the iPhone
see we now have LTE speeds that are 50%
faster than the iPhone 5s and we've
added more LTE bands so you have better
global roaming and of course high
fidelity call quality with voice over
LTE and we've given in high-speed Wi-Fi
as well 802 11 AC which is three times
faster than the iPhone 5s and now you
can make easy secure and private
payments with Apple pay well we're going
to start the price of the iPhone se at
only $399 and we have a higher capacity
64 gigabyte model for just $4.99 course
we know installment plans to become
incredibly popular the iPhone se now
starts at just 17 dollars per month
we'll begin taking orders for the iPhone
se this Thursday March 24 and it be
available next week's March the 31st and
for the last couple months we've been
testing iOS 9.3 which is one of the
biggest dot releases we've ever done
let's start with night shift so night
shift automatically shifts the colors of
the display to the warmer end of the
spectrum which may help you sleep better
at night notes let's talk about notes
notes is actually one the most used apps
on the platform it's look used by
literally hundreds of millions of people
every day well today we're adding the
ability to further protect your most
personal notes with a passcode or
fingerprint news we introduced Apple
News with iOS 9 so we're adding top
stories to make it easier to track your
news on your iPhone or iPad so that's
just some of the highlights of iOS 9.3
we think it's turned out really great
and it's going to make the best mobile
experience even better and it's
available as a free update for all of
you today
next up is iPad and to tell you all
about it I'd like to invite up Phil
Schiller people love an iPad pro it is a
revolutionary device and so that's why
today we're so excited to introduce you
to for the first time the second member
of the iPad pro family an entirely new
iPad pro based around a nine point seven
inch Retina display it is 40 percent
less reflective than an iPad air 2 and
it's brighter to 25 percent brighter
than an iPad air 2 this is the best
display we've ever built for an iPad
in addition it supports to really
breakthrough features it works with
night shift the brightness dims a bit
the blue light wavelengths get reduced
and some people find that makes it
easier to get to sleep but the second
feature it's incredibly innovative we
call it a true tone display no matter
where you use it automatically senses
the color temperature of the light
becomes warmer or cooler and matches
paperwhite and is really natural and in
the new iPad pro we've put our most
advanced camera yet it's a 12 megapixel
iSight camera but its focus pixels true
tone flash that amazing image signal
processor built into the a9x the iPad
pro comes in four metal finishes silver
gold Space Gray and for the first time
rose gold as well we're really excited
to offer the 32 gigabyte iPad pro for
just $5.99 for 128 gigs for 749 for the
first time ever an iOS device is a
configuration now with 256 gigabyte of
storage
this is the best lineup we've ever had a
high pad by far next year in 2017 we're
looking forward to moving we expect that
we're going to have many many
opportunities to invite all of you to
join us there thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
