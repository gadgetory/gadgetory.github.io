we're here looking at the new LG g2
which was just announced here in New
York City so from a hardware perspective
this phone is a lot like the Samsung
Galaxy s4 it's a little bit bigger has a
5.2 inch screen it's also 1080p and it
looks really great the screen is bigger
but the phone itself is actually about
the same size but one thing that's
really interesting is that the buttons
both the power and the volume buttons
are on the back you can also long press
the volume down button to launch
straight into the camera or press up to
go straight into the quick memo the
quick memo is one of a huge list of
software features on this LG basically
took the same approaches Samsung and
just crammed all the software could
possibly think of into this phone so
quick memo lets you take a screenshot or
just doodle notes it's a really handy
way to just quickly get a note down on
the phone it's also one of a bunch of
apps that LG has that will actually pop
over whatever you're doing so you can
take a memo or see your calendar or use
a calculator over top of another app and
you can use a bunch of them you can
handle the transparency you can really
do a bunch of things at once on this
phone and it seems to work really well
it's running a Snapdragon 800 processor
which is insanely fast and has two gigs
of RAM and all in all makes the g2 seem
like a pretty fast phone it is a 13
megapixel camera again just like the gs4
and for the most part it's basically
just like the gs4 it has tons of modes
there's a dual camera mode that lets you
shoot with the front and back camera at
the same time there is one cool feature
called VR panorama which lets you take a
360 degree photo and actually pan around
it just by moving your body or scrolling
around on the screen it's a little like
Google Street View and it's actually
pretty fun it's kind of hard to get the
photo right but it's cool there are a
bunch of little tweaks to the operating
system what is called slide to access
and basically what it lets you do is
store apps off to the left side of your
screen using three fingers just swipe a
nap over and it just lives there and
it's sort of own separate multi-tasking
menu one of the coolest weeks to the
operating system is how the g two
handles guest mode instead of having a
bunch of different totally distinct
profiles you just unlock the phone with
a different pattern for yourself or for
a guest and if you use the guest pattern
it just shows a few apps and a few
settings and whatever you've enabled
it's a really clever way of handling
being able to just give somebody your
phone and let them make a phone call so
in all the g2 reminds me a lot of the
gs4 it's a ton of software features it's
not particularly exciting hardware
though LG is doing a couple of
interesting things here with the buttons
on the back
but really the move here is software the
quick memo stuff there's the remote that
you can use and even offers the remote
in the notification pull down there's a
ton of options a ton of menus a lot
going on but ultimately a lot you can do
as well the g2 is coming to all four
carriers and it's going to be a very
different phone depending on how you
want to set it up so obviously we've
only just gotten to know this phone but
it's clear that this is not trying to
compete with something like the iPhone
or the Moto X this is very much a
kitchen sink kind of phone like the
samsung galaxy s4 it has all the
features you want probably dozens and
dozens more and really if you're a
tinkerer can be almost anything you want
which is probably going to be a lot of
fun for some people</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
