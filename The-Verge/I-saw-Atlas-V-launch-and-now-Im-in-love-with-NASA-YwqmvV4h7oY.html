Earth orbit since the Apollo program
ended in the 1970s and with the shuttle
program ending we haven't even been
sending our own astronauts up to the ISS
that's going to change nASA has
announced that they want to send us
astronauts from US soil starting in 2017
and their ambitions are even bigger it's
not just NASA either companies like
SpaceX the United Launch Alliance and
Virgin Galactic are trying new ambitious
things that we've never done before I
think space is coming back in a really
big way oh my god oh my god
what we're here to see is the Atlas 5
rocket launch which is going to be
carrying an a/v communication satellite
to provide cell phone service not super
sexy and a lot of our rocket launches
have been like that not really
compelling in the same way that human
spaceflight can be the space program has
literally had its ups and downs if
you'll pardon that little bit of a pun
but but there have been some changes we
certainly experienced that at the end of
the Apollo program today you know
there's only two countries that have the
ability to launch humans into space and
the u.s. is not one of them we obviously
had huge excitement around the Apollo
program that was renewed with shuttle
and then when the shuttle was
decommissioned we kind of went into this
bathtub or hiatus where the excitement
level went down and NASA you know wasn't
able to do what it normally does to
excite the country but I think we're
seeing a resurgence of that we are
certainly at the turning point in the
space activities because we add if you
want the period of the space shuttle and
the space station the major developments
are completed and we need to look beyond
by looking beyond of course the next
step at international level is agreed to
be space exploration moon Mars and so on
there's something really amazing about
sending people beyond our own planet I
mean it's maybe the most impressive
thing that we've accomplished as a
species the idea that we might be going
to Mars really excites me and I think it
excites a lot of other people too I've
seen a really renewed interest in what's
going on in space in part because we're
doing things we haven't done before one
of the things that's different from the
early days from the Apollo missions is
that we actually have private companies
that are interested in space now that's
pretty cool i think that potentially
things like space tourism might make
people care about the big missions more
and more likely to fund them we
definitely are renaissance and what a
lot of people called new space which is
the movement from gum
dominated programs like the space
shuttle program in public-private
partnerships where NASA's investing in
programs but companies are also
investing to try to make it commercial
as well for the private side as we say
there has been a clear identification of
a private sector taking more
responsibility in the low Earth orbit
destinations course this is in general
beneficial it has to be very strictly
coordinated with the government
activities I believe because we cannot
afford to have major failure so take
risks which cannot be calculated 30 our
estimation tism main engines at 108
percent if you are
it's not like space is easy though just
last year we saw three major accidents
within the space of about two months two
of them were uncrewed thank goodness but
one person died it's kind of like the
early days of Apollo when the Rockets
weren't totally ready for prime time and
we saw a lot of explosions I mean
commercial spaceflight isn't there yet
it just isn't space never has become
routine there were 135 Shuttle missions
which seems like a lot but when you
compare that to cars operating on the
freeway or commercial aircraft where you
may have a million flights a day
operating it's really a very small
number at some point there's going to be
a conjunction between the reliability
and cost of the technology and processes
it takes to get to space in a burgeoning
commercial market particularly for low
Earth orbit there's going to be a time
in the future where you don't have to be
a billionaire to get to space but your
average citizen has an opportunity to go
to space maybe work in space during
research at least go to space and look
back at Earth which is a incredibly
unique perspective
so this was my first rocket launch I've
never been to one before and it was
amazing I'm so excited I like kind of
cannot contain myself I'm like I've got
butterflies oh my god oh my god
I wasn't expecting to be as excited as I
was it was like a kind of giddiness
butterflies in the stomach feeling that
I hadn't really been expecting
especially because this isn't even a
very important mission and honestly I
don't think I had a single thought in my
head except the holy this is so
cool I think we like to think of
ourselves as a spacefaring people we
like to think of space as part of our
home now and I think the excitement of
what's going on in space travel space
launch space exploration I think it's
starting to hit its stride again it is
capturing the public's attention in and
the imagination and making people think
a little bit more about what is out
there in the future are we going to
march when are we going to Mars when is
that going to take place when am I going
to get to fly in space and all those
things are possible
the thing is i think that people really
are interested in space I was in Times
Square when curiosity landed and it was
packed and I think people really
responded to how ambitious that mission
was and how ambitious as landing was I
think people care about space when we're
doing exciting new things especially
when we do things we haven't done before
especially if people are involved
something like an asteroid redirect
mission a moon base Mars maybe even
Venus those are things I think people
would get behind I think those are
things people care about and I think
that's what's coming space is about to
get really exciting for everybody and I
really can't wait</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
