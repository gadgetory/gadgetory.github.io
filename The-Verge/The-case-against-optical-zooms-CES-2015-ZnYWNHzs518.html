had a proper zoom lens you'd never need
a real camera again well not so fast
even though it sounds inevitable and
we've actually seen examples like Asus
zenfone zoom appear at CES this year
thank you there are way more problems
with the idea than you might imagine
right now smartphones these prime lenses
that means a lens that doesn't zoom
which you think would be a bad thing but
a ton of series of photographers use
prime lenses for a whole bunch of
reasons I only bought one camera to CES
fujifilm's x100 T and it really shows
off the advantages of prime lenses they
can be smaller they're often sharper and
they can let in more light so they're a
lot better in dark situations and all of
these things might be even more
important for smartphones than so-called
real cameras because there's much less
space to work with looking at the
zenfone zoom specs it's definitely going
to suffer in low light compared to other
phones but there are other non technical
reasons why you may prefer a prime lens
on either a pro camera or a phone prime
lens is force you to think about
composition more carefully you have to
move your feet get close to your subject
when you shoot with the pro moans you're
spending less time dialing in settings
and more time thinking about your shop
that's not to say you don't have any
options for expansion with promo the
x100 has a couple of great conversion
lenses for example and there are tons of
adapters for the iPhone just as week
I've been using all eclipse new iphone 6
telephoto lens which is a neat way to
zoom without compromising your phone
ultimately as with many things at CES
the zoom and smartphone is an idea that
sounds a lot better in theory than
reality ballys fellow
