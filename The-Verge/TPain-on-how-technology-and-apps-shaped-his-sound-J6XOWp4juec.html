have changed music you know both your
career Watergate affair
yeah mine is a little more quiet I'm
gonna say like find your Co oh forgot
about that damn it now of course oh look
they look terrible
what's good man it's your homeboy t-pain
aka your girlfriend's boyfriend right
here with a verge yeah so I guess I mean
the first thing to ask is we're here to
talk about GarageBand and some what I
understand you've actually used
GarageBand which is you know known as an
amateur piece of stuff right or make
some of your hits that's pretty crazy I
mean how is that still possible to use
like a piece of software like GarageBand
to make something that is a like serious
piece of music well the great thing is
that it's even more possible now you
know because they've heard the voices of
you know their users and you know when
it started coming on the laptop like I
did my whole first album on GarageBand
because you know it was just it was so
accessible is there a reason for you to
go back to grudge band ever do you still
use that when you're on the go I still
use it I just got off of it right before
you guys got here so yeah I use it in my
big powerful studio like you know ears
people just have to see these things and
people have to know like if I tell you
that the last song that I released was
completely done in GarageBand you
neither wouldn't believe it or you would
go I need to check out garage yeah was
it yes Wow yeah I'm creating like stuff
for my new album couple scenes yeah I'm
doing full songs like you know there's a
you know the entire audio app there's
always third-party apps that you can
bring in to wear it make the fogers a
little sweeter and you know that I got
to have my pitch correction so you know
there's always after you can bring in
for that you know saying I got my I am
t-pain app I can bring that in
you know different if you want some
different drums from a different place
and you can bring in an throw out of
your app well let me ask you this I feel
like I've heard a lot of musicians
they're you know almost embarrassed to
admit that they use garage yeah or
they'll be like oh no I used to or like
I tried a little bit yeah you think it's
just like perfectly totally legit it's
totally legitimate it's not it well to
me it's it's the carpenter not the
much of your career has been defined by
which is really wild right because
you're you know an incredible singer mmm
by yourself right you didn't need to use
autotune
but you decided to bring that in right
you know is that because you know the
technology is going to bring attention
yeah definitely not a technological
prophet or anything like that I didn't I
want to take that I just I felt like I
was out of would have just been another
singer there's so many people that can
sing and have wonderful voices and you
know a lot better than mine I always
thought to myself what's gonna make me
different and you know sacrificing
people hearing my voice and you know
being ready for the ridicule and stuff
like that I just said you know what
here's what's gonna make me different
I'm gonna stand out nobody's gonna be
able to copy this boy was I wrong super
wrong but you know it was it was a
thought process of how do I not become
just another guy that can sing and this
was at a time where I was building
computers for people in Intel a say yeah
that was my big mouth yeah I charged
them 400 bucks forget the parts of Steel
build your own computer
absolutely yeah I can't I can't have
anybody so you know it's always been
like that man and you know one computer
I was building for a guy and he didn't
have all the money so he gave me a he
gave me a CD of cracked plugins going
through it and you know I had one one
region of vocals just had that looping
and what's going through each plug-in
and once I got to an Tara's auto-tune I
stopped and I was like this is it this
is what's gonna make me sound different
and that's why we're so hold on you
mentioned it you actually use the I am
t-pain app for your vocal bar absolutely
seriously yeah there's nothing better
really hi I'm t-pain take it home with
you
yeah absolutely I have to call this yeah
yeah you know not everybody should be
using I am t-pain app I'm using I am
t-pain app because I am t-pain now so I
guess you know the big story about
having all this stuff on our phones and
the fact that these are all really easy
to use tools just it's opening up music
to more amateurs I would imagine right
is that intimidating that there's that
literally anybody can become a huge star
I don't think so I don't think so I mean
it's not intimidating to me you know I
was that amateur do you think it's
easier to get out there now or is there
too much noise for anybody to actually
easier to Gay's it's either to get
exposure to get the right exposure it's
harder to get the right exposure but you
know all you got to do at this point is
I know in an urban demographic you just
got to dis somebody and they'll be right
so you're using streaming services then
oh yeah after are you sorry musicians
seem to talk about them like their
apocalyptic for for actually making any
money
no no not at all because I mean do two
streams like I mean sound like a jerk
right now but if you got more streams
maybe a show prices can go up maybe
different things that your revenue would
come from different places due to the
amount of streams you have let it stream
and we don't get the iTunes money we
don't get any of that money like even if
we even when we sell albums we're just
paying back the money that we borrowed
from the label to get that album out so
you know it's not a fact of making money
off of things and asking Spotify where's
my money at it's not all that it's about
what you do with that opportunity
afterwards streaming it's just giving
the giving the customer more
availability you're selling an idea now
now you're selling to the person don't
you want to see this live come to the
concert and don't you want to that don't
you want to come see me a person
somewhere that you got to pay for so
when you put out
you you want people to listen to it and
then get excited and come see right this
is a new tour you know a new cooler for
the avenue tool for the single new tour
for something you know and and a new a
new way to make money the surprise album
drop is like this unique little thing
well seems to be like can we can we get
as much attention tell you what that is
that's a contest it's a contest between
artists to see who's more famous than
the other one that's all that is
I'm not risking it I need to take my
show prices up I need everybody to know
about my album actually leaks and
mixtapes or two other maybe interesting
things to touch on before you why you a
mixtape versus a CD why people just to
basically to hold it down you know fans
on hold your attention to keep the
attention on mindset keep their
attention gon keep letting people know
that you are still making music and you
know just you're in between
album cycles mixtape nowadays are purely
digital because if you're not if you're
not planning on making money you try not
to spend any I'm printing up CDs and now
you're gonna get cover made you got to
print those and there you got to get
cases and dogs too much and you got to
actually hand them to people who does
that anymore skin-to-skin contact no
one's doing that have you had experience
with leaked albums at all many really
any times is that frustrating or is very
because you know like I said we had the
whole we have roll outs to where we have
plans on when things are gonna happen
and when would be the optimal time to
drop certain things as a collective we
found out what studios not to use
because some of the employees may leak
it and something like that or what email
like we've all have a collective just
found out you know the most common ways
that we've been leaving some users are
sharing absolutely we have to so what do
you do want something leaks is it just
you just throw your arms up or do you
kind of very harmless with me with me I
reformulate and
make newer music you know I kind of give
it to him like I he thought you had it
they did have it but but my quick
planning is like y'all just gonna make
new music and I'm gonna make you think
you got the wrong stuff well thank you
to appreciate you having us it's been
great talking about thank you guys it
seems awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
