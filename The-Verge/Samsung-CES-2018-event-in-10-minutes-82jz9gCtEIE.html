relative intelligence intelligence to
make your life easier there was our
vision with a big speed to make your

added the smart things app to our 2018
Smart TVs so now your TV becomes a
dashboard for your entire io te cos√¨
allowing you to manage your connected
devices from the largest screen in your
home when we first introduced family hub
at CES in 2016 we had exactly that in
mind today family hub is much more than
just a fridge it's a way to manage your
food to stay connected with your family
and to bring fun and entertainment into
the kitchen just connect your Android or
iOS phone to the TV via Bluetooth
low-energy and when it's connected you
see this you'll get this pop-up and you
get this pop-up all you need to do is
just press the set up and it's actually
loading necessary information from your
phone to the TV via smart things cloud
so wait that Wi-Fi password I can never
remember at home and stingy a no
password all that stuff you just did it
one click no more stingy
oh back back back I know it's all
loaded in good ok ok hi Bixby play my
morning brief Good Morning Joe
here is your green you have sales
meeting an 8 a.m. meeting of 12:15 p.m.
Samsung CES 2018 press conference at
2:00 p.m. micro LED this is the TV
without the trade-offs experience in
other technologies like oh le D it uses
non organic materials and does not
require a color filter to produce
perfect blacks and accurate color the
micro LED does not sacrifice brightness
or viewing angle either and the Samsung
micro LED is modular meaning any size
you want
any configuration you can think of this
tvs design transforms the concept of
what's possible simply put this is the
future of television and it's going to
make a significant impact on
industry beyond our booth starting
tomorrow be sure to stop by and see it
introducing our even slimmer sleeker and
more powerful PC the Samsung notebook 9
pen it is our lightest and most durable
tore one PC ever giving you the power
flexibility to work wherever you are it
weighs only 2.2 pounds and has a 360
degree rotating hinge for optimal
display Samsung flip is a portable fully
integrated and interactive whiteboard
that can connect to your PC and your
phone so you can easily share and markup
content together as a team so let's take
a look at how it works we were working
on a presentation and I want to make a
few changes and this is not gonna take
long
so here is the notebook 9 pen and the
last slide that we were working on and I
just have one suggestion that I want to
add in here I'd like to slide this over
and we've been talking about this target
consumer all day and I'd like to go
ahead and make that a graphic on the
side there very cool so red hair and all
right
you love it exactly perfect rendering so
with my no date I simply tap to connect
using NFC technology
and like that I have video and a two-way
control of my father very cool
just as Samsung led the implementation
of 3G and 4G technologies it's only
natural that we are taking the lead in
5g and in the u.s. after successful 5g
trials with Verizon in seven cities we
announced last week that Verizon has
selected Samsung for the launch of its
first 5g commercial service in
Sacramento later this year our
intelligent digital cockpit shown for
the first time here at CES 2018 securely
delivers greater productivity and
personalization with countless apps and
enterprise services the digital cockpit
merges the instrument cluster and the
entertainment systems of the car into
one the second technology I want to
share is our new telematics control unit
or TCU our cars are no longer islands
they have to communicate with traffic
lights instruments infrastructure and
even other cars on the road telematics
is what makes these connections possible
I'm proud to announce we have already
signed a leading European automaker as
the first customer for this 5g
telematics solution ever here at CES we
are also introducing driveline our new
platform for autonomous driving designed
by Samsung in close collaboration with
Harman driveline combines modular
hardware and software with an open
ecosystem to accelerate best-in-class
solutions thank you and have a great CES
