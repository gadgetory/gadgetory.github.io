this is the very beta version of the new
digg reader so the new digg reader looks
basically like your standard RSS reader
it looks a lot like Google Reader on the
left you've got your all feed of all
your subscriptions you've got folders
popular stories that you've dug this
first version is basically only for
Google Reader subscribers that's the
only feed you can import is from google
reader and that's where all of these are
these feeds are from so as you can see
on the right you can dig stories the
save stories there are also the standard
keyboard shortcuts for scrolling and
they're pretty fast jay moves down k
moves up s is for save d is for dig
another neat thing about the Digg reader
is you can sign in with Instapaper
pocket or readability and it will
remember your choice so the icon for
Instapaper is showing up here because
we're logged in with Instapaper so to
add a feed or folder just go to add
enter your feed URL and the future load
as you're looking at your feed you'll
see dots these orange dots appear on the
side of the headline these dots indicate
popularity with other reader users so
the dots go from one to three the more
dots there are the more popular the
story is the idea is that if you're
scrolling really fast for your feed you
can see which store is maybe you should
look at first so right now there's kind
of a lot missing from this version of
digg reader you can't mark stories as
unread the fab icons haven't imported
for your feeds which kind of gives the
whole thing like this black and white
look besides that it works for loading
and reading feeds so I went to dig and I
saw what the reader looks like in their
designs and I have high hopes for it but
right now the first version is missing a
lot of things it has a lot of bugs and
it might not be convincing for users who
are trying to find a solution for their
RSS needs by the time that Google Reader
shuts down the Digg reader is rolling
out to beta users today but it's not
really going to be ready for the public
until Wednesday next week which is still
a full week before Google Reader shuts
down hopefully the team
can get it together and fix some of
these problems basically what they told
me is that they would have preferred to
have six months they built it in half
the time but they're going to continue
to work on it and hopefully it'll
eventually reach parity with google
