where I'm flying put a lot starfox as a
kid I don't know you just get like
locked in and like you're inside the
drone and then it makes sense it's like
at first it makes no sense and then it
makes perfect sense
and you're just flying
hey everybody it's been popper from the
verge I'm here at CES 2015 out in the
middle of the mountains in Las Vegas
Nevada enjoying a beautiful sunset and
my first ever drone rodeo
so we've been out here doing drone
racing is that a thing is that a sport
is that what hobbyists do what is drone
racing it's definitely in the Hobby
world right now and it's starting to
become more and more popular and it's
it's kind of reminiscent of like hot
rodding days you know where there's a
lot of tinkering required in the tools
typically pretty much all drone racing
now is done first-person because it
really it's very immersive as you saw
but it also forces you to really project
yourself into the vehicle if you race
off the tablet or another display
there's there is a tendency to look up a
lot and that really takes you out of the
feel of the whole race
we do find that spectators who come they
want to pay back you know they want to
put on a set so they can they can watch
the land race and people who have gotten
really into it are so good it's it's
ridiculous
it's really awesome you should try
should I give this one a test sure go
nuts you're not gonna hurt it so feel
free to let loose nice shot
you can stomp on it you can roll your
car over it when we all started flying a
few years ago we would meet together a
bunch of artists and robot guys meet on
Friday nights and we'd have a Fight Club
we'd be smashing our robots together
when we started working with drones we
immediately started fighting our drones
but a couple years ago we were using
commercial products and they didn't
really hold up very well they would
crash and break and that really inspired
us to figure out how to make an airframe
that could take that abuse
ready to fight and they are the basic
drone combat game that we play is kind
of like sumo wrestling the arena is the
ring and if you get knocked onto the
ground or if you get caught up in the
net that's a point against you so each
player starts with three points the
first person to reach zero is eliminated
so you're doing anything you can flying
maneuvering knocking the other guy down
to get him to either crash or fall into
the net Oh once that happens the player
has 90 seconds to get their drone flying
again the neck would mean just turning
it over and turning it on but it could
also mean replacing motors replacing
internal components and it's amazing to
see some of these pilots who can do
these total teardowns and rebuilds in 90
seconds
in the design and development process we
shot a 12-gauge shotgun and landed it on
the water just to see if we could
submerge it and fly away we flew it
through flamethrowers dropped it from
hundreds of feet smashed it thousands of
times and the original airframe is
actually the airframe that I normally
fly in the combat arena today after all
that abuse shooting and everything it's
still good enough to fly in the arena
sad sick dead but not forgotten
