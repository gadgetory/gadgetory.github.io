dystopian one the Statue of Liberty gone
the Brooklyn Bridge obliterated entire
regions have been terraformed I'm Audi
Robertson with average since the first
iPhone Apple has relied on Google Maps
with the latest iOS update however Apple
has entirely replaced Google Maps with
its own in-house mapping system it's
probably the biggest change in this
update and although we're told Apple has
been working on this tool for five years
it's still nowhere near the level of
quality of the app it replaces in iOS 6
we have built an entire new mapping
solution from the ground up and it is
beautiful as more people update their
iPhones iPads and iPod touches this week
users have taken to Twitter and Tumblr
to showcase the most egregious failures
collapse buildings walking directions
that lead nowhere and satellite images
completely obscured by clouds we spend
an afternoon traveling in and out of
Manhattan for walking and driving the
app is actually pretty problem free
in fact turn-by-turn driving directions
are a great addition Apple uses Yelp for
points of interest like restaurants or
gas stations that can sometimes make the
selection of icons seem a little random
but it also means you can get things
like pricing and reviews at least in the
US what's lost in the process however is
all public transportation tapping the
bus icon now prompts you to open or
download a local transit app instead of
offering built-in directions transit
apps have come a long way but they still
can't offer the same integrated
experience as Google Maps and you could
end up downloading a new app every time
you visit a new city
the situation is murkier outside the US
users are now seeing blank pages where
they once saw buildings or detailed
highway data
Apple has misidentified entire towns as
hospitals or misclassified and nursery
as an airport to some extent you can
expect these kind of glitches with any
new product but Apple is facing tough
competition from the ubiquitous Google
map the new maps are also arguably the
most front-facing feature in iOS 6 which
means Apple's not going to have much
else to lean on as it tries to market
the new iPhone as for Google though many
expected it to release a third-party
version of its now egg size map service
all it's done so far is remind users of
its updated Android
and say that its goal is to quote make
Google Maps accessible for everyone
there is a web version but it's no
replacement for a native solution
ultimately Apple created this problem
for itself with iOS 6 the company wanted
to wean itself off Google as much as
possible that's been accomplished Google
Maps in YouTube
both beloved by users are now gone from
iOS 6 the real question is whether these
victories for apples are victories for
its customers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
