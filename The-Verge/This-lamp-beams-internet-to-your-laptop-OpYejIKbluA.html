your computer it's called my life I and
that sounds like Wi-Fi except it does it
without wireless radio it uses light
instead if you have a TV remote you know
use infrared to beam out you know
changes to the channel this is the same
thing but doing way more it uses
infrared to stand the internet down to
computer and then from your computer
back up to a lamp and then out to your
router and to whatever website you're
trying to use so we're sitting here at
CES and we're gonna try it out this is
my own laptop
I just turned Wi-Fi off I don't have an
internet connection so when you choose
this dongle I'm gonna plug it into my
computer to the actual USB port and they
told me that I won't need to install
anything it should just work so let me
see if I can yeah wait it's blinking
green right now and I'm just gonna go to
the verge I think it's loading the verge
yeah I just pulled up our website it
works that's cool it shows me a few big
benefits here one is security right so
instead of having a Wi-Fi network that
somebody can tap into there's just this
infrared that is really short range it's
going from here to here and it's going
to be a lot harder to monitor what
you're doing they're also selling a pro
version that encrypts all the traffic to
the other benefit is supposed to get
both one because there aren't radio
waves now very important to know that
radio waves are not actually known to be
harmful to the human body so that's not
really a benefit but if you are a person
who
worries about these things you know the
option is there the downside though is
that at least for this initial version
it's it's very short-range this is a
desk lamp and if I move it too far away
you can see these lights start to go
down to show that my signal is breaking
the company OLED comm plans to introduce
more lights over time they're gonna do
ceiling lights and wall lights when they
imagine that eventually we were to light
up an entire room using these and also
you know get your in it that way which
will give you a little bit more range of
movement that might also hurt the
security but it still won't go through
walls and so it's gonna be confined to a
chef review it set up it the time being
it seems like it is maybe best for like
a really crazy business person who like
wants a small range of movement and the
security element is sort of weird
because you could just plug it in
Ethernet jack into your computer because
that's really what this is if you see
this yellow cable over here that's just
an Ethernet jack it's actually powering
the lamp to the lamp itself is a pretty
standard smart desk lamp it can change
between warm and cool color temperatures
so from bluer to more orange you can set
a timer to turn it on and off over time
you can also use an app to control when
the internet connection is activated
that's actually one of the weirder
things in order to me manners of the
lamp you need to use an app and to use
the app you have to use your phone which
requires Wi-Fi there's also a web app so
you could theoretically then go to a
hardwired connection but if you're
trying to totally avoid Wi-Fi that's
there's just really not a possibility so
the selling point here is really the
security you could just using ethernet
cord it's dead but there's something
very neat about
having this stylish lamp my fly is
launching on IndieGoGo is actually
already live you can go there and back
it for eight hundred and forty dollars
to get the lamp and the dongle is
supposed to be available sometime later
this year
