Verge and we're looking at Sony's two
new lens cameras the QX 100 and the QX
10 so here on my iPhone 5 I just paired
this minute ago I have connected the QX
100 this is the bigger of the two models
it's $499 and it's as you can see kind
of big in fact the whole camera is
inside this lens itself there's a zoom
button and a shutter button on the side
there's a sensor in here everything you
don't actually need to connect it to
your phone all that this is is just a
detachable mount that you can attach to
almost any phone it's really easy to
snap on and it's totally irrelevant to
the actual mechanism of shooting it it
uses Wi-Fi to connect between the two
and let your phone act just as a
viewfinder this is Sony's PlayMemories
app which is not my favorite camera app
but it's fine and you can just take
pictures and it's a little slow there's
a little lag and it pulls a smaller
version of the picture from your camera
or from the lens to your phone and you
can share a picture as soon as you take
it or you can just go back and keep
shooting pictures it stores the full res
images on the lens itself or you can set
it to bring them over but that'll take a
while because they're obviously just
bigger files so the one of the biggest
things about this is obviously other
than just a bigger sensor you get actual
honest-to-god optical zoom which is nice
you get 10x on the smaller qx10 and this
because it has a bigger sensor you only
get 3.6 but the pictures here also look
a lot better and you get some real
camera features it's basically like
having an rx100 just strapped to the
back of your phone which is pretty cool
again the Wi-Fi is a little slow and
laggy I think it'll get better our
connections not great here and you have
to use this app to take all the pictures
you want but for the most part it's a
pretty solid option for using your phone
and still having a pretty good camera
it's big and clunky and $500 here but
that's pretty much what you get so
that's the QX 100 and the QX 10 which
works just exactly the same is this guy
it's much smaller obviously and has much
more digital zoom it's also 250 dollars
instead of $4.99 but it's a much smaller
sensor it's like a cyber shot from Sony
instead of the rx100 which takes
incredible pictures so those are the 2
new lens cameras they work for just
about any phone they work pretty well so
far it's kind of a weird idea that I
wasn't sure was ever gonna work but it
seems to work pretty well and the
pictures we've taken so far looked
really great so that's the QX 100 and
the Q
10 the lens cameras from Sony</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
