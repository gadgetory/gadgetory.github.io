here taking a look at four new phones
from Motorola in the Moto G 6 and e5
series these phones are all going to
sell on the 2 to 3 hundred dollar range
but while they aren't flagships they are
really important phones the Moto G
Series is Motorola's top seller and
apparently it's the number one in its
class the Moto e isn't that far behind
it and this year they're even starting
to look a little bit more like flagships
that they have 18 by 9 displays
octa-core processors and dual cameras in
some cases too so let's take a look at
them so this is the Moto G 6 and the
Moto G 6 play the Moto G is always in
Motorola's $200 or so phone line big
deal this year is that there is going to
feel and look like much higher in phones
with 18 by 9 displays and they have
these nice curved backs that really look
very nice there are some differences
between them the Moto G is a little bit
more expensive as a higher resolution
display and a dual camera lets you do
all kinds of focus tricks in portrait
mode the Moto G 6 play is slightly lower
end it's gonna be a little bit cheaper
but the big deal about this one is that
it's a four thousand milliamp hour
battery which Motorola says is probably
the last you well beyond today so one
other cool feature on the g6 is that
they're a bunch of gestures built into
the home button so I can swipe to the
sides gets the app switcher I can just
tap it to get to the home screen I can
do back to navigate back a page and
basically it just takes over for all the
buttons that would normally be built in
to the bottom of the display that was on
the g5 too but it has a really
pronounced effect here because by
removing that we get much more screen
space and it looks really really nice in
this tall screen now we're taking a look
at the Moto e v plus and low E v play
music the little Uihlein isn't as nice
as the Moto G line but it's not really
the case of the Plus model and it's a
big 6 inch display and the really big
feature here is the battery it is a five
thousand milliamp hour battery which is
more even than the Moto G 6 play and
motorola says gonna last you well into a
second-deck Moto e 5 play on the other
hand isn't quite as nice it looks a
little bit older it has a 16 by 9
display with big bezels on the top and
bottom that's a plastic back I usually
think that both of these phones still
feel really nice they're a little bit
thicker
the moto G line they don't feel quite as
fancy and for high-end but they still
seem like much nicer phones and they
actually are for the price now look I
totally understand if you're really
confused about how all these phones
break down that's why we're making this
graphic right here to explain the
differences between all these phones
basically the Moto G's are higher-end
for the most part than the Moto G's but
they really do start to blur in the
middle this year
so if batteries your biggest concern
there is some reason to look at the Moto
e line over the Moto G line
we're not pricing information on the
Moto e line because it's going to be a
tube Motorola's carrier partners they're
usually any $100 or so range but
motorola is hoping that with carrier
discounts they might even go well below
that all of these phones are supposed to
be available around the same time later
this spring in May or June you might
have noticed that there are actually two
additional phones we don't have here the
g6 plus and the e5 just regular edition
that's because neither of those phones
are coming to the United States there
might eventually but at least right now
we're just starting with these four
thanks for watching if you want more on
the g6 and E 5 we're gonna have a ton of
coverage at the verge comm if you're
looking for something else to watch be
sure to check out SD Nation on YouTube
they're part of the same network as the
verge they make a bunch of really fun
sports videos so go check them out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
