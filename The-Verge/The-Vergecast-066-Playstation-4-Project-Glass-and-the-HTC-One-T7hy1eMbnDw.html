week of February 18th 2013
I'm Josh Topolsky I'm Nilay Patel yeah
Ross are you are you anyone's Ross is
not with us we just have a frozen Ross
Miller Ross Miller would have been with
us today but he died tragically five
minutes ago he died a terrible his
bandwidth died as a human he's fine
anyhow this is the verge cast we're
doing to hang out because this week has
been insane and we're all incredibly
busy and oh here's Ross is joining us
now
Ross's back he claims to be back no
didn't Ross get a new apartment recently
oh I'm actually no I first I have not
number two
I'm in South Georgia right now oh that
would explain why your bandwidth is so
terrible the South yes I apologize to
all of our southern listeners or viewers
for where you live can you oh we're not
on yet no no isn't like where the South
we obviously they can't stream it right
yeah yeah I have no idea what's great so
anyway this is the verge cast where we
discuss the vici technology culture and
what a week by the way it's been in
technology culture
really pretty monumental and and by the
way not over yet
in fact I'm working on a story right now
for tomorrow which I'm not going to talk
about in detail but I will say that it
is a very special story that you won't
find anywhere else and I'm very excited
about it it's about giving birth yeah
your tweet a c-section I did it I'm
going to go to tweet live I'm gonna buy
the c-section
oh god that's 18 hours of six 18 hours
of six I mean that would be that would
be something like why don't we where is
the feature-length film done in six
second installment yeah here we Storify
a vine I know Adam Goldberg is doing
these little bits but I'm saying like
let's actually film the scenes as you
would in an entire film but just let
them out you know distribute them in six
second chunks yeah
anyhow this is not what we're here to
talk about all right Ross what is a what
are the one of the topics of the day you
you're the list holder here what do we
have to discuss well we will have a
special guest later talk about some of
the big events of today you're boring
everybody
fairly late station for about last
night's ps4 okay you guys did it and you
did a live thing afterwards which I
really enjoyed and by the way you both
live so you and Chris Grant look so
sharp
yes we both had green dress shirts on
we're very worried about that green that
was the thing last night great green
plaid I outside of the ps4 so I were
there I was there that was cool I went
David Pierce and Paul Janos there was a
party I have to say really like
mismanaged chaotic event right so that's
weird I think they I think they realize
that ever happens I was it's very
strange for Sony in New York to like
throw something together that that felt
that just chaotic so like there are
literally like journalists like lining
up for like hours outside in the cold
like they had bouncers who I didn't
think realize it wasn't like a concert
it was at a concert venue so bouncers
like shoving people like you can't come
in yet like we're professionals where
where was it it was at Paris the hammer
the hammer really above where we do on
the verge it was it the Hammerstein
Ballroom yeah yeah and we were you know
people outside it was chaos and I'm like
how was the visit venue can have
concerts at it that are like well run
all the time with hundreds of people
going in and like Sony can't figure it
out anyway so they started and it was
very obvious immediately that they were
trying to get a jump on Microsoft ahead
of e3 because Microsoft's obviously
gonna show a new Xbox this year Sony is
you know behind in the race a little bit
but III so even a ways off I feel like
they're compelled by something that they
know it's the rumors are that Microsoft
is gonna announce something right that
that's like the kind of like I feel like
there's this floating idea right now
that everybody seems to be sort of
winking and nudging about that nobody
really is confirmed yet or can get a
good confirmation of that Microsoft is
inevitably going to do something before
e3 right and I think the sense is that
Microsoft is also more ready right their
console will be finished in some way
so but there's also the other thing no
silly remember to and if we want to
figure out who the audience was for this
like he talked 11 architecture it feels
like a developer focused kind of event
yeah right if the Game Developers
Conference where they really have to
hype people's like building base making
games so that was a weird thing so they
you know if you saw the coverage on I'm
sure he did they went on for two hours
two hours and 15 minutes I was long it
felt like it was never going to end
I'm he was so it was so long that I just
like at one point just email and stuff
and then he went back and they were
still talking like so they opened with
like Ross saying they open with the
architecture you know it's a souped-up
PC you know they're gonna use an x86 you
know processes come on this is a big
change few change the money they were
making basically custom guts before ice
and now they've gone completely in the
opposite direction and they're basically
saying we're taking off-the-shelf stuff
we're gonna you know have a car I think
there's something to do a custom GPU
right is that right I mean it's gonna be
custom ish right they're gonna they're
gonna go AMD AMD is gonna make them AMD
parts and make something custom I will
say this about it there's been a lot of
talk about that let's just like pause
there for a second yeah there's no talk
about that I actually feel like this is
kind of a positive for the industry
where you know if I'm a developer and
even maybe this is an upgradable I don't
know the system maybe the you think you
can swap out a graphics card in the
future you know swap out a GPU you know
because they could do that in this
situation and and I think it's kind of
amazing that I don't have to if I'm a
developer I don't have to think like I'm
gonna code for xbox pc and sony now it's
like I'm just like x86 is where I'm
headed
essentially you know there are obviously
major issues you know you gotta still
port stuff but it sounded to me like one
of their goals here is making the port a
much easier process so to me it's kind
of like opens the floodgates for what
developers can do in terms of designing
these titles and trying to get you know
great-looking and great playing stuff on
every platform right so that I mean I
think that's true except for Nintendo
the ps3 was a pretty much more honestly
difficult platform to develop for
because it was so customs
you know they brought out mark Cerny
who's our ahead of like system
architecture and he's famous on the game
the polygon guys were really excited
about it he was there and he's spent a
lot of time talking about how they don't
need to do the Cell processor with like
blast rendering or whatever the hell it
does and how they can use these
commodity parts to to make a better
experience but like at that moment Sony
had immediately lost the plot right
because they hadn't they were already
into the guts of developer stuff with
this presentation they were very far
away from how will the ps4 be awesome
for you the gamer right and then they
tried to get back there but they they
didn't ever do it you know they showed
off a bunch of like in-game stuff some
of which we've seen so should watch dogs
but we saw that at e3 yeah they showed I
think there was another they showed
another trailer and somebody from our
staff like I am to me to be like just so
you know this trailer is a year old it
was that it was the square annex 1 the
square Enix month up and then what
actually looked and that was that game
look to the worst so I started off at
this high point of like look at how
amazing we can do with all these new
tools and this developer stuff and then
when they started bringing out the games
the graphics actually in my opinion got
progressively worse yeah I stuff got old
or not I I agree I think there was this
kind of cheerleading about you know
developers in that you know this is
gonna be you know an easy platform for
you to work on it's gonna be really
powerful we have the power of the cloud
so I actually think just edit a if we
just back up for a sec you know what
they announced was anywhere I think you
were kind of getting into this but let's
like do the high level stuff right they
announced that a new consoles coming
it's gonna be called the PlayStation 4
the ps4 it's going to have a completely
redesigned UI it's gonna be very
powerful based on x86 architecture there
are a number of cloud-based advances
that they're making that I think are
kind of fascinating one of them is games
that you can play while you're
downloading them with you so my
understanding is basically they're
taking the Gaikai technology which they
bought which is streaming technology
game streaming technology and they're
saying like we're basically gonna stream
this thing while you download in the
background I mean that's my impression
they also they also
said that you could you know is try
before you buy which is Gaikai again
which isn't it kind of crazy to think
about like you know when you wanted to
try something before you're still
downloading like a multi gig yeah yeah
the other thing is and I think that's
gonna lead to a lot of impulse purchase
I mean I know for me like it's good well
I think it'll cut both ways right but
then they also said that the Vita you'll
be able to play ps4 games on your Vita
yes right you know just kind of in a way
is like do I even bother introducing a
console why not just update the software
on the ps3 if that if the Vita can play
the games
I think naming the game I mean you know
obviously I'm saying it's but you could
conceivably do the same thing on a ps3
with a new controller right right so
anyhow but I mean that was very
interesting so they the cloud is a big
part they mentioned social networks they
basically said you're gonna use Facebook
or Twitter or whatever to be your the
way you connect with I mean they
intimated that they were would be moving
away from this siloed we're managing a
social network more into were you than
Facebook to Facebook can you stream are
there two big social network partners
yeah and there and they're doing stuff
with like being able to stream your
games to friends and yeah the controller
has a share button on it yeah they they
actually want you as you're playing with
a controller in your hand to push the
button that says share and either I
think it's always recording the last 15
minutes of what you do so you know
always just like send that and that
bumps it out to you stream is out of the
idea yeah so that's actually really cool
I mean they they show this weird game
that using the Move controller that was
kind of like a you playing with puppets
okay that's not a game molecule that's
whatever it is I mean it probably will
develop into something that is is some
type of game probably it's a guy's
LittleBigPlanet so that it's pretty
close like what they always do and I
think but I think that what's
interesting about that is they were kind
of putting on this performance and I
think you can see some really cool stuff
that could happen in the future when
you've got all this power all this
processing power and live processing
power and you're able to do something
like put on a performance like that
using avatars and stream it live I mean
I think there's a whole new world of
weird crazy that they're gonna get
into with that which I really love and
so so any hi and then they they announce
a bunch of titles for the ps4 and they
showed gameplay from with these titles
you know they showed some early gameplay
they should live gameplay there no they
only showed live gameplay twice they
should kills for Killzone yeah and watch
dogs watch dogs yeah I think more than
twice then are you sure
ok well at any rate kills down and watch
dogs to the most graphically intense
games that I've ever seen you know you
were there now I was watching on the
livestream
was there any lag during those games uh
when they switched so that these you
know these demos are highly produced so
what we saw as gameplay was like
bracketed by big full motion video
sequences but they but they weren't but
those weren't those were not
pre-rendered those were in-game we yeah
it's hard to know so there was a thing I
think that's what they were saying that
was like a lag there was one moment of
like very distinct lag I think it was
during Killzone when it switched from
video to the guy actually controlling
with a controller ok and there was like
a stutter that I think everybody in the
theater noticed but might not have been
apparent on the watch was it but was it
it wasn't like a continuous thing it was
just like a glitch kind of lag yeah I
mean it didn't look it all looked great
I think me when I when I took away from
from these games was they all look
amazing
right particularly I think Killzone when
they there was a sequence with an
African explosion or there's like dust
in the air and they had this like
incredible depth of field and all this
refraction and like that's clearly no
console to do that now then there are
other parts where it was like this looks
like a slightly more clear ps3 or
slightly more clear Xbox and then there
were other parts where I was like this
just looks like an Xbox your ps3 but
what got to me was all the games are the
same so like the physics in the motion
and the stuff that you're doing still
looks like the video games right it was
beautiful and intense some of it looked
real some of a little bit the same yeah
all of it looks like video games well I
think I almost named John was you see
any force the shooter is the race I mean
I think and I'm gonna get to that but I
think that there is we're gonna have
there's
gonna be a couple of years here where
were you answer this question for me
they have a new controller they didn't
show the console right they didn't show
us the piece they showed us the
controller right and one of the big
features of control has this light bar
on the front that that connect like
depth camera sees so you can move that
around I guess it has a share button and
it has a touch pad none of those games
used any of those features right well I
think one of the games we saw use the
features of this new controller I think
I think beyond the share button why is
it great but I'm not sure about that
actually I think I think which game used
any of the features
they definitely showed the touchscreen
being useful they showed it once they
showed it once right at the very
beginning when they were when they were
ensuring the controller I don't remember
who was he actually took he was holding
it like this and he took his hand off
and looked around using the touchpad and
then what's the witness I think it was
the witness well it wasn't a puzzle game
I think it was kills him I think it was
that one as well
he was a little early he took his hand
off he looked around using the touch pad
and then he went back to standard
controller configuration either way even
if it had been using the whole time they
were so subtle and so not important to
what was happening
the focus was look at these beautiful
graphics in these games that we know are
going to be popular not we've built a
new controller and here's how we're
gonna write and they didn't they weren't
showing you know where is like
Microsoft's last you know big
announcements have been around look at
this incredible innovative game played
the Wii U was all based around this
incredible innovative gameplay this was
like look at these amazing graphics and
yeah we got this innovative gameplay
stuff too that we'll show you later on
but it was like rad how awesome our
graphics are and I think that is it that
is a testament to you know somewhat the
the history of gaming now that you
they're kind of working against and I
think this to your point Neal about how
everything kind of looked like a video
game you're working against you know
years and years of this I can grain like
here's what the motion looks like here's
what yeah here's how characters interact
and so you know I did think like and
then killzone demo when it got into the
actual gameplay I thought there were
moments when it was just like just like
wow moment where it just felt like the
the amount of texture the amount of
like atmosphere that was happening was
just kind of overwhelming and I was
really impressed by it and I think you
know if you look at Jen I mean I played
this is actually really good to talk
about for me I play dead space the I've
just finished the first dead space a few
weeks ago which was made in released in
2008 I believe which is still like a
like later generation Xbox game and I'm
now playing dead space 3 and the the
difference between those games in terms
of graphics is like kind of blows my
mind it's kind of like I can't even
understand how they've been able to pull
out like what they've done in the newest
one first is like what they what we
thought they were doing it that like the
forefront of Technology in 2008 you know
so I feel like there's gonna be a
learning curve where people have to
understand what this hardware can do
that always happens but but I think
what's most striking about the
announcement last night is and what I
was struck by at e3 this year when I'm
constantly kind of like blown away by is
the incredible lack of imagination
the game developer seemed to have when
it comes to when it comes to what their
games are gonna be about like right no
matter what it is the David cage games
beyond two souls kill zone obviously the
what was the what was the watchdogs a
drive Club is the driving game you know
you're driving games it was infamous and
there's what I mean it was infamous
right it's all like here's what's gonna
happen okay you're gonna be somewhere
you can you can shoot something out of
your hand or you can shoot something out
of a gun and it's gonna be in somebody's
excuse that bullet or that beam of
energy is going into somebody's head
that's just going to happen that's the
way the game is and like what's so weird
to me is even like beyond two souls it's
it's it's the premise of the game seems
like the set up and it's like but it
feels like the you know the setup could
allow for all kinds of really amazing
different things to happen and maybe it
will but at the end of the day there
it's like okay here's the hook you're
gonna shoot people and kill people and
like blow stuff up but this time it's a
girl or like this time it's a little
girl
game remember me where it's like you're
in futuristic neo Paris you've got to
take down the government but this time
you're a female and I just feel like
there are so many things you could do in
the game there I mean they haven't even
has anybody ever tried to do anything
different in a game okay it's either
like shooting or it's like the the braid
stuff where it's just like this
whimsical magical weird like yeah I owe
this and I judge the witness was right
the witness we did it looks great it
looks really cool yeah it's like this is
the best update to missed that is that
right right it's like why not show me a
game with the with the visual complexity
in the world of watchdogs where you know
I'm a you know I'm a you know EMT or
something and I'm like literally doing
surgery on people at crime scenes or
something like where I'm like driving
around this like give me any I'm just
like whatever give me a game where you
do other things besides shoot people and
then what's funny is s then the
disconnect between the plots of these
games and the system that they're
running on so Sony is like they're deep
in this social they're deep into
obviously online distribution is gonna
be big for the ps4 so they were going on
and on about how you know there's a
camera sitting there it's like watching
you it's watching your controller so
that's weird it monitors your activities
and what you like and what you're buying
and what your friends are like and what
you're playing with your friends so it
world right so it pre downloads games
that it might think it thinks you might
want to buy so that when you impulse buy
the games are already there waiting for
you so it's like learning about you it's
like consumer paradise manifesting this
consumerism no it's like all the games
are like in a world where everything is
a camera yeah I love the new theme of
games now they're like oh we've been
noticing this privacy stuff happened
we've been noticing this surveillance
like the best one was the game what was
the game it was infamous 3 or whatever
yeah where it's like a guy comes you're
being watched all the time but and it's
like all this setup like wow this is
real drones and this is serious heavy
political stuff I'm like ok this is
political intrigue this is you know
talking about humanity like what where
we headed he's like what if humans began
to mutate with superhuman powers like
what what if we actually like I don't
know I'm not saying like you're gonna
play a game where you're the president
or whatever though I have to say if you
created a game with the visual
complexity and the complexity in terms
of the world of something like watchdogs
and I had to play as the president
actually doing presidential stuff like
that would be kind of a cool game like I
would be into that where you have a
briefing every morning yeah take a
breathing make decisions about diplomacy
but like actually walk like to that you
know the West Wing and stop like you
know unless I mean actually walk into
the West Wing each other's five minutes
why the peoples are talking about
walking around look real quick let's
let's let's look dieter getting and
start talking to you yeah very paper
waiting for us to four-year can't here
are you
I'm new audio got on to meet yourself
dude I'm such a noob yeah alright every
shut up dieter where is it get it up get
it up right now you have one they've got
to Chrome pixel dude I'm going to say no
here it is wait good dieter dieter open
it up Oh touch open it touch the pigs
awesome show us the money oh yeah
show us that 3-2 screen it looks like
this the elite book I love it god I love
it look he's touching something look at
this touch it Thank You Birds men
Angry Birds VADs touching it's good look
at this this is the future I think you
have to talk so you're on the main one
right okay so uh playing Angry Birds
it's some know people can select me like
you don't know you can do that later
here's the thing like the the hardware
that looks really good I mean it's like
it's incredibly like square it's the
same thickness all the way through from
front to back
Square squares in square it's making to
come back it says gunmetal finish it's
you know a chiclet keyboard and then
comes back backlit keyboard backlit
keyboard oh yeah
the touchscreen I mean the it's what is
it 2560 by 1700 I think is the dieter
does it does it do this does it have
them you notify all the stuff you read
not does it have this new notification
thing that we saw this notification
pop-up in Chrome OS it is not and I
think it's we're just waiting for like a
update on it again but this is like the
Chrome OS is the Chrome OS I have on my
Chromebook right now yeah but I think
things coming very soon so can you tell
me look at all these hands you're
putting on so it's some yeah so the the
touch screen like they don't get how bad
that yours yeah they're doing something
weird with the inertia on it but it's
terrible or you know chunky and it was
the same way when they were demoing the
photos live on stage but check this out
when I go to the touchpad and do it it's
totally awesome and fast and fun doesn't
make any sense what is that what is the
CPU in that
so it's an Intel Core i5 I don't know
the clock speed and it's got I think 32
it's got 32 gigs of storage I don't know
the Rama let's discuss the most
important spectator how much does that
thing cost so this is the Verizon LTE
version and so it costs fourteen hundred
and forty nine alright so I only version
is $1300 I want to talk about I want to
talk about let's get I want to do real
talk here for a second okay real talk
why why who is the person yeah
who is the person now look by the way I
want one don't get me wrong you know but
I have like a stack of things that I
wanted Cydia next to my right you know
that I regret buying who is the person
like this Vectrex
who is the person who's going to spend
$1300 on Eric Schmidt pee all the people
who work Eric shy yeah Google people
readable he you don't put you don't push
it on a production line because Eric
Schmidt wants a once it 31 dude they did
that that's my my personal conspiracy
theory about the Nexus line on Android
is they needed to make a high-end phone
for their employees to use to develop
Android on and they so they need to make
like 10,000 of them so the developers
nightmare what the hell let's just make
a hundred doesn't anybody like with this
a Chromebook pixel to me some sounds
like a developer's nightmare no no
developer uses a Chromebook right I mean
how did that allows we be what web
developers I mean if your Chromebook
developers yeah exactly
developers are using Chromebooks I just
feel like it's kind of a crazy like I
don't understand it I touch screen is
there anything special about the touch
screen like new functionality is there
any it's a it's a touch screen they
gotta wait for you know developers to
support it you can't pinch-to-zoom
I'm sure that there is somewhere that
there's multi-touch unlike some Photos
app or something that I haven't found
yet no this thing is like it's a big
middle finger from Eric Schmidt in
Google to Microsoft and they could just
turn around and crank out a laptop
that's highly SPECT it looks good is a
trackpad any good you know here's an
idea why not try on this with a really
good trackpad and I say something has a
nice screen and they're like screw you
Microsoft this is the future but like I
say something super nice super nice
design new hardware design right new
design language for them kind of with
this boxy look super high resolution
display very fast for very responsive
LTE I think they I think they messed up
on where to put this the specs I think
this is the Dex this is the new Nexus
design people forgot they're like does
that does the LT go in the Nexus or the
$1300 Chromebook I can't remember
oh the chrome buff is re 14 how do they
convince Verizon and put LTE in this
piece of junk right how about if I can
buy this how come I can buy this off
contract and use it on Verizon LTE but I
can't buy an X's off contract and use it
on Verizon LT didn't your dealer do they
know what I don't want to ask them that
question do they give any indication of
who this is for who's gonna buy a $1300
laptop that only runs Chrome I mean
everybody asked him that question over
and over again and the answer is you
know people who look want to live in the
cloud that's their response people that
believe in the cloud and want that
terabyte of storage yeah by the way this
is the Chromebook remember they very
early on they're like you can drop it
you can break it what if you lose it
it's like what if you lose your $1400
writing book
you're a book no this is really funny a
few people have tweeted this a B so it
comes with three years of one terabyte
of Google
storage and Google Drive which is great
and I think that would cost you $1,800
we just like paid for it right but that
is so arbitrary because you know that
storage actually costs Google $0 it
doesn't mean anything it's like that
that's how much they priced it so I I
there just tricking you so by the time
my chance to ask questions came around I
had two questions because everything
else had already been asked the first
one was are they making a profit on it
they say yes they are and the second one
is they eat it yeah there were they
making it they're making it in Taiwan
there it's not a us-made device the
Nexus Q look you know what chrome can do
for you it can integrate you into Google
services and it can browse the web which
has tons of Google ads on it why do they
need to make a profit on this product
well forget about that the better
question is not about whether they're
making a profit or how the better
question is what who is this for like
wow I mean yes they say it's for
whatever but let's talk about what's
going on in the competitive landscape
okay for $1000 I can buy a MacBook Air
which is a very cave it's what I'm using
now is that for the 13-inch is $9.99 no
that's the 11 inch okay well I have a
13-inch but okay for the same price well
$12.99 for the xxx no I think it's 1199
for those really what is it can somebody
tell me if all we had a staff of people
who knew about technology Shawn knows a
Shawn dieter you and Shawn actually
behind us no pictures now yes it's 1199
1199 night for 1,200 bucks I can have a
completely cable fully-realized
Mac laptop the screen isn't is it a
touchscreen it's not high-resolution
yeah but it does about I'd say roughly a
million times more things than what a
Chromebook does like look I've tried to
use a Chromebook as my main computer and
it's just like kind of doesn't cut the
mustard I mean yeah there's a bunch of
stuff that's missing so people on our
staff who used Chromebooks are Adrian
and Chris Ziegler and both of them are I
love it I'm like why do you love it I
was like because it can't do anything
else yeah I use it when I have to out I
have to do work because I
Google Docs and like all I can do is
type and I'm like right here that's not
a good reason so dear this is what
$14.99 right now it's $12.99 for the
Wi-Fi only model right or you can take
200 ollars more and get the retina
MacBook Pro with the same specs right
which is also bonkers like so what
here's an idea just run full screen
Chrome on exactly the same experience
that you have with this thing I mean I
like I like the Chromebook idea they
just need to do a few things to make it
more like an actual computer here's the
things I don't have a problem with don't
have a problem with using Gmail in a you
know instance right don't have a problem
with browsing in an instance don't have
a problem if you have a good IRC client
there now seems to be one that you can
use in a browser don't have a problem
with that but there's a bunch of stuff
missing like ground notifications or
notifications of any type you don't get
anything like that there's nothing that
plugs into the core services of of
Chrome as a as an OS you know yeah so
it's like you're missing all of this
extra stuff all these things that I do
like I use fantastical which is like you
know a menu bar item that I can quickly
access my calendar you know it's it
automatically backs up my stuff to
Dropbox you know I have Google Drive and
Dropbox set up that's not something you
can really do it's like yeah you can go
get your stuff but you really can't yeah
you really can access it like you would
in a normal file system so it's like
basically you are it's still very much
that browser experience for 1,300 or
1,400 dollars I just feel like you're
really pushing your luck on how much
I'll accept a noncom plea I'm not gonna
be able to run powerful 3d games like I
could actually game on my computer if I
wanted to they won't look that great but
there's the option you know Angry Birds
is whatever I can play that on any
tablet in the world I think that Google
is maybe hoping that this is they've got
a chicken-and-egg problem with Chrome OS
they need real stuff developed for it
and they might have the hooks and API is
necessary to make that happen
but they don't have you know widespread
adoption especially with people using it
as their main machine and so I think
they're just they're like who's this for
I think it's for like developers to use
Chrome OS so that they can move the
state of the art forward on it so that
it actually does become a viable
competitor to other operating systems I
think that I you know what they're
hoping are located are they located
within Google
I've been selling this thing understand
why if that's the case why are they
seating this thing for free to everyone
here's what I understand why don't they
just take why didn't they just take the
Nexus 10 what's the resolution of the
screen of the Nexus 10 2560 by likes
it's super high super high yes just take
that screen blow it up a little bit and
give me some option to be able to run
like Android apps and Chrome on the same
thing brand Android in like even a an
environment so it was Chrome OS but then
there was Android next to it yeah it
would change the my entire conception
now right I mean just something just
give me something here you know give me
the Android notification system in
Chrome OS you know let me plug in like
okay here's my phone number and my you
know here's my Google Voice account or
something like where Google Voice
wouldn't be enough but let me plug in
you know my whatever my all my accounts
are that I'm already signing in with in
some way does this you can't even do
multiple account stuff in Chrome OS yet
right you can you can log out of your
account log into somebody else's account
no that's not what I was talking about
I'm saying oh my my on my Android device
if I have six gmail accounts I can log
in with all of them and I get
notifications for all of them and
they're all in my saying you know I mean
like there's not a unified inbox but all
that stuff is connected if somebody
messages me on gchat on one of my other
accounts you know it shows up on my
phone it's all this like what's like
kind of great about Android phones is
that it collects all of your stuff into
one place whereas you can't even do
anything that basic on it on a Chrome on
a Chromebook so it's like just give me
some of the Android functionality just
give me some of the ideas behind Android
to make this thing better right now it's
just you just added the touch screen and
a ton of money right now maybe it would
be great if the Chrome OS team in the
Android team like hung out and had lunch
more often did a hangout ride you know
those things together if they actually
got into a good what is do they have any
answers beyond for people who want to
live in the cloud people out man that's
the same answer for people who have the
other Chromebook yeah like okay I want
to live in the cloud but I'm gonna spend
like a thousand less dollars is that
gonna what a complete I mean this is a
fail and I just
like this will go down and like I
guarantee you you know it's fine
everybody at Microsoft laugh to Google
today yeah everybody at HP and apples on
the floor people they have a day off
yeah boy boys are the rest of the day
like to laugh just laughter no in all
seriousness I was talking to Michael
about this yesterday and and we were
talking about the pret can you hear me
okay Tim I might just go out we're good
hello can you hear me so we were talking
he's like what do you think if this if
you know if there's gonna be a
Chromebook this Chromebook pixel we saw
this video for do you think it'll cut be
really expensive
I was like man there's no way you know
the whole thing about Chromebook has
been like it's super affordable you know
even at the top end of Chromebook it was
like 500 400 500 bucks you know and I
was like no they're gonna I was like if
this thing's any more than like 600
bucks 700 bucks at the highest and like
that's how they're gonna kill it they're
gonna be like super high-resolution
touchscreen and it's $600 I could not
believe this price when I saw it today I
was like how is this in any way like an
advantage now like all of this stuff
being the same if you said yeah and it's
less than a thousand less than 800 you
would start to be interesting so I'm
gonna use this thing but like obviously
well I'm excited to use it it'll be fun
to play with but there's no like single
feature that makes me go oh yes that
makes it worth it if they if it had come
out the main thing for me that what
would make sense for me is if this thing
had like legitimate 10 12 hours of
battery life right this thing
legitimately lasted that long I'm like
oh well this kind of makes sense but
it's just you know it's like it's just
like a laptop only any one any one
single thing that was better than
anything else so we just got this tweet
from ovo AIT's everyone I just saw fail
they're targeting the creative class
video editors photographers and
developers yeah you're no there is no
there are no video editors or
professional photographers will touch
who would touch a Chromebook with a
ten-foot pole Upshaw's wait speaking of
Crabbe do you see him taking photos and
like processing with other Chromebooks
speaking of
you guys hear about this creepy feature
you you plug in an SD card and it will
automatically import all your photos so
that's cool and then it will
automatically upload them to Google Plus
they're private
okay I guess that's cool but then you
can go to Google Plus to like the you
know the event you've just uploaded and
they go through and they analyze your
photos and they check off the ones they
think are good and they give you an
option to automatically just share all
of those by the way we got a really
amazing hold on I want to put this tweet
can I put this in our chat know if
there's a way to get this image up on
screen here but we just got an amazing
yes I went to Queens rub from me from
somebody who's listening he got a to D
right it was addressed to you can we get
this image on screen I don't know like
there should be a way in hangouts to do
there's a screen share option but I'm
showing my entire screen no no no no
hold on a second let's try something
here I could I could pick up my webcam
and point out it chill out I'm trying to
hangout toolbox no lower third just put
it as a custom overlay here we go hold
on it's gonna be ridiculous is gonna end
and ridiculously awesome one hired Josh
for the monocle wait a second I get it I
got to drag this my desktop well she
can't do by the way in forever less so
we've already gone beyond just this much
effort here we go that work there it is
that's pretty grainy oh there it is
weird to me there's so few members of
our hey guys it's Schmidt stream man
this is it this is a final authorization
I love the these crazy these pressures
are so perfect for our the topic of
conversation I look stoned yeah well are
you stoned I mean maybe it's a Thursday
you have it okay so so what else is
there to say about the chroma it's a
fail here's my question that's not a
family lights facilitative class let me
let me ask you come on let me ask you a
question so we've now seen both Google
and Microsoft proceed with their like
hardware vanity projects right right
what would you rather have a Chromebook
pixel or a surface RT wait the surface
or serpro service RT Wow yeah but
price-wise they're the kind you get you
get you get you get to pick one surface
RT pixel that's a hard one I'm gonna say
the RT I'm gonna say the RT is well yeah
there is there is the RT has some okay I
can get I can run do they have Chrome
for RT yeah yeah you have to use IE 10
for arm and Bing and Bing
it's a tough right it's not an easy
start for starting to reconsider
you can always break the Chromebook down
into parts I mean hold on here's the
thing honestly the I mean honestly
actually what I'd want to do with with
the surface I mean it's like I can't
really use it because again
ergonomically it stinks you know what
Chromebook pixel Chrome I don't need I
don't need I don't need a laptop to to
play Angry Birds right or to run out
look I need a laptop to do like work
right and if I can't put it on my lap
and type comfortably or put it on a desk
and type comfortably
that's like get out of my face and I
know I can't with the surface and that's
my biggest gripe about they RT you know
besides its lack of any kind of viable
hiko system at the moment yeah and its
slowness and its house but you know but
whatever I mean if it if it if it was
just it felt like a good nice
comfortable laptop to use I'd be like
yeah let's do this so so I have to say I
think I'd go for the pixel also let the
brag the brag factor of the pixel radius
it's like it's like buying you know it's
like buying some hideously ugly old car
and putting like as some sort of weird
Porsche engine in it yeah I think it
looks like an HP EliteBook from like 98
do you know which one would you if the
90s are back don't you know that that's
really important do you I I would I
would struggle over this decision I'm
struggling right now it's fast the
pixels superfast but yeah this is not
gonna replace a laptop for me a real
laptop and that was probably gnashing
your teeth at the saying me saying it's
not a real laptop but there you go it's
not a laptop it's a Chrome yeah so
I need if I'm gonna have a secondary
device I want it to have a ridiculously
long battery life and the when RT it's a
little bit slower but it has a longer
battery life battery life is battery
life is better I gotta say that's the
way from the pixel it's like ah they say
ah they say it's over five hours and so
realistically that's me through five
hours I'm sorry I'm sorry could I just
say I'd rather have an iPad at this
point it's not a choice but it's it's a
500 it's 500 bucks and it does more than
both of those combined yeah so what is
actually here's a good question I can
run Chrome on my Retina Display iPad
which has pretty much the same pixel
density sinks it syncs your stuff what
is their answer for why you shouldn't
just get a retina iPad
well Chrome is slower on the iPad
because it doesn't get the fancy
JavaScript engine and yeah but on Chrome
apps yeah but it doesn't matter because
Safari is ridiculously fast on yeah and
there's like a whole I can run Traktor
DJ Emily iPad yeah I mean seriously I
mean you know I got a Mass Effect game I
can play on my iPad do they have a mass
effect game
there is a huge silent majority of
people who desperately want to give all
of their data all of their information
everyone on the Internet is not the
issue do whatever you want you don't
have my take my data please but just
give me something to like that and its
really good to do with it like give me a
place that I can really utilize my data
you can get deep into Google Plus man
sheep I mean look I honestly I would a
Chromebook would be more useful for from
a business perspective to me than an
iPad okay like if I had to take one if
they're like you're going on a trip you
got a right you're gonna do X Y &amp;amp; Z you
can have a Chromebook or an iPad I would
take the Chromebook yeah as an iPad
won't be as useful to me but but I think
that but I think that that's not the
debate anybody well the debate people
are having it well whatever they're like
should I get this or a real laptop right
because this isn't I mean it doesn't do
all the things my laptop can do it does
a lot of them not as well which is like
thanks for nothing
yeah maybe maybe maybe Google just
didn't want to compete with the
Chromebook for partners maybe they're
like we've got to not do what Samsung
and does Lenovo make one we've got
you know what everybody let's make a
peep I'm not making a product people
want to buy you mean that's how you
don't that's how you you fail to compete
right I don't know like you know maybe
they're like Samsung has everything from
Samsung makes my $300 Chromebook right
right and it's and it's good that the
300 our Chromebook is actually really
good so maybe Hugo is just like we can't
make a $500 crumble I mean Samsung's
Chromebook is actually the probably the
third most excellent laptop in my house
right now
behind the is gonna sound crazy behind
my macbook air and adele XPS 13 with the
1080 display running Ubuntu so here's
the bottom line on the Chromebook from
the old the old joke that we used to
make when we were reviewing Windows
laptops is for $100 more you can get a
MacBook Air with the Chromebook for $100
less you can get a MacBook Air which is
bitches bonkers like just and I get it
high resolution but but was Joanna at
the event at her head just explode there
no there she was I saw she was traveling
last night so I don't know where she is
today okay but I mean this is just wrong
I mean somewhere she's looking at into a
mirror deeply into a mirror has exploded
yeah all right so we never gonna I feel
like we should give that we never
finished our ps4 conversation right well
we also like only has 10 minutes we guys
have a couple other things too we have
you know yeah everything is a fail can I
just fail with HTC one Sony began the
beginnings of a long failed process with
a ps4
and this Chromebook is like it's like a
comedy fail it's like a it's literally
like Google's like playing jokes on
people I think here's the things that so
I don't think the ps4 is a fail at all
by the way I can I just say that I they
didn't show hardware but I think that in
no way suggests that this is a failure
for them I think that you know what it
comes down to is how great is it when
it's actually available you know if
Microsoft releases something they're
gonna show
I mean maybe they'll show something like
the illumiroom which is just a
mind-bending
thing and if they do that then Sony's
gonna have to answer why aren't you
creating a this immersive environment
that's as different and weird as what
Sony's doing and and and okay that's
gonna be a problem for Sony that doesn't
mean it's only can't capture the market
that it's after
and it clearly is after a hardcore
gaming market here the question is when
it comes time to make a decision here
what's their price what's their content
offer and look like what are their part
of their graphic stack up next to the
other guy and are they actually
introducing any really truly innovative
and useful and fun gaming experiences or
is it same old same old I don't think
they have anything is precluding them
from from offering great stuff I think
that so I think that this is a I think
they're the way they did their
announcement was bizarre I think that
they let left a lot of people
disappointed by not showing Hardware
fiber Sony I would have showed a version
of it a renderer it's not it's not even
ready so they know I mean but they must
have some idea what the hardware if look
if they're if it let's say it's the end
of February beginning of March right now
okay we're in the week range here when
they say it's gonna be holiday 2028 that
means November at the latest there's no
possibility they're doing this earlier
than November or later then for
Christmas shopping so we're talking like
Black Friday right so so November 20
whatever the date is gonna be so if
you're you know you only have a handful
of months you don't know what your
industrial design is going to look like
you're already design the controller you
don't have a pretty far along version of
your of what your hardware will actually
look like they could have shown an empty
box it doesn't matter the only thing
that matter thing is to say like here it
is it's real it's going to go into your
living room underneath your TV or
whatever I think that's not a big deal I
think it's a minor thing but it's a
little bizarre I mean we we have a quote
that that they gave to all things D Jack
Tretton gave to all things D today that
said we don't have final specter design
that to me is more worrying than the
idea that they write aa class well and
you know you know my favorite thing in
CES was Sony had a 4k player that was
fake it was a it was a aluminum circle
with a light and then behind it like
hidden behind the screen was the devil
PC that was actually yes and yeah so I
was saying last night we we do like
snuck backstage to find the controller
because we were looking for it and like
Sony had like NASA back there there was
like an army of people like running all
this stuff yeah and it was like okay
like I get it it's not ready and demos
but the reason I just don't think they
didn't say anything beyond this we'll
play video games
I didn't say anything of beyond this
will play video games on your Vita which
is by the way the Vita is a fail right
where's the piece where you get to play
all the games on your Sony phone these a
little more interesting the Vita is a
little more interesting now that I know
I can play PlayStation 4 games no it's
even more interesting being able to play
those things on Sony's Android tablets
which are far more useful it's not gonna
happen though
yeah you can but you can't do that
without the controller I mean once you
lose the control you're in a whole
another but but let's just say this I
think so we can put a cap on some of
these conversations because we have
other stuff other fails to talk the Sony
the Sony announcement was not 100% a
fail but I have looked major concerns
about their readiness to release a new
console you know and and whether or not
that consoles can provide a truly
dramatic dramatically different
experience so Chromebook pixel not a
fail if it was 700 bucks 600 bucks not a
fail to undercut the competition that it
was the people it was competing against
which is PC laptops the surface and
MacBook Air and it doesn't undercut any
of those guys in any way it doesn't
offer anything they're not offering for
less or and it doesn't say like you've
got to have it even though it's a little
bit more because it's got this crazy new
feature there's nothing there I don't
understand it that one's just confusing
to me the laser
oh the let's talk about a she say did
you think this was a fail I why why do
you think that cuz I don't need flip
board on a home screen in my phone let's
talk about the HTC One this is their new
flagship phone I mean
4.7 inch 1080p super fast Android device
with their new the big deal about it
those they have a brand new skin called
Sense 5 yes completely and what any
other big deal is the camera right the
camera ultrapixel camera the idea is
gonna name stuff now yeah instead of
going to a standard 8 megapixel sensor
it's technically a 4 megapixel sensor
but the the pixels are bigger so they
can take in more light it's less if they
can do more interesting stuff because it
doesn't they don't have to spend as much
time processing out noise I'm actually
pretty excited for the camera i think
that if as long as people don't get
freaked out that it's only 4 megapixels
i think it's gonna end
so I'm not worried I think I think what
they're doing with that is great
you know actually it's funny because my
column last night released the new
version of the camera I have I have the
d7000 Russa d70 100 it's funny because
instead of giving it more low-light
performance they increased the megapixel
count and I was disappointed right like
I get it I think that's really important
on a phone camera that you can take
pictures in the dark with it I think
that that will become like the most
important camera spec of all over being
able to take pictures in any situation I
think is right so I'm gonna I'm gonna
get totally flamed for this but I use
the camera for about five minutes
and pretty in a low light situation and
you know I was taking like I would take
pictures in low light like a regular
human not like I know what I'm doing
with cameras and I'm gonna say that it
in that in that short time it seemed to
do a slightly better job than the Lumia
920 that's it I hope you know it's great
knowing you can you can Lisa tell us
where the funeral I'm really I'm sorry
that it had this way it's tough to see
you go we're only looking like you were
only looking at on the screen right yeah
that's the other thing so you're saying
it's like ridiculously bright but when's
the last time you looked at a high
megapixel photo like no it's actually I
think forever like you're never gonna do
it like when you see a pixel it's gonna
be upset right exactly but when I see a
phone that has like a 13 megapixel
camera I just know it's gonna be
terrible it's always bad but we got to
talk about blinkfeed this all the new
skin basically it's Flipboard on your
home screen you can check a box to have
it be off to the left instead of it
being your main home screen but I don't
know it's here can I say this thing
about blinkfeed and then point out to
Josh's point one of HTC's big lines from
this entire event with the one was we're
not marketing ourselves correctly like
nobody knows who we are we need to be
more out there with a brand and what we
provide consumers and the way they're
doing that is by giving everything a
stupid name like it's how you do yeah no
but so like HTC blinkfeed is the new
home screen Flipboard the speakers are
referred to as HTC boom
sound inner cats terrible also they have
a partnership with beats so it's like
HTC boomsound with the beats which is
terrible
they have like a vine kind of app called
HTC Zoe which like is basically burst
mode Lily is the word no Zoe's actually
Chloe no it's basically a burst mode for
the camera right no it's a burst mode
with video that you record at the same
time and it codes both at the same time
and so you can take any video and pull
out a still from it and it doesn't look
like it's still from a video it's
actually a full but they commit it but
at the end of the day at the end of the
day you know I understand it but I
understand okay for the separate
features aside I understand the need for
naming a product you want people to know
you want people to know you know that
your camera's different I'm sound with
Beats Audio
okay boobs really sounded let me ask you
this
we just told you what HTC Zoe is what is
HTC Zoe yeah what is it
Zoe trope like but the better not doing
this correctly the better question is
what let's I mean this is the thing that
I think we need to start the question
that needs to be answered what consumers
want I mean why is Samsung succeeding
with Android and other companies are
failing what are they doing the way they
giving them I mean they're airing
commercials I don't think that's it yeah
I think it's but I think that first part
right that that that first click when it
was Samsung I don't think they're
copying Apple as much anymore but I
think for a minute they really did they
were on Verizon when the iPhone wasn't
on Verizon and they they they were that
alternative to the iPhone on Verizon
yeah I think that was a really big deal
but so is Motorola I mean you know I
feel like in some way Motorola murders
but I didn't want the joy right the
Droid was marketed against but I feel
like and also in some way like this
whole Apple vs samsung thing has kind of
it's really I think it's helping people
who already are predisposed to not like
Apple or think that they don't like
Apple for some reason they're like oh I
finally have a company that can champion
but you know my side of things
you know I finally have a Microsoft in
phones even though Microsoft has phones
but Neela's me always points accurate
like when it was like motor all over
Samsung Motorola was the guys phone like
it was the boss the wall guns out like
we're talking commercial still have you
seen them the new Droid RAZR MAXX
commercial tear it's like what would you
do with 32 hours of battery life and it
just zooms in on people looking tough
and they don't actually ever say that's
the thing imagine nobody can think of
something it's like I'm gonna wait here
until I die like you just so I don't
know like but I think but I think that
uh I think I think that okay fine
but I think that you have to start
asking the questions these companies
need start asking questions what a
consumers actually want and why aren't
why isn't it working for us you know
there are real there are real questions
to be answered but here's the thing
blinkfeed like that's a strategy
question that you're asking Josh and HTC
is answering it with a tactical answer
so the way to think of blinkfeed is a
way that you think of the gigantic flip
clock that they used to put on cents and
it's all about the in-store experience
someone walks into a store they see this
thing on the home screen they're like
ooh that looks pretty I want that
that's what blinkfeed is it's so that
when you walk into the store and play
with the phone there's something cool
right there on the phone that that you
know the reps can't really screw up
because it's built in like it's about
selling the phone in the store and you
know if it's actually useful to users
later great but I personally don't think
HTC cares there's thinking about the
in-store buying experience but that but
I think that's the I think that's their
problem I think they have to figure out
how to make a phone that's better than
the galaxy s3 then I you know aren't we
assuming the galaxy s4 is coming out
next month yeah 3 March the 14th we had
sources right March 14 the Samsung is
like slowly but surely getting better at
the software right like they're they
know that it's their area of weakness as
well resources against it
HTC is like seems like rebooting right
they're like yeah let's start over with
this footboard thing and that's not you
know what come on
I mean I'll say this but you can do the
home screen you know Laura as an HTC
phone that that she really loves I mean
I don't I can't stand what they did in
the interface and sense there's a lot of
it just bothers me she really likes it I
see places where yeah I get it I know
why somebody would like this better and
it just works more like you expect a
phone to look but she has the the 1s
right yes no but you know why people
like that phone because it's of a size
that it's malleable it's a normal size
it's a four inch phone it's a normal you
know Vlad's question for Peter charity
you know the C of HTC was why don't you
make a small phone and he was like I
don't know what it is like there's just
a point I just want people to make it a
reasonable size phone I actually think
the BlackBerry the 4.2 inches like a
pretty good you're in the range of like
this is a pretty good size I remember
thinking 4.3 inches about as big as I
ever want to fight to fly home I I just
want people to actually think about what
what consumers really want in need in
their lives instead of stuff that you
think they want need I think that's the
problem is like there's a lot of
assumptions like blinkfeed I mean I
don't know what kind of market research
they've done but is blinkfeed the thing
that's been missing from everybody's
life you know I think this like this
Live Tiles argument it's like let's
present information better like okay I'm
all for that let's present information
better but you actually show me a better
way to present information before you
write you noticed is Flipboard you know
people really love in it the red phones
is Flipboard and sort of like you're
like here's this crappy other Flipboard
and then you're out of your way and like
and also and also just like what is it
what are you actually trying to get at
they're like is news the thing that you
know here's what I found that's most
interesting and you know I have two
phones now one isn't it you know I use
full time iPhone and Android and and I
have found increasingly just
increasingly annoyed with the with the
hunting and the weird like you know
interface discrepancies on the iPhone
right and and and on Android what I've
noticed is that I'm less and less
interacting with icons and lists and I'm
interacting with my notifications I'm
interacting with when i when i unlock
the phone first off i see what do I have
right my notification light actually
tells me what I have before i unlock it
right I have to
color notification light so then I get
information right away without having to
think about it then I unlock it and I
see okay
emails from here tweets whatever other
you know calendar stuff that is kind of
the way I'm moving through my phone and
then that's leading to other actions
right that's a branch of action so it's
like so you have this in somewhere in
our forums I don't remember who it was I
don't remember when I read it but
somebody in our forums was like it's
weird because I feel like Android is
becoming more and more about in
integrated OS and the iPhone is becoming
more and more about apps pulling you in
different directions
yeah and we're just ballade like they're
different no and not only that but the
apps themselves are have functionality
that is diff completely wildly different
you know you look at an app like mailbox
which feels you know it doesn't feel
like it acts the way other iOS apps act
it has a totally different like a swipe
to delete is actually a swipe one a
little bit to do something and swipe
further to do something else and it
becomes this like okay but I'm used to
swiping and then I get the little thing
and now I'm just swiping away and if I
don't do it long enough it does
something else and it's like but like
and there's no cohesion there but I know
not to bash iOS iOS has a lot of great
look I'll say this if I want to take a
picture or browse there is no better
device than the iPhone there is no
better mobile device in my opinion for
straight-up rat web browsing and
straight-up photo taken at this bright
are you good you should you should
download Traktor DJ for the iPad today
Oh like I have time to mess with Traktor
DJ you're gonna you should you should
it's the weekend you're cracking me up
oh you mean the weekend where I'm
traveling to LA - what are you doing a
plane
what's the music I'm going to write I
have something to write on the plane so
thank you for this great suggestion I'm
gonna DJ like an app that can't exist on
Android but it does on the iPad yeah
they you know they're they're all about
how they there's stuff they can do an
IRS - can't do an angel but I think that
I think that right so but anyhow but the
point is I'm increasingly you know my
experiences in my interactions and I
think this goes for a lot of people are
increasingly cute off of stuff coming
into them you know it's not like I got
to go into this app and do X Y &amp;amp; Z like
you know that's a very specialized sort
of thing that you're doing you know I
need to make a list I need to play a
game I want to listen to music like
these are not these are not what you
do all day long it's like talking to
people it's tweeting it's I am its email
its browsing right and those are all
like these weird branch and experiences
where you start with one place and they
usually lead to something else and and
Android has found a way to connect that
stuff I think better than anybody right
now
and and it doesn't feel disconnected
when you're moving through iOS totally
feels disconnected but the thing when I
look at the one I think like you know
what if this does all that stuff great
then that's great if this mean I hate
the one because it they took away the
multitasking button Google now is like
it's fine but they have a double tap to
multitask I think that doesn't bother me
right eater that's gone no it's no you
come double tap the home double tap
until it's in it's a much better
multitasking and what the iPhone was -
right so that's why and I use that all
the time and it's totally fine it shows
you a grid of nine frozen app states so
dinner they hold it down to new Google
now it's totally fine like anybody can
get used to that the big question is
does it connect all of my experiences
when I do need to branch will it help me
branch better and faster and easier when
I need to share will it help me share
better and faster and easier and like if
you can't effectively and I think
Samsung has done a lot of that stuff and
it's one of the reasons people like what
they're doing is that despite how much I
hate their interface they actually have
started to connect a lot of those branch
experiences together it's like that
thing where they did fake it'll find
your Facebook friends and photos that
you take it's that kind of stuff where
that's actually a real world use like I
could see people needing that and
wanting that alright so dinner we should
wrap this up here's the last question
where you play to the phone this is a
make-or-break for HTC right this phone
isn't a success
I don't know that HTC has a lot of shots
left yeah they won't they won't like
they won't go out of business right away
if this wasn't a success but like yeah I
think I think this is their best shot
and coming back and I think that it's
not gonna be easy and I think it's
probably not gonna work and I think it's
in large part because Verizon said
thanks but no thanks to it so they're
only gonna be on the other three
carriers in the US
Wow well Verizon will do they'll make
they'll make them do like a Droid client
D Ning Yeah right because that's what
they have now is it aren't they like
they're largely similar no they're gonna
do they're all of you they'll they'll do
some something with the D end I mean
they've got the DNA now I'm sure they'll
do some other joint brain
thing but it doesn't help HTC is a
company it doesn't help them build line
share and branch share and they need
that right now because people think I
you either get an iPhone or a galaxy and
HTC needs to just get back in that
conversation and Verizon is not helping
him do that by the way this somebody
sent me this is this is apples apples
reacted to the oh my god dave grohl your
son coke invited Dave Grohl just hanging
out there not even kidding either man I
believe it liked it here and what's the
price $12.99 boom oh it's later passed
out on the floor from hysterical
laughter lovely no we should start
wrapping up so yeah we should I yeah
we're doing a short one today because
I'm in the middle of writing something
I'm very excited about if you are a
reader of the verge tomorrow I'm gonna
have something very special that no
really no one else I think will have and
and they'll be awesome video with it and
I'm excited about that so get ready and
I'll probably tweet some hints tonight
or tomorrow and and anyhow but so I have
to get to writing that and we have to be
stuff that we got to shoot it's very
exciting we're moving into our new
