week of februari 18 2013 I'm Josh
Topolsky come nilay patel yeah roster
you are you under loss Ross is not with
us we just have a frozen ross miller
ross miller would have been with us
today but he died tragically five
minutes ago he died a terrible band with
his band with died as a human he's fine
anyhow this is the verge cast we're
doing to hang out because this week has
been insane and we're all incredibly
busy and oh here's Ross is joining us
now crosses back he claims to be back no
didn't Ross get a new apartment recently
oh I'm actually no I first I have not
number 2 i'm in south Georgia right now
oh that would explain why your bandwidth
is so terrible the south yes um I
apologize to all of our southern
listeners or viewers for where you live
maybe there's a cover i carrying it can
you oh we're not on yet no no isn't like
where the south we obviously they can't
stream it right yeah i have no idea
what's great so anyway this is the verge
caster we discussed the Weeki technology
culture and what a week by the way it's
been in technology culture there's like
really pretty monumental and and by the
way not over yet in fact i'm working on
a story right now for tomorrow which i'm
not going to talk about in detail but i
will say that it is a very special story
that you won't find anywhere else and
i'm very excited about it it's about
giving birth yeah your tweet a c-section
like it is i'm going to go to tweet live
i'm gonna find a c-section oh god that's
18 hours of six installment 18 hours of
six I mean that would be that would be
something like why don't we where is the
feature-length film done in six second
installment okay yeah here we storify a
vine I know Adam Goldberg is doing these
little bits but I'm saying like let's
actually film the scenes as you would in
an entire film but just let them out you
know distribute them in six second
chunks yeah anyhow this is not what
we're here to talk about all right Ross
what is a what are the one of the topics
of the day you hear the list holder here
what do we have to discuss uh well we
will have a special guest layer talk
about some of the big events of today
you're boring everybody
fairly playstation 4 about last night's
ps4 okay you guys did and you did a live
thing afterwards which I really enjoyed
and by the way you both look so you and
Chris Grant looks so sharp yes we had an
issue we both had green dress shirts on
we're very worried about that green-eyed
was the thing last night Green Island
green plaid I outside of the ps4 so I
read you were there I was there uh that
was cool I want David Pierce and Pauly
on US airways party I have to say really
like mismanaged chaotic event right so
it's weird I think they I think they
realize that ever happens I was it's
very strange for Sony in New York to
like throw something together that that
felt that just chaotic so like they're
literally journalists like lining up for
like hours outside in the cold like they
had bouncers who I didn't think realized
it wasn't like a concert was at a
concert venue so bouncers like shoving
people like you can't come in yet like
we're professionals where where was it
it was at Paris the hammer the hammer
really above where we do on the verge
yeah it was it the hammerstein ballroom
yeah very good I am uh and we were you
know people outside it was chaos and
like how is it this venue can have
concerts at it that are like well run
all the time hundreds of people going in
and like Sony can't figure it out anyway
so they started and it was very obvious
immediately that they were trying to get
a jump on Microsoft ahead of III because
Microsoft's obviously can show a new
Xbox this year Sony is you know behind
in the race a little bit better but mine
but III so even a ways off I feel like
they're compelled by something that they
know it's the rumors are that Microsoft
is going to announce something right
that that's like the kind of like I feel
like there's this floating idea right
now that everybody seems to be sort of
winking and nudging about that nobody
really is confirmed yet or can get a
good confirmation of that Microsoft is
inevitably going to do something before
e3 without any cons right and i think
the sense is that Microsoft is also more
ready right there console will be
finished in some way
head of show but there's also the other
thing though so they remember to and if
we want to figure out who the audience
was for this like the type of lava
architecture it feels like a developer
focus kind of event yeah right so that's
what if the game developers conference
when they really have to hype people
like building base making games so that
was the weird thing so they you know if
you saw the coverage on I'm sure you did
they went on for two hours two hours and
15 minutes guy was long it felt like it
was never going to end I mean so it was
so long that I just like at one point
just I already checked my email and
stuff and then went back and they were
still talking like so they opened with
lie crossing the open with the
architecture you noted souped-up pc you
know they're going to use an x86 you
know processes come on this is a big
change view this is a change for the
money they were making basically custom
guts before ice and now they've gone
completely in the opposite direction and
they're basically saying we're taking
off the shelf stuff we're gonna you know
have a car i think they're still gonna
do a custom GPU right is that right i
mean it's gonna be custom ish right
they're gonna you're gonna go AMD and
AMD is going to make them AMV parts and
makes it in Causton i will say this
about it there's been a lot of talk
about that let's just like pause there
for a second yeah there's been a lot of
talk about that i actually feel like
this is kind of a positive for the
industry where you know if I'm a
developer and even maybe this is an
upgradeable I don't know the system
maybe the you think you can swap out a
graphics card in the future you know
swap out a GPU you know because they
could do that in this situation and and
I think it's kind of amazing that I
don't have to if I'm a developer I don't
have to think like I'm gonna code for
xbox pc and Sony now it's like I'm just
like x86 is where I'm headed essentially
you know there are obviously major
issues you know you gotta still port
stuff but it sounded to me like one of
their goals here is making the port a
much easier process so to me it's kind
of like opens the floodgates for what
developers can do in terms of designing
these titles and trying to get you know
great looking and great plain stuff on
every platform right so that mean i
think that's just except for nintendo
the ps3 was a pretty notoriously
difficult platform to develop for ram
because there was so customs
you know they brought out mark Cerny
whose are ahead of like system
architecture and he's famous on the game
the polygon guys were really excited
about it he was there and he spent a lot
of time talking about how they don't
need to do the Cell processor with like
blast rendering or whatever the hell it
does and how they can use these
commodity parts to to make a better
experience but like at that moment Sony
had immediately lost the plot right
because I hadn't they were already into
the guts of developer stuff with this
presentation they were very far away
from how will the ps4 be awesome for you
the gamer right and then they tried to
get back there but they they didn't ever
do it you know they showed off a bunch
of like in game stuff some of which
we've seen so should watch dogs but we
saw that at e3 yeah they showed I think
there was another they showed another
trailer and somebody from our staff like
I am to me to be like just so you know
this trailer is a year old it was that
Enox it was the square enix one was a
square enix month and then what actually
looked in that was that game look to the
worst so I started off at this high
point of like look at how amazing we can
do with all these new tools and this
developer stuff and then when they
started bringing out the games the
graphics actually my opinion got
progressively worse yeah I stuff got old
or not I agree i think there was this
kind of a cheerleading about you know
develop person that you know this is
going to be you know an easy platform
for you to work on it's gonna be really
powerful we have the power of the cloud
so I actually think just edit a if we
just back up for a sec you know what
they announced was anywhere I think you
were kind of getting into this but let's
like do the high level stuff right they
announced that a new consoles coming
it's going to be called the PlayStation
4 the ps4 it's going to have a
completely redesigned you I it's going
to be very powerful based on x86 86
architecture there are a number of
cloud-based advances that they're making
that I think are kind of fascinating one
of them is games that you can play while
you're downloading them with you so my
understanding is basically they're
taking the Gaikai technology which they
bought which is streaming technology
game streaming technology and they're
saying like we're basically going to
stream this thing while you download in
the background I mean that's my
impression they also they also
said that you could try before you buy
which is gaikai again um which isn't it
kind of crazy to think about like you
know when you wanted to try something
before you're still downloading like a
multi gig yeah for um the other thing is
and I think that's gonna lead to a lot
of impulse purchase i mean i know for me
like it's good well I think of a cup of
ways right but then they also said that
the Vita you'll be able to play ps4
games on your Vita it is right you know
just kind of in a way is like do I even
bother introducing the console why not
just update the software on the ps3 if
that if the Vita can play the games
right I think it's video streaming the
game is you know obviously I'm saying
it's them but you could conceivably do
the same thing on a ps3 with a new
controller right so anyhow but I mean
those very interesting so they the cloud
is a big part they mentioned social
networks they basically said you're
going to use Facebook or Twitter or
whatever to be your the way you connect
with I mean they intimated that they
were would be moving away from this
siloed we're managing a social network
more into were you than facebook to kiss
facebooking ustream are there two big
social network port yeah and they're and
they're doing stuff with like being able
to stream your games to friends and yes
the controller has a share button on it
yeah so they actually want you as you're
playing with a controller in your hand
to push the button that's a share and
either I think it's always recording the
last 15 minutes of what you do so you
can always just like send that and that
bumps it out to you stream is out the
idea yeah so that's actually really cool
i mean they showed this weird game that
using the move controller that was kind
of like a you playing with puppets so
yeah that's uh not a gang of molecule
that's what ever thats a dad whatever it
is i mean it probably will develop into
something that is is some type of game
probably it's a guy's a little big
planet so that it's pretty close like
what they always do and i think but i
think that what's interesting about that
is they were kind of putting on this
performance and i think you can see some
really cool stuff that could happen in
the future when you've got all this
power all this processing power and live
processing power and you're able to do
something like put on a performance like
that using avatars and stream it live i
mean i think there's a whole new world
of weird crazy that they're going
to get into with that which I really
love and so so anyhow
then they announced a bunch of titles
for the ps4 and they showed gameplay
from what these titles you know they
should some early gameplay they should
live gameplay there no they only showed
live gameplay twice they should kills
for killzone yeah and watch dogs watch
dogs yeah I think more than twice then
are you sure dosis okay well at any rate
kills down and watch legs to the most
graphically intense games that I've ever
seen you know you were there now I was
watching on the live stream um was there
any lag during those games uh when they
switched so that these you know these
demos are highly produced so what we saw
as gameplay was like bracketed by big
full motion video sequences but they but
they weren't but those weren't those
were not pre-rendered those were in game
we it's hard to know so there was the
thing I think that's what they were
saying that was my fake only lag there
was one moment of like very distinct lag
i think it was during Killzone when it
switched from video to the guy actually
controlling with a controller okay and
there was like a stutter that I think
everybody in the theater noticed but
might not have been apparent on the
lodge was it but was it it wasn't like a
continuous thing it was just like a
glitch kind of flag yeah I mean it
didn't look you know it all looked great
I think I mean when I what I took away
from from these games was they all look
amazing right right ick ularly I think
Killzone when they there was a sequence
with African explosion where there's
like dust in the air and they had this
like incredible depth of field and all
this refraction and like that's clearly
no console can do that now then there
are other parts where it was like this
looks like a slightly more clear ps3 or
slightly more clear xbox and then there
were other parts where I was like this
just looks like an xbox or ps3 but what
got to me was all the games are the same
so like the physics in the motion and
the stuff that you're doing still looks
like the video game right some of it was
beautiful and intense some of it looked
real some looked a little bit better so
they look the same you know all of it
looks like video games well I think
Hollis name genres you seen before is
the shooter is the race and I think and
I get to that but I think that there is
we're gonna have there's going to be a
couple of years
well then answer this question for me
they have a new controller they didn't
show the console right they didn't show
us the pieces is it is okay they they
showed us the controller right and one
of the big features of control has this
light bar on the front that that connect
like depth camera sees so you can move
that around I guess it has a share
button and it has a touch pad on it none
of those games used any of those
features right well I think one of the
games we saw use the features of this
new control i think i think beyond the
share button like it great but did the
eyes i'm not sure about that actually i
think i think which game used any of the
features they definitely showed the
touch screen being useful this shirt at
once they showed it once right at the
very beginning when they were when they
were ensuring the controller uh I don't
remember who was he actually took he was
holding it like this and he took his
hand off and looked around using the
touchpad and then what's the witness I
think it was the witness well it wasn't
which was my aleska witness it's a
puzzle game uh i think it was kills him
i think it was that one as well okay he
was literally he took his hand off he
looked around using the touchpad and
then he went back to standard controller
configuration either way even if it had
been using the all time he was so subtle
and so not important to what was
happening the focus was look at these
beautiful graphics in these games that
we know are going to be popular not
we've built a new controller here's how
we're gonna write and they didn't they
weren't showing you know where is like
Microsoft's last you know big
announcements have been around look at
this incredible innovative gameplay that
we you was all based around yet this
incredible innovative gameplay this was
like look at these amazing graphics and
yeah we got this innovative gameplay
stuff too that will show you later on
but it was like rock out how awesome our
graphics are and I think that is it that
is a testament to you know somewhat the
the history of gaming now that you there
kind of working against and I think this
to your point Neal about how everything
kind of looked like a video game you're
working against uh you know years and
years of this I can grain like here's
what the motion looks like here's what
yeah here's how characters interact and
so you know I did think like it then
kills on demo when it got into the
actual gameplay I thought there were
moments when is just like just what like
wow moment we just felt like the the
amount of texture the amount of like
atmosphere
that was happening was just kind of
overwhelming and I was really impressed
by and I think you know if you look at
Jen I mean I played this is actually
really good to talk about for me I play
dead space the five just finished the
first dead space a few weeks ago which
was made in released in 2008 I believe
which is still like a like later
generation Xbox game and I now playing
dead space 3 and the the difference
between those games in terms of graphics
is like kind of blows my mind it's kind
of like I can't even understand how
they've been able to pull out like what
they've done in the newest one versus
like what they what we thought they were
doing it that like the forefront of
technology in 2008 you know so I feel
like there's going to be a learning
curve where people have to understand
what this hardware can do that always
happens but but I think what's most
striking about the announcement last
night is and what I was struck by at e3
this year when I I'm constantly kind of
like blown away by is the incredible
lack of imagination the game developer
seemed to have when it comes to when it
comes to what their games are going to
be about like right no matter what it is
the David cage games beyond two souls a
kill zone obviously the what was that
what was the watchdog's a drive club is
a driving game you know drugs or driving
games it was infamous and there's what I
mean it was an infamous right it's all
like here's what's going to happen okay
you're going to be somewhere you can you
can shoot something out of your hand or
you can shoot something out of a gun and
it's going to be in somebody's if that
bullet or that beam of energy is going
into somebody's head that's just going
to happen that's the way the game is and
like what's so weird to me is even like
beyond two souls it's it's it's the
premise of the game seems like the setup
and it's like but it feels like the you
know the setup could allow for all kinds
of really amazing different things
happen and maybe it will but at the end
of the day there it's like okay here's
the hook you're going to shoot people
and kill people and like blow stuff up
but this time it's a girl or like this
time it's a little girl Thanks propeller
you take this capcom game remember me
it's like you're in futuristic neo Paris
you've got to take down the government
but this time you're a female and I just
feel like there are so many things you
could do in the game there I mean they
haven't even has anybody ever tried to
do anything different in a game okay
it's either like shooting or it's like
that the braid stuff we're just like
this whimsical magical weird like yeah I
owe this and I judge the witness was
right the witness with it it looks great
it looks really cool but yeah it's like
this is the best update to mist that is
ever right right it's like why not show
me a game with the with the visual
complexity in the world of watchdogs
where you know I'm a you know I'm a you
know EMT or something and I'm like
literally doing surgery on people at
crime scenes or something like where I'm
like driving around give me any I'm just
like whatever give me a game where you
do other things besides shoot people and
then what's fun is then the disconnect
between the plots of these games and the
system that they're running on so Sony
is like they're deep in the social
they're deep into obviously online
distribution is really big for the ps4
so they were going on and on about how
there's a camera sitting there it's like
watching you it's watching your
controller so that's weird it monitors
your activities and what you like and
what you're buying and what your friends
are like and what you're playing with
your friends so at world right so it pre
downloads games that it might think it
thinks you might want to buy so that
when you impulse buy the games are
already there waiting for you so it's
like learning about you like it's like
consumer paradise manifesting this
consumer is it if how you love it no
it's like all the games are like in a
world where everything is a camera ya
know it's different the place where of
where this is happening i love i love
that new theme i love the new theme of
games now they're like oh we've been
noticing this privacy stuff happened
we've been noted in the surveillance
like the best one was the game what was
the game it was infamous 3 or whatever
yeah where it's like a guy comes you're
being watched all the time but and it's
like all this setup like wow this is
real drones and this is serious heavy
political stuff I'm like okay this is
political intrigue this is you know
talking about humanity like what where
we headed it's like what if humans began
to mutate with superhuman powers like no
dude what it what if we actually like i
don't know i'm not saying like you're
gonna play
game where you're the president or
whatever though I have to say if you
created a game with the visual
complexity and the complexity in terms
of the world of something like watch
dogs and I had to play as the president
actually doing presidential stuff like
that be kind of a cool game like I would
be into that we're using a briefing
every morning yeah take a breathing make
decisions about diplomacy but like
actually walk like to let you know the
west wing and stuff like you know I feel
like I let me actually walk into the
West Wing each other's five minutes why
the peoples are talking about walking
around look real quick let's let's let's
look dieter getting and start talking to
ya very patiently waiting for us to
four-year can't hear you I'm Madea got
on mute yourself dude I'm such a noob
yeah totally hi Peter all right every
shot up dieter where is it get it up get
it up right now you have one they've got
to Chrome pixel dude I'm going to San
Francisco from nixle here it is wait
good dieter dieter open it up ok touch
open and touch the pic awesome show us
the money oh yeah show us that 32 screen
it looks like the elitebook i love it
odd i love it look he's touching
something look at this touching Angry
Birds men Angry Birds VADs touching it's
good look at this this is the future I
think you have to talk so you're on the
main one right ok so a planet angry
birds it's some know people can select
Neil I you don't know you can do that
yeah but you don't later here's the
thing like the it the hardware that
looks really good i mean it's like it's
incredibly like square it's the same
thickness all the way through from front
to back square square is in squares
making a comeback it says gunmetal
finish it's you know a chiclet keyboard
and then comes back backlit keyboard
backlit keyboard oh yeah the touchscreen
I mean the it's what is it 2560 x 1700 i
think is the resolution on it dieter
does it does it do this doesn't have the
new notification thing that we saw this
notification pop up in chrome OS it is
not and I think it's we're just waiting
for like a update on it I'm again but
this is like the Chrome OS is the chrome
OS I have in my Chromebook right now
yeah but I think it's dead
it's coming very soon so can you tell me
look at all these other hands you're
putting so it's um yeah so the
touchscreen like they don't get how bad
the hairs yeah they're doing something
weird with the inertia on it but it's
terrible or you know chunky it was the
same way when they were demoing the
photos live on stage but check this out
when I go to the touchpad and do it it's
totally awesome and fast and fun doesn't
make any sense what is it what is the
CPU in that so it's an intel core i5 I
don't know the clock speed and it's got
I think 32 32 gigs of storage i don't
know the rama let's discuss the most
important spectator how much does that
thing cost so this is the verizon LTE
version and so it costs 1449 all right
so good dumbest thing I've ever my only
version is a 1300 oh I want to talk
about I want to talk about let's get I
want to do real talk here for a second
okay real talk why why who is the person
yeah who is the person now look by the
way I want one don't get me wrong you
know but I have like a stack of things
that I wanted sitio next to my right you
know that I've regret buying um who is
the person like this vectrex who is the
person who's going to spend 13 hundred
dollars on Eric Schmidt p other people
who work Eric shy yeah google people
regional you don't put you don't push it
on a production line because Eric
Schmidt wants a wants it 30 on dude they
did that that's my personal conspiracy
theory about the nexus line on Android
is they needed to make a high-end phone
for their employees to use to develop
Android on and they so they need to make
like 10,000 of them we're developers
nightmare at the hell let's just make a
hundred doesn't anybody like it's the
same with this a Chromebook pixel to me
son sounds like a developer's nightmare
note no developer uses a Chromebook
right I mean how did that logically be
what web developers I mean if your
Chromebook developers yeah I guess the
calipers are using Chromebooks I just
feel like it's kind of a crazy like I
don't understand it I oh the touch
screen
these are anything special about the
touchscreen like new functionality is
there any it's a it's a touchscreen they
gotta wait for you know developers to
support you can't pinch to zoom
understand why is it at all this you
know this thing I'm sure that there is
somewhere that there's multi-touch in
like some photos app or something that I
haven't found yet no this thing is like
it's a big middle finger from Eric
Schmidt in Google to Microsoft and they
could just turn around and crank out a
laptop that's highly SPECT it looks good
is a trackpad any good you know here's
an idea why not try that you hold on
this way to say no talking about a
laptop with a really good track pad and
I say something room and has a nice
screen uh and they're like scream
Microsoft this is the future but like a
car say so like I say something can I
say something super nice super nice
design new hardware design right new
design language for them kind of with
this boxy look super high resolution
display very fast for very responsive uh
LTE I think they I think they messed up
on where to put this the specs I think
this is an index this is the new Nexus
design if you go forgot they're like
does that does the LT go in the Nexus or
the 1300 our Chromebook I can't remember
oh the chrome bizzarri 49 how do they
convince verizon and put LTE in this
piece of junk in now right how about if
I can buy this how come I can buy this
off contract and use it on verizon LTE
but I can't buy a nexus off contract and
use it on verizon LTE did answered
either do they know what I don't want to
ask them that question do they give any
indication of who this is for who's
gonna buy a 1300 our laptop that only
runs chrome I mean everybody asked him
that question over and over again and
the answer is you know people who want
to live in the cloud that's their
response people that live in the cloud
and want that terabyte of storage yeah
by the way this is you like the
Chromebook member that very early on
they're like you can drop it you can
break it what if you lose it it's like
what if you lose your 1400 on redbook
you're out solutions are gonna book so
this is really funny a few people
tweeted this Abbey so it comes with
three years of one terabyte of Google
storage and if Google Drive which is
great i think that would cost you
eighteen hundred dollars are usually
paid for it right but that is so
arbitrary because you know that storage
actually cost Google zero dollar it
doesn't mean anything it's like that
that's how much they priced it so I I
they're just tricking you so by the time
my chance to ask questions came around I
had two questions because everything
else has already been asked the first
one was are they making a profit on it
they say yes they are and the second one
is they need it yeah there were they
making it they're making it in Taiwan
that's not a us-made device like with
you know the nexus q look you know what
chrome can do for you it can integrate
you into Google services and it can
browse the web which has tons of google
ads on it why do they need to make a
profit on this product well forget about
that the better question is not about
whether they're making a profit or now
the better question is what who is this
for like how I mean yes they say it's
for whatever but let's talk about what's
going on in the competitive landscape
okay for a thousand dollars i can buy a
macbook air which is a very Cape it's
what i'm using now is that for the 13
inches 999 no it's the 11 inch okay well
I have a 13 inch but ok for the same
price well 1299 for the admit her no I
think it's 1199 for those really what is
it can somebody tell me oh we had a
staff of people who knew about
technology hi Sean knows as Sean dieter
you and Sean actually is right behind us
no I know he's photos the pictures now
or this thing of this blog's electric
they are yes it's 1199 1199 night for it
for 1,200 bucks I can have a completely
cable fully realized Mac laptop alright
the screen isn't is it a touch screen
it's not high resolution yeah but it
does about I'd say roughly a million
times more things than what a Chromebook
does like I look I've tried to use a
Chromebook as my main computer and it's
just like kind of doesn't cut the
mustard I mean yeah there's a bunch of
stuff it's missing so people on our
staff who use chrome books are adrian
and chris sigler and both of them are i
love it i'm like why do you love it I
look like because it can't do anything
else yeah I use it when I have to out I
have to do work because I reckon Google
Docs and like all it can do is type and
I'm like right here that's not a good
reason so dear this is what 1499 right
now or it's 12 99 for the Wi-Fi only
model
or you can pay 200 hours more and get
the retina macbook pro with the same
specs right which is also bonkers like
so what here's an idea just run full
screen Chrome on a macbook yeah exactly
the same experience that you have with
this thing i mean i like i like the
Chromebook idea they just need to do a
few things to make it more like an
actual computer here's the things I
don't have a problem with don't have a
problem with using gmail in a you know
instance right don't have a problem with
browsing an instance don't have a
problem if you have a good IRC client
there now seems to be one that you can
use in a browser don't have a problem
with that but there's a bunch of stuff
missing like growl notifications or
notifications of any type you don't get
anything like that there's nothing that
plugs into the core services of of
chrome as a as an OS you know yeah so
it's like you're missing all this extra
stuff all these things that I do like I
use fantastical which is like you know a
menu bar item that I can quickly access
my calendar you know it's it
automatically backs up my stuff to drop
off to now I have Google Drive and
Dropbox set up that's not something you
can really do it's like yeah you can go
get your stuff but you really can yeah
you really can access it like you would
in a normal file system so it's like
basically you are it's still very much
that browser experience for 1,300 or
fourteen hundred dollars I just feel
like you're really pushing your luck on
how much I'll accept a non complete I'm
not gonna be able to run powerful 3d
games like I could actually game on my
computer I wanted to they won't look
that great but there's the ocean you
know angry birds is whatever I can play
that on any tablet in the world I think
that Google is maybe hoping that this is
they've got a chicken and egg problem
with chrome OS they need real stuff
developed for it and they might have the
hooks and API is necessary to make that
happen but they don't have you know
widespread adoption especially with
people using it as their main machine
and so I think they're just they're like
who's this for I think it's for like
developers to use Chrome OS so that they
can move the state of the art forward on
it so that it actually does become a
viable competitor to other operating
systems i think that right you know what
they're hoping I've got the RT
developers locate are they located
within Google yes Harvey selling this
thing at understand why if that's the
case why are they seating this thing for
free to everyone here's what I
understand why don't they just take
why didn't they just take the nexus 10
what's the resolution of the screen of
the nexus 10 2560 by like it's super
high superhot yeah just take that screen
blow it up a little bit and give me some
option to be able to run like Android
apps and chrome on the same thing if
you're an Android in like even a
environment so I goes Chrome OS but then
there was Android next to it yeah it
would change the my entire conception
know right i mean just something just
give me something here you know give me
the Android notification system in
Chrome OS you know let me plug in like
okay here's my phone number and my you
know here's my google voice account or
something like where google voice
wouldn't be enough but let me plug in
you know my whatever my all my accounts
are that i'm already signing in with in
some way does this you can't even do
multiple account stuff in chrome OS yet
right you can you can log out of your
account login to somebody else's account
no that's not what i was talking about
saying oh my am I on my android device
if I have six gmail accounts I can log
in with all of them and I get
notifications for all of them and
they're all in my saying it but you know
I mean like there's not a unified inbox
but all that stuff is connected if
somebody messages me on gchat on one of
my other accounts you know it shows up
on my phone it's all this like what's it
kind of great about android phones is
that it collects all of your stuff into
one place where as you can't even do
anything that basic on on a chrome on a
Chromebook so it's like just give me
some of the android functionality just
give me some of the ideas behind Android
to make this thing better right now it's
just you just added a touch screen in a
ton of money right yeah I'm gonna be it
would be great if the Chrome OS team in
the Android team like hung out and had
lunch more often did a hangout tried to
you know those things together if they
actually got into a good what is do they
have any answers beyond for people who
want to live in the cloud people the
cloud man that's the same answer for
people who have the other Chromebook
yeah like okay I want to live in the
cloud but I'm gonna spend like a
thousand less dollars is that going what
a complete I mean this is a fail and I
just say it like this will go down and
like I guarantee you you know it's fine
everybody at Microsoft laughs to Google
today yeah everybody at HP in Apple
Apple
on the floor people having apple they
have a day off yeah boy boys are the
rest of the day like to laugh just deal
with our laughter yeah cuz they go I
collective today no in all seriousness I
was talking to Michael about this
yesterday and and we were talking about
the prep can you hear me ok Tim I might
just go out there get working we're good
hello can you hear me I'm sexy so we
were talking he's like what do you think
if you know if there's gonna be a
Chromebook this Chromebook pixel we saw
this video for do you think it'll cut be
really expensive I was like man there's
no way you know the whole thing about
Chromebook has been like it's super
affordable you know even if the top end
of Chromebook it was like 500 400 500
bucks you know and I was like no they're
gonna I was a give this thing's any more
than like 600 bucks 700 bucks at the
highest and like that's how they're
going to kill it they're gonna be like
super high-resolution touchscreen and
it's six hundred dollars I could not
believe this price when I saw it today I
was like how is this in any way like an
advantage now like all this stuff being
the same if you said yeah and it's less
than a thousand less than 800 you would
start to be interesting so I'm gonna use
this thing but like obviously well I'm
excited to use it it'll be fun to play
with but there's no like single feature
that makes you go oh yes that makes it
worth it if they if it had come out the
main thing for me that what would make
sense for me is if this thing had like
legitimate 10 12 hours of battery life
writing legitimately lasted that long
i'm like oh well this kind of makes
sense but it's just you know it's like
it's just like a laptop only any one any
one single thing that was better than
anything else so we just got this tweet
from OVO eights everyone I just thought
to fail other targeting the creative
class video editors photographers and
developers yeah order your what are you
talking about there is there is no there
is no there are no video editors or
professional photographers will touch
who would touch a Chromebook with a
ten-foot pole Upshaw wait speaking of
background do you see him taking photos
and like processing with other
Chromebook face speaking of
photography's exactly look you guys hear
about this creepy feature you plug in an
SD card and it will automatically import
all your photos so that's cool and then
it will automatically
load them to google plus they're private
okay I guess that's cool but then you
can go to Google+ to like the you know
the event you just uploaded and they go
through and they analyze your photos and
they check off the ones they think are
good and they give you an option to
automatically just share all of those by
the way we got a really amazing hold on
I want to put this tweet can I put this
in our chat or there's a way to get this
image up on screen here but we just got
an amazing yeah I was 12 tween from from
me from somebody who's listening you got
it to do right it was addressed to you
oh yeah can we get this image on screen
I don't know how it like there should be
a way and hangouts to do there's a
screen share option but I end up showing
my entire screen now hold on a second
let's try something here I could I could
pick up my webcam and point out it chill
out I'm trying to hangout toolbox no
lower third just put it as your custom
overlay here we go hold on it's just
gonna be redic this is good to end and
ridiculously awesome flown hired Josh
for the monocle wait a second I got it I
got a drag this my desktop oh she can't
do by the way in Chrome OS so we've
already gone beyond just this much
effort here we go that work there it is
that's pretty grainy oh there it is
weird to me there's so few members of
our Haggai yeah it's like a hangout in a
hangout you just take a look it's
Schmidt stream man this is it this is a
final authorization i love the these
question the expressions are so perfect
for our the topic of conversation I look
stoned yeah well are you stoned at me
maybe it's a thirst there you have it
okay so so what else is there to say
about the limit the crumbly to fail
here's my question we ask you want to
fail me lights for the au- class let me
let me ask you a question of laptops
come on let me ask you a question so
we've now seen both Google and Microsoft
proceed with their like hardware vanity
projects right right what would you
rather have Chromebook pixel or a
surface RT wait the surface RT or
surface pro surface RT wow you have at
price-wise the composite you get you get
you get to pick one surface RT or a
Chromebook pixel
that's a hard one I'm gonna say only the
RT I'm gonna say the RT is where there
is RT there is the RT has some okay I
can get I can run do they have chrome
for RT yeah yeah you have to use IE 10
for armed and Bing and Bing it's a tough
right it's not an easy starting dinner
come back for more starting to
reconsider you can always break the
Chromebook down into parts I mean here's
the thing hold on here's the thing
honestly the I mean honestly actually
what I'd want to do with with the
surface I mean it's like I can't really
use it because again ergonomically it
stinks you know a Chromebook pixel girl
big daddy my child if it feels like I
don't care I don't need I don't need a
lot talk to I don't need a laptop to uh
to play Angry Birds right or to run out
look I need a laptop to do like work
right and if I can't put it on my lap
and type comfortably or put it on a desk
and type comfortably that's like get out
of my face and i know i can with the
surface mean that's my biggest gripe
about the RT you know besides its lack
of any kind of viable ecosystem at the
moment uh yeah and its slowness and its
house but you know but whatever i mean
if it if it if it was just it felt like
a good nice comfortable laptop to use
I'd be like yeah let's do this I'm so so
I have to say I think I'd go for the
pixel also where the brac the Bragg
factor of the pixel rages it's like it's
like buying you know it's like buying
some hideously ugly old car and putting
like as some sort of weird Porsche
engine in it yeah I think it looks like
an HP elitebook from like 98 dieter
which one would you if a 90s are back
don't you know that it's really
important damn I i would i would
struggle over this decision i'm
struggling right now it's fast the
pixels super fast but me this is not
going to replace a laptop for me a real
laptop and that was probably gnashing
their teeth at saying me saying it's not
a real laptop but there you go it's not
a laptop it's a chrome yeah so i need
i'm going to have a secondary device I
want it to have a ridiculously long
battery life and the WinRT it's a little
bit slower but it
has a longer battery battery life is
more matter life is better i gotta say
that's a lie from the pixel it's like
they say they say it's over five hours
and so realistically that's me through
five hours what's our ops I can I just
say I'd rather have an iPad at this
point you know gossip it's not a choice
but it's a 500 it's 500 bucks in it does
more than both of those combined yeah so
what is actually here's a good question
i can run chrome on my retina display
ipad which has pretty much the same
pixel density sinks it syncs your stuff
you know it does much stuff what is
their answer for why you shouldn't just
get a retina ipad well chrome is slower
on the iPad because it doesn't get the
fancy JavaScript engine and yeah but on
Chrome apps yeah but it doesn't matter
because Safari is ridiculously fast on
yeah and there's like a whole I can run
traktor DJ my iPad yeah I mean seriously
I mean you know I got a Mass Effect game
I can play on my iPad do they have a
passive fact game there is a huge silent
majority of people who desperately want
to give all of their data all of their
information and who is everyone on the
Internet yeah look they have my data the
data is not the issue do whatever you
want you don't have my take my data
please um but just give me something
like that it's really good to do with it
like give me a place that I can really
utilize my data you can get deep into
Google+ man cheap I mean look I honestly
I I would a Chromebook would be more
useful for from a business perspective
to me than an iPad okay like if I had to
take one if they're like you're going on
a trip you gotta write you're gonna do x
y&amp;amp;z you can have a Chromebook or an iPad
I would take the Chromebook yes an iPad
won't be as useful to me but but I think
that but I think that that's not the
debate anybody's well the debate people
are having it well whatever they're like
should I get this or a real laptop right
because this isn't I mean it doesn't do
all the things my laptop can do it does
a lot of them not as well which is like
thanks for nothing maybe maybe maybe
Google just didn't want to compete with
the Chromebook partners maybe they're
like we've got to not do what Samsung
and does lenovo make one we've got about
you what everybody let's make a peep I'm
not making a product people want to buy
you mean that's how you don't that's how
you you fail to compete right i don't
know like you know maybe they're like
Sam
as everything from Samsung makes 13
hundred dollar Chromebook right right in
skin it's and it's good the 300 hour
Chromebook is actually really good so
maybe he was just like we can't make a
five-hundred-dollar crumble I mean
Samsung's Chromebook is actually the
probably the third most excellent laptop
in my house right now behind the is
gonna sound crazy behind my macbook air
and Adele XPS 13 with the 1080 display
running ubuntu so here's the bottom line
on the Chromebook for the old the old
joke that we used to make when we were
reviewing Windows laptops is for a
hundred dollars more you get a macbook
air with the Chromebook for a hundred
dollars less you can get a macbook air
which is bitches bonkers like just and I
get it high resolution but but was
Joanna at the event in her head just
explode it was you know I've ever this
is there nothing there she was I saw she
was traveling last night so I don't know
where she is today okay but I mean this
is just wrong I mean somewhere she's
looking at it into a mirror deeply into
a mirror has exploded yeah alright so we
never gonna I feel like we should give
that we never finished our ps4
conversation right well we also like
only have tim is we guys have a couple
other things too we have the l1 yeah
does everything is a fail can I just
right let's do that long should fail
with HTC One Sony began the beginnings
of a long fail process or the ps4 and
this Chromebook is like it's like a
comedy fail it's like a it's literally
like Google's like playing jokes on
people I think here's the things that
then so I don't think the ps4 is a fail
at all by the way I can I just say that
I they didn't show hardware but I think
that in no way suggests that this is a
failure for them I think that you know
what it comes down to is how great is it
when it's actually available you know if
Microsoft releases something they're
gonna show I mean maybe they'll show
something like the illumiroom which is
just a mind-bending thing and if they do
that then Sony's going to have to answer
why aren't you creating a this immersive
environment that's as different and
weird as what Sony's doing and and and
okay that's going to be a problem for
sony that doesn't mean it's only can't
capture the market that it's after and
it clearly is after a hardcore gaming
market here the question is when it
comes time to make a decision here
what's their price
what's their content offering look like
what are they out of their graphics tag
up next to the other guy and are they
actually introduced in any really truly
innovative and useful and fun gaming
experiences or is it same old same old I
don't think they have anything is
precluding them from from offering great
stuff I think that so I think that this
is a I think they're the way they did
their announcement was bizarre I think
that they let left a lot of people
disappointed by not showing hardware
fiber Sony I would have showed a version
of it a renderer it's not even ready so
they know I mean but they must have some
idea of what the hardware if look if
there if it lets say to the end of
februari beginning of march right now
okay um we're in the week range here
when they say it's gonna be holiday 2020
that means November at the latest
there's no possibility they're doing
this earlier than November or later than
for christmas shopping so we're talking
like Black Friday right so so November
20 whatever the date is going to be so
if you're you know you only have a
handful of months you don't know what
your industrial design is going to look
like you're already design the
controller you don't have a pretty far
along version of your of what your
hardware will actually look like they
could have shown an empty box it doesn't
matter the only thing that matter thing
is to say like here it is it's real it's
going to go into your living room
underneath your TV or whatever I think
that's not a big deal i think it's a
minor thing but it's a little bizarre I
mean we we have a quote that that they
gave to all things D Jack Tretton gave
to all things D today that said we don't
have finals factual design that to me is
more worrying than the idea they write
ox lam well and you know you know my
favorite thing in CS was Sony had a 4k
player that was fake it was a it was a
Luminum circle with a light and then
behind it like hidden behind the screen
was a dell pc that was actually yes if
that's a service uh and yes so i was
saying last night we uh we do like snuck
backstage to find the controller because
we were looking for it and like Sony had
like NASA back there there was like an
army of people like running all this
stuff yeah and it was like okay like I
get it it's not ready and demos but the
reason I just don't think they didn't
say anything beyond this will play video
games I didn't say anything beyond this
will play video games on your Vita which
is by the way the Vita is a fail right
where's the piece where you get to play
all the games on your
sony phone these a little more
interesting the Vita's a little more
interesting now that I know I can play
playstation 4 games no it's even more
interesting being able to play those
things on sony's android tablets which
are far more useful it's not going to
happen though yeah you gotta give it but
you can't do that without the controller
I mean once you lose the control you're
in a whole another but but let's just
say this I think so we can put a cap on
some of these conversations because we
have other stuff other fails to talk the
Sony the Sony announcement was not one
hundred percent of fail but i have
looked major concerns about their
readiness to release a new console you
know and and whether or not that
consoles can provide a truly dramatic a
dramatically different experience so
chromebook pixel not a fail if it was
700 bucks 600 bucks not a fail to
undercut the competition that it was the
people it was competing against which is
pc laptops the surface and macbook air
and it doesn't undercut any of those
guys in any way it doesn't offer
anything they're not offering for less
or and it doesn't say like you've got to
have it even though it's a little bit
more because it's got this crazy new
feature there's nothing there I don't
understand it that one's just confusing
to me the leadership of the let's talk
about HTC did you think this was a fail
I why why do you think that because I
don't need Flipboard on a homescreen in
my phone baby with this device yeah okay
let's talk about the HTC One this is
their new flagship phone I mean or 20
min gu here 4.7 inch 1080p superfast
android device with their new the big
deal about those they have a brand new
skin called sense 5 yes completely yeah
well any other big deal is the camera
right the camera ultrapixel camera the
idea is going to name stuff now yeah
instead of going to a standard 8
megapixel sensor it's technically a 4
megapixel sensor but the the pixels are
bigger so they can take in more light
it's less if they can do more
interesting stuff because it doesn't
they don't have to spend as much time
processing out noise I'm actually pretty
excited for the camera I think that if
as long as people don't get freaked out
that it's only 4 megapixels I think it's
gonna so I'm not worried i think i think
what they're doing with that is great
you know actually it's funny because my
column last night released a new version
the camera i have i have the d7000 lucid
e71
it's funny because instead of giving it
more low light performance they
increased the megapixel count and I was
disappointed right like I get it I think
that's really important on a phone
camera that you can take pictures in the
dark with it i think that that will
become like the most important camera
speck of all over being able to take
pictures in any situation i think is
right so i'm gonna i'm going to get
totally flamed for this but i use the
camera for about five minutes and pretty
in a low light situation and you know i
was taking like I would take pictures in
low light like a regular human not like
I know what I'm doing with cameras and
I'm gonna say that it in that in that
short time it seemed to do a slightly
better job than the Lumia 920 that's it
i hope you know it's great knowing you
can you can lisa tell us where the
funeral will be really i'm really i'm
sorry that it had end this way but um
you know i love good long a lot of the
man and real it's tough to see you go
but you definitely we're only looking
like you were only looking at on the
screen right yeah that's the other thing
so your thing is like ridiculously
bright but when's the last time you
looked at a high megapixel photo like no
it's that's why i think i think for
never like you're never gonna do it like
whenever when you see them SEO pixel
it's gonna be upset yeah right exactly
but when i see a phone that has like a
13 megapixel camera I just know it's
gonna be terrible it's always bad but we
got to talk about blinkfeed this of the
new skin basically it's Flipboard on
your home screen you can check a box to
have it be off to the left instead of it
being your main home screen but I don't
know it's kind of so here can i say this
thing about blinkfeed and then point out
to josh's point one of HTC's big lines
from this entire event with the one was
we're not marketing ourselves correctly
like nobody knows who we are we need to
be more out there with a brand and what
we provide consumers and the way they're
doing that is by giving everything a
stupid name like it's like this knows
how you do it ya know but so like HTC
blinkfeed is the new home screen
footboard the speakers are referred to
as HTC boomsound inner cats that's not
yeah that is not good haribol also they
have a partnership with beats so it's
like HTC boomsound with beads which is
terrible they
have like a vine kind of app called HTC
Zoe which like is basically burst mode
lily is the word no Zoe's actually Chloe
no it's basically a burst mode for the
camera right now it's 20 employees the
first mode with video that you record at
the same time and it codes both at the
same time and so you can take any video
and pull out a still from it and it
doesn't look like it still for the video
it's actually a full minute but at the
end of the day at the end of the day um
you know I understand it but I
understand okay for the separate
features aside I understand the need for
naming a product you want people to know
you want people to know you know that
your camera's different um sound with
Beats Audio okay boobs out is really bad
I won't deny it turns on is AC sounded
let me ask you this I we just told you
what HTC Zoe is what is HTC Zoe yeah
what is it yeah first I'll sharpers oder
alle doing oh sure what for zoetrope
like but the better not doing this
correctly the better question is what
let's I mean this is the thing that I
think we need to start the question that
needs to be answered what consumers want
I mean why is Samsung succeeding with
Android and other companies are failing
um what are they doing that were they
giving them it looked like the iphone
and they were yeah Aizen I mean that's
near airing commercials I don't think
that's it yeah i think it's but i think
that first part right that that that
first click when it was samsung written
I don't think they're copying Apple as
much anymore but I think for a minute
they really did they were on verizon
when the iphone wasn't on verizon and
they they they were that alternative to
the iphone on verizon yeah I I think
that was a really big deal but so is
motorola i mean you know i feel like in
some way motorola murders but i didn't
want the joy right the droid was
marketed against but i feel like and
also in some way like this whole apple
vs am something has kind of its really
anything to tell people who already are
predisposed to not like apple or think
they don't like apple for some reason
they're like oh I finally have a company
that can champion right you know my side
of things you know I finally have a
Microsoft in phones even though
Microsoft has phones but Neela's the
always points accurate like when it was
like motor all over Samsung Motorola was
the guy's phone like it was the balls to
the wall
guns out like we're talking joy
commercial still magraph have you seen
in the new droid razr maxx commercial
tere it's like what would you do with 32
hours of battery life and it just zooms
in on people looking tough and they
don't actually ever say what they're
going to do that's the thing there you
know imagine you can't imagine it or
beef nobody can think of something it's
like I'm gonna wait here until I die
like you just hope i don't know like but
i think but i think that uh i think i
think that okay fine but i think that
you have to start asking the questions
these companies need to start asking the
questions what do consumers actually
want and why aren't why isn't it working
for us you know there are real they're
real questions to be answered but so
easily so here's the thing that lead to
do it blinkfeed like that's a strategy
question that you're asking josh and HTC
is answering it with a tactical answer
so the way to think of blinkfeed is a
way that you think of the gigantic flip
clock that they used to put on sense and
it's all about the in-store experience
someone walks into a store they see this
thing on the home screen like ooh that
looks pretty I want that that's what
blinkfeed is it's so that when you walk
into the store and play with the phone
there's something cool right there on
the phone that that you know the reps
can't really screw up because it's built
in like it's about selling the phone in
store and you know if it's actually
useful to users later great but I
personally don't think HTC cares they're
thinking about the in store buying
experience but I think that's the I
think that's their problem I think they
have to figure out how to make a phone
that's better than the galaxy s3 then I
you know aren't we assuming the galaxy
s4 is coming out next month yeah isn't
that remarkable 14th we had sources
right March 14 I mean the samsung is
like slowly but surely getting better at
the software right like they're they
know that it's their area of weakness
too well resources against it HTC like
she seems like rebooting right they're
like yeah let's start over with this
foot board thing and that's not yeah
what come on I mean I'll say this but
you can do the home screen you know
laura has an HTC phone that that she
really loves I mean I don't I can't
stand what they did in the interfacing
sense there's a lot of stuff that just
bothers me she really likes it I see
places where yeah I get it I know why
somebody would like this better and it
just works more like you expect a phone
to look but she has the the one
s right I yes there a no but you know
why people like that phone because it's
of a size that is small animals a
normal-sized a 4-inch phone its enormity
of lads question for Peter Chou tioner
the CEO of HTC was why don't you make a
small phone and he was like I don't know
what is it is actual animal it is like
there's just a point never responds I
just want people to make a reasonable
size phone I actually think the
blackberry the 4.2 inches like a pretty
good you're in the range of like this is
a pretty good-sized I remember thinking
4.3 inches about as big as I ever want
to date in right here say you're right
you are favorable time I'm air lock
device no I haven't haven't playing
around on the flight on the fly home um
I I just want people to actually think
about what what consumers really want in
need in their lives instead of stuff
that you think they want need I think
that's the problem is like there's a lot
of assumptions like blinkfeed I mean I
don't know kind of market research
they've done but is blinkfeed the thing
that's been missing from everybody's
life you know I think it's like this
live tiles argument it's like let's
present information better like okay I'm
all for that let's present information
better but you actually show me a better
way to present information before you
write you noticed is Flipboard you know
people really loud on it droid phones is
Flipboard and so like you're like here's
this crappy other Flipboard and any real
out of your way and like and also and
also just like what is it what are you
actually trying to get at they're like
is news the thing that you know here's
what I found that's most interesting and
now I have two phones now one isn't it
you know I use full time iphone and
android and and i have found
increasingly just increasingly annoyed
with the with the hunting and the weird
like you know interface discrepancies on
the iphone right and and in on android
what I've noticed is that I'm less and
less interacting with icons and lists
and I'm interacting with my
notifications I'm interacting with when
i when i unlock the phone first off i
see what do I have right my notification
light actually tells me what I have
before i unlock it right i have
different colored notification light so
then i get information right away
without having to think about it then i
unlock it and I see okay emails from
here tweets whatever other you know
calendar stuff
is kind of the way I'm moving through my
phone and then that's leading to other
actions right that's a branch of action
so its life so I have this in somewhere
in our forums I don't remember who it
was I don't remember when I read it but
somebody in our forums was like it's
weird because I feel like Android is
becoming more and more about in
integrated OS and the iphone is becoming
more and more about apps pulling you in
different directions yeah and which is
valid like they're different no and not
only that but the apps themselves are
have functionality that is diff
completely wildly different you know you
look at an app like mailbox which feels
you know it doesn't feel like it acts
the way other iOS apps act it has a
totally different like a swipe to delete
is actually a swipe one a little bit to
do something and swipe further to do
something else and it becomes this like
okay but I'm used to swiping and then I
get the little thing and now I'm just
swiping away and if I don't do it long
enough it does something else and it's
like but like and there's no cohesion
there but I know not to bash iOS die OS
has a lot of great look I'll say this if
I want to take a picture or browse there
is no better device than the iphone
there is no better mobile device in my
opinion for straight-up rat web browsing
and straight up photo taken at this
brett i think you should uh you should
download traktor DJ for the ipad today
oh yeah it's like I have time to mess
with traktor DJ you're gonna get you
should you should it's the weekend
you're cracking me up oh you mean the
weekend where I'm traveling to LA to go
what are you doing the play what's the
music i'm going to write i have
something to write on the plane so thank
you for this great see Josh I'm gonna DJ
all weekend uh no i was just saying like
an app that can't exist on android but
it does on the ipad yeah they told me
they're all about having their stuff
they can do an IRS I can do an angel but
i think that i think that uh right so
but anyhow but the point is i'm
increasingly you know my experiences in
my interactions and i think this goes
for a lot of people are increasingly
cued off of stuff coming into them you
know it's not like I gotta go into this
app and do x y&amp;amp;z like you know that's a
very specialized sort of thing that
you're doing I need to make a list I
need to play a game I want to listen to
music like these are not these are not
what you do all day long it's like
talking to people it's tweeting it's I
am its email it's browsing right and
those are all like these weird branch
and experiences where you start
one place and they usually lead to
something else and and Android has found
a way to connect that stuff I think
better than anybody right now and and it
doesn't feel disconnected when you're
moving through iOS totally feels
disconnected but the thing when I look
at the 1i think like you know what if
this does all that stuff great then
that's great if this mean i hate the one
because it they took away the
multitasking button google now is say
it's fine but they have a double tap to
multitask I that doesn't bother me they
go on Scrubs my teener that's gone no
it's no you come double tap the home
double tap into it's in it's a much
better multitaskers and what the iphone
was to right now so that's why and I use
that all the time and it's totally fine
it shows a grid of nine frozen app state
so dinner they hold it down to new
google now it's totally fine like
anybody can get used to that the big
question is does it connect all of my
experiences when I brew need to branch
will it help me branch better and faster
and easier when I need to share will
help me share better and faster and
easier and like if you can't effectively
and I think Samsung has done a lot of
that stuff and it's one of the reasons
people like what they're doing is that
despite how much I hate their interface
they actually have started to connect a
lot of those branch experiences together
it's like that thing where they did
it'll find your facebook friends and
photos that you take it's that kind of
stuff where that's actually a real world
use like I could see people needing that
and wanting that alright so dinner we we
should wrap this up here's the last
question where you play to the phone
this is a make-or-break for HTC right
this phone isn't a success I don't know
that HTC has a lot of shots left yeah
they won't they won't like they won't go
out of business right away if this
wasn't a success but like yeah I think I
think this is their best shot and coming
back and I think that it's not going to
be easy and I think it's probably not
going to work and I think it's in large
part because verizon said thanks but no
thanks to it so they're only gonna be on
the other three carriers in the US Wow
well verizon will do they'll make
they'll make them do like a droid kind
of DNA yeah right because that's what
they have now is it aren't they like
they're largely similar they're gonna do
they're all those of you though they'll
do some something with the D and I mean
they've got the DNA now I'm sure they'll
do some other droid branded thing but it
doesn't help HTC is a company doesn't
help them build mindshare and branch air
and they need that right now because
people think I you either get an iphone
or a galaxy and each
she needs to just get back in that
conversation and verizon's not helping
him do that by the way this somebody
sent me this is this is apples apples
reaction to the oh my god dave grohl you
don't cook invited dave grohl oh babe
tim is just there just hang it up
they're not even kidding either man I
believe it that's not right there like
it here and what's the price 1299 boom
oh it's later passed out on the floor
from hysterical laughter on that lovely
note we should start wrapping up so yeah
we should I yeah we're doing a short one
today because I'm in the middle of
writing something I'm very excited about
