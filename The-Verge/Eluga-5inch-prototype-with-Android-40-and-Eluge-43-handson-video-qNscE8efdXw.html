we are at Panasonic booth where they
have a surprise for us we had already
heard about the eluga a 4.3 inch film
but they have got a 5 inch version here
this is running Android Ice Cream
Sandwich android 4.2 beta here this is
definitely a prototype we see the home
button here is permanently with it up
there few software glitches with it but
it's very thin it's very svelte it has a
weird station for the power button it's
on the back makes the volume buttons but
the materials on the back field great
it's got a really nice curve and it's
basically just like a really big version
of the previously-announced eluga the
4.3 so there you go that is a surprise
prototype from panasonic eluga 5 english
running an Ice Cream Sandwich and of
course panasonic also had the logo the
4.3 inch this is also waterproof and
dustproof it has a 960 x 540 screen and
is only seven point eight millimeter
spin it's actually a really really nice
man it has a weird way to unlock the
screen you've actually got a track that
the little dotted line sir which is kind
of awkward
but otherwise it's really thinned it has
a really nice metal feeling material on
the back and that same placement for the
power button</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
