this is the LG Nitro HD that's the first
AT&amp;amp;T phone to have a 720p display and
it's only the third to connect to ATT's
new LTE network joining the Samsung
skyrocket and the HTC vivid the Nitro
has a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor
gig of ram 4 gigabytes of internal
storage it's good looking it looks just
like the Samsung Galaxy S 2 it's got the
same textured back and the same kind of
look and feel all over its plasticky but
well made and looks pretty good
most of the ports are up top there's the
power button microUSB port and the
headphone jack and they're all a little
crowded up there plus the microUSB port
is covered by the most ridiculously
breakable piece of plastic I've ever
seen
you're better off probably just breaking
it as soon as you get the phone and not
dealing with it anymore there are three
capacitive buttons down at the bottom
instead of the usual four they've also
been redesigned and the Menu button and
search button were combined so that if
you long press on the menu button it'll
search for you instead
LG actually customized pretty much
everything about this phone and it
almost never works out in LG's favor the
phone's running Android 2.3.5 so you're
not getting the latest version of
Android anyway and it's just really
heavily modified for mostly kind of
pointless reasons it has icons in these
weird kind of glossy containers it has a
light blue and white color scheme that
doesn't look very good and even the app
drawer is designed in a way that makes
it much more confusing there's three
different layouts and one of them groups
things funny and another puts them in
the wrong order and it's just really
hard to navigate the browser's fairly
average verge into red phone it has some
issues with image heavy sights but for
the most part works fine as you did add
a navigation bar to the bottom of the
screen but it's not such a huge problem
because you get so much real estate on
the 720p display it's a four point five
inch IPS display and it looks really
really good it has really accurate
colors and it's bright and you can't
really see individual pixels like you
can on some other big screen phones but
the best thing about the Nitro HD has to
be it's LTE performance we got our
review unit right as a TTS LTE network
went live in New York City and we had
speeds as fast as 60 megabits per second
down and 50
megabits per second Oh once the network
is officially live it speeds won't be as
fast but it's certainly much better than
the HSPA+ that 18t has been trying to
pass off as 4g until now the great
display and LTE both bring the same
downside and that's really bad battery
life I never got a full day out of the
Nitro HD and it was really more like a
few hours as long as I was using it
heavily if streaming video through
Netflix in particular just destroys the
battery otherwise it's a pretty average
smartphone call quality is good but not
great and speakerphone performance isn't
very good because the speaker is quiet
anyway and it's located right where you
not really put your hand on the phone so
it means it even more there are two
cameras an 8 megapixel camera on the
back and a 1 megapixel camera on the
front and both are fine for what they're
supposed to do but neither is
particularly great it does shoot 1080p
video from the rear camera which looks
better than most smartphones but again
nothing to write home about at $249 the
LG nitro HD is the best phone you can
currently buy to connect to a tMT's LTE
network but lt's not everywhere yet and
if you're outside the test markets
you'll be better off with a phone like
the iPhone or the samsung galaxy s 2
which offers better software better
battery life and slightly better
performance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
