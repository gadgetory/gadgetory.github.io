Mobile World Congress and this is the
hallway watch which was just announced
on stage it's an android west watch the
the first from the company and the thing
to say about this is it it's all about
the design really it is by far the most
watch like Android watch that we've seen
today it's a has a wide variety of
straps there's a nice Milanese right
here the bezel is very slim obviously
the screen is circular the button here
looks a little bit like a crown it's
clearly pain fashion very much in the
style of an actual watch obviously as it
runs Android wear the software is more
or less the same as a any other watch
but highway is installing about 40
different watch faces on it to give it a
bit more personalization so yeah there's
not a lot of about it but about
perfect assignment if you like the
design and you like Android wear this
seems like it would be probably be the
best like watch style Android wear watch
today obviously things like pricing and
battery life a total unknowns right now
and the watch isn't going to launch
until the middle of the year but so far
from from what we can see I think
impressions are pretty good it feels
nice on the wrist the screen is amazing
it's very sharp and by far the best
android wear screen i've seen so far and
yeah i think this is a pretty promising
product if you're into Android wear this
is the huawei watch at Mobile World
Congress</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
