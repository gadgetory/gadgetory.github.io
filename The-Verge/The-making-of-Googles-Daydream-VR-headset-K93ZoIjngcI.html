isn't very much like any of its
competitors the PlayStation VR oculus
rift HTC vive cure VR or even Google's
own cardboard it's soft squishy and
feels more like clothing than
electronics but the data room team has
spent a long time getting to that point
we went to Google's offices in Mountain
View to see how they did it
the view is supposed to be one option
among many for Google daydream headsets
but it's Google's way of setting a tone
for the entire platform and to do that
the company looks not to electronics but
to clothes the headset draws on a lot of
different types of soft goods of
clothing for example the head strap it
adjusts much like you'd adjust a pair of
ski goggles the outer part of the
headset kind of the body of it it's sort
of rigid right it's soft but it also
holds its form so something like
comfortable pair of shoes and then just
the material which the whole thing is
clad in I think is reminiscent of a
super comfortable t-shirt right or
something that you just wear out and
about this was the starting point of
daydream view because technically it's
all you need in a headset just strap a
phone to one side and put a pair of
lenses on the other and you have
something like a very simple Google
cardboard the problem is this doesn't
feel very good
the daydream team needed to end up with
something more like the Samsung gear VR
with padding a strap and a controller
and they needed to do it without
weighing down user's faces or making it
too tough to get to their phones the
first step was 3d printed mock-ups these
were a heavy and stiff but they let the
team figure out of shapes that would fit
the most people including ones with
glasses then they experimented with
finding the lightest materials possible
ending up with a combination of plastic
foam and fabric the view isn't a very
complicated piece of hardware but it's
the culmination of lots and lots of
little decisions like what angle should
the strap be to get it to sit right on
somebody's head how do you make sure
people can tell that they're supposed to
open up the front and put a phone inside
sometimes the most elegant solutions
Google tried like magnets that
seamlessly held the trace shut turned
out to just confuse people they were
much more likely to get that you should
just pull a tab to open an elastic band
on the one hand it's a VR headset which
means you need to line up optical
elements and the screen and everything
else just so on the other hand it's
something that you wear and so we had to
kind of learn some new tricks in
manufacturing we weren't just making
things out of molded plastic but we also
have sewing machines right and and other
things that you find in a place where
you're making shirts and clothes and so
on take for example the fabric that's
covering the daydream view it's got a
distinct texture because solid colors
made it look too much like hard plastic
from a distance so Google set up a laser
system that would let manufacturers
precisely align the texture in the right
way for each headset daydream view isn't
just the headset it's also a custom
controller that works kind of like a VR
laser pointer if google has its way all
kinds of companies are going to be
making their own very unique looking
daydream headsets but the controllers
are all going to look pretty much like
this but it could have looked very very
different these are all possible shapes
that Google thought about for its
controller the daydream team even had
people come by and model their dream VR
controller in clay a lot of the designs
look cool and way more futuristic up
until you put them into your hand then
you realize they're actually awkward and
uncomfortable or they didn't fit into
the headset tray one of the first things
the daydream team decided they do you
could almost say the final remotes a
little boring compared to all these but
it's the results of constant refining to
figure out even little things like how
high the buttons should be meanwhile the
team was testing the software with
something they called the garage door
opener all the guts that made it into
the daydream remote in a big black box
we're usually excited when headsets get
high-tech new features and Google hopes
that daydream will have them in the
future but they'll probably be on the
phone not the headset one of the things
that was very important to us with
dataview is that it's simple it's easy
to get in and out of and the more kind
of active elements you add to the
headset the more complex that come it
becomes in terms of cost and
manufacturability but also most
importantly setup right you imagine
plugging lots of little things in and
connecting things and so on we want it
to be simple we want it to be
frictionless to get in and out of the
are and the really simple largely
passive headset design really helps with
that
now that daydream view is out in the
world all googles decisions are getting
put to the test are where is going to
think it's as universally comfortable as
it's supposed to be will making it out
of fabric help people get over the
fundamental weirdness of virtual reality
the answers so far are we don't know and
probably not but Google is taking VR
someplace it's never been if only as
we've just seen with a lot of stops
along the way
