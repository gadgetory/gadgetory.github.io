now with average I'm here at Nokia World
2011 at the company's future booth and
we're taking a look at the new kinetic
device so there is no touchscreen here
this is basically just a prototype
device to show one of the future
interactions they're not give thanks we
might be using all you actually do here
is twist the device to control it so the
volume control is right here we're
playing a music track so if I just twist
it like so I'm turning it down if I
twist it like so I'm turning it up shoot
me yes then if I push it away I come out
of the meet to the music menu and then
push back in push away how do I scroll
up a twist like so
so go music photos that's all we've got
here really music and photos that's all
but yeah so this is how you zoom into
the pictures zoom out it's quite it's
quite natural so in order to bring the
picture towards yourself you kind of
talk it like so push it away like so and
again you twist the corners describe
between the photos and it only requires
very gentle touch it doesn't require -
yep do too much does this actually have
a future do you expect to be able to
integrate it into any films in the
future with people like it it's worth
popping you I'm also over displays is
this seems to be about a three point
seven two four inch display so is it a
Monet yes it's back to flexible AMOLED
display metal graphical metal plastic</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
