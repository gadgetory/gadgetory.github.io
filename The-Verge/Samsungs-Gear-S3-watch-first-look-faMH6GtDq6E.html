addition to its gear SmartWatch line
last year Samsung kind of nailed it with
the gear s2 and you'll notice that not a
lot has changed this time around the
gear s3 has a really similar design just
bigger and with more stuff inside the
new model has a 1.3 inch display and is
2 millimeters wider than the s2 that
sounds like a really negligible
difference but it's not the s3 feels
bigger and chunkier and small Watch fans
will definitely want to look elsewhere
but the extra space let's it include
some new stuff the s3 has a speaker it
sports GPS which would be great for
runners and it can do mobile payments
both over NFC and on magnetic swipe
machines to the watch still has a
rotating bezel which is for checking
notifications and spinning through menus
the interface hasn't really changed at
all which is mostly a good thing Samsung
has made some tweaks though so that you
can actually use the bezel to control
things more and you want to swipe around
with your finger as much there are going
to be two models for the s3 the s3
Classic and s3 Frontier I like to
frontier way better it comes in a matte
black and has a nice clicky bezel it can
also include LTE the classic comes in
stainless steel and is supposed to be a
little classier though I didn't really
get that from it it's also only going to
be Wi-Fi and Bluetooth so there's no LTE
both models though do include standard
watch shops which is a nice touch this
time around so that's really the deal
the s3 is just a refinement of the s2 it
takes something that was already working
pretty well and add some new stuff that
ought to make it work even better
Samsung hasn't announced pricing or
release date just yet but it's supposed
to be available sometime in the final
quarter of the year so it's coming up
