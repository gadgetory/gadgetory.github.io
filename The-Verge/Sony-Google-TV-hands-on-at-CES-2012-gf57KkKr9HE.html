here in Sony's booth at CES 2012 it's
incredibly loud here they just have to a
whole bunch of stuff this is the new
google TV stuff this is the NSC gs-7
streaming player it has this new remote
that Sony's doing that's a touchpad on
the front this qwerty keyboard in the
back it's kind of like a rubbery
keyboard it's not really what you'd
expect we can go here i can type in
let's try to type in the verge
see here how do i spell our website oh
it's auto completing so I can pry press
it down hit okay and we're going to load
up the verge of Google TV so this has
google to be integrated it's it's the
same software really there's some tweaks
to how it's integrated with the product
but underneath in the box it's the new
arm based platform this is the Marvel
1500 processor that's everybody's using
in this wave not the Intel stuff at
Sonny's doing before so here we've got
the verge loaded up I can move you can
see I've got here I can move the mouse
around this whole thing is a button so
if I click here try to click on this
post and so I clicked you saw it just
clicked it it goes when you're watching
marietv these are fast forward and
rewind buttons here and that loaded a
different post which is extremely
strange let's try to go back about the
android back button here this is the
main android d-pad the controller also
supports motion control it's a three
axis not six axis like a ps3 so it's
three worse but three better than a
regular remote that has no access so I'm
gonna play this game called dot I'm
supposed to eat the pink ones eat the
pink ones kill the blue and eat the blue
ones fulfill the pink ones it's single
player and I shoulder like this and see
what happens here and this is just an
android game oh it's star game what up
oh my god what am i doing this is so
confusing okay I'm really good at going
left and right terrible going up and
down I mean just awful going up and down
no clue I'm the white dot everyone and
so I'm oh I got killed I'm gonna try it
again okay okay okay okay really bad
going up and down I mean my ability to
go up and down verges on the adjust the
absolutely awful but I'm good at
anything on this left edge is going to
die I'd died I was the thing on the left
edge and I said anything left to add to
die and then I died it's kind of a
syllogism and then i can press home and
I go back here's the google TV menu this
is the built-in tuner swimming is also
doing integration with DISH Network so
we have dish network box it can control
it over hdmi and your home network you
don't even ir blaster or separate
control cable so you can just click on
dish network and that'll bring up
television I think I hope and your CV
and now I can control everything from
this same remote I can't type to the
dish network box can I so this is only
for the google TV this is all the dish
network stuff and then i can just put it
with your photo or you can click pin
numbers and stuff i can type in numbers
and stuff to control this network which
is very important just typing in numbers
is the primary way you use a television
in 2012 anyway so that's sony's new
google TV stuff this is a streaming
player but there's also a blu-ray player
and the blu-ray player has the voice
search in the remote so you can just
talk to Google and Google will solve all
your problems so that's certainly google
TV at CES 2012</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
