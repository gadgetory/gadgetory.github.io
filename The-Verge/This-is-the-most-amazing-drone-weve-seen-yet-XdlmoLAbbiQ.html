innovations but if you showed them the
Hong Kong startups best-selling product
everyone would recognize it immediately
DJI has created our favorite drone the
Phantom a unit so ubiquitous it has
become the face of the technology across
popular culture
for better or worse it's the Kleenex of
drones what made the DJI phantom so
popular was its combination of power
price and simplicity
they have also offered a much more
expensive unit for Hollywood
professionals but it wasn't safe for
affordable for the average consumer
today the company is trying to bridge
the gap between those two with its
newest unit the inspire one our product
design team said that they looked at
some sci-fi movies and started designing
it one of our product engineers said
that it looks like a dragon skull I
don't know what that's about
we see this as bridging both the
community that once really easy to use
systems without thinking too much about
the mechanics of flight with the crowd
that wants really professional video
easily captured from the sky the first
thing you notice about the inspire is
the way it transforms on takeoff this
borrows spreading link technology DJI
developed for its s-class units the legs
lift overhead after takeoff allowing the
inspire to shoot 360 degrees of video so
you got a 4k camera and also streams
Full HD video 1.7 kilometers distance
and near-real-time down to your iPad it
also has an HD in my video out on the
controller so you can automatically see
this on a large screen or connect it to
your animals recorder right now it's a
modular payload that's formatted
specifically for this camera but we'll
have a lot more exciting things to say
about that later down the road
it's got redesigned motors and
electronic speed controllers it's to the
point where if you follow forward and
then let go it's almost like you've
thrown a brakes on a car it's quite
impressive another big addition to the
inspire is a camera on the bottom that
can recognize what's below it and lock
on to its current location when you're
flying outside and you're not sure if
you have a GPS connection flight close
to the ground and you'll be studying the
inspire can offer a dual operator mode
with
pilot and one cameraman it's still
possible to do both with one person but
adding another set of hands allows for
more flexible and fine-tuned shooting
for single operators the inspire offers
the ability to lock the camera and
maintain an area of focus even as the
unit moves about a godsend for any
wedding photographers hoping to capture
the perfect aerial shot of that first
kiss the DJI phantom cost around $1,500
while a fully loaded s1000 ended up
closer to 10 grand the inspire one tries
to split the difference with a price
point of roughly $3,000 DJI is also
announcing its first software
development kit or SDK allowing outside
developers to integrate their programs
with the unit's camera and video
software there's some applications
looking at 3d mapping that we're really
excited about there's a whole host of
applications that we never really
realized that these aerial systems were
perfect for but people are using the
systems to explore the inspire one marks
another big step forward in the amount
of power and photographic capability
available to the average consumer at a
price point that won't break the bank
that in turn is a reminder of how little
safety and privacy regulation currently
exists in the US with $3,000 anyone no
matter how old or inexperienced can
purchase this unit and start flying at
the same day when people start thinking
about this technology they recognize not
only the form factor of the phantom
which is pretty iconic at this point but
also how easy and accessible it is to
use so that even Cartman can fly it you
know weights so epic there definitely is
that question of how do you integrate
this technology into the airspace safely
and that everybody's following the rules
and Eyewitness News investigators
exclusive that's getting a lot of
attention tonight how was a man able to
fly a drone over the busy streets of
Manhattan from our perspective we're
looking forward to a lot clearer rules
in the u.s. and several other markets
like Japan Australia Germany there is
already that framework in place and
we're seeing a lot of success
one of the things that we've cooperated
with the Australian and New Zealand
government's with is creating a document
that says these are the best safe flying
practices and with every phantom sold in
those countries you get that pamphlet
that says you can do this you can't do
this we think that sets a really clear
tone for what's acceptable in terms of
best safe flying practices and if you
don't follow those practices here are
the consequences the other thing to
consider is that with any new imaging
technology there's always this question
of privacy and appropriate use so on the
one hand you have government's
implementing privacy rules that help
protect people's privacy on the other
there's a bit of social etiquette like
you don't take Google glass into the
bathroom or you don't climb a tree with
a telephoto lens so those are kinds of
things that I think people will start to
understand a little bit more as the
technology becomes more commonplace
