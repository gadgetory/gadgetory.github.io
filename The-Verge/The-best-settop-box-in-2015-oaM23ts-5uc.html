fire are giving a lot of attention right
now which either says something about
the built-in interfaces of Smart TVs or
is a testament to how useful and
powerful these video streaming boxes
have become once the staple of cord
cutters they're now becoming a lot more
mainstream so which of these is the best
video streaming box you can buy right
now the blanket answer is it depends it
depends on how tied you are to iTunes
how much you use the Amazon Prime video
app and how you feel about a feature
like Apple's AirPlay but if I had to
point to just one the best new set top
box to buy right now is the new Apple TV
it isn't killing cable in one fell swoop
as some people had hope but it
introduces new features that make it the
most elegant solution out there its new
interfaces focused around apps but
what's more noteworthy is that these
apps are basically iPhone apps ported to
the big screen which means it's easier
for developers to redesign and redevelop
their apps for Apple TV it opens the TV
screen up to a whole new world of
experiences around casual games
ecommerce and more beyond the standard
selection of video streaming apps the
new Apple TV comes with a fully
redesigned remote one that now has a
touchpad so you can swipe your way
through content and while Siri on Apple
TV is far from perfect which is
something it feels like we've been
saying since Siri was introduced having
voice control over your TV set through
Apple TV is a welcome addition the
biggest downside is that Apple TV still
doesn't have an Amazon Prime video app
which lets you watch a bunch of videos
for free if you're an annual subscriber
to Amazon's popular prime service
another thing that might be a downside
for some people is that the new
top-of-the-line Apple TV is more
expensive than almost every other
streaming box or stick we looked at
including Amazon fire TV all of Roku
streaming devices and the new Google
chromecast and it's the same price as
the Nvidia shield which lives somewhere
between a gaming console and a set-top
box but given all of its new features
Apple TV gets the top spot if Amazon
Prime video is one of your top sources
of video or you're looking for a less
costly solution then we have an
excellent alternative option Roku
streaming boxes are
seriously close competition for appletv
in fact you don't even need the hundred
and thirty dollar Roku for you could
spend a little less and go with the Roku
three and still get a pretty similar
Roku experience but the Roku 4 has more
processing power and something else
worth noting that we're not giving much
weight to yet 4k Roku 4 is not the only
box with 4k support the Amazon fire TV
and the Nvidia shield have it too but 4k
is still so limited in terms of content
and requiring the right kind of TV that
it's still too early to make it a deal
breaker where Roku stands out then is in
its availability of content and how easy
it makes it for you to find that content
Roku has over 3,000 channels that
include both popular video streaming
apps and totally niche content unlike
Apple TV it does offer Amazon Prime
video and Google's Play movie service
and if you do have a 4k TV you don't
have to go hunting for it
Roku has a section in its menu dedicated
to finding 4k TV content like Apple TV
Roku offers voice search through its
nifty remote that was searches
specifically around content not stuff
like the local weather Roku also gets
the nod for having thought to introduce
a headphone jack and an earlier version
of the remote so you can plug in
headphones and not disturb your
housemates or your kids while you're
watching TV but Apple has even out
thought that one adding the ability to
use Bluetooth headphones with its latest
box so you're not tethered to the remote
all of these boxes are really useful
devices whether you're a cord cutter or
you're just looking for easier access to
things like Netflix Hulu and HBO go and
even if you do go for other options or a
less expensive streaming stick you're
not sacrificing a lot much of the same
basic content will be there but Apple TV
stands out for its interface its
ecosystem of apps and all of the other
little elements of design and usability
that Apple has come up with for its
latest box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
