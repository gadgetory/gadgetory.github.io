- [Ashley] In our new podcast.
- [Anna] And we have a new podcast.
- [Kara] Our very first podcast.
- Influencers, celebrities, journalists,
random friends of yours,
everyone has a podcast.
Spotify plans to spend $500 million
on podcast related
acquisitions this year alone.
But why is this happening now?
Podcasts have been
around for over a decade.
To understand what changed to make
podcasts the phenomenon they are now,
we have to, hold on.
This is better.
Okay, we have to look at the big picture.
So yeah, podcasts came
about because of Apple,
iTunes and iPods.
- Now we recently announced something new
for iTunes and iPod and
it's called podcasting.
- [Ashley] Apple brought
podcast to iTunes in 2005.
- Podcasting of course is a concatenation
of iPod and broadcasting.
- Steve Jobs called
pocasts, TiVo for radio,
which is an insanely dated reference,
but can help us contextualize
this whole shift.
Before podcasting you had the radio,
with it's ads, unpredictable content,
and your favorite hosts
timed to specific days
with specific shows, but with podcasts.
- You can download radio
shows and listen to 'em
on your computer or put 'em
on your iPod anytime you want.
- And you can subscribe
to these shows too,
so you never miss an episode.
Plus podcasts are free
just like the radio.
With the release of internet
connected smartphones,
people could download podcasts
onto their phones directly
instead of having to load the audio
onto their phone from their computer.
And that made listening
to shows even easier.
Still in 2009 only 11%
of the US population
had listened to a podcast
in the last month,
but then a podcast arrived in 2014
that changed everything.
(dramatic music)
- [Sarah] From this American Life
and WBEZ Chicago, it's Serial.
One story told week by
week, I'm Sarah Koenig.
- Serial broke with
established podcast rules.
It was a narrative, mystery, crime show
that told a single story
over many episodes versus just one.
And that new format drew listeners in.
It became the fastest
podcast to ever reach
five million downloads
and streams on iTunes.
Around the same time that Serial and other
highly produced shows became popular,
cars were becoming more connected too,
which gave commuters an opportunity
and place to listen.
Plus new direct to consumer companies
had money to spend on podcast ads.
The confluence of all of these factors
pushed the podcast
business to new heights.
- [Male] This week's show
is brought to you by Casper.
- [Announcer] This episode
is sponsored by Dell.
- [Woman Announcer] Turn your great idea
into a reality with Squarespace.
- Last year podcasts created nearly
half a billion dollars in revenue.
Maybe you've heard hosts read ad
and give you a promo code.
That's a main way shows make money.
And that code helps advertisers know
which show has sold their product.
Shows make money in other ways too.
Some adapt their story for TV
and others host live events.
Other than the recording costs,
audio is relatively cheap to capture,
particularly compared to video.
So it can be a lucrative business.
Media companies and individual creators
can try out podcasts without
risking a ton of cash.
And they can publish their shows
in the same places that
major publishers do.
Now that there's so much money in podcasts
companies want more control and visibility
in to how well their ads actually work.
So podcast technology is
becoming more sophisticated
and the field is changing.
Promo codes might not be needed anymore.
Advertisers want a more
robust way to track ads,
similarly to how they
do with banners online.
That's why the Interactive
Advertising Bureau
established it's podcast
measure technical guidelines
in December 2017.
With this new standard,
advertisers now know
what counts as a download, or a play,
and they can get a real sense
of how many people heard their ad.
The ads themselves are becoming
smarter and dynamic too.
Which means one ad doesn't have to live
inside the same episode forever.
They can be swapped out with other ads
as time goes on and podcasters
can improve their ad offerings
by guaranteeing timeliness.
Everything is formalizing in an effort
to make the field even more lucrative.
Some podcast players are experimenting
with exclusive content too,
which is a fundamental
change to the open world
podcasts have traditionally lived in.
Podcasts are starting to be tracked
more like the rest of the web
and the content is
starting to be distributed
more like movies or TV shows.
So why does everyone have a podcast now?
Because they're cheap to
make, the stakes are low,
and the opportunity to make
some cash could be big.
Plus who doesn't love the
sound of their own voice.
So now that you've just watched this video
on podcasts, wouldn't you know it,
I have a podcast too and
you should check it out.
It's called Why'd You Push that Button.
We'll put a link below
and you should click it.
See what it's all about, check it out.
All right, we'll see you later, bye.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
