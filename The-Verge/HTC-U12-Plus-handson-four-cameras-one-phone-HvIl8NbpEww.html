is the new HTC u12 plus it's a successor
to last year's u11 and you will evan
plus they're available in other parts of
the world and it's a company's 2018
flagship smartphone now a lot of things
are very similar to the U 11 in terms of
design and features but there's
definitely some more modern upgrades
here and starting with the screen you
can see it's a bigger screen than before
it's now a six inch panel it's a very
high resolution qhd+ and it's a Super
LCD 6 panel instead of AMOLED that we're
seeing on other devices but it does have
HDR 10 support now in the process of
adding that bigger screen HTC did make
the bezels on the u12 plus smaller above
and below and then also on the sides so
the YouTube all plus is actually a
little bit narrower than last year's u
11 which makes it a little bit easier to
hold and the obvious change here is that
the fingerprint sensor is now on the
back it's just below the camera but it's
right under where your finger would land
as opposed to on the front in terms of
design it's very similar to last year's
phone it still has HTC's liquid metal
type of design which uses curved glass
and these very reflective finishes with
a metal frame it's available in three
different colors there's a translucent
blue and a black available in the US and
then there's this flame red color that
will be coming to other markets across
the world all of them are very premium
very pretty they really feel nice and
well built as you kind of would have
expect from a HTC phone at this point a
couple other different features on the
hardware as well now there's still HTC
edge Sense technology which means that
you can squeeze the phone to do
different things like it's squeezed to
turn on the flashlight here you can set
it to whatever things you want you could
set to launch assistant or launch camera
or launch an app or anything like that
that hasn't changed too much from last
year's phone but one new feature is
ability to double tap so you can double
tap it to set different things right now
this set so brings up some buttons on
the screen but you can set it to open an
app or change the screen size and things
like that and then the buttons here on
the side the power and volume rocker are
not actual buttons in the sense that
you're used to they don't really depress
when you press them instead you get a
little buzz when you click the button
which feels weird at first but it's kind
of neat it uses the same kind of
underlying technology there's the
pressure sensitivity on the sides but
it's applied to the buttons here so
that's
the front on the bottom you got a USBC
charger there's no headphone jack not
huge surprise there the one that
headphone jack last year so
unfortunately there's not one this year
but each should see does bundle its you
sonic headphones in the box so you get
those with the phone when you buy it and
it does have dual speakers so there's
speaker on the bottom as well as speaker
on the top for pretty loud and vibrant
sound inside the you 12 plus has a
Snapdragon 8045 processor six gigabytes
of RAM and it comes in 64 or 128
gigabytes of storage both of them
support micro SD card expansion as well
and then of course like last year it is
ip68 water-resistant now the other big
new thing here is that it's got dual
cameras and not just on the back like
we've seen on a lot of phones lately but
also on the front so there on the back
there's two cameras there's a 12
megapixel sensor on the wide-angle
camera and then a 16 megapixel sensor on
the telephoto camera and that lets you
do the standard portrait mode blurring
bokeh effect type of things and then on
the front there's two eight megapixel
sensors here that allow you to do those
things for your selfies as well one
thing that is unique is HTC software
lets you actually adjust the effect of
the bokeh after the fact and then you
can also change the focus point around
which is kind of a unique feature that
we haven't seen before the u12 plus is
launching with android 8.0 Oreo out of
the box it will be updated to Android P
at some point later this year but
there's no timing yet for that it's
running HTC Sense interface which if
you've been using it for the past couple
of years you know that it's pretty
similar to what Google provides on its
pixel phones but not exactly it's still
it's very clean easy to use version of
Android there's really little to
complain about with Android on HTC
phones at this point
HTC has been building premium phones for
years and the u12 is really no different
it feels great when you hold it it's got
really nice tight tolerances materials
are really nice and it's also because
it's a little bit narrower it's actually
a little easier to hold it'd be nice if
it had wireless charging but
unfortunately that's not available this
year but it does have quick charging
over USB
through quick charge 3 or quick chart 4
if you have a compatible charger now
with that premium feel comes a premium
price and this is gonna be priced pretty
much in the same range as other premium
Android smartphones that you can buy
right now
and HTC is not gonna be selling this
through carriers but you will be able to
get it through HTC comm or amazon.com
and it's going to support Verizon AT&amp;amp;T
or t-mobile pre-orders actually start
today it's going to be shipping in the
beginning of next month for more on the
HTC u 12 including our forthcoming
review or we'll take a look at all of
these features in more detail please
