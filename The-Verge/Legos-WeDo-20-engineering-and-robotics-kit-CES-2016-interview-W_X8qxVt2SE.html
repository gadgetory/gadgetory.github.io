Verge it's day 3 at CES and I am a grown
human adult who's gonna be playing with
Legos for the next 5 minutes
please excuse me it's been a very long
week already enjoyed actually by LEGO
Education this week they're unveiling we
do 2.0 is an educational kit designed
for elementary schools and students to
learn robotics engineering math science
so with this iteration and new
generation of video 2.0 we've built in
some new technology features so
Bluetooth wireless technology that
enables it to run freely and you be run
using the tablet devices so what is this
is this part of the the curriculum right
here yeah so this is actually from our
series of getting started projects so
this build right here would be the first
project that we would encourage students
and teachers to do it's a very simple
build and it teaches the basics of how
to connect your smart hub to the device
that you're using to control it and also
how to control your motor and the motor
is a really important feature in most of
the builds so it's a good place to start
so this particular project you you learn
about science rovers and wide scientists
use rovers to explore you know far-off
or dangerous places that they can't go
themselves so if you open a project in
the library the content is launched and
what you see here is what students will
actually be working through so initially
they're given a challenge
they're also asked to watch a video that
is a little animation video of our to
elementary figures Max and Mia they
connect them to the problem that they're
going to be trying to solve in the
challenge and after they've watched the
video they're then able to follow our
step-by-step building instructions and
then
you're launched into your programming
palette what else do you have in here
besides just like uh pieces yep so
there's also a tilt sensor so you can
build a model that changes its behavior
based on the angle that the tilt sensor
is placed at and then there's also a
motion sensor and that detects if
objects are coming forward or away from
from your model okay so the tilt sensor
and emotion since are the other sensors
in addition to the motor and then the
smart hub that are included in the kit
very cool so this is coming out this
this year is it coming out now is it
available yesterday okay yes it's 100%
available suite and is it just for
classrooms are you guys talking to you
know teachers unions and schools are you
guys actually selling direct to consumer
as well yep so and the product was
developed specifically for use in
classrooms we sell through LEGO
Education North America direct to
schools but we also have an e-commerce
site
