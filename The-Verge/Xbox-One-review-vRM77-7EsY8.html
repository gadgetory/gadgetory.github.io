this is Microsoft's Xbox one yes it's a
games console the successor to the Xbox
360 which is now showing its age eight
years after its launch but it's also
something much bigger much more
ambitious the Xbox one is Microsoft's
way of attaching itself to every single
thing you do in your living room it's a
gaming machine a set-top box a cable box
and a computer all rolled into one $499
device for all it's trying to do the box
itself isn't much to look at it's not
ugly so much as it is just boring it
looks like the ultimate sci-fi evolution
of a VCR or at least how people in the
80s would have imagined it part glossy
part vented and all very black and boxy
and humongous there's a disc drive on
the left side a glowing capacitive Xbox
logo power button on the front and
really nothing else to see it's not
pretty or well designed like the
PlayStation 4 it's just a box for all
the many parts of the Xbox one with the
new box comes a new controller the Xbox
one controller feels absolutely
identical to the Xbox 360s gamepad
except in the ways it feels better
it has clicky d-pad buttons where the
360 had mushy ones and has smoother
triggers in a smaller bump for the
removable battery but if you've been
using a 360 it will take exactly no time
to get used to the new controller
there's a little more texture on the
grips and a little less on the analog
sticks though there are still grippy
thanks to new rims around their circular
edges and the whole controller has a
higher more curved profile the glowing
Xbox button takes you home from anywhere
you are and start and select have been
replaced by the occasionally confusing
view and menu buttons the coolest new
feature is the controller's impulse
triggers which are hyper specific
vibrations that fit whatever game you're
playing in Forza it's made to feel like
you're actually holding a steering wheel
in a fast moving car it's really jarring
and only exists in a few places anyway
but it's something developers are
definitely going to make use of setting
up the Xbox is a long somewhat
complicated process and it does take a
while but Microsoft does a good job of
guiding you through the many
configurations updates and options
basically you're setting up a gaming
machine a universal remote and a PC all
at the same time it's definitely worth
taking the time to do right when you
turn on the Xbox one you'll see a very
similar tiled interface to anyone you
would see on any other Windows 8 PC it's
pretty and colorful and customisable
different users can have different
colors in different layouts and as soon
as you sit down the Xbox recognizes you
and adapts everything to your particular
setup actually that part's import
because while this is very much built
like a Windows PC with an 8 core AMD
Jaguar CPU 8 gigs of RAM and a 500 gig
hard drive it's not designed to be used
with a mouse and keyboard or with a
touchscreen it's designed to be used
with your controller but mostly with
your voice that happens through the new
connect the astonishingly powerful and
accurate device that comes with every
Xbox one you don't have to use Kinect
but you should it's what automatically
recognizes you and signs you in what
makes getting around the operating
system much easier than it would be
otherwise you say Xbox on to turn the
console on and the Xbox boots up from
there the two commands I use most for
Xbox watch followed by the name of a TV
channel like ESPN or MTV
and Xbox go to followed by any app game
menu or option on the device as long as
you're in a quiet small room the voice
controls work pretty well but if there
are any other people other noises or
just any echo it starts to get really
problematic it felt like half the time
it took me two or even three or four
tries to get the Xbox one to recognize
commands and it didn't always get them
right either you also have to learn the
particular cadence Xbox go home works
but Xbox home doesn't there's a big
learning curve here especially for
things like navigating in the browser or
snapping Skype calls to the side of your
screen but it's worth figuring out it's
partly worth figuring out because the
alternative doing everything with your
controller is kind of awkward it's just
way easier to say Xbox watch ESPN and
then Xbox play local cycle at least it's
easier when it works
Microsoft has said that developing apps
for the new console will be really easy
but we haven't really seen the fruits of
that yet other than Skype Skype Sinta
grated with the Kinect and thanks to its
wide high-res camera and impressive
microphone it's a pretty fantastic
experience to just sit on your couch and
talk to someone otherwise for now
there's really just the standard set of
media apps Netflix and Hulu Amazon and
HBO GO ESPN and the NFL plus apps for
channels like Fox and FX the potential
here is huge and most of the apps work
really well but so far the experience
feels pretty much like a faster Xbox 360
actually like the 360 only better is a
bit of a theme for the Xbox one at least
at the beginning even the best games on
the console like Forza Motorsport 5 Dead
Rising 3 and Ryse son of Rome don't feel
like something completely new and
different they're gorgeous with better
graphics and amazing detail but they
just feel like the best yet not a huge
leap forward and like the PlayStation 4
the Xbox one has a large group of third
party titles you've got your
battlefields Call of Duty's
since Creed's and of course all your
sports games where the experience
differs from the ps4 is the Kinect and
again it's like the 360s but better
connects exclusive titles fall into two
very predictable categories full-on
fitness trainers and fitness trainers
masked as arcade games like Just Dance
and Kinect Sports rivals Xbox fitness in
particular is really fun and is a great
demonstration of how eerily accurate the
new Kinect sensor is Zoo Tycoon also
uses Kinect a lot and it's a
surprisingly immersive and adorably cute
simulator the fun does wear off after a
while but it's a really cool example of
how uniquely you can game with the Xbox
one ultimately the biggest way Kinect
will come into play is how it can add to
games games like dead rising 3 require
you to literally shake your controller
when a zombie grabs you or shout things
like over here to get a crowds attention
of course if you don't like shouting and
shaking you can just turn it off in
settings with other games any Kinect
functionality was limited to leaning
past walls or some kind of rudimentary
voice commands it's nothing that feels
forced and in this case is mostly
additive and optional but it's only
going to get better and more interesting
over time the part of the Xbox one
experience with the most room to grow
where Microsoft is clearly betting on
the future rather than the present is
its TV integration right now it's kind
of a mess
changing channels with your voice is
great but it doesn't always work and
even when it does it's just a series of
Xbox menus overtop of your cable boxes
menus with no clear indication of what's
going on and it's all happening through
an IR blaster old and cumbersome
technology that doesn't make a good
experience for anyone it's not actually
controlling your TV it's just sending
the commands for 7 3 &amp;amp; 5 to get to
channel 735 that means it doesn't work
if you're in a menu it doesn't work if
you're slightly misaligned it's really
just a mess it doesn't support Dolby
Digital yet either which means no
surround sound which means I won't be
plugging it into my cable box anytime
soon really the best thing the Xbox one
offers right now is that you don't have
to switch inputs between the Xbox in
your cable box that's kind of the whole
point and switching from TV to game is
really easy but even then the console
takes a few seconds to turn on freezes
when switching channels sometimes and
every once in a while the TV app will
just crash unless everything was broken
everything else the Xbox one offers on
top of your TV experience the app
channels and the awkward overlaid
playback controls are really better left
alone for now anyway if Microsoft can
integrate better and actually replace
your set-top box instead of just being a
middleman between it and your TV it
could be really great that's really the
story of the Xbox one it's trying to do
so much
it has so many good ideas of course
having a computer underneath my TV is
great and of course I hate my set-top
box and of course I want to switch
between games in ESPN and even do both
at the same time but right now none of
that works as well as it should the
voice control is just good enough that I
want to use it all the time but so
inconsistent that I can't possibly do so
the Xbox one is a great game console
absolutely and out of the gate there are
more good games like Ryze and Forza then
on the ps4 but that's not what Microsoft
is going for if you're buying a console
right now for right now it's purely a
decision based on games pick the one
with the games you want to play and buy
that one two five years from now that
might change and Microsoft might have a
big wide offering with everything from
great games to the greatest set-top box
ever but there's a long difficult road
to that point and I can only pass the
time killing zombies for so long</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
