what goes into making the model 3 it's
not so forth design we aim for something
that was a very simple clean design
because the cars will be increasingly
autonomous so you won't really need to
look at an instrument panel all that
often you'll be able to do whatever you
want be able to watch movie talk to
friends go to sleep so one of the
challenges with the car is since it is
smaller than a Model S how do we make a
car that is smaller on the outside
bigger on the inside so we took an idea
from the Model X and we turned that
around put that on the rear of the Model
3 so that you could still have a great
deal of rear headroom and how to have
this amazing view while being in a
smaller car it's actually one of the
toughest design challenges of making the
model 3 and then and in terms of
engineering the car we had to engineer
it to be a lot easier to both the Model
S is an amazing coverage is very hard to
build a certificate the part countdown
design is full to be light but also to
make it affordable and then where this
really shows up is and things like
safety so on the way have you got the
car that is one of the safest cars in
the world of Volvo s60 the Volvo is
arguably the second safest car in the
world but I think it is it is obvious
which car you would prefer to be in in
an accident a question I get asked I
noticed its popping up on Twitter quite
a lot where is my model 3 sometimes not
phrase quite as nicely in terms of
production I think that's going to be
the major challenge for us over the next
6 9 months is how do we build a huge
number of cars frankly we're going to be
in production hell and welcome welcome
welcome to production hell we're
building the cars as fast as we can when
you have 10,000 unique items in a kit in
a vehicle or any any any object any one
of them can slow down the production
process so the production rate will move
as fast as the slowest and least
luckiest component and in the whole mix
so we've got giant giant factory making
battery packs and power trains giant
factory making cars and dry and supply
train and so all of those have to work
together in cadence in order to get to
our initial target of 5,000 cars a week
and then hopefully by the next year
towards 10,000 cars a week you're
probably wondering okay well like be
able to charge my car well this is like
probably the second most common question
I get on Twitter like the supercharger
is full what is wrong with you by the
end of next year there will be three
times as many super charges as there are
today so that should really help out a
lot okay so let's talk about the specs
for the Model 3 there there are two main
variants there's the standard in long
range the standard well is gonna be
$35,000 for 220 mile range it's going to
be a fast car so the acceleration will
still be well under six seconds hundred
thirty mile mile an hour top speed I
think you don't forget the long range
one which I have arranged in 310 miles
and be about roughly 5 seconds 0-60 140
mile an hour top speed so this it's
gonna be a really great card you would
not be able to find a better car
gasoline or electric in that price range
that is anywhere near is as great so
let's head over some cars we have the
first 30 production cars here being
charged right now right there those are
actual owners getting actual production
cars it's to give you a sense if you if
you're a model 3 now you'll probably get
it towards the end of next year but
because the S and the X are in
production if you order them now you can
get them in about one or two months I'd
like to think about all the customers
who have
model estimates and those who buy a
Model S and an X because in doing so you
make the three possible the money that
we we make with with a man s necks all
goes into building model three so thank
you for doing that
I want to just say to those that have
lined up for I am a model three I want I
just want you know we we realist that
really matters to us
I really care we're gonna do everything
we possibly can to give you the car
as soon as possible so we're gonna work
day and night to do right by the provide
the oil through that you've shown us
thank you thank you for a long time
supporters thank you guys to make it
thank you but about two-thirds come from
North America and about a third from the
rest of the world but as you can see
with this chart which looks like we're
being shot with ICBMs
like that that is the ICBM chart
actually versus a well we need a missile
