me Google they know when I wake up they
know when I go to bed they know what I
searched for they know everything I'm
interested in they know where I eat they
know where I sleep it's it's really kind
of be that Google knows everything and
is it creepy but they know everything
about me or is it just creepy that they
know so much about you know a single
topic well you know who knows a lot a
lot pretty much everything about mobile
Vlad and Chris are they creepy we're
gonna find out stay tuned for the verge
mobile show I am dieter bohn i'm ron
burgundy and i'm chris sigler this is
the verge of opal show it is the 6
episode of it for the week of july
second and we have got so much Google a
to talk about I can't even handle it do
you really think I'm creepy dieter no I
just I just I just posing the question
do you know is it is it creepy that you
know so much about mobile that's all
well I I'm personally offended I know
about Vlad I can't speak for Vlad I mean
Gladius oh that's cool that's true it's
Ron Burgundy i forgot i'm sorry and
you're a nosegay oh and you have you had
the most amazing mustache on the face of
the planet extra last know what I'm
really like you but I want to see you in
a mustache this is very important to me
this is very very important we need to
make this happen and I've had beards
yeah no beard is a mustache by itself
doesn't lost my face number than half
day I just stopped the only like an 80s
porn star like Robert this yeah that's
exactly what I going for this is getting
weird let's talk phones
yeah something creepy Alyssa that's
right so I mean what else is there to
talk about but I mean there is only
stuff we could talk about but let's just
Google i/o and jelly bean and the Nexus
Q and I mean I don't even know where to
start and this is partially because I
decided to wait to the last minute to
handle the the layout and actually I'm
talking about my jelly bean review I
also waited because I wanted to give
myself a ton of time with Google now
which because it does it gets better as
you spend time with it so I didn't want
to kick something out right away I
wanted to give it a chance to get to
know me which is very sweet um right
let's talk about the event itself we had
we had a big team there I was there Josh
was there Sean was there her Scott was
there Jordan was there Justin was there
we had a bunch of people there well yeah
atmosphere what was the atmosphere was
it was as crazy as it looked from the
outside it was insane insane insane the
first day the they didn't give press a
separate line and I know I I shouldn't
complain about not having a separate
special line for press because I've done
plenty of events not getting to even be
in the special line from press when
there is one but they basically just
like filled up the entire first floor of
the moscone center with developers like
it was wall-to-wall people and then you
know we went up one set of escalators
and then went around a halt and lined up
in the hall on the second floor and then
they stop that and then the line merged
in a really awkward way and then to get
up to the keynote we had to go up to
third set of escalators and everybody's
really agitating a way to get up there
because they were kind of late in fact i
started the keynote before everybody was
even sitting down and so since everybody
was like you know pushing up against the
the stanchions they opened it up and the
Google guy literally went let's go and
like turned and like threw his arm back
and started sprinting to the escalators
I'm like well I guess I guess that's
what we're doing now we're sprinting it
was it was nuts like they were really
really excited to make us run which and
somehow somehow there were no riots or
fistfights
yes I can well that's cuz everybody was
there I mean everyone is there to get
the insane amount of swag that google
gave away they gave away a Galaxy Nexus
Nexus 7 a nexus q and a chromebox see
here's the thing is these guys you
please these guys I've always go ahead
okay we interrupt each of them about
three times but I was gonna say these
guys aren't fools you know they I mean
as members of the press I don't think
we're paying anything to be there but
most of us are paying a fair chunk your
feeds be there yep so maybe you do want
to write maybe you do want to throw down
but presumably they did that on maybe
the day to keynote after they collected
they once were gasps daddy got through
all the information ah but there was a
really dirty swag it was still dangerous
wet day two they got the chromebox
Seether then we were just too efficient
into rational about it cuz thats that's
a good point actually like all of these
events and particularly I remembered the
Galaxy Nexus event when Google and
Samsung hosted in Hong Kong it was an
absolutely massive crush in front of the
doors never were even push then crashed
into one another but again nobody was
throwing punches like there was plenty
of reasons for people to get agitates to
the point of fighting but people like
actually I'm here to collect information
and see this pretty awesome new thing so
maybe I'll say the fighting to you later
now I'm there to fight I'm there to
throw down and that's why I was pretty
slave Irina said these words well there
there was extreme sports so after they
got done with the keynote and all the
announcements which I promise you were
actually going to talk about some your
inner runs on stage and in an impromptu
totally unscripted moment and wanted to
show off google glass and so they had
not just skydivers but the dudes wearing
the the wingsuits they jumped out of a
blink or a the original nitrogen bowler
the aircraft was it should i what no it
was it was the second day wasn't bland
by i'm not sure about the first day
anyway it was an airship the second day
was definitely an airship what I'm
getting to is I did it twice they
parachuted on the roof of the building
that got on dirt bikes then they went
over
another dude repelled down the side of
the building and then they rode bikes
again through muscovy center through the
crowd and up on stage they did it twice
because you know the first time wasn't
enough right wow so got it you know
actually thinking about it now I comedy
that is only been a week or rather than
google why all happened within the past
week just because we did well we
previewed it on the last podcast / show
but it just feels like it's so massive
and so comprehensive in terms of what
google introduced and showed us they
kind of feels like it's further back in
time we will head the nexus 7 review and
everybody has dealt was pretty deeply
into that new device and it's shockingly
impressive again we'll find time to
discuss it and it was all the Nexus Q
stuff and then today android 4.1 it's
actually surprising how much Google
managed to squeeze into those two days
Thank guys pink yeah yeah although they
don't eat to be fair I mean there was
only so much that they could say about
4.1 because it is only a point one and
they didn't didn't describe you know
every little thing about it but but
let's just let's just get into it let's
get into jelly bean so it's basically
the same look and feel as ice cream
sandwich it basically you know it's the
same look field they the main things
that they did is the first year was
called project butter where they
increased the responsiveness of the
screen by increasing by standardizing a
frame rate they set up this the triple
buffering so that GPU and the CPU and
the screen could operate independently
and they wouldn't slow each other down
and I forget what the third project
butter thing was oh I mean it's not
effectiveness oh yeah touch
responsiveness that's right so the net
effect is that like it feels way better
it feels way better than four point oh
and four point oh of course felt way
better than 2.3 no in the the video on
the review it doesn't quite come through
and I mean that might be like a frame
rate thing I had a heck of a time in
betting that era encoding that video but
like like the multi-tasking menu there's
like almost no lag there
it's it's really good it's not you know
it's not iOS level and like you just you
can't deny that if once you use it it's
not quite as like moving a piece of
paper on the screen as iOS but it's
really close and it's close enough where
like i'm not really complaining about it
and i wasn't really playing with four
point oh but like I didn't know how bad
I had it but the 4.1 it's great and
what's really as I did it on the Galaxy
Nexus which is what eight months old
they didn't have to like throw massive
hardware at yeah that's an old Oh Matt
40 one of the really impressive things
to me about iOS has always been the fact
that even going back to iOS one iphone
OS at the time the original iphone it
still felt very responsive then and I
think that's because Apple is very good
at employing creative visual techniques
to make you believe that the device is
more responsive than it actually is and
I always think back to the way the
browser worked you know on on the
original iphone you'd scroll page around
and it would instantly go to
checkerboards but it would never start
stuttering and it would never feel like
it was lagging behind your touch and
that is so so important I would much
rather have that checkerboard effect
then the then the perception that the
the phone isn't instantly responding to
my touch and I think that Google is just
now getting around to recognizing that
and fixing it and I recently heard a
presentation from Nvidia where and Vlad
we may have talked about this in the
past but in integra 3 they did some
specific things to try to try to address
that as well so Phylly that's that's
finally solved or very close to sold
yeah regarding Tegra free I recorded CES
and video showed off a particular touch
technology which I believe is called
direct touch but I'm quote me on that
it's something like that they gave it up
to come Friday and it was specifically
about the lag between your touch and the
smoothness of response with touch
screens which at a time sounded
intriguing but again we never really got
a chance to test it out in for all to
see any you know pretty engaging demos
of it but there's every chance that this
could be something that Google has
sat at least if not integrated obviously
nvidia would probably want that to be a
tegra free only thing which wouldn't
make it Universal 200 4.1 as a software
but is good to see that google is
addressing that exact same thing and
also think it's very easy to under eight
the importance of project butter like
okay first of all it's easy because
we've got such a silly name let's just
agree like I don't care if google
continues to give these dorky names for
the next 20 years every time a new one
comes up I will say it it's a silly name
so jelly bean is silly Ice Cream
Sandwich was triple silly because it has
free words for crying out loud it wasn't
even efficient till the space and our
project butter is again it's
unbelievable like this is a
multi-billion dollar business we're
talking about and a critical aspect of
improving your competitiveness in it and
then you call it butter yeah yeah it's
not it's not if you're talking about
something that involves a touchscreen do
you really want to be thinking about
that in conjunction with butter i mean i
get buttery smooth but like butter spray
CEO I mean it's just kind of gross right
i mean there was so many you know hip
words like you can use Greek mythology
you can use futurism you can use token
the words and names you can just grab
anything they're like this there's so
much mythology that geeky folks can get
into it doesn't have to be food is it
it's just talking but beyond that what I
think it's important is user interface
responsiveness is still to me like the
number one thing the paramount thing
with any operating system this is also
the paramount complain that i had about
symbian on the previous podcast with the
808 PureView and I think Google going
after it again with 4.1 even though as
lead to said four-point-oh was a massive
improvement I mean as far as I'm
concerned four-point-oh fixed ninety
percent of all lag problems with Android
with just a basic user interface and
going after it again with 4.1 shows a
Google is really keen on maximising
responsiveness everywhere
I can tell you you know once you spend
time with ice cream sandwich you do find
areas where the phones lag like with
Galaxy Nexus perfect example is as soon
as you jump into your contacts list if
you start scrolling really quickly you
find lag as soon as you jump into emails
he start scrolling really quickly you
find like maybe when it has to both load
things up and start scrolling through
them it lags like the animation starts
to break up forget forget about
standardizing frame rates you lose you
go down to like two three praying frames
a second for like a split second ain
fixes itself so there's definitely room
for improvement is it deserve any areas
where Google can you know raise raise
the bar raise the performance it's
raised it to 60 frames a second with
project butter which is great I mean you
really are going to see extremely smooth
and consistent primary set and I also
noticed in your video data that the
browser just another really important
part perform smoother and faster again
the exact same hardwood which is great
yeah that that was actually one of the
things that surprised me I mean to be
clear I mean we're talking about sort of
responsiveness and and the feel of the
OS in terms of Rob benchmark CEO I ran
all benchmarks on Android 4.1 a Galaxy
Nexus and Android 4.1 Galaxy Nexus side
by side on a fresh food and the numbers
were pretty much identical I there was
no real difference that could make that
could matter but just scrolling around
and especially just stuff popping up so
like the phone isn't like just faster it
just feels faster and i mean thats nice
feels faster matters and yeah that's
does the very core of the software this
is this is what like as far as I'm
concerned if you're going to improve
your software make the one thing that is
fundamental and constant to it which is
the user interface better right because
then it's just the universal upgrade
it's kind of like um you know I i know
people complain what we refer example
but is the truth it's kind of like an
apple upgrade where it seems minor just
you know it's like a one-sentence ok we
just stuck a massive
new Retina display in laptop but then
you go and use it and you're like
actually this makes a huge difference in
day-to-day use okay maybe not the
retinal display and laptops immediately
but you know what I'm saying right Apple
does is upgrades they're really easy and
quick to verbalize and then because it's
not a massive list of upgrades people
think was just one thing how can it
matter so much and I think like this is
exactly what Google's doing and is the
absolute perfect thing that google
should be doing I would I wonder you go
ahead i think that i think the project
butter is very important but i would
actually argue that google now is a big
deal not just it transcends android it's
a big deal for 4.1 but i think that this
is actually that this is the culmination
of everything google has been doing for
the past 15 years is google now I mean
it's only going to get crazier and
crazier yeah I remember um I'm a singer
who's one of the Google fellows he did a
talk in London a couple of years ago
that I attended and he was talking about
the development of search from the
beginning of Google and then point six
so he had six major bullet points of
development point six was searched
without search and he was talking about
exactly google now thank you saying
predicting things like when you fly it
will be traffic pretty things like you
might be hungry here restaurants you
might want to buy something you might
want to go and pick up your dry cleaning
etc sees a familiar with what what
Google now is I mean it it when you jump
into it it gives you like cards that
sort of display and eat information so I
just popped mine up here I've got the
mobile podcast so I've got the weather
and what else I got I guess that's it
right now because it knows i'm at work
and I'm gonna be here for a while but
when it gets close to quitting time or
what it thinks is quitting time it'll
give me directions home by a transit
it's got restaurants nearby it really
wants me to go to Mars bar restaurant
like in the worst way it keeps on
popping that one up but what's
interesting about Google now to me is
one we've been hearing this promise for
so long I talked about this on the verge
guy so that we would get phones that
would magically give us information and
now find
Google's actually trying it and to like
I don't know who else could pull this
off like who else knows enough about me
who else is collecting enough
information from me from the phone and
from other metrics and you know has an
ecosystem to support it to give me this
kind of functionality who else is
plugged into the transit system in San
Francisco and has a robust set of maps
and you know locations and knows that
I'm searching for online and you know
yada yada yada yada I mean apples I
suppose close but I feel like it it
doesn't have the sort of raw
computational expertise to try and pull
it off so like it's a uniquely Google
product because it takes pretty much
everything google does and combines it
into one experience or at least it's
trying to do that and it's a uniquely
Google product because like I don't know
who else could could even attempt it and
have it not come off as a total flop
because it's not a total flop it's it's
pretty good it's not changing my life
but you know I'm checking it a couple of
times a day and at first was like oh
this is I don't care about this but it's
there's fewer and fewer those moments as
time goes on it that the mars bar thing
dieter because it makes me wonder
actually kind of concerns me to think
that this is like this is the next
generation of google adwords right like
companies are gonna be able to buy
terrible vision chris noble you know
it's true right exactly this matter no
vision bub saying companies can be able
to buy and companies are gonna be able
to buy into your your consciousness
basically i mean that's what this boils
down to okay but to play what what's the
opposite of devil's advocate the
positive advocate there's no certificate
ok so today's em ok um i do feel like
getting back to the idea of search
without search i mean google nail taps
into Google's core competency which is
as data says data collection and search
indexing etc I mean still ultimately
Google now is just a
up connected service that gets you
essentially like search information that
you need it just kind of tries to
preemptively tries to do it practically
tries to predict what you're actually
going to want right so again if Google
didn't have its own search algorithms
and indexing and colas etc you could do
it so again it's unique functionality to
Google but if you go to Google search
yourself you'll find yes a whole bunch
of companies are buying ads and listings
promoted listings but they clearly
identified so why would they well in
issue be possible okay learning first of
all Google now is barely out of the door
so let's not get first it off is just
the promotion platform Google will
probably be very very cautious before
starts increasing ads you wanted to
flourish and develop before ads ads but
then what it does I imagine they will be
kind of identifiable at least like if
not it's something you can all sit out
of B&amp;amp;N to do Google switch to paid
placement in shopping or the they kind
of backtrack on that that's not quite as
clear what's what isn't isn't an ad and
that in that part of Google pay-to-play
that's that's right i mean everything
that Google does is built around
advancing the core cash cow which is
search and Google now is clearly even
though we're just seeing the first
glimmers of it it's clearly the future
of Google as a platform and as search as
a product and there's zero question in
my mind that they are going to
commercialize this this product and turn
it into a money-making platform for them
the only question lies I mean let's get
clear every single search brings up web
results and those what results have ads
right but but I mean it there there are
many Google now presents many new and
interesting and quote unquote smarter
ways to integrate that right and the
question is how are they going to do
that how lightly are they going to tread
in turning this into a new form of of of
profit center for them now hey you know
you know what I'm thinking
about something else here which was
again going back to Apple being the
closest competitor but when apple
updates its eerie for iOS 6 you notice
that Apple's sources information were
all outside companies so Cirie being
able to look up sports scores and player
bios and things like that it comes from
yahoo sports movie reviews rotten
tomatoes restaurant reviews of things
Yelp Google strength and the thing that
google has been doing up is the fact
that Google is bought everybody up you
know imports i get so it has restaurant
reviews it it already has the maps in
the search and all that stuff already so
most of the stuff that comes into google
now is in-house and as a matter a
partagé and they tried to buy yelp a
few years ago right net that deal fell
through but at one time that was that
was part of their plan hmm but anyway
yeah don't get don't get me wrong don't
get me wrong I'm I'm very bullish on
Google now and I think it is one of the
most exciting things to happen in search
and for Google as a company may be in
forever I'm just very concerned at how
the commercialization of the platform is
going to proceed over the next few years
we'll see well I mean it's a fun place
on the intro is total only just get this
out real quick like what I wasn't joking
that Google knows when I wake up it
knows where I live it knows where I
sleep it knows where I work it knows
what i eat it knows where I go every
minute of the day because it google maps
is you know I don't know if it's every
minute but you know I'm checking in i'm
open your maps up all the time ready
don't this is one feller there's one
comfort for you and that is the fact
that Google doesn't care who you are so
God it will keep anonymous data on you
because it really really doesn't care
who you are you're just a data point and
so long as it's able to sell data points
as opposed to personally identifiable
information you're fine fair enough um
you know actually just leave there's
another critical system play that
happened
that we should really talk about in the
because they spent a long time talking
about google play and you know this was
specifically about the nexus 7 as a
kindle competitor yada yada yada but
they basically spent a good third of the
time for the nexus 7 talking about
Google Play and pushing that ecosystem
of you know movies and media and whatnot
and of course there's the Nexus Q which
you know only works via a google play
and i don't know like that feels like a
little bit of an overreach here I mean I
suppose they have to do it they have to
try but I you know google now's like yes
of course Google should do this this is
interesting but Google Play is like well
really you really think you're going to
be beat amazon at this game do you
really think you're going to be an apple
at this game I'm not really sure well
there's no question that they want their
own content ecosystem and I mean I can't
blame them that that's one of the most
profitable uh well maybe profitable
isn't right word but it's been a very
profitable venture for Apple it is an
extremely profitable venture for amazon
and for a company like Google to have to
rely on on amazon or geez I don't know
Zinio or I I don't know who else to to
to bring that content into a self
branded flagship quote-unquote flagship
device like the Nexus 7 I mean that
that's that's just not going to fly
right they need I mean they're getting
Google's getting paid for for all that
content that the customers are buying
out of google play and that's yes that's
right i don't you I just can't envision
Google not having a competitive software
and media consumption store with the
other guys it's just not possible I mean
Microsoft is building up to do the same
whether it goes it xbox or you know
whatever the heck it wants to call the
store is gonna try and do absolutely the
same thing it's the reason why Microsoft
is also going into hardware they're all
kind of more or less building up to work
into apples model I mean it's fine to
say but it's the truth you know Google
now legitimately has a nexus program
and the only thing that's consistent
about next program is that it's
google-branded hardware and Google
marketed hardware and that's one of the
big highlights for the Nexus 7 and
probably the reason why the wise asus
wanted to build a nexus 7 is because
google is completely handing the
marketing with that so asus can save
money there even though it seems to be
being produced at cost so that cost so
we should talk a bit about the nexus 7
because it sounds certainly from Josh's
review ivan played with the with the
tablet personally but dieter i know
you'll be able to speak to this bit it
sounds certainly sounds to me like this
is the most exciting non i pad tablet
ever is that a fair assessment one other
percent it is the most exciting out on
ipad tablet I've ever used and it's it's
pretty thin I think it's just what is it
a millimeter thicker than an iPad and
the bezels are kind of big around the
screen but it's you know but but t is
like oh you want a big bezel so you can
hold it in landscape and I guess that's
true but like it's fast and it just it
feels right in a way that honeycomb and
the United cream sandwich tablets never
ever did and that's partly because the
you know the Android tablets that I had
experienced was before were like the the
original seven ish galaxy tab which was
on i think i was on 2.3 and then you
know 10-inch tablets which just like you
hated that you had this crap in the four
corners of the screen you had google
search up here you had multitasking and
something else down here you had
notifications over here you had apps up
in the other corner and you're just like
real all the time yeah and so with the
nexus 7 they're like you know what and
this is actually one of the interesting
things that you know i tried to cover
come across on the review each other be
it is like like everything from
honeycomb except for like that that
initial idea of having a pop-up
multitasking thumbnail list is gone like
there's there's very little tron left
that that bar on the bottom the four
corners of honeycomb that's gone the
font is improved it's like it's it's you
know it's like a blown-up phone but it's
a blown-up version of jelly bean which
is great
instead of you know a shark down version
of honeycomb which I I think it's even
if you liked it you got to admit it had
baggage and i think was totally right
the right call to jettison it but will
this you i work at 10 inches that is an
excellent question i think it'll be
pretty weird at 10 inches yeah yeah
that's my concern I mean 10 inch is a
very very important form factor for
tablets obviously and somebody is going
to have to make a 10-inch 4.1 tablet
whether it be Google through through a
partner and they branded as a nexus or
if it's somebody else but somebody's
going to do it and that's still a very
open question what that UI is going to
look like can I and I just rewind us
back to Matthias comments for just a
quick moment about you want a thick
bezel in order to hold it in landscape
that is basically the tech equivalent of
a car salesman telling you I know this
car is slow but that's safe hey you want
it to be slow because then you won't
kill yourself when you're driving I just
give me a tiny little bezel and then I
can stick things on the outside of it if
I really need to hold up I I don't know
if I agree that this is a prop this has
always been a problem for me with the
iPads this day one like if I'm if I'm
reading it in bed and I'm holding it
above my face you know and you always
hear stories about people dropping their
iPads on their faces and breaking their
faces to really tragic and I don't mean
to make light of that situation although
it is kind of funny yeah uh so many car
like noses right it it there is
definitely something be said for having
a thick bezel and i agree with you Vlad
I think that that Matthias was putting a
positive spin on you know asus who
started this project to make like a
low-end a bad one called a crap tablet
but like a low-end tablet that that uh
that was under two hundred fifty dollars
this is the you know is sean hollister
wrote an excellent piece about this you
should go read it start light as thread
life as the memo and uses a low-cost
Tegra 3 and all that jazz so i think
that ultimately the bezel is there
because it's a low-cost device
but that being said I think that there
is a very legitimate positive spin to be
put on that big bezel well it's not it's
bigger on the top and the bottom than it
is on the sides and portrait and so
having it when you put it in the
landscape be a little bit bigger than it
means you can like hold it with your
thumb and you give more leverage the
stupid thing actually so no the home
screen on jellybean is not does not go
into landscape that's not going to work
at Texas it's just not know that means
knowing like everywhere contentious EP
well so maybe it would for a 4 by 3
tablet because you know you think of an
iPad it's mostly used in portrait but if
they're if they're putting out 16 by 9
10 inch tablets like they usually do
with Android then there I mean they
can't avoid the landscape question they
just can't but let's also not rush
conclusions here as or because the
android 4.1 that we have so far is a
preview build right wonderful open wanna
meet is now to the show was andrew
pokemon pre yeah but it's coming out i
mean like it's going gold it's shipping
this month so soundly I was going over
torson you know in the next 2-3 weeks
right but but also think that you know
being able to flip the UI into the
landscape mode is such a minor thing
Google could just do android 4.1 point
one when the first 4.1 10-inch tablets
come out it's a weird lady but no I
agree but but there are open UI
questions about how that will work oh
yes look you know yeah no that's
absolutely true chad is saying that
there will definitely be a different you
is tennis shoe eyes just save you I know
there's a different UI use the old you i
use the original ice creams how much I
to come you I so that might be what the
whole story is here okay and is this
some specific konami code combination
that using isa punching to get the
special stuff at you I what's going on
there I it's just a bigger tablet so use
it i mean III think that like google
just didn't want to talk
about it at all with this thing because
they're they're positioning against
kindle fire and they want to keep it
really simple right so they didn't get
cast all the differences speaking of the
fire that's a very good question like
what is gonna happen I mean I've so many
questions about amazon right now amazon
is a source of continued fascination for
me and because i know i talk about the
amazon the mythical amazon phone on
every podcast but uh what is amazon's
next move are they going to fork
four-point-oh or 4.1 again or are they
permanently forked off of what what did
they pull three point 0 or two I I don't
know what the fire is running this 2.3
or 3.0 or 3.1 or one point x 32 points
are they going to know yeah but you're
free definite are they currently forked
or are they gonna take another cut you
know who know and what is the next fire
gonna look like are they gonna do a
seven and a 10 is it going to be there
are rumors going around that it's going
to a much higher end looking and feeling
device than the current fire which I
would I would believe because the nexus
7 looks and feels nicer than than the
existing fire which is basically just a
repurposed playbook without a camera but
yeah lots of questions for amazon right
now how they respond to this but in the
meantime what they immediately need to
do in fact i'm blown away they haven't
done this already is drop the existing
fire to 179 I mean why they have they do
and I don't do it because there's no way
that that they would not be able to
break even if not still turn a profit at
this point in the fires lifecycle if
they dropped it to 179 there's no way
and there's I would not not recommend a
fired anybody except for people who are
desperate for amazon video or i guess
buying stuff on amazon because the
amazon app doesn't work on the nexus 7
isn't that what was that the amazon
shopping app though it's not compatible
that when i try and load it up in google
play it says it doesn't work in my
device oh well they're gonna have to fix
that amazon see here's the thing about
both google and amazon is that they both
and and they've they've exhibited this
in the past few weeks it that they both
seem to be pretty genuine about the fact
that they just want to extend their
ecosystems and as far and wide as
possible whether it's their own hardware
somebody else's hardware google is being
very good about
doing the support iOS that was one of
the announcements that came out of i/o
is that now Google Drive is on iOS and
all this this other stuff and and and of
course amazon is very good about pushing
kindle far far and wide as well and
amazon music and cloud player so i
receive me uh amazon cloud storage and
cloud player so hopefully they all
continue to do that regardless of what
device you're using on that point Chris
on that point I do feel like there's
only one way that we can wrap up our
discussion about android 4.1 at least
for the moment and that is by having an
epic whinge about the complete silence
from every Android OEM without exception
all about when current devices are being
upgraded 4.1 that has been zero before
you know that all just like
justification reflect notifications are
awesome in you know you can't you can't
act on everything I wish you get
archived email but being able to drag
down your email and see your five most
recent messages is totally amazing and I
don't know why they didn't do it sooner
it just it's prettier they improve the
font you know the new notifications is
really great and I would show to get you
but at all events might wanna the one
that no it hasn't it on right now what I
think but but when the God said one
thing that Josh pointed out in his nexus
7 review the concern me a bit is the
fact that you can't theater correct me
if I'm wrong you can't collapse or
expand all notifications with a single
toggle right right yeah and I think it's
sort of auto expands like pictures and
whatnot okay so I mean Vlad's right we'd
have a winch what's okay explain whinge
to me is it like wine or is it a
different word yeah it's exactly like
wine I I am actually not really sure why
doe two words but that um what you're
using and applying lead work thank you
thank you for calling me out for using
word blind edita I don't know what you
gather to shame in that at all Oh what
the heck are you guys talking about well
I'm gonna talk about mobile again but
this is one other thing which is
Google's io 2012 they to kido was
essentially the iOS
vaio cuz it was bonkers and voted with
things for iphone and ipad here's how
our software works on the ipad here's
how it works in the iphone it was like
hey Apple wanna be friends and one of
the things that came out of that was
that the chrome for iOS iphone and ipad
was available on the day now the first
thing to say about that and everybody
has noted it is it's not the proper
Chrome browser it's kind of chrome ish
because apple doesn't allow you to
install your browser and have the full
JavaScript engine all of those things
but it does sync with your chrome
bookmarks which to me is one of the
major attractions of chrome is having
the bookmarks length across every device
that I've got and and the annoying thing
is you need android 4.1 i believe yeah i
think so four point four point oh oh
four point oh right um okay what in any
case most devices don't have access to
the full chrome browser which left beta
during i/o amongst android devices don't
have access to the phone chrome browser
and our apple has like over ninety
percent of iOS devices have access to
some version of that browser it's really
kind of you know what what Google
doesn't have access to though is decent
whatever the heck the stupid things are
called that point a camera at a screen
the the pictures from the live blog I
mean I apologize they were terrible of
of chrome running on the iPad and iPhone
but that was because like they like
pumped in red fog and red lights on the
devices to like you you literally like
sitting there in the room you couldn't
see what they were doing think it was it
was it was like they were in hell and I
don't know it was very good pumping in
red fog is a sure surefire way to make
any presentation go a little smoother
flat but I want to go back to something
you said earlier which is that Google is
like Oh Apple we want to be friends
that's not it at all they would they
want to be they want to be friends with
Apple user
did not with Apple is this a big
difference well yeah absolutely but yeah
I mean look I I know the Google's Play
is very specifically to get its own
wares on to ok I'd like you're saying
Chris every single platform possible and
iOS is the one platform you conning law
doesn't matter how much you hate Apple
how much you want to compete with Apple
you have to be on that perform yeah but
then you know the same time Google's
best way to achieve that is to be
amenable to apples demands and to be
friendly to babble so did I mean it's
good things about what I'm saying let's
be friends a guy I don't really think
Google has as its n go some sort of who
unites with apple and you know knock out
the competition or whatever like that's
obviously not the case it's just if you
want to be on Apple's platform you have
to play nice with apple with us that's
been known that's the thing that's been
the true for years now decades me I'll
bet you that Apple had received me
google has an amazing native chromium
build for iOS that they can't submit to
the App Store I'll bet you they have it
kicking around at the Googleplex this
amazing like totally native chromium
build I I guarantee it they just you
ain't gonna be like flash by Google
constantly mon and just kind of be
passive aggressive about it and just
talk you know we would love to give you
guys a native chrome experience but it's
just love to laugh why doesn't Apple
open up well Gary smit Eric Schmidt
certainly would I don't know about
Sergei brand who turns out to be like
this crazy superhero like chill
superhero guy who wears muscle shirts
and and commands people to jump out of
planes we show sergey brin doubt he's
you know a triple billionaire whatever
now he's only going life is to be the
utmost bad ass for the rest of these
days yeah and and haven her power what's
his name else about an island right yeah
yeah yeahs unbuttoned but but all this
in sun city
if if I had to choose between buying an
island and dropping a bunch of dudes
wearing his up glasses that that I i
fundit i essentially funded on to
moscone center in san francisco i think
i would take the ladder personally ya
know Chris not absolutely not the island
is the way to go what you want it is is
a recipe you want to buy the island make
sure you can grow watermelons on it and
then set up a nice what's run a farm on
it and then it is you know spend the
rest of your days on a rocking chair on
the porch looking at sea the ocean just
lapping the waves against the beach
eating woodsman so now we know how the
latter is better kid is like he's pretty
amazing you you give me get another
layer you can get a nice satellite
internet connection as well I'm not
saying you know be a hermit I'm just
saying you know guys jumping out of an
airplane is a few minutes who are
excited with maybe hours if you can
stretch it out but and I will do you
could do edited on an island how much
watermelon could you reasonably eat
though I mean like what are you gonna do
with all these watermelons can you d I
mean are you just always thank you face
yourself and I don't know i don't like
this plan i see what larry ellison is
really gonna do is he's going to turn
that island into like a private most
dangerous game uh / hunger game / you
know that that that formula has been
done 15 times now throughout history who
taught telling you're under ball better
rio sunday well guys he's building an
underwater lair and yeah we're gonna
have to send james bond in to take him
out that's way just guys one thing i
want to point out though is we love to
talk about we as in all of society the
whole world love to talk about the power
of states and the dangers of
authoritarian regimes and all that stuff
but then we're kind of forgetting how
these ultra rich companies and let's not
forget google has cash reserves that are
better than most european countries okay
i'm just making it up but probably
because because your favorite bizarre
death apple has
more money than probably anybody in the
world the guys who are on some of these
companies have power that is probably
comparable to that of many states and
you know just look at the examples we're
giving like one CEO or former Co Co Co
sergey brin is sending guys out of
planes jumping and recording video and
other guys buying an island is a later
Oracle now has territories girl it's
absolutely true and it's not it's not a
very big leap of logic suggests that
that Elson's going to use Oracle's vast
technology to take over a satellite like
Goldeneye and you know it meets a car
the one you want you freaking area of
satellites he could I think the critic
Ellison is more of a Moonraker kind of
guy I think that's more his style so
like a space base of some sort yeah I
like it perfect the secret space space
that nobody knew about somehow dockside
am I don't mean yeah yeah you might
already have it who knows anyway we next
we complained about Nexus Q and then we
need to talk about the fact that Android
4.1 was announced the same week that
Android 4.2 spare Lee managed to crack
ten percent against 10.9 all told and
I'm sure a huge chunk of that you know
when it went from like seven to just
over ten was from sales of the the
galaxy s3 and you know last year at
Google i/o there was this alliance of
all these partners and they were they
promised that devices would get updates
within 18 months assuming the hardware
could support it and they're going to
find a way to make things happen more
quickly and I mean what happened there
nobody knows so now the new initiative
is the platform development kit and the
idea is a few months two to three months
before they actually launched the next
version of android they're going to give
hardware partners access to it so they
can port their hardware
or port android on to their hardware
which okay maybe that'll work out better
than we got now but it takes more than a
couple of months for these devices to
these companies to ship the latest
version of Android on existing devices
it always does and then on top of that
you know we reached out to a all the
major android oems and the most
forthcoming statement we got from out of
anybody was from samsung who is already
high on their horse because they're you
know releasing android 4.1 devices they
also said that they will soon announce
which additional devices are eligible
HTC's had watched the space and
everybody else said man we're looking
you don't know like yeah that's terrible
like that is like that is google like if
you thought that Google could like I
don't know control the Android ecosystem
or you know corral these manufacturers
into you know bending to their will and
cooperating with them instead of just
taking a droid you know when Google
gives it away for free and you know
using it for their own means then like
that illusion is gone like they're the
Android ecosystem is all these
manufacturers going after their own
thing and Google going after its own
thing and the thing that ties them
together is that you know Google happens
to give away Android that these guys
have to put other phones eventually but
you know in totally different ecosystems
like do you think Samsung is gonna put
google now on the galaxy s3 and jettison
s voice uh that's a very good question I
hadn't thought about that I don't have a
prepared answer I I I think she's gone
5050 Brian s voice is really terrible
but that does mean come on by day wait
when has that stopped samsung from doing
anything at the other day I don't want
to see is Samsung do s now because then
it's gonna be samsung snow yeah yeah
little bit oh because it would be
samsung snow and and then instead of
asking you know Google to tell you
something or Syria to something tell you
something you'd ask Informer to tell you
something
I di you lost me I know some reference
here I I'm just not getting it yeah now
what what if i said a licky boom boom
down would that help no no I have no I
have absolutely no idea what you're
talking about okay move on just let it
go I was like yeah some some listeners
yeah chatters totally got him and Brian
it's in the room he's got it the
canadian rapper informer come on
nineteen nineties hip-hop man he loves
me sing it for you i'm not gonna sing it
for you I was too busy alyssum
Evangeline in the 90s I'm i I don't I
don't know any Canadian rappers from the
nineties but I'm sorry that I took us
down that path please yeah I am
perplexed I they were thoughts in my
mind and now there's nothing uh well so
look I you know I want to say one thing
and you know I'm not gonna say that the
berry ended the show because I know we
always end the shown a depressing know
and I want to get the depression out now
which is that I feel like the tenuous
alliance that is holding Android
together I mean charlie kindel has
written extensively about this night
that I when he when he first started I
thought that he was kind of crazy and
now I realize that he's dead on is that
Google love me he's crazy like locks
exactly it who lost control of Android a
long time ago and they can say and do
whatever they want and that's great 4.1
is a beautiful dream and Google can can
make as many devices as they want to
make running 4.1 but I think that that
om Charlie feeling empowered by the
success that amazon has had and they are
probably feeling like they can offer
enough value add on top of any version
of Android if they're choosing to
completely ignore or mostly ignore new
versions of the platform offer by Google
and instead fork off and do whatever
they want to do with a previous version
and just add crap we're on top of it and
and that's that's an extremely
depressing vision but I think it's
probably an accurate one yeah okay yeah
I am depressed
okay okay sorry oh how I can make us
happy again let's talk about the nexus q
yes the shot put let's do it oh my god
it is terrible is that the word I'm
looking for it's it's interesting and
you don't think of it as an appletv
competitor think of it as like a sonos
competitor because it's got an amp and
you know they're they're sort of looking
at high-end audio with it and the way it
works if you're not familiar is it looks
like you're streaming music from your
phone but you're not you are using the
music app on your phone that we would
normally play music from to tell the
Nexus Q to stream music directly from
google play over Wi-Fi over the internet
unless there's more anything that's kind
of my first thing that the Nexus Q is
not a speaker right all right that it
has amassed amp but it's not a speaker
right is it you can't put out sound it
just needs to plug into something else
right you can if there's banana plugs
for two speakers or you can plug you
know optical audio out or HDMI out to
get the sound output I can tell you that
is the most befuddling thing about this
device which is befuddling in its
entirety and its entire spherical
existence but it's like everybody who
looks at it and here's that it's about
sound and music and streaming all of
that stuff and sees its shape because
our social circle it looks like it
should be a speaker so everybody would
expect at least some sound to come out
of it and particularly with the price
which you know come round to but it's
just kind of nuts to me that yeah i
don't know i know i mean just carry him
because he i'm more more irish watchlist
they were very close to making a sony
rowley when you think about it uh yeah I
mean Leia it reminds you of that yeah
because it has the colored ring that
flashes in in sync with the music right
all they need to do is put a little
motor on it to make it roll around and
add a speaker and they would have had
the next generation Rollie the thing
weighs like two pounds like that would
it would it would shatter flow
or is it were too okay it's like it's
like it's like classic American muscle
cars right like it's made in the USA
it's got its got it exudes an American
like heaviness right they have to make
it a two pound device absolutely until
then I just I don't think google intends
to have this be a commercial success I
don't think they ever did it's an
interesting project there's going to be
some people that really get into it it's
got the micro USB port so you can hack
on it there's already games running on
it and you know some people will you
know have have some fun with it and
they're just sort of seeing what it's
like to be in this market in a small way
and maybe they'll you know with the next
version they'll do something more
ambitious and more serious for the
consumer market I think for now you know
it's just in a weird space like what's
its relationship to Google TV well it's
a totally different thing what you know
what is it for I think it's for people
to just like I've got this cool thing
and it's kind of nerdy and fun like
that's that's what it's for I I think
they're very good idea I think that
really what it was was it was way for
Google to UM to experiment with the
concept of making advice in the US
without uh without making something that
was yeah well yeah with without having
it be something that was really critical
to google strategy because the cute
isn't critical to any part of google
strategy right it's just this thing that
you like you're saying you know if it
succeeds great if it doesn't that's fine
too it's not a phone it's not a tablet
it's not something that's really core
visit to the success of android going
forward and I think that Google probably
would be the first to admit that they
have kinks to work out in their US
manufacturing strategy if they're going
to actually make that work but he's
another question doesn't you have any
boots in storage it's got a terse brat
pouch source is a key lab look at how
much towards if you have a cysteine 16
gigs built in but you can't like
transfer stuff to it it's just there for
caching video yeah i mean that that was
my impression that you can't stick your
music on it which is just annoying
because google learned his lesson to
some degree with chroma
in making google docs this past week
available offline and offline editing
and making making you know the whole
experience of using its devices offline
at least tolerable right because most
Google services are so online centric
you have to be online you have to have a
web connection in order to make full use
of them and I was kind of taking a step
back with the queue and saying well if
you wanna play music with this thing you
need to have a web connection always
constantly even if you are you know I
mean look a great example is I might
wanna okay I'm oh I wouldn't want to
take the key because it's good deeds
just said it's heavy but I want to take
a device like this uh when I'm traveling
right and just have my music on it for
would have no I don't know why why would
you carry i know i would very a
two-pound sphere with you when you
travel because I much opposed fear with
a glowing light at a rotating top that
looks a lot like a bomb looks a lot like
a bomb like like like if you just put a
fuse on the back of it out of one of the
little ports on the back like it bets
that's some wile e coyote action right
there ok ok I I won't carry on with a
hypothetical because it really is just
way too it's out there but this is more
serious point to make it which is at
last year's i/o google made big point
about a droid at home and this year's
i/o there was no android at home they
were just I mean the queue is kind of
linking into that but there is none of
that I mean there's a whole SDK for
Android at home which is seems to be
like 25 people used and abandoned within
a month it's been a year note about
nothing nothing to be happening and if I
can offer kind of again kind of a far
reaching an allergy I'm getting the
feeling with Google's Android at home
and home automation and home flirtations
anyway with home devices that GU has the
idea that there's a market there that
maybe can be developed and grown and
exploits it but isn't
doing it properly and it's kind of doing
to use another able to haul hobby
devices particularly with the cute like
chris says already a serious device a
serious competitor to anything really
and lethargy analogy was like they're
they're being obstinate about it like it
basically got the guts I believe of a
Galaxy Nexus inside in terms of its
processor and yeah we would just mention
the RAM and everything so like it's
running android 4.0 they're just like
deliberately like Norfolk it basically
so that it'll only work with Google Play
to see if they can you know make this
ecosystem play with google play and then
also you don't let people hack on it
just to sort of you know no appease
people that like to hack on strange
android spheres but like they could have
I feel like done more like I don't this
this wasn't an issue of late round at a
time to give it a you why because it
doesn't have a hue it's only got the app
on your phone it's that they're
deliberately choosing not to they're
deliberately saying we're gonna make
this thing that's weird we want to make
a weird little thing and let's see what
that right puts the in energy that comes
to mind with me is Microsoft and its
tablet strategy around the turn of the
century right because since 2000 2001
Bill Gates is saying you know tablets
are gonna be really really awesome
they're gonna be great they're gonna do
a whole heap of things for you and
Microsoft has been doing tablets and we
can throw in tow into that as well with
the mid-17th of the mobile internet
device they just done better and well so
what what I'm kind of getting the
feeling I'm getting is that guys like
Google or go to screw around and im
gonna be like well we'll try this will
try this other experimental device and
while they're doing that they are
actually providing data points and some
sort of reference points for guys again
I'm going back to Apple I don't know why
I sound like an apple fanboy this week
but whatever I for guys who are more
serious and focused about really
exploiting the space and really having a
mass-market device and ultimately
somebody's going to come up with
something that reads
too many problems with people and then
becomes indispensable and that somebody
isn't going to be Google because it's so
scattershot approach and we just does
the feeding that I'm getting right now I
like you get hey I you know one of
Google's strengths and this has been a
strength of theirs for many many years
is that they have the money and the in
the the brain trust to uh you know
basically put on a blindfold and and
fire a bunch of shots into the air and
hope that something hits uh and and you
know it that good that goes back to you
know their their corporate culture of 80
20 and and you know it's very
fundamental to their philosophy as a
company that they try all these crazy
things and hopefully something works and
and I i think that the queue fits right
into that you know in and that that fits
in with what you were saying what about
it being a hobby for them just like that
bowl TV was for Apple and I and and I I
i think the apple TV is not a hobby
hobby anymore I think that it's turned
into a viable platform for them and will
continue to evolve as such the Q I don't
know maybe it won't maybe there will be
no q2 but but maybe something will come
of it maybe they'll they'll figure it
out for next year's i/o i don't i don't
know but but i don't think that google
is sweating over this being a success or
a failure i think that the worst case
scenario for them is that they don't
sell any of these and for the price they
probably won't sell many but they've
they figured out a way that you know
they work through a lot of the logistics
of making a device like this in the US
and they've you know they've come away
with that with that knowledge you know
they fish net we can't we can't overlook
the fact that this is a google device
this is not another company making this
device on google's behalf and then
google slaps their name on it google
made this device with the queue they are
a hardware manufacturer right but but
what I'm saying is that then not like
this is saying they could do more they
could go one step beyond just will build
and it would be crazy and nuts and
whatever they could build something that
actually it gives them a foothold in the
market because as far as I'm concerned
Network speakers and speakers that you
can just you know seamlessly and that's
does a key thing seamlessly get your
music off your phone and playing on to
them whatever it be via airplay whether
it be by something like Sonos and Wi-Fi
and whatever else they can be just a
massive market if somebody nails the
price and nails the execution you know
it's there it's just waiting for
somebody to do it right sonos is too
expensive um it that market basically
just needs his own kind of fire as far
as I'm concerned head place to expense
it as well Aaron won the cutesy it could
be in bad device but there's nothing
standing in his way I don't think it's
that air plays is too expensive is
because that there's a huge airplay
ecosystem now that the problem is that
airplay is proprietary to iOS into apple
and android does not have a viable
equivalent to airplay right now and it
it's so frustrating to me whenever I go
to you know to somebody's house and they
have an airplay device and I just I want
to say hey listen to this track whatever
and I can't it android desperately needs
something that is that simple it's it's
it's weird to think you know because
we've had HTTP for so many years now
it's in it's weird to think that little
leap from HTTP to seamless Wi-Fi audio
and video would be such a big deal but
it really is airplay has revolutionized
that entire workflow of playing media
and I would love to see something to do
something that's simple and easy on
Android and you certainly isn't the
answer to that you know because people
are going cues I just want to point out
that if if Google does try and make a go
of this at actually making another
version of the queue there's going to be
rumors about it and we're gonna have to
write about having received a q-tip I
can't believe you just said that it's
really really upsetting to me I yeah I
think we because that that that refers
to old school rap we got is a really
good one I I just want my life slap you
got
sorry first this Canadian rappers now is
q-tips I I just don't know see I warned
people in the podcast post that dieter
may not be lucid and I think that that I
went I went home to take a nap and
literally five minutes after i laid down
there's banging at my front door and a
bunch of workers showed up to install
the baseboards after my apartment
flooded it was a two weeks ago I don't
even remember it may have been year ago
it doesn't whatever and so like I
couldn't sleep I didn't I I had time to
take a nap and I wasn't unable to do it
because they were selling baseboards and
they knew that I was in a hurry to get
them out of there so they were rushing
and they basically spent the whole time
telling each other to do unmeasurable
things to their mothers which was pretty
awesome I got two brushes planet vanish
yeah you uh you should have offered them
a few for further work it would have
thrown it at me I know that's a
dangerous thing to get chucked at you I
mean yeah obviously agents I'm so tired
of talking about the cube can we please
talk about something else yeah we can
say is we can't have a Google exclusive
podcast can we talk about anybody else
okay talk about rim about anybody
before room I'm saying room for our
depressing closer oh alright fair enough
uh well t-mobile CEO resigned oh that's
depressing to um well it's not entirely
depressing it is it is happy news for
him that he's going to work for Vodafone
which is um in Germany which is a
carrier with much brighter prospects
than t-mobile USA right now so so at
least for him it's it's a it's a it's a
happy event Wow so yeah they still have
an interim CEO t-mobile USA they haven't
they haven't announced a permanent CEO
yet okay no we got to talk about
blackberry so blackberry 10 devices
delayed to 2013 rim cutting 5,000 jobs
and take they took a 518 million dollar
loss their sales
quarter have plummeted they're not
selling the phones anymore well I mean
they're still selling phones but the
radically fewer which is a bad sign that
they're you know what they had been
hanging on to which was international is
probably starting to get really really
soft on them so that's all the terrible
news the good news is the grand
tradition of rim executives saying
boneheaded things in public continues
with tor tonight's yeah it's yeah yeah
so there are two good things that the
tourists and Heinz has said which are
very encouraging first of all he said
that he's uh he's not satisfied with the
results so that's good news right if he
had said well I'm delighted with with
this horrible quarter then then then he
probably won't be the right CEO for the
company but then too he has come out
today with an opinion piece in The Globe
and Mail the Canadian newspaper saying
that rim is not in fact in a death
spiral so so that in a in a radio
interview like the the company is not
ignoring the world out there nor is it
in a death spiral like man don't let
people put the word death spiral in
quotes when in an article about you
death I don't care if you're saying no
like you you do not bring that up that's
just not smart you say we're doing we're
not failing we're not know going down
we're not something something but I
agreed with him I don't think it's a
spiral to I mean it's a straight line
right it's it's good this way oh hey
mess the way yeah the problem for rim is
that uh you know maybe a year or two ago
there were potential paths and options
that they could have maybe pursued to
turn the company around but at this
point there is no right answer right so
people will say I can't believe I can't
believe tourists in hinds is delaying
blackberry 10 to q1 2013 will guess what
if they had shipped a half baked product
this year that would have been their
death knell but are they going to
survive long enough ship in q1 a group
I don't know maybe not okay I'm just no
longer a right answer I'm going to
retweet somebody live on the show and be
completely irresponsible in not
crediting that person I saw this you
know in the in the immediate wake of
rooms announcement of his quality
results and it was the best the best
reaction so whoever it was first very
little guy and credit to them that
person said that room has delayed first
BlackBerry 10 devices until after it
stops doing business until three shuts
down and goes the bus which was just the
perfect way to summarize like it's so
difficult for me to express and at the
same time comprehend just the sheer
stupidity of leaving the smartphone
market the I mean yeah lil leaving the
smartphone market as far as I'm
concerned rim doesn't have anything
that's competitive with legitimate smart
phones anymore and it's not going to
until at least the first quarter of 2013
it was late with quota-free 2012 that
was late that was the previous roadmap
and nothing was happening now they've
moved it a whole six months back I don't
care how amazing the software is oh it's
going to be even if it actually beats
every single piece of software that's uh
you know leading the market today so
even if it be's iOS 6 even if Utley if
it beats I don't know android 5.0 is
probably going to be out by then that
doesn't matter it doesn't have an app
ecosystem because people gonna have to
start building apps all over again and
even if it's ahead of everything else
someone's going to come again there's
going to be Google i/o 2013 is going to
be iOS 7 yeah you just can't compete
yeah and you know I've been Minds if is
a surprise now I'm to--some right now I
would say exactly what he's saying
there's nothing wrong with a company and
you spend every
single second tried to sell the freaking
company to somebody at some place what's
happened is I know what you're about to
say and it's not true it's very clear
that hindsight is not 2020 here that is
okay Peter that is strike three you may
now leave the show walk away have right
at your place go go lay your head down
you've earned it no um I yeah I there I
think that what's happening behind the
scenes we've known for a few weeks now
we we've written a story about it and
you mentioned again on this earnings
call they have retained to banks to
quote-unquote investigate their options
and those banks are in my opinion
obviously going to recommend that rim
liquidate some are all of its assets and
that that recommendation is probably
going to come long before blackberry 10
ships so the question is does this
blackberry in the long term does rim
become an IP holding company does it
become does he become this generations
palm source I don't know but but yeah
it's looking very grand and you know the
thing is Heinz has said in the past to
quarterly earnings calls including this
most recent one that they want to
concentrate on the enterprise and BYOD
markets the problem with that which he
fails to acknowledge is that BYOD
implies that anyone wants to bring your
device nobody wants to bring nobody is
going out to their their carrier right
now and saying give me your latest
hottest blackberry and then bringing it
into their office and going to their IT
department saying this is the phone that
I want to use for my for my corporate
email nobody is doing that the BYOD
makes no sense for them it makes sense
for for Apple makes sense for Google
doesn't make sense for REM that leaves
them only with enterprise and that
market is being eaten quarter by quarter
by quarter by Apple and by by Google
Williams and and just just another thing
that really really needs mentioning it
brim has been failing to execute for so
long so many years but forget what Tulsa
and Mike
Reedus before him and said yeah torsten
everything is fine Mike everything is
unfair just forget what they've said
remember the blackberry 7 wasn't
supposed to be blackberry 7 it was
originally supposed to be blackberry 6.5
but it took so freaking long to make em
room was so convinced is such a massive
upgrade it just decided it would jump in
a whole one version up remember that
yeah where am I crazy no I I remember
spec it was supposed to be bad bruising
point 5012 blackberry stand and we're
looking at freaking and any of
blackberry 7 with behind the times as
soon as it came out we're looking at
version inflation you know from
BlackBerry's it was i was actually 6.1
not 6.5 I I mentioned this a reform I've
mentioned this before if you look at
everything from blackberry OS 4.7 to 7.1
you can barely notice the difference
okay that is so Vlad I think the
terminology used version inflation is an
excellent description of what's
happening here well the browser is you
know you usable slightly more usable
yeah torch browser very good point I you
know I will say this um I would like for
me and you know i would i would
selfishly like to see another company
try and do something new with like user
interface design on a smartphone because
i think that's interesting and I think
that blackberry 10 is an interesting mix
of a whole lot of concepts and I would
love to see if rim could actually pull
it off in a usable device that feels
compelling whether or not it succeeds
just like just because I'm you know
greedy i would like to play around with
that and to like if i were also being
selfish like the scenario i'd be you
know that seems most likely to me and
then I would be really happy with is if
a year from now we're talking about
installing blackberry messenger on
Android and iOS and Windows Phone
devices and this mess and then I
messages is you know obviated nobody
uses it anymore and we have a full
secure instant crowd
platform messaging solution that is as
robust and compelling as blackberry
messenger used to be for BlackBerry
users like that you need a nap you need
a nap so badly dieter I can't even tell
you that is the most absurd vision I've
heard in this entire show bbm is is I am
I've never understood BBM okay I don't
understand the novelty in giving a
hexadecimal code to a front of yours so
that you can add new pattern now in what
version 7 I when did this happen I can't
remember what version of blackberry
messenger they they move down to the
hexadecimals I think are still
technically they're under the hood in
some cases it's it's a big mess but
we'll have to have Kevin Mitchell come
on and explain it all to us but what I'm
saying is like SMS is expensive and
stupid and not everybody's using google
talk nobody I mean what whatsapp group
me I message lab just give me a
cross-platform messaging solution that I
don't have to pay 25 cents a pop to to
the carrier right you know well I cared
us I mean waiting for that carriers are
very very cognizant at the fact that
that business model is going away and
I'm sure that they're going to be
fighting very hard over the course of
the next 18 months to two years to try
and keep that source of revenue because
it at this point 18teen verizon have
forced virtually all of their smartphone
customers on to these twenty dollar
unlimited messaging plans which it is
just absurd to think about the fact that
you are paying twenty dollars a month
for something that costs the carriers as
close to zero dollars and zero cents per
message as a met as you can possibly
imagine i I'd love to see like an
independent audit break down exactly how
much one SMS costs AT&amp;amp;T but it must be
in the thousands or ten tens of
thousands of a cent tens of thousands
I'm sure if not even less uh because I
mean keep in mind SMS is origin is
literally it they they fit the reason is
a hundred sixty characters is because
they fit it into some sort of header
message in in the GSM uh you know uh
scheme say it's like it's it it it began
life as a shoe
learned a protocol that wouldn't cost
anybody anything to begin with and now
we're 20 years on and we're getting
charged twenty dollars a month for these
things it is completely asinine so I
very with its progress I totally agree
that something needs to replace that and
it's unfortunate that what what's ended
it what's ending up happening is we're
developing these um incompatible fiefdom
most notice most notably I message which
is ios-only so if we get to the point
where there's no viable SMS replacement
that will make me a very sad individual
indeed we're at that point right now I
still use SMS daily well you know yeah I
know but I mean there's no viable
replacement is what I'm saying and
that's completely frustrating to me yeah
no I agree I I message leaving the
Tigers were cross but I want to bring us
back to room actually just for a quick
quick second um what I was actually
thinking I mean yeah I'm a detour on
this I feel like a room could figure out
a licensing agreement and just spread
BBM out and I figure out again licensing
agreements with other companies for its
enterprise services and all of those
things that was Jimbo series whole idea
that he wanted to promote and push
months and months ago tail end of the
last year and it's the thing that made
but it's because he was turned down in
that push that he decided to step down
as co-ceo but you know that ship that
whatever his sailed by now but what I
also have been thinking about eunuchs
which is the underpinning of blackberry
10 is what evers fault it is it's taking
rim an inordinately long time to code
anything with it or on top of it Oh
however you ought to put it I mean the
play book came out with the kionics
based OS and it didn't have an email
client didn't have really really really
basic functionality I don't think I her
calendar okay that was one of the
emissions right in
mr. kennedy is is that basically limited
and hamstrung so and and now again we're
taking six months I can tell you for
with an absolute guarantee the thing
that's taken six months is not hardware
right rim in six months time like if you
tell room from today design me a brand
new smartphone it needs to be super
high-end you have six months it will be
a massive push but room has the
resources capabilities the designers to
make that happen so delaying things but
I asked you think so as the things are
don't rush it but they can do um just
let me be you know bullish on room per
second right for a little bit we can be
punishment but then now we're talking
room is giving itself some ten months to
finish off just a software like the
software is the thing holding this thing
back and that's that's a problem like if
you can't code on that software fast
enough to compete with anybody else ever
again even if you get the best case
scenario and cubix comes out blows us
all the way in the first quarter of 2013
what does that mean for the future after
that if you're still coding and evolving
your West slower than everybody else
yeah there there is no gate yeah I
struck the perfect tone we can just cut
it done completely by all that we're all
depressed again there's no Road podcast
there's there's no road to success for
rim apart from breaking up reselling the
company I'm absolutely convinced of it
and and and i think that taurus nines is
convinced that too and i think that's
why these two banks are in there and he
knows damn well that he can't say
anything about that until that process
is complete so about any antitrust
issues um i think anybody because rim
doesn't add any value to anyone but i i
i i just realized something i just had a
moment of brilliance that i wanted to
share with you III think that that Heinz
actually
I'm sure this probably already already
been said in somebody's editorial but
I'm gonna steal it and use it as my own
I actually don't think that Heinz has
any intention of shipping blackberry 10
ever I think the problem is that with
the original ship date they get bumped
up it bumped up against a potential
decision from the banks or you know a
target sale date and he didn't want to
get those those two dates mixed up so he
pushed blackberry 10 cut out comfortably
far enough so that wouldn't be an issue
for the banks coming back and trying to
sell the company so the grad has been I
a lot of weeds in money whipping up
developers right now like the idea that
they're they're still like it it might
be completely insane but so far as I can
still tell they're still pushing to get
this thing out the door but I mean what
chris says though is a very logical
scenario like if you want to actually
just give yourself room to complete a
sale gather stuff sorted out without any
interruptions this is exactly what you
would do you would kick the blackberry
10 release date so far into the future
as to be essentially irrelevant right
and they can't say that they're not
working on it anymore because that would
that would tip their hand so they need
to say oh yeah we're working on it it's
gonna come in 2013 and then that gives
them all the time they need to to do
their due diligence on a sale or
whatever they're gonna do with the
company yeah so so the guy that I'm
saying that I'm library tweeting him he
was joking but he could she turned out
to be absolutely right yep that's pretty
crazy but yeah I mean if anybody decides
to take over rim um i think i think you
you're the one who made up when Chris
room being an IP holding company they
would do it for the pace it's wouldn't
they exactly as Google deal with
Motorola thank you jump over the company
and just focus on grabbing hold of all
those wireless patents and then keyboard
patents which are codes met so much
anymore oh man such a sad story well the
blackberry 10 keyboard looks like I mean
like I can't to see what they're trying
to do with it but it looks like a mess
like I don't want these words popping up
all over the keyboard which is how they
have it set up right now mmm I think we
know it I think it looks weird but
reaching I mean so okay the auto part
keyboard on jellybean is really great
it's a huge improvement over what there
was there before but you still have to
you know reach up to hit the thing and I
maybe you could set it on a space but I
don't think so but to just like when
you're typing quickly your thumb is
naturally gonna go to the first letter
of the next word that you want to put up
there it though that word is just
sitting there just flicking it up like
that I think seems really fast and cool
um like that impresses me I like that
fair enough so there are enough to bit
too bad you'll never gets used on an
actual device yeah well oh well um maybe
I'll crash a blackberry jam there on a
world tour you know they are there
actually we sent we sent Dante to the
blackberry jam in New York was it a week
or two ago and that's where we got our
hands on with the keyboard which is up
on the site want to check that out he's
got he's got a video posted some some
gallery shouts I believe so you can get
a sense of how that works in the real
world but uh yeah I mean it's so far
until we we get actual hardware assuming
we get actual hardware ever that is kind
of irrelevant right now and nobody I
mean like I'm kind of surprised i got'em
it as a gadget collector I'm little
shocked that there hasn't been a cottage
industry forming around the resale of
these Devils of devices no one has
offered me their dev alpha device for
princely sum and that that personally
upsets me you have a devil device
emailed it out there I'm sure they're
out there yeah I mean name your price so
i'll i'll give you a few bucks for it
let me know I give you five bucks sick
folks he had whatever yeah literally a
few bucks you'll be able to buy yourself
lunch with it um no I crazy Fiona's
eliquis is never gonna sell these
devices he's actually just going to keep
them in his collection no it's like this
is a commercial venture it's who that
reminds me I need to talk about
something amazing that happened
the other day so nokia uh reached out to
me and said hey Chris were about to
recycle a bunch of old devices do you
want them and I said yes oh yeah so they
and so they sent me they sent me a 3620
I think it's a 3620 I'm looking at them
over on the table I can't can't read the
model number but it it was the one you
know with the crazy circular keypad but
but the Americanized version that had
the the standard numeric keypad instead
and that's new in box never been used
and then I also have three communicators
of the e90 the 9000 which is the
original I believe in the 9300 which I
think came out around two thousand one
or two thousand to something like that
and i'm gonna try i have all the
chargers for them and try to get them
working and hopefully i'll be able to
show them off a little bit more but um
it is pretty much the most exciting
thing happening in my life right now are
these no kiss is it's pretty special
stuff so i'm done i just wanted to share
that dead anecdote thank you notes a
happy positive coat and we're gonna
we're going to end on that so thank you
very shaky they want me let me share a
few training though he took the trial
sir I broached answer to interrupt you
man come on and and I was way too
positive a note to a show on like whew
it's a combo breaker we can't we can't
end the show and I have been positive
note about unopened delicious old-school
devices like one of these knockers might
even have the original snake on it like
imagine that I would actually own one of
these ancient luck is just play snake on
amazing if a nokia wants to sell me a
5110 with the original snake on it I
promise I guarantee you I will break any
record you set on that Vice oc- is that
we were saying you're a snake original
snake snake to anything after it forget
about it but the original snake yes yeah
yeah I always did snake what is gonna
say though um to hopefully turn down the
tone I do hope people
about this I'm gonna be missing for the
next couple of weeks while I regrow my
head you mean your mustache oh yeah yeah
Oh make an effort to grow a mustache
watch me get back I want you to come
back with a ben popper style mustache
anything anything less than that will be
a failure on your abject failure on your
part foot I want to make that very clear
I don't really want to go and compete
with been popping he is he's rather
owning the mustache Virge editor
position right now I mean this does his
phone I don't want to compete with him
on that one yeah but in any case I'm
gonna be gone a couple weeks I shall be
in Bulgaria I expect Bruce superstars
the mobile industry to replace me um as
guests probably Rosa whenever you'll be
suitable he's super sounds too yeah us
good bra trusses good people's left it
worth every last one is the letter you
can get real data so I'll practice I'll
work Nick can't wait wait so this that's
not that depressing of a note I mean
like you're gonna go away you're gonna
get rested yeah yeah what's a better
area yeah so I mean I think that's
actually I think that's a very uh that's
a very bright note that's it that's good
that's a happy note should be unhappy
