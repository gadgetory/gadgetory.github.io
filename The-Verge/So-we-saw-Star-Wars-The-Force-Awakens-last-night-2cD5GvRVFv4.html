entertainment editor for The Verge and
I just saw Star Wars. Hey it's Ross just
saw Star Wars. Hey it's Casey Newton out in San Francisco. We are in Brooklyn at
the Brooklyn Academy of Music. We're a little dazed right now.
I just watch Star Wars: The Force Awake here in Waterloo Ontario Canada. Here at
the world premiere in Hollywood
California and... What did I think?
I felt a lot of things tonight a lot of childish wonderful exuberance and joy. Lots of nostalgia feelings, lots of Millennium
Falcon, lots of Han Solo.
The acting is great and that makes such a difference
so much more than effects, or anything like that
good performances where
you believe in the characters is all that you really need to sell the universe. I love
the new characters Rey was great, Ben
was great. Anytime they were on screen it was my favorite part.
The chemistry between the
the new trilogy of leads was
really good and I'm excited to see how
they play off each other as we roll into
Episode 8 and Episode 9. C-3PO still sucks.
Yeah C-3PO is in character.
More than anything else though it was the first time probably since 1983
and saw something that actually felt like Star
Wars. It just fell right and that was just
and that was just a wonderful wonderful relief. It really just felt like Star Wars.
In some respects like it was calling back to the original trilogy in beautiful ways.
It largely ignored the prequels, which is fine.
There is nothing about the governance of the
empire. It's just all about chases and
finding things and getting things and just
sort of very relatable human drama. I also don't remember
Star Wars being that funny
That was a plus.  I don't know what I was
expecting in terms of humor level of a
new Star Wars movie but it exceeded it. There's not a
negative messages in Star Wars and that's what this is
the biggest reminder of Star Wars is a
really optimistic and fun and
imaginative universe and this totally
is in keeping with that. So I'm like the rest of
all these people, I'm having a good time. Man, just, I can't get over it. I can't get over it.
Yeah, that's about it. That's all I can say. That's all I've got, I'm sorry.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
