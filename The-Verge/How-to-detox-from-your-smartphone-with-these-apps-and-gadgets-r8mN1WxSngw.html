chances are the answer is too much right
we all want to spend less time looking
at screens and more time having
real-life experiences see the problem is
hold on a second
this'll just take a second look the data
is pretty clear one in three people
around the world has trouble unplugging
even when they're aware that it's way
healthier to put the phone down I'm not
trying to nag you guys I have this
problem too and I'm guilty of staring at
my phone at like some of the worst
possible times like when I should be
playing with my kids or making sure
they're not burning my apartment down
but fortunately for us there's a lot of
things that we can do to change our our
phones look and perform in fact if you
want to make your smart phone just look
straight up ugly you can do that let's
start with the tools that are already on
your phone Apple's iOS 12 update
included a new feature called screen
time which gives you a wealth of data
about your iPhone and iPad usage
breaking down the amount of time that
you spend in each individual app on your
device there's also a Plymouth's which
lets you set a daily allotment of time
for a particular app or for an entire
category of apps like social media
productivity or entertainment once it
runs out iOS will gray out the icon and
have a full screen banner telling you
you've reached your time limit Android
phone users have a setting called
digital well being which is pretty
similar to screen time the main
difference between the two features is
you can basically press a button to
ignore it on iOS but on Android you have
to manually remove the limit which is
way more annoying an Android app called
CM Poe makes your phone boring with a
white background and bland icons and
there's a twist
CFO constantly rearranges your icon so
you can't form the muscle memory habit
of reflexively launching the apps you
can also turn on your phone's grayscale
function on Android and iOS everything
should turn dull and gray it's like that
movie Pleasantville but in Reverse you
might need to alter your behavior but
you don't want a quit cold-turkey
think of it more like going on a diet
you still need to eat but your goal
should be to cut back to more healthy
levels of use so how do we do that some
tips that I've seen outlined by various
experts in behavioral psychology include
setting goals for use
your smartphone and working up to that
turn your phone off during certain times
of the day don't bring your phone to bed
I'm working on that myself just ask my
wife hi honey
delete triggering apps like Facebook
Twitter and Instagram and accept the
fact that by limiting your smartphone
use you're going to miss out on certain
invitations breaking news or gossip take
a deep breath embrace the FOMO for more
extreme cases you can also get rid of
your smartphone altogether currently
there's a trend in minimalist phones
which are basically phones that do a lot
less there's a whole bunch of minimalist
phones out there that range from most
functionality to least devices like the
unit Hertz jelly are tiny smartphones
that are just harder to use while others
like the Lite phone just make phone
calls if all else fails there's always
drumroll please
digital detox camp these places have
been around for a while and honestly
they're pretty easy to hate on rich
privileged people heading out to the
woods where they learn to cope without
electronic devices inaccessible to most
of us but if you can afford it have fun
hey I get it
smartphones are great you can play candy
crush watched YouTube tutorials and the
real world is kind of a mess but when it
starts to interfere with your life it
may be time to reassess your
relationship to technology then
hopefully you can achieve that perfect
phone life
having real life experiences right but a
whole lot of cycles so let's take a
second walk in here
