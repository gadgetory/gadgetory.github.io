we're looking at the new MacBook Pro
with Retina display Apple is announcing
this as the new flagship macbook product
so there's a few big features here
listen it'll be the size and the ivy
bridge chipset but let's go ahead and
get right down to what you care about
the Retina display at twenty eight
eighty by eighteen hundred pixels it is
actually the most pixel dense screen of
any macbook that all breaks down to 220
pixel per inch density not quite the
same level as the new retina iPad but
pretty close so what you're really
getting is four times the pixel density
than your standard macbook pro and it
really breaks down to actually not being
able to see the pixels the text and
images and apple's apps actually look
really good especially safari for
example in TextEdit the text looks very
crisp iPhoto aperture you know High
Definition pictures you really do see
the difference especially we have a
full-screen DSLR photo and you're kind
of looking at the details obviously
apples gone ahead and optimized its
first party suite for that Retina
display that's something third-party
developers don't have to do also in the
meantime however third-party apps most
notably Chrome for example Firefox Opera
Kindle Nook all of them have text that
actually displays actually a little
pixelated it if you compare it to the
standard pro it actually looks a little
bit worse
and to be honest though we kind of think
this is more of a minor short-term
inconvenience in terms of form factor
the laptop is actually kind of a hybrid
lovechild between the standard MacBook
Pro and the MacBook Air it's not a wedge
machine but it does have a point seven
one inch thin chassis that's a good 37
percent smaller overall then the
standard macbook pro and at four point
four six pounds actually 25 percent
lighter to and inside that smaller form
factor we've actually got intel's third
generation core chipset the ivy bridge
this one in particular has a two point
six gigahertz core i7 processor and
Nvidia GT 650 M graphics chipset it's
quite a powerful gaming machine in Apple
itself showed off Diablo 3 we've
actually played Diablo 3 ourselves on
this maxed out the resolution 2088
hundred
of the settings the shadows special
effects the blood the guts the gore and
what we found out I was you can actually
get a consistent 20 frames per second
it's not great for the hardcore gaming
but really only later in the game of
that becoming
issue and if we lower the resolution you
get a very consistent 30 frames per
second regardless of the situation so no
it's not the most powerful gaming
machine but in terms of Apple's machines
it's actually one of the best we've seen
apples been touting its asymmetric fan
system saying it actually gets the
blacktop a lot cooler and a lot quieter
and while it's definitely much quieter
with more processor intensive acts
especially games video it is still hot
to the touch one of the ways Apple has
managed to keep the size down the
MacBook Pro with Retina display is why I
opted in to go with flash storage
entirely starts at 256 gigabytes goes
all the way to 768 it's much much faster
if you've ever used the MacBook Air you
know in the startup times the boot times
the times from sleeve hour
near-instantaneous is actually really
really impressive in practice as far as
ports goes Apple has actually made a few
radical changes especially for people
who've used MacBook Pros for a while
gone completely now is the firewire
which is something we kind of saw coming
also though the ethernet port actually
turns out to be a little too tall for
the frame that Apple wanted to make so
in their place we've got two Thunderbolt
ports and of course you can buy
Thunderbolt adapters if you need the
firewire in Ethernet we've also got two
USB 3.0 ports one on each side they also
work with USB 2.0 again they're much
faster perhaps one the nicest changes
here is the HDMI out before you had
actually used the mini DisplayPort
adapter plug into a monitor and then
also get like an audio cable this time
though you just do HDMI to HDMI I put it
in TV you get a 1080p signal really good
audio it's very impressive in the time
it actually takes to plug it in and
actually get working as measured in
seconds it's really nice and then
there's max safe to Apple it's done away
with the old Macs a fan dr. persona it's
a little flatter but of course none of
your old adapters are now going to work
with this and vice versa Apple does
offer a Mac safe 1 to 2 adapter text
about 10 bucks snaps right on
so people with a lot of power adapters
just consider yourself warned the new
MacBook Pro with Retina display starts
at 21 99 and with that you get in 2.3
gigahertz Intel Core i7 8 gigs of ram
and 256 gig flash storage that is 400
ollars more expensive than the base
price of the MacBook Pro but again the
trade-off is flash storage versus hard
disk drive retinas flavors otherwise
disc
versus otherwise so really it's more up
to you what you
you hear regardless of your feelings
toward Apple generally or even the new
MacBook Pro specifically it's more or
less a certainty that laptops all over
are about to make a strong push for high
resolution displays the more high
resolution screens in the market the
more websites and apps will be optimized
for it the new MacBook Pro Retina
Display really is kind of the
culmination of everything Apple has
learned in the MacBook field granted of
course it is the most expensive MacBook
Pro out there one of the most expensive
laptops out there but if budgets not an
issue this is the best laptop you can
buy right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
