Gregor the Verge's gadgets
show I am Nilay Patel
sadly Paul Miller is not here with us
today he's sick
send Paul your best wishes he's at
future Paul on Twitter but we have a
packed show for you we're gonna take
your calls at the end of the show and
gadget emotional support tech emotional
support that number is 184 for for
emotions to start thinking about where I
could fix your problems are just gonna
help your heart really in your soul
we're gonna play with a bunch of
levitating gadgets which I'll tell you
your personal completely ruined me so
that's gonna be exciting for everyone
except for me but to kick it off I'm
Garten burgers here mm-hmm Stefan Sen is
here he's interviewing a lot of gaming
laptops for us they're gonna talk us
through some of the coolest gaming
laptops in the market it's just Stefan I
think of gaming laptops is being big and
stupid and huge and crazy these are not
what's going on here where we go it's
part of a new revolution in gaming
laptops there are two things going on
one there's razor producing what we like
to call the windows MacBook Pro
equivalent a MacBook Pro in this color
I'd buy it
just straight up so what razor has here
is a GTX 1060 that's a pretty decent
graphics card you can play most games at
medium high settings on it any problem
is they offer different screen options
which change how much capability you
have because a graphics card has to work
harder to push in that display you can
buy 1080p display with the high refresh
rate which is what I recommend if you're
gonna play games on a razer computer
yeah but this particular one has a 4k
screen limited to 60 Hertz you really
won't ever max out any video game on
this it just can't handle it but that's
why we have other systems like the
zephyrus we have a macbook pro over
there right I just want to point this
out because razors everywhere people
love them this is pretty popular and
almost every other product they were
very unique design sensibility they do
well we're about to look at a touch yeah
right there's no denying what
definitely there's no denying that this
is just a black version of this one and
this is a 15 inch screen this a 14 inch
but it's a pretty screen and it's also a
touch screen which the MacBook Pro does
not have mr. so razor actually fix the
bezels on their smaller one - they have
the blade stealth which is the 12 inch
one there's one now and that's like the
13 inch body and they completely fix the
vessel on that they just haven't shown
shown that love to the blade over here
but yeah you got so that's my main
vessel delayed it's out of date compared
to the other systems that we're looking
at and that we have here it does have a
decent support selections you have hdmi
USB 3 you must be but that's about
it that's all you get updated this is
still like a different class of laptop
these guys right so you're telling me
earlier there's a big difference between
this and yes razer does make gaming
computers but these are really more
enthusiasts these have all the ports and
they're using a new technology that
nvidia calls max q mm-hmm it's what
allows you to take big graphics cars I
tend to go into really big seven eight
pound systems and put them into slimmer
systems that you can hear in a play
there are five or six pounds they're
sort of more manageable yeah and they're
usually in the 15 inch range okay so
this is the first one we're looking at
this is the Asus zephyrus
first-generation uses a gtx 1070 just
like the organ over here but it has one
thing that a lot of people have mixed
feelings about and that's because the
keyboard is moved to the very front on
the laptop and I hate this keyboard I
hit this keyboard I use this computer
for a week and I Paul I feel bad
disparaging this keyboard cuz cuz Paul
is supposed to be R to defend it and
Paul loves this I love this keyboard I
use it for a cup I get it I get it
I love it I like it I like it because
for gaming it's closer to the edge which
works for most gamers and in this case
you've never used this touchpad to play
games you'd probably use something like
this so it's more in line res most
laptops you'd be shifting your shoulders
and would be a little bit awkward so it
works here yes this is actually we're
odd but it's something that Asus does to
give you access to a numpad it sort of
works on the touchpad why would you want
a numpad anyway
well some people use Excel it happens
how much is this thing so this one SPECT
as it is is about $2,100
yeah this also you see the keyboard the
light a keyboard backlit keyboard yes
white ringed around here this is all
very gamer this is all very gamer
friendly these keys are tuned to be used
in games like League of Legends and wsad
is using every other video game so it's
pretty suitable I have to say this thing
this whole thing seems horrible to me
I'm just I played one game G on it
earlier on your account I will say it
wasn't even a good death I just comes
out of a car this is all how's the video
this is all - how's the video card and
more importantly to cool the video cards
so one special thing about this laptop
that we don't see on any other system is
if you raise it and you okay yeah I got
it
you can see that there's a little bit of
airspace corrected yeah right here and
if you plug it in this also glows red so
it also has an aesthetic purpose to it
the only problem with it is this isn't
is a removable panel which is very
flimsy and it's pretty poor plastic so
this will warp over time wait this
reflects it so it flexes if you cool it
you gotta open it open it yeah
it rises up yes and then there are you
seeing this yeah it flexes that's great
that's my other theory why the keyboards
on the bottom because if the keyboard
was up here and you were typing on it it
would be like typing on a sponge-like
yes if you push it hard enough you slow
the video card damn I hope I will say by
the way on the keyboard they changed in
the new one they have a new one we're
gonna get to it well gets with anyone
okay what's this third one so this one
is one that we look
February this is Connie or than Evo 15s
and it has the exact same specs of the
Zephyrus same processors send them out
of RAM and same graphics card and the
same screen the only difference is it's
much better built and as you can tell
there's not as much flex yeah you can
also make different lighting zones on
the keyboard in case you're into that
kind of thing it has a fingerprint
sensor as well there you see use Windows
what yes you can use me those hello it's
windows a little compatible and it has a
lot more ports than the Zephyrus it has
an Ethernet port a couple extra
DisplayPort can I just show this yeah
so Paul came by earlier that's like look
at that that's like a good selection of
that's like pro level support to sees I
will stress though that unfortunately
these USB C's don't carry power they're
only for data ok so how many how many
USB C cables would you need to charge it
gaming is the question I would like
someone to answer and that's what's the
refresh rate on the screen so they're
both 120 Hertz and then the razor is
just it's just at 60 because it's 4k but
the 1080 can go higher than that so if
you buy the razor you would buy the
today's I would buy the 1080p screen and
save a couple hundred dollars yeah so
what's the catch
these look and sound great they're so
thin they're light they're faster than
the razor and they're a little more
expensive but like what's the catch the
catch is the battery life is terrible
the Zephyrus tops out at 2 hours maximum
that we're talking power saver 1 chrome
tabs it's ridiculous and the origin is a
little bit better at three hours but you
won't get on a plane flight with this if
you need the power brick make is any
gaming laptop will never run at full
clock speed without its power brick so
you would never game on the go really
which is kind of counterintuitive but it
is what it is yeah so I will say in a
chat
who's he says this thing is hideous true
and then the legend legend you didn't do
a great job of typing here but he says
get it just get a gaming desktop so why
would you get one of these as opposed to
just building out well
$1000 it's really hard to build a
desktop right now because Bitcoin mining
has made it
possible to buy a graphics card on the
low it's just impossible it's a creeper
to purchase a system that's pre-built
than it is to build your own which is
sad because he used to be cheaper used
to be the other way around
so the are you really that straight on
I'm putting it straight in script oh
yeah it's a straight pick one thing it's
it's like a full of thing people buy
them in bulk and then there's no it's
supplying the man yeah how's Lois
applying how to demand so you're saying
that manufacturers have allocations yes
exactly and gonna desktop like why
should I not buy a desktop or pre-built
this time well it's not a laptop you
can't take anywhere it's just so this
isn't more so like a portable desktop
but not a laptop because it's not
convenient in the way that the laptop
traditionally is so this origin I can
set it up at home it's ready I connected
to my monitors but I can bring it over
here and experience the same stuff and
play the same games on a pre decent
screen as well yeah okay so tell us
what's happening so these are kind of a
generation these are kind of a
generation back because Intel announced
some new hexa core processors that are
coming up pretty soon and we're gonna be
taking a look at them in the coming
weeks they're really exciting because
they're bringing hexa core technology to
laptops which we've never really seen
before only really in workstations so
first and foremost we have the Acer
nitro which is gonna be a pretty
powerful system it'll come in both i7
and i7 + configurations one will be quad
core one will be hexa core and
overclocked and we'll have a 1050 TI
which is kind of a really low graphics
card considering they'll have a really
powerful processor in there but that's
why you different have different options
gigabyte on the other hand is gonna
start producing the air of 15 X which
has 144 Hertz display and a gtx 1070
just like these two systems over here
yeah what's super special about the
gigabyte though is it's the only laptop
screen in the whole upcoming lineup of
max-q laptops with the hexa core
processors where they pay attention to
the color quality on the screen so it's
a hundred percent srgb certified you
know it's great for designing it's great
for gaming it's really the closest
all-around we have right now that screen
also just looks really good yeah it's
practically it's compared that to the
razor a minute ago that horrible webcam
placement yes horrible but then if
you're using a webcam on a gaming
computer are you streaming no sir you
did you gotta have your own you gotta
look like a dedicated
so yeah this one is atrocious it's the
Odyssey this is there's that keyboard
place ever been made they learn
something from Asus because ironically
enough we'll get to this later the new
zephyrus move the keyboard to the right
place this is they moved all of the
designers at Samsung to the phone team
and then my Steve was left over and he
is he the sharper image is this looks
like if you googled gaming laptop this
would be the first for know even like a
huge gaming laptops they had a sense of
purpose I mean it needs a dragon there's
no like a glow about it's a beaut x10 70
144 Hertz screen and also a hexa core
it's just if you want a Samsung version
of everything we've been talking about
but yeah that's that the Zephyrus now
this is a lot of that really excites me
because to me this is the perfect one
that's coming in and they're so they
went away from the keyboard
yes so this is this main successor to
the Zephyrs over here is called the
Zephyrs M it's still 15 inches it moves
the keyboard to the correct place but
more importantly while all these systems
are using different variations of max Q
and Max P which down clock processors to
fit them into smaller systems the
Zephyrus is using a full size 10 a set
of 70 sorry so it you get more bang for
your buck and it still retains the same
footprint which is really special no one
else is doing it and the way they're
pulling it off is using the same flexing
Auto cooling system that the Zephyrus
uses where if you open it and the bottom
raises itself apparently there have been
mates they've made some improvements
where the bottom plate doesn't flex yeah
and it doesn't have all the issues that
we move that keyboard up yes yeah so
that's pretty cool we're gonna check
that out and hopefully it'll be as good
as it sounds there's palm rest beautiful
thumb
yeah we got two more what else we got so
the rugby 703 this is if you want to go
all out and this is not a portable
computer this is not a max Q computer
it's a full-on DTX 1070
with the hexa core in there and of 144
Hertz display it's ridiculous it's heavy
is if you want to throw all your money
at the problem and you really really
don't want a desktop yeah dramatically
chunkier then yes
the ones we've been looking happily
weighs around 10 pounds don't call about
that when last but not least we have the
digital storm equinox it's sort of like
an interesting middle ground so it's a
hexa core very similar to the origin it
has a very similar keyboard design and
vent placement mm-hmm
but it also has a 1070 GTX processor and
144 Hertz screen you can upgrade the RAM
and you can upgrade the story pretty
much those core specs remain the same
the only difference with all of these
manufacturers besides Asus Samsung and
Acer's that digital storm is a boutique
manufacturer so they're much smaller
their customer support is a little bit
more tailored but you know different
strokes for different folks if you want
something like that it's available yeah
well what are these all coming out
they're coming out in the next couple
weeks and we're gonna be kicking them
out within the next and you know you're
doing a bunch of those
all right well thank you so much for
coming on hi and thank you so much
always what's not here but I can't stop
the man from making videos check this
out and we'll be right back I've been
told that my last logo for hot tips did
not look like a flame so just trying to
just trying to please everybody Hot Tips
part to take that haters good that logo
I've heard that you have a hot hot - I'm
collecting hot tips okay I can give you
a hot tip but I have to give credit to
dieter in the first place well I was
getting really annoyed because every
time I plugged my computer into my
monitor I would have to redo all of my
windows I'm very specific about why
windows go where although I will say
that this orbit setup originally gave me
carpal tunnel which is why I have every
hot is risk free you got your safety you
got your monitor but your windows
they're everywhere yes what do you do so
I use an application called Divi okay
div V Y so whenever I open this up and
things aren't probably like them I can
easily move things around and I'm not
sitting there dragging the corners of
different windows driving myself crazy
it gives you a mini version of your
screen when you highlight where in the
screen you want that window just I want
this to be Chrome
I want this to be slack do you feel more
fulfilled as a person yeah I feel less
annoyed with resizing windows in America
hey Dan buddy talk to them like that's a
hot tip for me hey Paul
that's a good Dan okay hot tips my hot
tip is sartorial in nature it's that
mean fashion it means related to
clothing okay
don't wear plaid and stripes at the same
time okay plaid ends strikes at the same
time okay at the same time not a good
move thanks Dan okay we're back with
Thomas for another hot tip
probably what do you have for us this
week all right so one of the things that
I do I normally don't carry so first of
all I live in Europe and I use European
Noora adapters to draw the euro plug I
know what that looks like I was over you
draw Europe because I was gonna test you
on that is it kinda like a square oh
yeah so these these little accessories
what Dan was calling those talking to
him earlier he calls it a duck foot or a
duck something I don't know but this
thing is obviously proprietary this is
Apple it only fits on these Apple
adaptors yeah but what's nice is that
lots of other devices that are powered
like this was really his happiness is
not set up this is Neel eyes desk as
this USB multi adapter these things can
actually be plugged directly in and
power your devices that is astonishing
to me it's incredible so sometimes I
don't know if you forget it or because I
travel with multiple pieces multiple
cables to adapt this to European or US
if I happen to forget it I can always
pop it out and I can grab some local
power cable and I can still even though
it's not proprietary doesn't match the
Apple thing it'll still power the device
you got an extension cable so many
possibilities it's incredible I'm really
excited how do you what do you think
what here's Europe our tip here's the
plug if it looks like an Ethernet cable
going into the power yeah that will kill
you Oh new hot tip don't plug in two for
the price of one it is really something
to have a hobo just wander around our
office
alright Ashley and Jake are here circuit
breaker because it's truly ridiculous
you guys are tasked with covering your
gadgets for circuit breaker a lot of new
gadgets happen on Kickstarter and one of
the hottest kickstarter segments
is that floats it's really weird
yeah like every couple of weeks it feels
like there's a new floating thing out of
case there they all get funded amount of
floating plants yeah but yeah I just
like back the math envelope and they
raised like a hundred and forty thousand
dollars on average which is like Wow
every like floating gadgets in general I
that was based I'm gonna say look back
I'm at a back-of-the-envelope but yeah
most cake serves raise less than ten
thousand dollars so thanks but if it
floats it floats you're gonna that's a
good idea naked yeah people love
floating stuff I think it's just like I
mean it's the perfect Kickstarter think
it looks appealing you don't have to
think about it and then it doesn't
really work all right walk me it so you
you've called in a bunch of floating
yeah
so all of these pass through some
crowdfunding platform I think may be the
place to start is this light bulb by
flight okay they've kick-started a
handful of these they have raised 1.6
million across three different floating
wait wait this has raised 1.6 this
company has raised million dollars
selling floating things on Kickstarter
is it various floating's are all light
bulbs I believe they are all light bulbs
just wireless power yeah so this is
pretty much how they all work there's a
base there's some magnets and including
an electromagnet which stabilizes it and
in this case they don't all have
wireless power but this one it uses
wireless power to get the light to light
up and that's it it's actually it's
really simple there are two LEDs in here
that's not real light bulb this is two
little LEDs
yeah we get that ball came on here this
is just like a clear plastic tube with
LEDs under it so one of the things that
I sort of picked up on as I got more and
more these things that they're they look
really slick in you know photos and
videos that they post online and they're
definitely not like you know front from
afar this might look really cool but
then you get a person you realize well
this is plastic not glass because you
don't want to accidentally knock it and
then it'll go flying which is gonna
happen because it's being suspended by
magnets the light isn't really filling
out the fake bulb because it's just too
little LEDs it's
weird like there's this hidden button
specifically like an inch over from the
corner with no markings on it the entire
aesthetic of this is like early eighties
cocaine yeah I just don't I don't get
like is this supposed to be to impress a
date guys really have this right i I
understand you're like okay yeah I mean
that's what this is Pistons right this
is like this is like the piece in your
apartment like how much is this ghost I
mean I would you pay for this right
ladies what I just led this is like a
novelty but also like a little sculpture
100 360 $60 yeah I see I'm gonna pray
over to $69 sorry what happens if you
which is crazy this is it it takes a
while to learn how to float these things
I want you you have not successfully
floated this yet that's the verb I'm
using float okay I think this is the
part they don't show you in the
Kickstarter video definitely not once
you get it up there it stays up there
mostly but if you kind of bump it it
will go and and it just plunk sit down
every time you actually comes with do
you try the little helper setup Jacob
wants to do without obviously it's all
about few minutes you have to talk to
the magnet it's true they can spawn you
kind of feel it yeah yeah you hear
that's one of the things I've become
very comfortable with everything you
should not be able to hear the things
rumbling well I'm gonna keep trying to
see your the power brick on this one
buzzing which would felt so yeah one of
the earliest floating things I saw was
the crazy
it was crazy babies Mars speaker who's
that people go people on the chat we're
actually surprised in it's real
yeah no it's okay um we have made it
float before you lose is not floating
currently and
kind of just you know a good example of
how these things work this was supposed
to do the floating on its own so you
don't have to position it we'll see what
happens here I don't think this is
actually starting up right now it's I
have no idea how to actually get it to
start and when it does start it doesn't
work it's on right you gotta hold it
down mmm I'm not sure I first several
days classic sugar breaker when it
starts up it will make a whirring noise
and then it will clunk to say oh that's
it that's the show everybody
watching now we can move on to you to
your next challenges so there's also a
company called levitating exonic this
year that is capitalized on this sort of
floating craze the fading pillow
yeah so they kind of realized well we
can just make a common base yeah and
then put a bunch of junk on top of it so
this is a cup and yeah is a cup this is
a pillow you suppose put like jewelry or
something on that really is the only
good use case I've seen here is like a
jewelry a tacky jewelry shop Elin look
at our engagement look at them sparkle
like that makes sense to me actually
yeah I think that is probably the big
use case for these right it's like
you're the phony cup is the thing I was
most excited about because I thought I
don't know do you serve people with this
to use it as a coaster and I want to
know okay Jake yeah I want to see Jake
drink out of doors wait I think we have
oh you do we do we have we have a
Seltzer here jump so Jake Wow we're
going to drink from the levitating cup
get it it's getting heavy
oh it is kind of going now you really
should not I feel that always up its up
it's the putting it back without
spilling I got
there any electronics everybody thinks
were but yeah so I mean I I asked them
about this because I really wanted to
know I'm like am I supposed to use it as
a coaster and they're like no you just
like serve it to someone and then remove
it which like they make these battery
powers you can lift them up which like a
cocktail see if you were certain like
this you can't be served a nice cocktail
on this glass it's a plastic glass it's
like screw yeah that's really no they
would not work and also there are any
number of like medium bad cocktail bars
in New York City but I like kind of like
a yeah but these things aren't even made
well that like the the magnet is glued
to the bottom they actually also sell a
$330 art piece which is really just like
a 3d printed like vase or something it
was cracked when it arrived and on top
of that the magnet on the bottom fell
off which this is all that these things
really are it's just this magnet but
it's kind of cool because now we can
just see how this works
okay you can definitely try but let's
put this on Kickstarter you owe us
royalty straight-up someone's gonna
steal his art yeah this is the most
obscure thing I've ever really what
happens when this runs out apparent so
this is okay this is all this stuff but
that's okay this is the one that is my
absolute favorite I gotta be careful
because this is also the absolute horror
see it to float this is the levitating
Nixie clock by laser mat and this is
clear this is made by some dude named
Tony in Scotland it's one guy well I
know valise maybe the chef
so this is really cool so the Nixie
clocks are these I I guess like retro
clocks that people are coming into
they're sort of like a neon lights where
you have a gas inside the tube and it
lights up the numbers which as you'll
notice means these are real glass way
more dangerous because you got to make
sure you don't crack these or you're
gonna just break it all right tell the
people how you set this clock cuz that's
the sale yeah so first you would think
it's a clock I bet I can just program
the timing no too simple instead start
with this this which I also want to note
says experimental use only on it by the
way Anthony said there's loads of Tony's
in Scotland oh that's right thanks thank
you
so this is they called the GPS Tony goes
as a GPS mouse you have to plug this
into power separate from this thing and
it has a really weak signal so it needs
to be pointed directly out of window it
then gets the signal from the GPS
satellite these lights just like blink
and stuff me real it looks very sketchy
when you just plug it into a corner of
your office and don't tell people what
it is you're looking for the sky yeah it
then booms GPS data over to this box
which just sounds like a big old wire
coming out of it this box takes the GPS
signal and power routes it into this
thing which then sends it up to this
clock which also has that's good really
it's really cool
yeah how much is this one this one if
you buy an unassembled kit this is like
really mad as a DIY project is 360 okay
I actually don't even know if they have
any more but unfunded yeah this is also
crowdfunded did six six thousand and the
assembled kits sold for $500 Wow which
of all of these things I think this is
like the nicest quality it's definitely
very weird they're not gonna say that
but somewhere else Steve Wozniak you
will necessarily impress everyone who
walks in here I'd actually of all of
these which one is your favorite
my gosh I I really didn't think this
would be me but I feel like it's my it's
the car yes functional you could drink
out of it well how much light are you
getting out of this bulb the speaker
doesn't even levitate
I feel like you you rock if I have an
office but if I had an office you walk
in my office you see this you're like
thank you very much
for both of you bringing me these things
although I did get it so I'm happy about
that here's what's gonna happen now
we're gonna go to a package room play
video it is cool it's a trailer for
dieter bones to YouTube show processor
but we come back we have gadget
emotional support so call us call us on
your telephone one eight four four four
emotion numbers bottom screen call us
we're gonna walk you through the
emotions of your tech support issue so
watch this video the dieter for
processor where we are back with your
phone calls
I'm dieter bone and I'm starting a new
video series on YouTube where we're
going to post a video every week and
it's gonna be a little bit different
than the stuff we've sort of done before
I promise you I promise you that it's
not going to be me holding a Naz model
making bad jokes I may hold an Osmo I'm
definitely gonna make bad jokes but
usually those two things will cross
we'll have professionals pointing at the
camera at me when I make bad jokes
anyway the point is I want to do a video
series that looks a little bit more
closely at our relationship with
technology and the way that we think
about technology for example one of the
episodes we're working on is this Apple
commercial but piss everybody off what's
a computer I think people really mad I
think it's fascinating that people got
so angry about that line in that
commercial it all was like about we're
calling the show processor we are gonna
look at the choices that technology
companies are making and we're looking
the choices that we ourselves are making
interacting with that technology and
we're gonna we're gonna process all of
that and hopefully come to a deeper
understanding of what our relationship
with technology is what a relationship
with each other is to prove this
technology mediated by it I want us to
get a little bit smarter and if nothing
else a little bit less afraid and a
little bit less alienated by all this
gadgetry stay tuned we're working in the
video series right now it's called
processor with me Peter bone it seems
like a thing that's worth doing
we're back
emotional support so call us 180 44 for
emotion phones are lighting up back
there Creighton our producer is
screening the people who call to just
breathe it us but I'm going to start
with one okay it's kind of it's it's a
lot it's a lot okay I mean like it's a
lot of hearts are open we're ready
getting all the car isn't it
no I bought it should yes it's a real
thing so I'm an Xbox person and I bought
a ps4 so I was peer pressured into it
and I kind of want to not use it and I
feel bad because every time I say that
out loud I'm like I'm gonna get rid of
this ps4 am I an Xbox 1x like people
like literally our co-workers make fun
of me like they make disapproving noises
because they think you're making the
wrong choice yeah because they're like
why are you doing that how do I stand up
okay well the first question I have is
whether the person who was encouraging
you to buy we were the same people okay
so they were just like it wasn't like we
want to play with you like we can have
to be on the same game it was more just
like make the right choice yeah it was
like I'm gonna do this oh okay I'm like
I'm gonna buy these are mantras in the
mirror no Chris plant the executive
editor polygon I'm like I'm not buy an
xbox I'm like literally and like he'll
just like type of room veces in slack
well okay if as long as you don't feel
left out like you're not missing out on
games with your friends then I feel like
better about yourself playing an Xbox
playing a bad game on the Xbox then you
would playing a good game on a ps4 cuz
that's the question what I would only
play the same games I feel like the Xbox
is like a better computer piece for us I
got messed me this doesn't make any
sense then see you're judging I'm ruined
the segment okay
yeah actually any years ago that just
Tom the saying the boss yeah what do you
hate about it so much it's just like I
don't know it's at home like I I think
the way the whole interface is organized
to ps4 just like deeply confuses me like
Sony doesn't get computer
to make beautiful gaming consoles they
have better games that's the thing that
I think you go with the counter take
prove them wrong live your best life
with your xbox
that's like everyday ash like advertised
like I'm Asha Graham yeah like it's the
story be like this is amazing but it
kind of think manifestly is not amazing
okay when you buy a phone do you always
buy the phone that is like technically
the best experience because it pleases
you in certain bizarre way no it's the
same thing because although all the
people are on iMessage right and all the
people are on PSN but you don't want to
be happy if you don't hear about the
people then it doesn't matter what
system you Mir alright creighton by the
way call us 180 44 I didn't get anywhere
with this by the way I just want you to
know one eight four four let's stand up
yourself about the friends at all well
as people it's poor life choices the
chat is like out of control now if you
have thoughts about this call me 184 for
emotion all right we got Eric on the
line he wants tacos unfinished software
Eric go ahead Eric I'm really glad that
my earpiece wasn't broken yeah Creighton
yeah tell us you're doing great so I
mean I do a lot of beta testing and this
this problem happens a lot and it
especially happened with the kaavo you
know the software just doesn't do
anything supposed to do yeah no I feel
like wait do you do a lot of beta
testing or you feel that you live a life
of beta testing I don't know so I hear
it my my feeling is that all of us
consumers now live a life of permanent
beta testing because nothing quite you
wrote that tape didn't you
after the holidays yeah nothing works
yeah everything is too complicated so my
my my like deep feeling in life is it
tech companies build things based on
assumptions and the assumptions are
stacking up faster than anybody has like
realized so give me an example so the
Kaaba was one they actually ship that
product it sort of worked like 80% of it
worked and then 20% of its broken what
some other places we have named
definitely this other software that's
supposed to be controlling my keyboard
and mouse can't really say what the
company is but they told me to uninstall
the first version and install the beta
version and now I can't even use my
keyboard enough here's the thing you're
not you're not upset about these things
being broken maybe you are I shouldn't
tell you you got invested in this
because there is a joy in having half
broken products that do something
slightly different than everyone else's
yeah I use an email app that doesn't
work like 80 percent of the time I love
it though what's your email out airmail
it's fantastic it has a million features
yep it has never let me down testing for
air mail and yes yeah thank you
air mail is you know it's but it's it's
there's such a wonderful feeling to
using this bizarre piece of software
that you have no idea how it's running
like you feel like you are in the new
frontier yeah venture I feel a little
special for having it I feel like I've
gotten involved in something that I
shouldn't be doing it's it's a little
risky you know there's no better feeling
than like the one thing that's broken
and that you're not expecting it and the
software update hits and that shit's
fixed yes you get that small victory
I waited this out yeah in the cabo when
the cabo got its like final update and
then it finally worked that was like the
best feeling ever just the entire bait
at that time it just it would like one
day would turn on and then the next day
I would have to factory reset it exactly
even have it worried yeah okay I don't
think you have a problem here I think I
think what you have is knowledge you
have a deep knowledge about yourself so
you're good take Ashley as bad advice to
me but think of it as good advice for
you just you be you posting Ariens the
story every day about how your birthing
 makes you happy all right we're
gonna go to the next call by Eric of
course by the way Mark Zuckerberg thanks
Eric
Mark Zuckerberg was testifying in front
of Congress today we have Brandon on the
phone he says he has a one-year-old
feelings about Facebook and exposing his
kids to it Brandon
tell me what's up I have a one-year-old
I know you have a kid on the way I just
was wondering what do you think about
you know exposing your kids to social
media things like Facebook Instagram you
know where is that all going should I
just keep my kid away from that so I had
this like I don't have a kid yet you a
one-year-old this is what your of your
one year old in my forthcoming daughter
whose name will be forthcoming Patel
like cardi B for my daughter will be
classic rock that's a crazy thought
right I I work for your kid like this
whatever you do with her now him now it
will be the same as like the phone
system or like cable news right like
you're gonna build them up into it and
they're never gonna know the world
before they're just gonna like build
around them so someone asked me
yesterday look what's the social media
policy for my kid gonna be and I was
like we're just not gonna give her one
until she wants it and then we're gonna
like make sure she's responsible of it
which is basically how my parents that
gave me up like I landed when I was a
teenager yeah you're more hip with teens
than I am
well I think use on your podcast like
every week it's true um I mean I think
it's one of those things where you
yeah you kind of have to weigh it out
for yourself because I do see how social
media is super toxic and I honestly feel
bad for kids now like if you see your
friends in a story all the time and
you're not invited that must suck like
back when we were in high school it was
like maybe you heard rumors but you
never knew
now there's hardcore evidence all the
time so I feel like you have to prepare
your kid for those realizations and they
have to be mature enough to understand
that it's like it's okay you're not
gonna get invited to some things and
you're gonna be fine
so also maybe just wait till they're a
teenager it's like that's like years
from now infinite on my Instagram I
would say I mean it's all every parent's
choice yeah like Andy at the verge
transportation reporter I'm so thankful
he puts his kids on insta stories
because it is my favorite content that
exists down private brand is your is
your Instagram open or closed is your
Facebook open or closed it's closed yeah
so if you're keeping your own pictures
of that lockdown that seems like pretty
safe you know Mark Zuckerberg has an app
on his phone that's like shows in one
new baby a day from all across its
refresh your thoughts what are you gonna
do with it I don't know it's kind of
hard to say I mean part part of what
makes me nervous is that you know I'm
not an old guy but I don't I don't use
things like snapchat you know I'm above
that I'm older than most people who use
snapchat so I don't even know what
what's in that world you know the answer
is others maybe kid yeah like right the
answers are they're teenagers I think
you raise it like everything you
described is just new tastes on the same
high school dramas that you know people
are worrying about yeah right you can't
necessarily avoid that at all as for
whether you put your you like encourage
your kids me on social media there know
how many people are excited about that
like you know at this moment in time
right the baby youtubers yeah don't
here's our advice to you Brandon yo
sorry you trial a YouTube channel
turn them into millions of dollars
no I think the answer is you do it's
comfortable for your channel and you
wait until they start asking for their
own and then you start you start
teaching them how to use it effectively
that's all you can do but the real thing
to me is they're never gonna know you
made this decision if you start buying
them followers now suspicious when
they're older you just want them to
succeed you just want them to be
influencers just give your baby to Sam
Scheffer that's my plan all right that
on that extremely strange no thank you
so much Brandon we're actually out of
time for this episode of circuit breaker
live we'll be back next week 4 p.m.
Eastern I might not be here because I
literally might have a baby between now

text message it doesn't show it to you
