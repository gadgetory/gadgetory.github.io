there's a new version of Dungeons &amp;amp;
Dragons that's coming actually it's
mostly here it's called the fifth
edition which is a lot of additions so
why did we need so many of them so back
in the 1970s this guy named Gary Gygax
created a tabletop game called chainmail
it was kind of like a medieval version
of risk but pretty quickly he and his
buddy Dave Arneson started messing with
the rules and it turned into something
completely different it turned to a
role-playing game we call it Dungeons &amp;amp;
Dragons back then D&amp;amp;D was all about
having a lot of friends around a table
and telling each other stories about
what the characters are doing in an
imaginary world there are all sorts of
rules about how to sword creating
fireballs and figuring out key stats
which led to the first edition of
advanced types of dragons a D&amp;amp;D is
really cool but it kind of caused a
moral panic Pat Robertson got on the 700
club and he told Christians that Dee Dee
was demonic and dangerous most people
have surrendered absolutely evil they
never allow cameras to record their bark
or a tune but the evidence appears in
frightening headlines almost every day
Tom Hanks made this movie called faces
and monsters where D&amp;amp;D basically drives
him crazy and it's a crying harder than
james van der beek of Dawson's Creek
so they pulled out some of those demon
stuff and cleaned up a bunch of
complicated rules and the release
advanced D&amp;amp;D second edition in 1989 it
basically turned into a golden age of
deity all sorts of people started
playing we got crazy new worlds of
playing there's a fantasy world vampire
world desert world made D&amp;amp;D in space
which these creepy creatures called mind
flayers who had tentacles instead of
mouths
that was all great but fast-forward in
1997 and a new company owns D &amp;amp; D and
they release a super complicated version
and then another version that focused
too much on tabletop play and then a
competing game called Pathfinder which
is actually based on the older TD rules
started to be more popular than deity
itself
so we get this crazy nerd fight that
already calls the Edition Wars where
gamers are all playing different
versions of DD or Pathfinder and just
trying to find people who you want to
roll dice with and kill some floating
pedicle IP holders is worse than arguing
about iPhones and androids all which is
why we have this new fifth edition of
D&amp;amp;D it goes back to its roots with
simpler rules and more creativity it's
trying to win back all those people who
left during the Edition Wars if they
pull it off it could be a resurrection
for the franchise Pat Robertson would be
proud
