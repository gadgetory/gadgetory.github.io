millions of people get their news but
they're getting it in a fashion that
Facebook considers really slow it's
taking an average of eight seconds
between the time you tap on the link
inside the Facebook app and the time
that the article fully loads on your
phone so they came up with instant
articles it's a way of downloading those
articles to your phone at rapid speed
and in so doing Facebook hopes that
you'll start consuming more of those
articles than ever before that means
that Facebook will get you to spend more
time in the newsfeed and maybe the
publishers who are publishing their
articles to Facebook will start seeing
more ad revenue it's a big idea and it
might actually change the future of
media for a lot of people on the team
articles is just something that they
love to read and we've all experienced
that issue of tapping on an article and
it takes super long time to load and
you're sort of like should I go back or
should I wait for it to load is it even
reload and so we wanted to start with
solving that problem but then go beyond
that and bring a lot of the stuff that
apps have been using to make experience
is really great into publishing stuff
like interactive maps audio captions
autoplay videos high resolution photos
the stuff that people expect from apps
that you just don't get in mobile
publishing because the tools are there
enough so starting today inside the
Facebook app some of the articles you'll
see there or what's Facebook is calling
instant articles as soon as you tap on
the link you'll get all of the content
from that publisher in a fraction of a
second Facebook's also built a lot of
tools for those publishers so that they
can augment their stories with things
like audio captions for photos or
interactive maps it's a way of creating
a new format just for Facebook when you
go to tap on this one of the coolest
things about instant articles is the
article loads instantly so using a bunch
of the stuff that Facebook's built up
over the past couple years to make their
photos and videos really fast we've now
brought that to articles so when you tap
on an article it loads instantly not
only that we've given publishers a bunch
of new creative tools to do stuff like
autoplay video inline you can tap on the
video and zoom into it and tilt around
and see all the detail in this HD
while its client and just by moving your
hand you can sort of change the view of
the video yeah you just tilt your phone
back and forth and you can go look
around it like you're there kind of
those bees are terrifying by the way
yeah my goodness and Facebook also did a
lot of work to make sure that when you
load up an article it feels like a story
from that publisher so a National
Geographic article actually looks like a
National Geographic article it has a
logo it shows you the author the
photographer it even shows you their
Facebook profiles in case you want to
follow them and see more of their work
and the sum total is something that
feels more like a brand new format for
publishing news more than just a
different container for it inside the
Facebook app so you guys build a lot of
creative tools for publishers to take
advantage of when they're putting
together their instant articles why take
that approach why not just sort of
create a like box of text and let them
drop in a couple of pictures I think the
team is just legitimately motivated by
making great articles you know that's
sort of what we approach this project
from the beginning as how could we bring
lots of the stuff that publishers love
to do in print and in traditional
desktop websites and give them tools I
can more easily be done on a mobile
phone because that's a place that so
many people are reading articles these
days but it's really really difficult to
create really interactive immersive
experiences here most publishers today
are still thinking in terms of website
specifically desktop websites what
Facebook wanted them to do was to create
a new feed of content that would look
really good on mobile so they created a
way for publishers to easily upload
everything they're doing straight to
Facebook Facebook parses through that
information and serves it up in a format
that not only looks good on Facebook but
is probably something that most
publishers wouldn't be able to do
themselves so let's just say it however
instant articles play out on Facebook
will likely have a big effect on the
verge and on our parent company Vox
media we're not a launch partner with
instant articles but maybe we will be
down the road and like any publisher
will have to think about exactly what
that means and what trade-offs were
willing to make in the past publishers
made a thing and then the audience came
to that thing you made a newspaper like
this or you made a website
now with instant articles publishers are
being asked to just become kind of one
more stream of content on Facebook which
means that they have to give up some
control right now they don't have to
give up any ad revenue down the road
they probably will be asked to give up
some of that revenue so there are a lot
of trade offs that publishers are going
to have to consider Facebook has a huge
audience
but that huge audience comes with some
caveats</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
