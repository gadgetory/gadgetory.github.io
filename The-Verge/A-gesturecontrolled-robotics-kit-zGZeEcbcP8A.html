and this is my new best robot friends oh
say hi zou zou is made possible by a row
box kit known as zero my company called
zero UI and what I love about this is
everything is built in and built around
the idea of using hand gestures to
control and this is the glove right here
a little sensitive right now I'm still
learning to drive though but more or
less though does what I what I asked it
to so right now if I'm twisting my hand
a little to and fro as I was gonna kind
of turn to the camera I use a gesture
here to wave one hand away the other
wave both and spin a little bit that is
clearly my thumb kind of going off the
rails but I will say though is actually
really responsive this is maybe a little
more of a sensitivity setting than I was
comfortable at first but I'm kind of
getting the hang him and kind of
enjoying his I'm really enjoying the
temperamental behavior I'll say that so
this arm over box kit was and then we
actually got to see earlier this year at
CES they've had an IndieGoGo campaign it
is just about wrapped up and the goal
now they're funded is to kind of get
these kids out to people do funders
especially by the beginning of next year
and we've seen robotics kits before
we've seen a lot of people like Lego
obviously does them Arduino is big maker
thing and to be honest the supports that
stuff this is actually a pretty open API
but even if you don't need to do all
that and you just kind of want to like
learn to make robotics this is a very
self-contained unit you can use one to
make a robot you can use up to eight
each kit comes with four of these
sensors and all it does is it connects
over Wi-Fi this kid is doing bluetooth
but the final product will connect over
Wi-Fi and using a smartphone app you
basically kind of program which gesture
you want to make kind of which motion
and motions we defined as kind of
twisting clockwise or counter clockwise
on each side or not moving at all and
that's kind of how you start pantomiming
these kind of motions really again this
robot is just a series of limbs and
axles that you kind of control your will
the system itself is a very
drag-and-drop is very very user friendly
it does take a little fun angle and you
want to figure out which direction the
arm is gonna go but it's again it's a
fun educational experience to do that
and again however you want to control
that and kind of program it is
to you and that is the gist Azzaro again
this is one of the many examples they're
gonna have it ships starting early next
year after they go into manufacturing
which is once the IndieGoGo campaign is
done and then once they kind of get the
early funders out of the way it'll be on
sale elsewhere shipping elsewhere
educators makers hobbyists tinker's and
very lonely people who like cardboard
robot friends like me just shake it
which is the universal sign of turning
things on phrasing I'm just going to
please cut that line up a middle higher
the right oh and oh yeah I'm gonna need
to hand shake that one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
