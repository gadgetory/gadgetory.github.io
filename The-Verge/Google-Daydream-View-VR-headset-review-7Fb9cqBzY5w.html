headsets have in common is that they
feel like science fiction the oculus
rift is cyberpunk the HTC vive makes you
look like an alien fighter pilot
PlayStation VR belongs on a 60 spaceship
and the gear VR is your bleak corporate
future what company though is showing us
something a bit more low-key Google this
week it's not you in a daydream view
which is more like the future as comfy
sweatshirt it's the first headset to
support daydream Google's new virtual
reality platform you might be thinking
wait Google already has a virtual
reality platform
it's called cardboard and it's about the
cheapest simplest VR you can get the $79
daydream view is powered by a phone just
like cardboard in this case the Google
pixel and pixel XL but there are three
big differences first it's designed to
be worn for longer periods of time with
a head strap an ergonomic design a
second it's got a miniature motion
controller that lets you do way more in
VR and third it's part of a brutal eco
system built around those first two
things which means the kind of gains and
experiences you'd expect from a
full-fledged consumer headset or at
least that's what Google is promising
but like a lot of VR was still in a
waiting game at first glance Google's
Hardware doesn't look all that
remarkable which is in itself sort of
remarkable the data review is a simple
squishy pair of face goggles to use it
you pull open an elastic band pick up
the controller loop strap to the inside
of the tray and put a phone on it
instead an NFC chip in the tray tells
the phone to launch the daydream app and
the controller pairs with your bone via
bluetooth two plastic nubs on the inside
of the headset Center the screen telling
it how to focus there are two pixel
phones and view works with both of them
but the 5.5 inch pixel XL gives you a
distinctly wider field of view you'll
clearly see the edges of the screen
you're using the smaller pixel so why
should you care about how assembling the
headset works because one of the single
most important parts of mobile VR while
people are still getting used to VR
there are a million points that they
might give up on using a headset the
daydream view is supposed to be all
about getting rid of those speed bumps
technically this headset has roughly the
same parts and basic features as a gear
VR but setting up the view feels a lot
better and it leaves the phone more
accessible while I'm wearing it which
makes me a lot more likely to
put in for a quick VR session most
headsets have three straps one on each
side and one over the top of the head
day during view doesn't have that third
strap so it feels like there's not much
holding it up I learned to trust the
design and now it's very very
comfortable for me but before that I had
a serious dent in my forehead from
strapping it way too tight and some
people may never get past that point
Google has promised over 50 apps by the
end of the year for daydream view but so
far we've gotten deter less than a dozen
in their favor
all of them are good-looking and
competently made I could watch a full
flat screen movie and some 360 degree
Clips in the special daydream version of
YouTube for example I spent many hours
playing a dungeon crawler called
hunter's gate but there's nothing that
you absolutely must try right this
minute
and that much that feels incredibly
clever or unexpected but the difference
is that it requires a smaller investment
and that means that whatever Google puts
in the headset doesn't have to be quite
so impressive to be worth it that said
you can see a lot of potential like the
design in general the controller is
something that seems obvious but
actually opens up a world of new
possibilities in addition to a couple of
buttons in a trackpad its internal
sensors let it tracks simple motion
don't expect to move it around like a
wrister vibe controller it's more like a
very nice laser pointer it is no
absolute sense of position and you have
to get used to the controller drifting
at some points it's easy to reset but it
can be annoying in some games but it's
convenient comfortable to hold and most
of the time it's very precise Google has
given developers a great tool so we're
just waiting to see how they use it if
there's one big missed opportunity for
daydream it's that despite being baked
into Android it doesn't really feel like
part of Android yet the promise of
daydream is that Google is controlling
every level of hardware and software
unlike a mobile platform like gear VR
where oculus is working on Samsung's
flavor of Android and one of daydreams
biggest advantages is being integrated
into a major ecosystem people don't have
to create a new account to use it or
access VR apps only through a daydream
specific portal the daydream interface
is simple and effective and it offers
phone notification options but there are
barely any phone settings options in VR
or much connection with the rest of the
phone period google's hands-free
personal assistant was a huge selling
point
the pixel and it could be great almost
full-fledged VR voice interface but
right now it's not supported in daydrian
what we're seeing here is gold trying to
set a VR standard while still figuring
out how VR works alongside everyone else
manufacturers have promised day during
hardware but we don't know what it looks
like yet developers have promised VR
games and experiences but we're waiting
to see them
there's the beginnings of a great
Android VR interface but it's just
starting to develop as we've said so
many times before VR isn't here yet but
at this point Google has laid out a
strong roadmap for where it could go
now it just needs people to follow I
think you're editing a little more
enjoyable is it really ok</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
