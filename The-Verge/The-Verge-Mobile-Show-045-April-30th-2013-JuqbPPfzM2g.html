the Virgin Mobile show it is episode 45
from week of April 29th 2013 but you
don't really care about the date and the
episode number what you care about is
who's here I am beater bomb i'm dan
seifert i'm chris sigler i'm david
pierce hey we've got David Pierce here
uh he's here to talk about peanut butter
and banana sandwiches that's true
actually uh I had one of those yesterday
by the way and it was phenomenal it's
the best thing ever well no it's only
phenomenal if you put money on it right
yeah no no no it's the mix of the
brittle crunchy and correctly you gotta
put Nutella on you're both wrong the way
you do a proper peanut butter and banana
sandwich is with peanut butter and
banana hence the name and you have to
use the right peanut butter i'm using a
an artisanal peanut butter from new york
city may I add it's from New York City
it's from I think it's just called the
peanut butter company right that sounds
like a New York kind of company yeah so
we invented peanut butter don't ask
questions right it's got like cane sugar
in it in all this garbage listen uh if
it's not the way Elvis didn't make it's
not the way I'll just made it I don't
care mash the bananas add bacon grill it
up grilled would be good I'm not gonna
lie uh so I was just thinking about
something you know how we used to for a
long time this actually predates the the
mobile show this is one we were audio
only we had the the variations of the
number three well since we added Dan we
never like got it thought about yeah we
never thought about doing variations of
four so this opens us up to an entire
entirely new dictionary basically that
we can probably carry for months on end
yeah we we just kind of just gave up
trying to come up with different
variations yeah we exhausted the supply
of synonyms for three but now we have
synonyms for four right can they go
quartet and not that's all I've got
quote oh you're just scratching the
surface so I can do this one time and
then i have to leave forever so we had a
whole lot of actual real genuine mobile
news this week a whole lot happened and
we are here to talk about it and i think
the the biggest thing that happened is
we had a review of the galaxy s4 david
is not at all tired of talking about
Alex ps4 not even a little bit have you
got one with you is there I do it's
right here it's also I like to play the
fun game called which one is the galaxy
s4 back on and I thing is everybody
always loses matters right you're right
you still lose well it via you know that
the dead giveaway is the number of
sensors around the ear piece right right
is the gs4 as an additional sensor right
because otherwise how would you wave
your hand over your phone to tell it to
do things right no the gesture where you
like wave to like move and I come on
between home screens like this thing
like that is the like if you had to boil
down samsung to a microcosm like that is
it like that that tells you everything
you need to know about what Samsung well
yeah I like to imagine Samsung has like
the same sort of twenty percent time
thing that Google does but then they
just take everything and they're like
yes ship it question with the gesture
thing is Ken intelligence between a slap
and the back of the hand like you give
if you give the phone the back of the
hand gesture does it do something
different no George ich8m it should yeah
should say thank you may I have another
um no unfortunately it doesn't and I
kind of wish it wouldn't so you can't
get to the point where like you feel
cool and you can just be like super
subtle with the gestures as you go over
it to make it do stuff and that's like
when you're a real power user of the gs4
but there are so many other gestures
they could have done like they could
have done this to force close apps you
know the thank you that thing that would
have been great okay so galaxy s4
basically like hopefully if you're
watching this you have read the amazing
review and the gist of it is and this is
also top shelf for quite a while just if
it is like it's a really really really
really good
found that nobody really hears all that
interested in yeah I think that's there
I mean and it's it's been really
interesting to see all the the feedback
to this review because I think like a
lot of people uh we have this great
benefit of being able to use all these
phones and in some sense like if you've
never used a phone like the HTC One the
galaxies cores gonna feel fine because
you know six months ago or two years ago
when you bought your last phone like
this is just what phones felt like in a
lot of ways it still is but now like
we've sort of seen the light and like
once you once you play with these better
design phones like the Lumia 920 or the
HTC One then suddenly this just doesn't
feel as good anymore even though for
most people it's probably what they're
used to I don't know quite what to do
about that it's like just go play with
this other phone I promise it's better
yeah so I want to want to tell a little
story so HTC releases a really well
designed one phone two pretty good
reviews they managed to get it out the
door just in front of samsung's new
phone samsung its phone comes out the
reviews come out a little bit later than
the the one reviews and people like this
is a really good phone it doesn't feel
about that great of the hand and then
Samsung proceeds to completely
obliterate HTC that was the story of
2012 and I feel like we could just like
copy and paste that on to what's going
on with in 2013 like it like like the
only thing that changes is you take the
X off of the one for HTC and you switch
the 304 on the galaxy s I don't know if
I'm convinced that that's true i think
you're probably right dieter and and i
certainly would have been on board with
that theory a couple weeks ago but i was
in an AT&amp;amp;T store over the weekend and i
was shocked dino dan you right back up
why were you in an AT&amp;amp;T store because i
owned a gs4 for about 18 hours oh and
returned it already well it will get to
that in a minute we'll get to that in a
minute but but the the store rep was was
really really bashing the gs4 and use
like you know look there's no comparison
he pulled a one out of his pocket he's
like this thing just feels so much
better and it's obviously like a
completely different design but the gs4
just feels and looks like a gs3 to mean
he's absolutely right so if that is the
sentiment that's that is being shared by
majority of the 18 in carrier refs
around the country this week that might
end up steering the kinds of people who
are looking at the gs4 right now not
knowing a lot about these devices going
into the store that might secure them in
the direction of the one so they might
actually have better success with the
one than they had with the 1x this time
last year I think yeah I'm surprised to
hear that actually like if I'm if I'm
HTC that should be super encouraging
because Samsung it seems like they they
just became sort of the default and
you'd walk in and be like I want a phone
and they would just immediately be like
here's the gs3 it's pretty good you'll
probably like it but if HTC has sort of
commandeered some of that away from
Samsung that's that's huge well there's
a couple of other things HTC did write
this year that it didn't do last year
wasn't able to do last year this year
it's got the one on Sprint t-mobile and
AT&amp;amp;T at virtually the same time and it's
a virtually the same phone whereas last
year eighteen t had the 1x but t-mobile
had the 1s and then later on in the
summer the evo 4G LTE came out and then
verizon didn't H interesting HTC device
until like December um you mean what you
know there's the rumors that verizon
will have a version of the one in by
mayish or something like that so that is
encouraging for HTC I still think it's
got a very very very difficult path
ahead in order to you know defeat
Samsung's marketing and you know there's
a lot of things that Samsung has going
for it between the massive support from
bestbuy like the Galaxy stores within
the store that Chris reported on a
couple weeks ago we're not going to see
an HTC store within a store so
everywhere you go the galaxy's thrown in
front of you and I know David mentioned
this quite a bit in his review when
people talk about buying a new phone
it's like oh I bought a new iPhone or I
bought new galaxy I didn't buy an
android phone or I didn't buy an HTC
unless you are like really into phone so
I think there's still a hard road ahead
for HTC yeah no doubt but dan I mean at
22 HTC's well not ABC's credit but but
Samsung's downfall you pointed out that
you're in your local best buy there
wasn't a soul in the sampling experience
yeah I mean it was it was like quite
deserted now to be fair I we noted that
this was before the galaxy s4 was really
is really available so yeah I assume
that's gonna be different once the
galaxy s4 is actually on shelves and
Samsung is advertising it every other
minute and people walking and looking
for it but yeah when I was there you
know I strolled right through the empty
samsung samsung display booths but hey
you know an empty samsung Display booth
is better than the non-existent HTC One
so the differentiating factors between
these two phones for me I mean one
obviously we think the hardware is way
nicer on the HTC One but you know HTC
took this giant risk with the camera
that's technically 4 megapixels and the
ultra pixels or whatever so I'm really
curious to hear more about the camera on
the s4 is David you see were really like
it's really really good i'm just sitting
here like scrolling through pictures and
i can just but um no i mean i think it's
it's the best android camera I've ever
used personally and for me it's it's
very much a you know personal preference
thing like I don't spend that much time
taking pictures at night in dark places
and if you do then the one and the Lumia
920 just blow this out of the water it's
not it's not good in low-light it's very
much like the iphone 5 and another like
any other Android camera in that sense
but just in terms of like I i I'd really
just don't buy what HTC says we're like
pixels don't like that the megapixels
don't matter it's just like a 13
megapixel image when you blow it up or
look at it and anything other than like
the 5-inch screen on your phone like if
you want to put this on your computer
and actually do stuff with it the more
pixels there is just more data and it
just it's sharper and this camera is
incredibly fast and they have just the
most ridiculous number of software
features and crazy stuff you can do but
it mostly just boils down to the camera
takes really good really accurate and
sharp pictures and the one just does it
it does some nifty things in low light
but this ultimately just takes better
photos and like for me that's kind of
the whole ball game I mean honestly
other other than like playing around
with all the
extra nifty features though like I'm
sorry what this isn't their feature were
like you take a picture and it records
like five seconds of audio when you take
the picture I mean come on yeah it's it
makes no sense and so the idea is like
oh it's a postcard where you take a
picture and you're like hey grandma
thinks about you happy birthday and
David I I do have to say that get your
the picture in your review of you and I
think you're in like Times Square with
like your your face in the heart is like
the best thing I've ever seen I urge by
far well not even look I mean that's
like the whole reason I did this review
if I'm being to do that on I just wanted
to take a picture of me in a heart in
Time Square know and that's another
thing that like Samsung makes this big
deal out of all these different features
and all the different things the camera
and the phone can do and this dual shot
thing where you can take a photo with
the front and back camera at the same
time and sort of super impose them on
each other is just absolutely useless
like I can't think of a single reason I
would ever actually wants to use this in
my life oh let me cover a quarter of my
image with my face awkwardly framed in
the front camera and the side of a
building yeah yeah but yet samsung
spends all this time talking about this
instead of you know any of the other
things they could be talking about and
it's right range to me yeah so is it
just like if you care about the way the
phone looks then you want the one but if
you want you know utility and expandable
memory in a replaceable battery in a
better camera then you want the s4 and
you know no shame in that is that does I
mean that sound and again that sounds
exactly like the story last year if you
want something that is you know super
useful and gets done I mean the galaxy
s3 was my phone for CES because I was
like well I need a powerful fast gmail
access I need LTE and I need to make
sure that I'm not going to be stuck with
the dead battery at the end of the day
and I was like well all those things put
together the led me to the gs3 yeah you
think it seems like there's a there's a
just the same sort of calculus for the
gs4 if you're looking you know deciding
between these two phones well I think to
me what's what's partly really
interesting about the one is that it it
used to be sort
you bought the iphone if you wanted a
phone that just worked and you bought an
android phone if you wanted to tinker
and do sort of weird customization
things and you wanted expandable storage
and you wanted a removable battery and
you wanted all this different stuff and
HTC skewed it seems to me skewed a
little bit for the apple route of saying
like this is our phone it's beautiful it
works you'll like it we promise just buy
it uh and like and other than like
blinkfeed which just remains a travesty
of everything for cell phone on it works
I think and it's it's a beautiful
well-designed phone but yes if you want
all the tinkering and all the
customization um you should probably buy
the gs4 because it has a removable
battery and has expandable storage and
the one doesn't have that but I'm
personally really excited about the fact
that there's actual options now if you
want to have an android phone that is
beautiful and usable and friendly for
all the same reasons the iphone is i
think that's great what the what version
of Gia come how much RAM storage you
have in your gs4 i believe it's 32 is 32
because there's a thing going around
that the 16 thing like a whole bunch of
storage gets taken up by the OS yatrik
the same thing Microsoft went into with
windows 8 where it's like half the
storage is gone because of all the crazy
stuff it's trying to say you're like
really gonna want to use that SD card
slot apparently so that isn't a version
that only gets you so far though right
like if you've got say a big game like
say you got asphalt 7 or something which
is like one or 1.5 gigabytes I don't
think you can move that to the SD card
so if you are a gamer or using these big
apps then you know you're gonna want
have more storage either the 32 gigabyte
version or what the access to your game
early should be buying an android phone
hey man I mean be 1080p displays games
look pretty great so yeah are the three
that actually are decent look Touche I'm
a huge don't know I'm a huge android
gaming hater so like the Ouya and the
shield make no sense to me because like
nobody's made yeah I I completely agree
with you either like idea is a product
that I just do not
understand just because android gaming
has not succeeded on what androids
native platform is a mobile device why
would I want on my TV but you know well
and and just adding to that so for the
for the fleeting moment when I owned a
GS for this weekend I yeah I know soon
no no stop just stop I love how he just
tries the glass right over it you need
to explain what happened here because
you're like if you guys aren't familiar
with mr. Crigler he's pretty well known
for like buying a phone and then selling
it immediately getting rid of it and
he's also well known for like paying way
too much for a phone just to have it and
then like realizing he's made a terrible
huge mistake and then getting rid of it
a couple of days later um this happened
with the nexus 4 you need to tell us the
story behind your purchase of a galaxy
s4 what color and why and like why don't
you have it anymore well it's it's
really simple so I you know I have a 1
review unit it's not you it's
international unlock so no LTE and that
the the back order for the u.s. LTE
unlocked version which is that the real
process the real gem which is in
theaters pocket right now is is way way
out right now they're short like if you
go to HTC site there it's a ship date
528 or something like that and no human
being much less somebody like myself is
that patient you know and I yeah I
already yeah I mean like the galaxy s 8
is gonna be out by 58 oh no so they're
like I ordered mine they said it was
going to be two to four weeks for the
ship that they shipped it within a week
so yeah I mean and that's something to
consider but that's still a week which
is like two years and in my they also
never sent me a confirmation email so
good job let's talk great job really
impressed with the retailer that HTC
chose to sell these phones it just
medically better than google better than
a less true not hard to better than
google right so you know the bottom line
is that i hand played with the gs4 yet
because i didn't do the review i didn't
have a review unit so I'm like hey you
know I'll go buy one so I got a white
AT&amp;amp;T one and it's weird because like
every time I buy
a phone for full price from a carrier
store it's like I'm from another planet
yeah they're like like I go to buy it
and they're like oh I'm so sorry like
you eat your you know you're not
eligible for an upgrade yet i'm like
that's fine and they're like what it
won't give me like it like I'm like I'm
insane so uh yeah but I bought it um and
the you know it's yeah I have the groove
with everything David said the one thing
that I noticed which which maybe I don't
know if it was the abscess running or
what but like consistently it was
stuttering like really yes everything I
did like just as simple like uh screen
transitions were stuttering and it and
it's like that is so unacceptable when
you're on a Snapdragon 600 or any 2013
processor like yeah what is what have
they done so tragically wrong at the at
the operating system level so that this
is at League I totally get why Facebook
had to rewrite the core of Android to
make homework now like I did it well and
that the crazy thing is like facebook
facebook did it it worked it's so smooth
and yet nobody else's figure this out
and and I notice the same thing in the
review and like I don't know if you
spending time in the gallery but for
some reason the gallery app is just
broken it's just slow and laggy and
crashes all the time and it's just like
it's all these little things that it's
like Samsung you have so many powerful
features and it does all this crazy
stuff yet you can't make it so that you
know swiping home screens works
perfectly every time it's ridiculous
yeah um so yeah anyway my gs4 is back in
eighteen tease hands now oh I got an
email from Chris on Sunday and the
subject line is I did something horrible
yesterday that I am ashamed no I was
totally ashamed of it like cuz I I swore
up and down that I went by GS for that
the one was better found and I believe
that it is I as I think most of us do
but you know I haven't played with gs4 I
wanted to so whatever for 25 minutes for
25 minutes um what else it's got an IR
blaster just like the one David I know
that they're not David dan you're deeply
in love with the IR blaster yeah man
it's fun like I know I read an article
you should I i didn't i didn't think
that I would like actually
be using it on the one like when when
these were all announced and they're
like oh they good ir blaster sounds like
oh well that's stupid oh and right you
know what am I going to do with that and
then you know I think both Samsung and
HTC have contracted peel to write these
television remote control apps and they
work really great and I mentioned in my
piece that these do not really replace
your your standard remote that comes
with your cable box or your DVR or
whatever it is you have these days just
because they don't support all the
functions but if you're sitting on your
couch paging through your fitted Twitter
feed or your your facebook news feed or
whatever while you're watching a TV show
and you just want to quickly change
channel or mute it or turn the volume up
or whatever it's right there in your
hand and it's like and super convenient
and it was super easy to set up so uh
you know i'm i'm happy with it and i
think it's cool um and it is frustrates
me no like I I mean i'ma I'm a harmony
one user and I Mike my cable isn't
really set up like I I think I've got
like three channels and because their
breasts are encrypted and whatever so
like you know I wash out the TV i watch
xbox I want I've got like my mac mini
hooked up as a media pc and you know I
want to like hit the button and have it
go through the macros of launching all
the right things in the right order and
switching all the inputs and you know
the apps don't do that so like like I
could get it to adjust volume i guess i
could try to program it but i would
really like i know there's an sdk for
this stuff but i don't understand if
these things are going to have I
airports we should have like logitech
should give up on their hardware thing
they basically have and just give us a
remote app that works they've got a
remote app that works with their little
repeater thing but I would love to see
somebody like actually try and do like a
smartphone remote app properly now that
there's hardware that I've got good IR
blasters on them because like if it has
hungries damn right the funny thing is
that i think i cant rember what that
repeater is called i know you're talking
about but it's it's discontinued already
like if yeah I I feel like it was in
production for like six months and then
it they just continue now know if that
was I selling halo poorly I pulled his
Eagle around and I bought one and used
today hahaha I didn't return it though I
think it's sitting in a closet is it no
good it's terrible the the delay on it
it's like it's like you hit a button
then you wait 10 seconds to hope it
works oh so that's like the kind of
performance I expected from using my
smartphone as a remote through an IR
blaster but you know it it hasn't been
that in my experience now I think I
might be wrong but I think you can set
up macros for the cable boxes and stuff
that are supported like within the HTC
app so if you have a cable box and DVR
that's supported by it I think you can
like go to like a watch TV setting it'll
turn your TV on it'll turn your cable
box on with one button press but it
really is more useful to you if you are
subscribing to a cable service or
satellite service or something that has
a cable box instead of a mishmash of
set-top boxes that you might have if
you're a cord cutter so i can see you
definitely understand your frustration
there because it is not as fully
featured as say like a harmony remote
rom but like the whole observation is
just that like 10 years ago every single
phone practically came with an IR
blaster and virtually every smartphone
up until the iphone and then they were
gone for like six years and then this
year we've got the two top android
phones on the market both have IR
blasters samsung's built it into a
number of its tablets it did started
that last year i think with the note
10.1 had an IR blaster so it's just it's
uh it's just funny to see like
yesterday's technology make a resurgence
even though it looks like that different
purpose today yeah yeah it's gonna say
that's the kicker there is that the the
IR ports that were on most phones before
the iphone were focused on ur da and
they usually didn't have enough output
like the you know that they weren't
bright enough or whatever to like
control devices reliably like there you
know they were just intended for data
transfer and like it that you know there
were always like apps that were
available to like turn them into remotes
but like they frequently didn't work
because like they just weren't designed
for that so you'll get like really close
to the components so now like or they
were just on a bad spot on the phone
yeah it's on the side or the bottom or
something like that right it wasn't
designed for that right so these new
ports are not
the right place but are designed to have
sufficient power output to reliably
control all components from a distance
man speaking of old-school features on
phones Chris reviewed the q10 with a
physical keyboard I did I did uh it's
it's a bold let's go through a bold move
there they did uh yeah yeah I yeah I
mean I don't you know I think my
conclusions thumbed it up it's like if
you use a bold and you love your bold
then yeah go out and buy this q10 and
you know Ingrid's is blessed you won't
you won't understand the features and
the apps that you may be missing once
you leave you mean Chris go out and buy
this q10 but still hang onto the ipod
touch you're using for all of your apps
and exactly that's exactly right yet
notes it's look it's it is hands down
the best portrait qwerty keyboard that
I've ever used which i think is what all
was probably expected and i think we say
that about that would've been bad yeah
and the difference with the q10 is that
it's um it's it's wider than a bold than
a bold 9780 so i think by a little bit
so you end up with a slightly better
keyboard but the cliq eNOS is the same
the shape of the keys is the same the
screen is not great the the resolution
is fine i have no problem 720 x 720 but
it's very very dim even compared to the
z10 side by side which was a little
surprising to me and it it's AMOLED
right it's not LCD correct cry on sam
alleging um so yeah I mean that the
conclusion i drew is that you know if
you're either accustomed to using
portrait qwerty a more specifically
accustomed to blackberry this is going
to be a great upgrade for you that's
what you're into but if you're
accustomed to using the Android phone or
an iPhone I can't imagine I like I can't
formulate a good reason why I would
recommend conceivably recommend this
device to any of those people so I can
what I was really curious about uh
reading your review was sort of the idea
that like it used to be that uh physical
keyboards were just kind of objectively
better than software keyboards but it
seems like
part of your argument was that were not
there anymore like I was it's you know
you know if you just attach the keyboard
to you know the iphone it would be a
better phone but like maybe that's not
true anymore right it no absolutely and
I know the people like sean hollister
will be humanely disagree on this but
some are Shauna be right there thank you
shit is just right there but if but if
you but if you um if you look at
swiftkey if you look it's what I love
the new ver I mean I've always looks
white but the new version of swype is so
good um but even the iOS keyboard a
windows phone has a notoriously good
keyboard it has since one doesn't 17 but
it got better in 7.5 and ate any of
these to me are better and more
efficient ways of entering text at this
point then a physical keyboard that
wasn't true five-year that certainly was
a true five years ago and I wouldn't say
otherwise but but now I think the story
has changed so for me a physical
keyboard is it like I'm faster on a
virtual keyboard but like the like
feeling of using it makes you feel like
a boss makes you feel like you're like
I'm typing on here i am working and i'm
doing something on it i feel fast and
that's awesome and like there's there's
value to that i was really hoping that
they're there whatever they're called
they're quick actions or just type
things where you could like launch stuff
with little keyboard shortcuts was a
little bit more robust um but i just
don't mean like I didn't see the
advantage of like going to the home
screen and typing tweet and then my
tweet instead of just going to the
Twitter app and typing my tweet like I
didn't get it well it's a verte it
sounds like it's a version one I mean
with the old blackberry you could assign
you could like go to the launcher and
hold down a button and have it launched
an app so you can pull down t to launch
Twitter the way that they did it on
whether lasses you could you it would it
would guess or design shortcuts so
instead of typing tweet da da you just
have like T space dadadada da so I was
like like Alfred I guess so like you
would you be able to do stuff a little
bit more quickly with a little bit fewer
key presses or like a mess i'm saying
this if somebody and actually one thing
that i will admit that of all the major
platforms right now i do think that
blackberry 10 particularly 10.1 has
the most robust universal search because
like when you start typing a list of uh
you know actions pieces of content like
emails and text messages and apps I'll
come up among other things and when you
tap and hold on any of those it shows a
role or excuse me a column of icons
along the right side of the screen and
if you swipe over to those it extend it
expands to show like text of what that
icon means and those are all the actions
that you can perform on that item that
showed up in search so that for example
if an email comes up you know some of
the options might be like reply to like
you know open I'll you know those sorts
of things it's it it's a context menu
for universal search yeah that's that's
cool actually but not enough to make you
feel like you were still more effective
and useful at this thing right right
that is the that is the core outcome of
this review is that it's like at no
point did I have I thought any
productivity game game but certainly not
enough productivity gain to justify
sacrificing everything that you need to
sacrifice to move from Android or iOS to
blackberry 10 really does that make
blackberry and particularly the the
keywords sort of like the AOL dial-up of
the spectrum tree where literally all
they can bank on now is that people it
is sort of the inertia of like this is
what I've always had I don't want to get
anything else because until now the
keyboard was the only thing that was a
convincing reason to buy a blackberry
right on and you know there have been
others over time there was security and
there was email and those of all then
sort of pushed away and then blackberry
is now just really touting the keyboard
and if that's gone like what what do
they have what's left yeah well like I
said I mean like if you have a bold
right now and you love your bold to
death please by all means go by the q10
because you are going to be head over
heels in love with it but yeah outside
that I don't know how they're going to
appeal to new audiences I think well but
so but even that like you're sort of
saying now that if even if you have a
bold and you love it kind of you know
try something else because on-screen
keyboards are great and they're better
and we think you'll like that better uh
yeah that that's sort of that's gotta be
scary for blackberry at this point yeah
and you know obviously that's what
they're trying to do the z10 right it's
like capture that audience that is
outside their core in a way that the
certainly the the torch never did and
and the storm but um green clicked it
was amazing yes very critical I forgot
about that oh my god that actually
happened oh man I totally forgot about
that so so Dan is Dan is actually going
to it's not called blackberry world
anymore right it's called some black
rely very live like react thank you and
so I think that's going to be what they
need to do we already know torsten
heinze said before that they're going to
be showing what a total six phones in
2013 and and so the only way that
they're going to be able to revitalize
the blackberry user base and actually
start adding people to it i think is to
really take the q10 down market and do
something really creative and innovative
to like show people why this is the this
is the right form factor and then pull
people into that ecosystem at a low
price point and then they can graduate
over and q10 right now I just need to
release a portrait slider and they'll
take over the world that's as they did
that the first time around L&amp;amp;T Thank You
Belong its price that I think it's
suggested price of two hundred fifty
dollars on contract so this is very much
not an entry-level device this is you
are not not even competing with like the
first level of iphone 5 or the one or
the galaxy s4 year now competing with
the upgrade version that gets you more
storage so it's like as far as that
price competitiveness is definitely not
well hang on I mean that price yeah I
mean they'll bring it down for consumers
but blackberries have always been way
more expensive than they really had any
right to be so like that price is there
just so that they can convince CTOs to
buy it and blackberry 10 just needs to
be good enough so that people will flip
a table and quit their job when they get
handed to them but Cory but but if
blackberry you and he doesn't take over
but BlackBerry's biggest success was
with the entry-level models the curve
8300 seer
he was the one that with blackberry sold
millions upon millions and pawns
millions upon millions on and it like
dragged out the death of the curve
series for eons because he couldn't
figure out anything else to do but
that's where blackberry got all its
market share wasn't selling bolds and it
wasn't selling the high end or the 8700
to the 8800 or whatever it was that was
priced at three hundred dollars on
contract at the time so if you know if
blackberry wants to appeal to that
entry-level market we need to see
essentially a curve level blackberry 10
device between may see a blackberry live
hopefully we'll see a blackberry live
you know sooner rather than later well
the original plan was to continue to
offer that kind of devices blackberry 7
devices i think it was like two years
after the release of the first the the
the z10 i don't know if they could stick
to that yeah i don't know if they can
really release a blackberry 7 device in
the US market they might be able to do
that in the emerging markets but in like
North America and Europe where you know
the people can buy an iphone 4s for a
hundred bucks on contract order an
iphone 4 for free on contract a
blackberry 7 device is just going to get
steamrolled but also releasing a new
blackberry 7 device would be deeply
stupid on many levels because the they
need to be spending every single drop of
their energy right now beefing up the
blackberry 10 ecosystem they can't
afford to divide their attention between
q ecosystems right now certainly and two
if they've coded themselves into an
operating system that on its surface
appears no better than Android that
isn't capable of running on entry-level
hardware they've really screwed
themselves yes God knows that you can
get an android device for free so if if
I mean you're looking blackberry 10 is
stuck on two hundred dollar on contract
hardware then it's game this hardware is
not two hundred all our own contract
hardware if you're looking at like say
the z10 that's competitive with a galaxy
s3 that was released in june of last
year so I mean it's for on a spec level
it's competitive with a hundred dollar
pantech which is an entry level or
mid-range android device why blackberry
is insisting on charging the price
premium you know dieter mention to maybe
it's to just you know appeal to these
these CTOs that need to buy them at
fleets but it's definitely not giving
you the same value that you get on
a droid was right and I guess well okay
so apparently the q10 is selling well in
the UK they're expecting to sell tens
and tens of millions oh but we don't
know the library says it's selling well
but we don't really know any numbers yet
I mean this single I think this thing's
gonna outsell z10 for sure yeah I mean
it's an obvious there's an obvious
reason to buy it like if you want a
physical keyboard buy this phone like
there there isn't one like that for the
z10 it's like if you sort of want a
universal hub for your messages by the
z10 like I I don't know why whatever
tell someone to buy that whereas with
q10 there's at least like somebody's
like I like my physical keyboards like
oh by q10 right yeah no one knows
language I need to upgrade no one's like
I need to upgrade from my curve 9380 or
like I need to I need upgrade I need to
upgrade for my storm like yeah no one
instead you know the storm people are
saying that the store people were oh boy
yeah if they have an upgraded from their
storm um p I pity them greatly so we
can't talk about BlackBerry's i'll talk
about the latest thing to come out of
tourists in Heinz's mouth um like the
new Eric Schmidt just saw I'm saying
things ever know he's a new he's a new
bike lesser ease yes it's like these
statements well this statement today
that has been in the news is that he
says that tablets will be dead in five
years which is kind of an insane thing
to think about and he's also elaborated
and saying that TVs tablets as a poor
business model because the money is not
where hardware is but it's with software
services for these companies um and to
be honest this is something that he's
actually said a number of times maybe he
didn't say in explicit words of you know
dead in five years but he's really
downplayed the importance of tablets for
quite some time and said that blackberry
feels the smartphone is going to be the
convergence device that takes over and
it crosses over to between your laptop
and you know your mobile and things like
that um but you know when you look at
Apple's balance sheet and you know where
Apple is making tons of money and where
every other company is trying to break
into and grab some of that money a lot
of that isn't
so it's I can see this and not be like
that is just the insane hubris that
we've heard from blackberry for the past
five years well I'm sure that you know
he was trying to meet I'm guessing that
he's trying to speak in like these
general terms of the future of computing
and that you know the phone is going to
become the hub and then you just have
these terminals and maybe other tablet
maybe a big screen at your desk
basically the exact same stuff that Jeff
Hawkins was talking about back in the
day with the folio right like the
blackberry spokesperson Alex Atala said
that the commons torsen made are in line
with previous comments you made about
the future of mobile computing overall
and the possibilities that come with a
platform like blackberry 10 like that's
fine if you want to say yeah we don't
know what the what computing is going to
look like and in five years not just
mobile computing we're computing in
general like it's going to be crazy and
what we're doing now is not we're going
to be doing and get ready for you know
innovation like that's fine but um you
know don't say tablets are dead because
you know what time what is dead as a
playbook yeah or tablets are poor
business model because you know who
they're poor business model for
blackberry yeah well everybody got named
Apple right yeah yeah I was about to say
like like that's that's the weird thing
about it is that like you can see if if
you live in this weird vacuum where you
haven't used an ipad for an extended
period of time you could seriously make
you know pretend to make the argument i
like to call that these d jon rubinstein
vacuum yes right famous for having
claimed that he never used an iphone
which may very well be true but but to
this day if you have never touched an
ipad you could seriously like I can
imagine how tourists in hinds could be
living with those blinders on but yeah
if he's only ever use the playbook and
this is this is his tablet experience
and sure but it's interesting to see
that we've been maybe kind of thinking
that with the launch of blackberry 10
now out there maybe we'll see a tablet
device from blackberry to go along with
the new phones and this kind of puts a
big damper on those kind of hopes or
anything like that so yeah well what's
funny is it makes me think that you know
towards makes me think that he thinks
the like the PadFone is the future of
computing on and he may well be right
and I will be
fascinated the day that you know
blackberry comes out with whatever they
feel like calling the PadFone David you
love the PadFone i do i love the PadFone
the PadFone and I are best friends we
really are I'm more of a phone pad guy
myself but things like I think torso
hands might be right ultimately the
India in that like your phone will be
the hub of all your data and then you
just sort of a talking to masters just
steal it from Hawkins boy yeah Coggins
is right and then there was there is the
atrix which tried to do the same thing
like people tried and liked this may
well end up being the future of
computing but come out and say in five
years no one will have a tablet anymore
is just you just make yourself look dumb
like that there's a better way to say
what he was trying to say and like if
I'm giving him as much bad for the doubt
as I can here there's a better way to
say what he was trying to say than to
basically say no one's gonna buy an ipad
in five years I'm sorry but that if
that's really going to be the case
whereas like the phone is our hub of
computing we plug it into all these
peripherals it's hard for me to see as
blackberry as being the company that
brings us there you know Google's going
to do that way before then and then you
know apples been converging iOS and OS X
for the past year and a half in that
looks like okay even more so I can't
believe I'm saying this but cute equator
platform to make that vision a reality
than Android is that's true perhaps but
you know Google's just going to like
show more knit like it does with
everything so you know we're going it's
very likely we talked about this a
number of times of the convergence of
Chrome OS and Android it just makes
sense for Google to combine those
businesses so you know and Google is so
far ahead of where blackberry is uh in
the smartphone world and it actually has
you know laptop devices that it can try
converge with that I think that Google
is going to do it first and it's going
to grab the attention long before
blackberry is able to um okay so coming
up we've got blackberry live we've got
google i/o same time we've got a nokia
lumia announcement we've got WWDC we've
got an xbox announcement what else is
coming up that I ocga
between yeah yeah there's gonna be
nothing happening there but we'll be
there computex isn't that Papa copy tax
like buckle up it's gonna be a crazy
couple of months yeah I guarantee you
that I guarantee you that we're gonna
see a pad phone for ad copy cuts mark my
words we'll wait has the PadFone three
hit the market yet that's why we're
gonna see a bad phone yeah exactly I
bought them all which is why they didn't
hit the market I'll get in my apartment
and I regret nothing I'm really got
fully on the brain like because like
plugging in a phone is stupid it should
just be do it over wireless it should
just magically won't be in your pocket
and work well that like that's the most
obvious use of NFC ever like if you just
walk in tap your phone and sit down uh
yeah that that would be amazing right
that's not the convergence device that
these people are talking about or at
least what i read it is they're talking
about that looking what thought Heinz
has been saying for so long is that
we've got these laptop great processors
and graphics processing units and
amounts of RAM in our phone and why can
it power all these other things unless
there's some like wireless technology
that I'm not aware of I mean if you're
going to be doing all the processing
level on your phone uh NFC your
bluetooth isn't really going to cut it
as a bridge to another device well I see
it just for the pairing but then it uses
Wi-Fi director you know so they're crazy
like there's plenty of wireless
standards and there's more coming that
would be able to have that kind of
bandwidth it's more an issue of battery
life but lining the standard no but but
still nobody especially in the age of
like family plan or scheme that family
plans mobile share and cloud computing
no one is presented a cognizant argument
to me as to why out we should be trying
so hard to converge our phone with
anything like give me a tablet give me a
phone let me live my life I don't need
to because verizon and ATT charge you
twenty dollars a month or ten dollars a
month just to connect your tablet hey
Dan imagine the AT&amp;amp;T Death Star
sunglasses coming down deal with it okay
so I have to say um ok so at WWDC we
should we should talk about Apple a
little bit we're gonna see new versions
of iOS and rumors are going around nine
to five Mac did it wsj did a little bit
for them that it's definitely to be
flattered all new icons maybe more
glanceable information basically all the
unicorn dreams we've been hoping for for
iOS have been put it out there as
possible features and then improved
looks on it I mean I genuinely believe
that they're gonna they're they're going
to try and make iOS 7 look better and
they're like right now the rumor is that
we're still going to have the grid Oh
icons is the home screen because that's
real and familiar but if they can
genuinely do something with Notification
Center and genuinely do something about
either multitasking or glanceable
information I think there'd be a really
big deal well and I think if Apple's
smart there they have to be really aware
of this because like this this running
narrative is you know apples lost its
touch iOS is boring they can't do
anything interesting you know Scott
Forstall is out and now it's like Johnny
I've is here too he's you know that the
White Knight coming in to save the day
and he's literally at night yeah that's
that's it he's white sooo so so there's
been that narrative but in reality it
hasn't really affected iOS device sales
has it because you know we had apples
financial report recently and they're
selling more iphones every single
quarter than they did the previous right
but i think what what's gonna be
interesting about WWDC is I think if
Apple doesn't do what everyone wants
them to do I think this might be when
things like when people actually start
to be rightly upset and start to you
know look elsewhere on because this is
where we're kind of at the point where
like they've run out of excuses like
Johnny I have is supposed to be the best
in business they're leaking all the
right things they're talking about all
the right things on but and then if they
don't come out and do what we want them
to do then what like I'm waiting for
WWDC and if they don't do what I want
them to do I'm gonna go buy an android
phone and I can't imagine I'm the only
person like I have this and I'll get rid
of it if they don't fix know
modifications and give me widgets but
vine David how can you go to a platform
without mine so yeah there's that you
get coming down you know the little new
banner when you download an app before
for the first time i downloaded vine
like three months ago and it still has
the little new banner on it I've never I
don't know you're missing yeah yeah so
harnessing vines front-facing camera
vines all rights office am i okay wait
now now I'm gonna get into vine okay no
idea what you guys just signed up for I
mean I feel like with regards to you
know the people are upset the apple
doesn't do I at people have been upset
at like Apple not doing what they want
forever right like it took five
generations to get a notification center
of any sort uh and you know every
quarter apple sold more iphones in the
last so I when it affects the bottom
line and I could see like a decline in
sales and totally but i know i don't
know if it's come that's really going to
do it people are happy with their
iphones yeah but if I mean critically
Jony ive is in charge now like David
said I mean like internally the game has
changed even if they're they're not
concerned about the bottom line and and
that you know the trajectory of the
product and the company which frankly
they don't have a ton of reason to be
considering their circumstances I think
that it was enough of a shake-up so that
you're going to see I mean Johnny I've
is is is perhaps the most influential
industrial designer of the past 25 years
at this point and clearly he's going to
want to put his fingerprint all over
this software and we've heard countless
rumors literally Johnny I fingerprint
instead of black metal you'll have
squirrels well there's those rumors that
there will be a fingerprint sensor on
the 5s I you fingers up fingers my
daughter I I don't believe that for a
second by the way that it's like that
that is the most samsung thing that
Apple and we also saw how well the
fingerprint sensor worked out for
motorola with the game matrix but but so
you know III think that he is going to
be looking at what we heard countless
rumors that that he hated force
all and and hated is it the the
direction that he was taking the
platform so I thoroughly believe pretty
much everything that 9to5 mac is
reporting about about iOS 7 right now I
hope so yeah I'm actually really excited
because I can switch back to my my my
iphone and me night you know I've been
using it quite a bit but you know I've
got this orange phone man I want to show
it off be cool so I don't know what else
quick Google now is on the iphone and
it's like it's not that good like it's
pretty it's weird that they got the
cards at the bottom it it things it
turns on your location thing so it's not
running GPS all the time but because it
checks location in the background it
looks like you're you're sucking down
your battery and I guess it probably
pulls it down a bit more but it doesn't
do background notifications it doesn't
do doesn't you know pink notification so
it's just sort of like there are some
cards there if you want to look at them
which for some reason just that little
difference of like you've got to go look
for them make some way less compelling
yeah it is on Android yeah the fact that
it doesn't do any sort of notifications
kind of blows my mind like I would have
expected it to do something you know the
notifications on Android are very
passive I guess is passive as a
notification possibly be because yes
show up in your notification center
without really like making the phone
vibrate or sing or whatever but there's
none of that on iOS so unless I think to
actively open the app and check it you
know it just my life carries on yeah oh
no a pelada earnings we talked about
earlier and on the call Tim Cook well he
did a couple of things that was weird
one he kept talking about the iphone 4
and then he also said that he would not
make a bigger iphone a iphone of the
bigger display unless he could solve all
the trade-offs that everybody else is
willing to make the biggest one was
probably you know app design uh so if i
think it pretty much shut down the
rumors of a larger screen iphone no
although I disagree but the binary BPD
bah I would not put a pass in to be to
be able to come out and say we all these
terrible trade-offs we solved it because
we're
we're amazing exactly but that that's
exactly the same thing happened that
happened with netbooks uh you know the
exact same verbiage that Steve Jobs
always use from netbooks and then we
finally got the 11-inch MacBook Air I
think we're gonna have this same it just
like really stretching the definition of
a netbook because you're comparing a two
hundred fifty dollar computer with a
thousand-dollar computer but yeah but
but I would shocked if we saw it this
year because just because just this fall
was the first bigger iPhone that's ever
happened so I'd actually been really
surprised if the very next generation
was even larger um right but you know
and that doesn't rule it out for
something further than one yeah could
they do like a 1024 x 768 big 4 by 3
iphone would that be the worst thing
ever and then just use like ipad apps
the same great ideal i need you have you
have you ever used a 4 by 3 phone yes is
awful i put something on into picture
goes i think of the pantech pocket and
then of course the LG vue and home of
the novel hey I don't hate on the
pantech pocket was awesome massage your
keys ergonomically like I ergonomically
incorrect devices ever it was such a
piece everything about it from the skin
to the materials to the shape the shape
of just a layered like I couldn't help
but law every time I pull the phone but
don't you want to live in the future
we're like you're carryin like crazy
like dip like not all devices need to be
uh you know the the standard aspect
ratio of a phone like a bunch of us are
trying to hang on I'm hang on i'm
watching Star Trek next generation like
Hulu put together this playlist where
you could automatically queue up all of
the queue episodes in aalborg episodes
and not watch the rest of this stuff so
I'll link rinding through yeah it's
great so I'm like grinding through a
whole bunch of old-school Star Trek next
generation shows and like they're
holding like the tricorder and their
phaser and like man we used to imagine a
future where we like made devices of
different sizes and we're not doing that
anymore like everything looks like this
you know everything looks like this like
like come on like I've got you know a
couple other extra inches I could you
know extend I hear you need er uh Anna
and you know
mixing it up would be great and and new
devices and designs maybe something to
flexible the screen and make our dreams
come true with that but you know the
fundamental problem with the view and
the pocket is that if you ever try to
ease it with one hand it was an absolute
nightmare like it just use a holster man
that's it that you want to start Trek
just a lot of good ideas here dear you
know it's even worse than try to use a
note to with one hand because it's like
there's they were just so wide and so
ridiculous okay so so we're all going to
be using square open webOS devices and
holsters is what I'm oh my god yes that
is exactly what I will mean yeah I can't
wait you should go if you haven't
precentral I'm sorry webos nation has
the the Windsor knot photos of the
winter not oh so you can go look I love
that is like the best code name ever
yeah anyone ever though the Windsor was
the pre three this is not the Windsor it
someone's or not um anyway um there's a
whole bunch of I guess we should we've
got a bunch of their like random stuff
to grind through and we've been gone for
almost an hour but I we do need to talk
about some carrier stuff looks like the
t mobile metropcs merger years ago I
mean does anybody have anything
interesting to say about that week I
mean I hate to not point it out yeah the
only thing I would say about that is
that you know this this doesn't change
the game for tmobile just allows them to
proceed with what they basically been
promising for the past six months terms
of their their LTE rollout so it's you
know this is effectively the status quo
and it's what you know what they've been
staying would happen so right we are um
and meanwhile like the clearwire sprint
softbank dish fiasco still won't die
like there's still stories coming out
about softbank says it's okay for sprint
to change their agreements like in Simon
and da with dish to talk about their
thing for clearwire and then clearwire
borrow some money asos print is more
likely to be able to do the buyouts of
dish named and they're like it's just it
continues and like if we get a
definitive like sprint spying clearwire
softbank its sprint by the end of May
like I'm taking the rest of
the year off because there's nothing
left okay i right I'm done um so anyway
that's coming and then verizon is trying
to buy the rest of the wireless unit out
from vodafone but they're arguing over
the pricing hundred billion offer
Vodafone thinks it's worth a hundred
twenty or thirty or something what's up
no what's 30 billions right yeah well
from so that's all happening but as long
as we're talking about like high level
stuff we should also mention that a
rumor has it that we're gonna have the
new FCC chairman to be guy named Tom
wheeler and like I don't know literally
nothing about this guy yeah before the
before we started the the show today I
think we we established three facts
about this man we do tia very quickly I
Wikipedia research it was the ctia
president before Steve Largent I think
who is the current so that press I mean
that gives me some serious paused right
I'm not I'm not a huge fan of the ctia
as a policy group like I hate going to
their conferences and having to sit
through their videos talking about how
evil taxes are on mobile carriers you
know I just don't believe the CTA has a
consumers best interest at heart well I
mean if they are a very very dress right
yeah right right but what always cracks
me up about the ctia is that you know
their their membership includes both
like you know 18 keep risin and also
these like microcarriers that sort of
like a thousand people so like they will
frequently abstain I'm like really hot
huge policy issues because they don't
want to piss off like you know half of
their membership so so like they end up
actually taking a hard line I'm like two
issues and like everything else are just
like you know whatever and they would
they wave their hands they are good for
telling us how many text messages have
been sent every year though yes they are
very effective at that so yeah he used
to be the cja president he was for the
AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile merger which is arguably
not a good sign and what was the third
fat
we knew one more thing about he was a
lobbyist yes I am and apparently he we
have a UH a Robertson wrote a good piece
on our site about that uh and he sounds
like he's very much not a surprise and
it has sort of been the de facto first
name they came up ever since Jenna
Cassie step down uh and he was part of
the obama presidential transition effort
and so it's guys like he's been around
and even though it's weird people are
like worried about him it seems like but
it's just sort of gonna happen anyway
well not also he's Obama's pic so i
can't like i would not associate like a
super pro big business guy is being like
obama's first pick to run the FCC so
maybe there's there's some part of the
story that we don't know yeah yeah well
and I mean like opinions are mixed out
like like pop acknowledged seems to like
him free press doesn't so I like I don't
we'll just have to see uh but I mean the
other thing is like now that the t
mobile ATT merger fell through like
other than like may allocating spectrum
I mean I guess there might be some crazy
thing happening to sprint because
there's always some crazy thing happened
to sprint that he might have to preside
over but I mean it's pretty always tied
up in drama what are the giant totally
screw over the consumer from the
wireless industry perspective things
that you expect the FCC is going to be
weighing in on next few years uh so
there's auctions coming up for spectrum
they really screw the pooch on the 700
megahertz one and that's really weird
feeling the hurts of that now because
you can't use your ATT LG phone on
Verizon in vice versa so if that doesn't
get sorted out properly then yeah we
could really definitely feel negative
effects with consumer if it goes in the
interest of the businesses and the
companies that will be using it as it
did with 700 makers block right right
uh-uh motorola if they lost a patent
case against Microsoft and so like
instead of getting four million a year
they're getting like
what like 170 million or something
ridiculous yeah might as well like six
dollars yes a click so if you haven't
read and realized piece about why why
does anybody know why google bought
motorola um it seems like all the
answers that have been floated like if
these were the reasons they were really
bad reasons that Google should have
known better well you know I was just
thinking about this the other night yeah
if Google had not bought Motorola how
much longer could they have survived as
as an independent maker of phones
because like what do they do well I
don't I don't know exactly how much
money they had in the bank but since
google bought them they've lost money
every single core yeah so I just can't
wait for like Google's spring cleaning
announcement 2016 have a one line that
says the clothes motorola down we're
closing or could and oh by the way we're
care less about that than they did about
google reader oh that's a sad but you
know but I mean you know maybe if you
never know it's google they could very
easily uh rejuvenate that division and
do some cool things with this rumored X
phone that we keep hearing about uh this
year who knows yeah I mean isn't that
enough like if Google does if they do
come out with this you know stock phone
that's durable and just the right size
on it doesn't seem like it would be that
hard for Google to justify this 12.5
billion dollar purchase if they like
actually want to make a real play and
Android hardware uh well I don't though
they don't think they want they would
have to be hugely profitable and hugely
successful for quarter like a long
string of quarters in order to make back
that 12.5 but they wouldn't and that's
the beauty of being owned by Google is
google just makes so much money off of
other things that they can just kind of
do whatever they want and like this is
an easy way for google to start making
cool phones that like Larry Page can now
carry around the Googleplex and like
maybe that's worth 12.5 billion dollars
to Larry Page uh and if it is then you
know I'm happy for him and I'll probably
buy his phone
uh but i don't know i mean this this
patent war thing is is increasingly
interesting and does seem to be kind of
a giant swing and a Miss from google and
motorola but I mean until Dave what did
they say it was an 18-month product line
that they acquired for motorola until
they've exhausted that and sort of seen
what comes next I don't know you're
currently being trolled by a ross miller
there uh-huh the nice tie Ross was
wearing I was really trying to read what
his card said I believe it said hello
yeah that's good yeah is that although
those cue cards necessary for when he
does does 90 seconds the first one oh
yeah Ross can't remember anything russ
has coupons for Brazil were there one
rave heart is it's like the box video
Muller shoot takes a very long time but
we love Ross so we do it it took kind we
do love Ross we do we miss him I've got
on the show we totally should in fact
yes let's book it next month he's gonna
be captive um so I'm looking at Motorola
site right now so I was secretly hoping
that they still made they don't appear
to you but until very recently they were
still offering a windows mobile 6.5
device through sprint um I just like it
gives me it gives me great pleasure
knowing that google makes the windows
mobile 6.5 device but I don't think they
actually sell dameware I think they
finally just commuted however both the
razr maxx HD and the razr HD are webtop
compliant which I did not know what is
oh man i still like bluetooth crap to
the motorola sonic writer chris loves
his motorola bluetooth crab yeah the s11
is like hands down the best stereo
bluetooth headset on the market right
now that's true actually that is
definitely true maybe they should google
should get into headphones yeah just as
your 12 to five billion dollars right
drop all this other stuff just get into
headphones also that's 11 supports
optics which i really wish the iphone
had but it doesn't could you imagine a
google glass device like designed by
motorola it would be like all giant and
Kevlar and heavy i would just like slice
your brandon happen it would have liked
instead of the little tiny little screen
thing that the glass has now it was just
like cover your whole lie yeah wait a
second hold on hold on hang on wait it
looks like motorola does this can't be
through mobility but they're selling
baby monitors through why motorola
mobility's motorola makes some of the
highest rated baby monitors on the
market you would know being that your
bear you're the only parent on the yeah
you know there there there little pricey
but if you're in the range of a few
hundred dollars for your baby monitor I
think Motorola's like one of the best
ones you can do they run web top oh no
they should mmm that's a missed
opportunity right there seriously like
this super high-end one this uh MBP 36
remote wireless video baby monitor looks
like a like a full-on like tablet yeah
it like they're like three and a half
inch or four inch screens it's like yeah
I definitely I definitely want to play
three birds on this baby monitor Chris
you should have kids and then boom there
you go do you really need kids to buy
baby monitor is a key to buy baby
monitor if you drive it what are you
gonna monitor like your plants yeah I
don't know she's gonna check in with a
myer run on monitors I'm gonna monitor
myself and I would monitor myself I'm
gonna turn the camera facing me anyway
