thought as well uh we're just calling it
multiplayer VR you're not calling in
limbo so project tango if you don't
remember is this crazy Google project
where they stick sensors and cameras on
a tablet and it's able to map space in
real time and know where it is inside
that space we first saw it about a year
ago at the last i/o and since then
Johnny Lee and his team have been up to
some pretty wild stuff so we have a
pre-existing floor map of this room
where we know are all the conference
rooms are and what we can do is say hey
we've just entered our building and that
lobby and we want to get to the
ping-pong room and so just follow the
earth indoor navigation is actually
really challenging problems still GPS
doesn't work people try to do Bluetooth
beacons Wi-Fi mapping only goes so far
magnetic mapping only goes so far and
there's an are number of use cases that
would be enabled if you just had perfect
indoor positioning to some degree I
think there's a bit of anthropomorphism
and that this is what people do right
you could take you to a brand new
building and you could start to learn
your way around and I think once we can
give our devices that same ability will
that will become more parity to human
perception lo and behold we're at the
market kitchen we're very interested in
building that core tech and partnering
with companies such as IO for one one
which is a company that does planogram
data for companies like Walgreens right
and they can do navigation directly to a
product in the store if they knew where
the customer was and we could
essentially build the core tech for
enabling those type of experiences
without having to load up the the
Walgreens is like a million sensors to
tell that's right here at the phone it's
just
so this is just our IO prep room or just
using it to practice okay so let me show
you just a couple of apps where project
tango does is try to revisit what these
devices could do if you add additional
hardware and software to them basically
start exploring this idea well what is a
3d mouse look like if you were to take
that device and be able to use the whole
world as your interface right so just
like a turn left and right we can walk
around and I can just sort of move
around the room and it continues to
track its position and then the bottom
line you can see it's also tracking Z so
it's full 3d tracking so it's a new
class of apps that very much starts a
drift in the direction of the ER and AR
but it's in a form factor that's
currently in Evans this is kind of an
homage to the games that you can you
know virtual building and build up the
walls and make a door frame like that
yeah so you can walk around it and if
you actually squat down you can go
inside the house so we could have built
a slightly bigger house that's already
done that one is just that kind of quick
and dirty but you could imagine like you
can put castles on one part of your
living room and go to your bedroom and
build another part of your virtual world
so let me let's walk over here because
what we're going to do is we're going to
put a car in the room okay it's actually
challenging with tango one of the things
that we do have trouble with is
sometimes estimating the absolute size
of things because it doesn't know about
what a normal car looks like what a
normal door looks right we're just
making pure numerical observations about
the scene right size is arbitrary it so
just it just saw the room was like well
a car will fit in there and it put a car
in it'll try to put the car in the room
regardless of how big it is
so this is just using pure open-loop
tracking and then you can change the
color of the seats and the dash trim if
you look at the modern mobile phone
today it's it's for the most part
stabilized like the feature set that's
in it basically there's incremental
changes now in that particular form
factor when project tango does is try to
revisit what these devices could do if
you add additional hardware and software
to them and where we are and where what
is around us has a pretty fundamental
impact over how we live our daily lives
we roughly understand how big this room
is and our own physical relationship
with each other and if these devices
understood how to do that you could then
make apps that could do things like it
could measure the size of your couch and
measure the size of your room you can
play games that actually use the shape
of your house as part of the game level
I've just put that box in front of us
and it's using the depth sensor to
actually capture the shape of the box
right and I can just tap the screen to
throw balls and try to play basketball
and I just move the tablet around it
starts to build a 3d mesh of the whole
room and we can actually bounce balls
off of his head okay one of the
interesting things about this is that
you start thinking about games that you
design procedurally because you don't
know actually the users living room size
yeah so you have to figure out a game
mechanic that actually can dynamically
adjust to any room size or furniture
shape we started stacking pillows and
like dripping out blankets because you
can actually start to build forts that
actually work in the game room oh so
okay yeah so it's sort of this belief
that you know just like GPS everyone was
fine before GPS came out right nowadays
you wouldn't consider buying a phone
without GPS and we hope to see tango
kind of reach the same level of adoption
which is we're fine today but once you
have the tech you have it enable so many
new things it just becomes ubiquitous
right where are you just tricking it
down and it's a matter of shrinking it
down or are you imagining there's other
sensors that need to be invented the the
core
our sensor suite may evolve in their
form one day they might combine as the
technology involves but that basic
sensor suite is everything you would
need to do ubiquitous six degree freedom
tracking we are continuing to invest in
shrinking the technology and making it
actually primarily power efficient until
you can ultimately get into something
like this and so these are all steps
toward a future that those tango classes
not quite yet maybe maybe one day so a
standard Android phone uses the gyro and
accelerometer to do rotation so you can
pivot your head but this one allows you
to actually walk through the space Oh so
I oh yeah so the bubbles are like where
their school okay so you can walk into
the bubbles right Wow Wow they're just
right there and they stay where they're
supposed to be so what's going on is
that his his tablet is acting as a
hotspot host okay and all we do is we
connect to that hotspot and we get
connected to his VR space uh we can
listen I sort of say hi to each other
hello hello oh my god how are you I'm
terrified oh and so are you if we get
close enough ah so remember you can
actually run around the world and yeah
it's definitely thank you so let me just
ask the question that is most important
right now for VR which is we've seen
lots of little bite-sized experiences
lots a little like oh this is fun to try
for ten minutes and it's like okay now
I'm done and now finally stuff is
starting to come out next year in real
way for consumers do you believe that
we're going to see stuff that isn't just
a fun little game to play for five
minutes
hi are anytime soon like if everything
feels like it's like still like not much
past demo yeah I think what the
challenge is that right now everyone's
just doing dev kits and low volume
platforms but as the volume start to
grow the economic start to make more
sense for real production houses to
focus on it even like in the early days
of movies you'll have like simple test
clips but then once people feel like
there's actually a viable platform to
target you'll see higher production
things is my guess which I think will be
fun like super duper fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
