amazing screen and almost all of them
have LTE but one of the last features
where a manufacturer can truly
distinguish itself is the camera we
decided to test for the best stones the
Nokia Lumia 920 the HTC One the iphone 5
and the nexus 4 let's see how they stack
up so all four of these phones do a
pretty good job in pretty good condition
slightly overcast outside plenty of
light not a huge amount of contrast of
the scene we've got detail and the tires
we've got detail on the paint on the bus
and on the gravel itself and the photos
are yo balance there's a wide range of
tones and everything's pretty sharp so
out of the four phones we tested it's
safe to say the Lumia 920 wasn't the
worst but it was a little weird
in almost every single scene the
saturation was through the roof there's
definitely a lot of processing happening
right on the phone before you even get
to see the image bright colors for
example the pictures of my shoes looking
down as at the grade on the sidewalk the
bright colors in my shoes and pants were
blown out shooting up into the sky
through the trees if you compare the
blue sky and the Lumias photos to the
other phones I think you'll see that the
HTC One and the iphone 5 and even to
some extent the nexus 4 they look a lot
more natural to me the Lumia 920 just
looks not real at all another thing I've
noticed about the Lumia 920 is that when
I look at these images zoomed in even
with the ones that were taken outside
with a huge amount of light they're
noisy almost every single image that we
pulled off of the Lumia 920 is noisy
image quality on the HTC One was decent
the biggest problem with the HTC One is
that in any sufficiently bright
environment the photos are washed out
regardless of where the light source is
coming from there's just not enough
contrast in the images as a person who
spends most of his time shooting with an
SLR in my opinion the iPhone 5 is the
best all-around cell phone camera that
we tested today noise levels across all
the photos taken to the iphone 5 were
generally good in low-light photos sure
there was noise but the noise looked
real for lack of a better term it didn't
look mushy it didn't look like software
was doing everything it could to
mitigate the noise the iphone does a
great job of striking a balance between
accuracy and a photo and giving you a
useful file at the end of the day dark
scenes are dark but they also look real
bright scenes of the sky buildings trees
things like that sure they're bright but
they're not blown out and there's plenty
of contrast and there's still some
detail in the shadows the nexus 4 while
not terrible was sort of right down the
middle decidedly averaged images from
the nexus 4 they lack contrast sometimes
they almost always look compressed
there's a high amount of noise in lots
of images it just looks like the photo
was taken with a cell phone camera so
one of the most common use cases for a
cell phone camera today is going to be a
place where the lights terrible you're
in a bar you're in a restaurant you're
out with friends the HTC One produced
really bright picture is that it didn't
look like a low light situation but they
were really noisy and really mushy but
it was a usable photo and in small sizes
it might work the nexus 4 was useless in
low-light worse than useless completely
useless just leave it in your pocket and
use your memory the Lumia 920 did a
pretty good job with a low light photo
but our subject wasn't moving and I can
tell based on my multiple tries the 920
absolutely favors a slower shutter speed
in low-light situations which means if
you're photographing anything that's
alive you're going to have some trouble
low-light photos from the 920 are noisy
just like any other cell phone camera
but it was also clear as usual that
there's a tremendous amount of
processing happening on the phone before
we even get the images onto a computer
the iphone 5s low-light photos are the
most true to life the the light and the
colors are as I remember them they're
generally pretty sharp but they are also
very noisy cell phones are better than
ever and everyone these days has a great
computer in their pocket and it's only a
matter of time before cameras catch up
but until that happens and probably
after that happens photography is going
to continue to be a game of compromises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
