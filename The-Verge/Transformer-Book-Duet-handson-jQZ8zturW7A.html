2014 in Las Vegas and I'm taking a look
at the brand new Transformer book duet
from Asus the company's describes this
is the first four in one the device and
the reason it says that is because
Windows laptop an Android laptop and an
Android tablet and a windows tablet this
is always switching button it takes
approximately four seconds as a sous to
switch between Android and Windows and
now we're looking at the Android UI and
if we press the button again we switch
back to Windows now asus won't really
tell us how it's doing this but it says
it's one of the first genuine do West
devices it says it's it's own
proprietary technology that's using I've
been taking a look at this it has a 13
inch display looking at the battery when
it stopped into the keyboard up I get a
promise of 10 hours initially now I'm
getting promise of six hours so that's
not terribly reliable but anyhow the
important thing is you can undock the
display from the keyboard and then what
you're faced with is a 13 inch tablet
13.3 inch tablet as a full HD resolution
this this one in particular is also a
1300 by 700 resolution version which is
100 oz cheaper that one is 599 the
Google h3 699 we available at the end of
march in the united states as well as
globally the processor inside is an
intel haswell it goes all the way up to
4 I seven there's no webcam or any
camera on the back there's a
front-facing camera at the front which
kind of really makes sense because for
such a large tablet or laptop however
you look at it you're not really going
to take a lot of high resolution shots
in terms of storage you get 64 gigabytes
in the tablet for 128 gigabytes again
that's probably going to raise the price
of the device and also in the dock you
could get 320 500 750 otero gigabytes or
a terabyte of storage on top of oil
games have itself the display is an IPS
display quite traditional for a sous
it's relatively thick we've got a
selection of course down here at the
bottom here for
Jack docking button there's a power key
hello and I brings us into the window
well actually it's not a power keys is a
windows button tucked away at the bottom
so this is the first polling one device
is it describes it it looks good it has
that concentric circles design on the
back and it is quite intriguing the
always switching is indeed very quick
but we need to spend a bit more time
with it to get a good idea of how useful
would actually ends up being in practice
and also first look at it here at CES
