2014 we're taking a look at the census
case looks like a normal rubber case but
adds these pressure-sensitive strips on
the side and on the back so that certain
apps can sense what you're pushing on in
this app we can see that the iphone is
able to tell where you're pushing and
how hard you're pushing the red dots
here mean that you're pushing harder and
the green ones mean it's lighter this is
kind of reminiscent of the PS Vita
skills meeting is a capacitive touch
sensor on the back this is in the
capacitive they're saying its
proprietary technology another tha less
is pretty similar your other apps here
that they're just demo apps they say
using the camera you can just pinch on
the side to take a picture there's a
scale as well we tried to test out the
scale we're going to put this lens on
and see how happy it is 0.35 out and
then let's put this other lens own I
measured 0.21 out as you can see unlike
other apps on here this isn't just a
tech demo the company actually says that
they expect this ship with this app on
here otherwise all these demo apps are
made by census just to show off the case
they're hoping that they can get more
developers on board for other apps in
the future the case is supposed to go on
sale by the end of the year it should
cost around ninety nine dollars
