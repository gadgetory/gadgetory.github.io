World Congress 2015 in Barcelona and
here we have the LG watch urbane LTE
which is a completely new SmartWatch
from LG it's based on webOS as opposed
to the Android wear device that the
company is really so far and here's how
it works
so you have the basic watch face here
and if you push this button you get
taken to a list of apps and in fact it
makes use of the circular display in a
way that Android wear it doesn't really
kind of it's still a bit more natural to
scroll through these things there's
three buttons on the edge this one is a
quick settings you can push it and you
know adjust the brightness and so on and
right here you have a back button to
take you back out of the app that you've
entered so what does this thing have
well as there's a whole bunch of stuff
there's this is a Korean video platform
there's a kind of a voice assistant that
you can you take your contacts the help
tracking app go cycling app a golfer
there's a whole bunch of stuff this is
like this is very much a gadget there's
a lot you can do on this one so the most
important feature I guess is the
built-in LTE connectivity this is the
world's first belt II SmartWatch
according to LG and what it means in
practice is that this bullet actually
can operate independently from a
smartphone instead of constantly needing
to be tethered from it so you can make
phone calls on this there's like there's
a full-on keypad you can talk to people
walkie talkie styling groups you can
check your email sort of when you're
even when you're away from your
smartphone so unlike Android wear which
is like built around the idea of just
pinging and notifications and so on from
your phone to the second screen this is
really kind of more of an independent
device in its own right downside of that
of course is that you'll need a second
data plan for it you're probably paying
a lot more per month if you have this
running alongside a smartphone but we
actually don't know a lot about the
release plans for this thing it's only
being confirmed for a Korean release
with one carrier
and it should be coming in the middle of
months but no pricing details or
anything of being announced yet so
you'll just have to hold on and wait to
see whether the thing will make it to
the US but it's pretty cool if you're
into the idea of a very hot core gadget
focus Maxwell lurch this seems to be one
of the best ones yet there's a lot you
can do in it LT has clearly you know
made an effort to actually make a new
watch OS rather than sort of trying to
ping things from the phone to do the
watch but I don't know it's not the most
intuitive thing to use and it's kind of
bulky okay I don't think I could wear
this under a shirt Bolin wearing a shirt
inhabitant sleeves are rolled up but
it's alright it's it's definitely gonna
be a nice product but for what it is it
is kind of cool
so LG also has an on LTE version of the
watch urbane this one is just called the
LG watch urbane and it runs Android wear
which means that it is pretty much the
same as every other Android wear watch
functionally you can you know it has all
the pedometer functions and so on and
it's you know very Google fade in
interface it's a little more focused on
what LG calls luxury experience then a
other Android wear watch is it's made of
stainless steel there are gold and
silver finishes the strap is made of
stitched leather it's a it's not as
bulky at the LTE version it's a little
you know fits a bit better on the wrist
although it's still being a fairly big
watch by what standard I mean it's it
doesn't feel anywhere is nice like
full-on luxury watch obviously but it's
you know four reported is it does the
job we don't know anything about
availability or price but you know
should be coming around the world LG
filters and so that was the LG watch
urbane and the watch urbane LTE</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
