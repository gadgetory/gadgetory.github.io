show for a second so you know I think
when you start I'll be honest I think
people were like Jimmy Fallon yeah socks
is hard to replace a guy like Conan
O'Brien is fantastic and he's he's done
his show for 16 years so he's he's a
comfortable face in your living room for
16 years you right went to school with
him you know I was in college witnessed
Monaco no no what basically he was on
Mike you were on my door yeah yeah yeah
that and Price is Right that's all I
watched it's a weird combo I love prices
right learned so much about the value of
things I was just telling you I didn't
have to you know wasn't those shows you
had to follow on the plot you know right
price is right you can watch whatever
the hell you like so following that it's
not the easiest thing I mean so and I
didn't know how to do a talk show I'm
just starting out I don't know it's it's
tricky because it's just it's talking
yeah it's corny but it's but it's it's
like you worry about those things you're
asking questions and like I had Robert
De Niro on as my first guest who is the
the greatest actor in the world I love
that guy so much and I just asked him a
favor if he would do it and he said okay
but he's I mean I don't want insult the
man yeah not a great interview though I
mean that's my 27th but that's what I
knew that going in right maybe I could
be the guy that cracks it yeah because
it is kind of like it is like a stone
he's kind of like he gives you a lawyer
doesn't like the top yeah Oh your
buddies at on Iran he's nice enough to
come on the show and he comes on and I
had my questions I'll set up may have
probably six minutes to talk to Robert
you know six minutes doesn't seem like a
lot but it is it's just especially when
you're flopping like I was and I go to
rob him like so so you live in New York
right and he goes yep okay and then I'm
like and you could hear people like
unwrapping candies
they flop sweat yeah it was I was so
scared the nurse shows terrifying me
it's hot and like that audience when
it's quiet in there I mean it's the same
in here you guys are terrifying who
wanted to why I learned this like I had
a few episodes ago I demoed the series
every time you have a great time you
always know but it was horrible I was
like a little copter up and almost broke
a light and almost fell on someone they
sued I was aiming for you but yeah but
DeNiro
yeah but anyways so uh so any was like I
barely scraped through it and I love
Robert DeNiro for just taking the chance
to come on the show when it was brand
new he no one else has the guts to do
something like that like I just really
will never forget those like that first
week of booking is so hard when you have
a new show and just like if you ever get
a chance to see any Robert De Niro
movies go do it because the guy's the
greatest human he's a good actor great
guy and that was like so I that was my
first interview and that kind of after
that I was just so nervous and the
reviews were correct you know they
weren't a hundred positive but you've
but you've grown this showing I actually
feel like you guys are doing some of the
smartest and I'm not just saying this
because I go on the show occasionally
but it's some of the smartest weirdest
funniest comedy on late-night and
there's a lot of late-night guys now
it's not like it used to be where
there's just two dudes yeah there's a
lot of people on and there's a lot of
really good comedy on late-night and you
guys are doing some of the it's just so
smart and so funny well thank you we're
all so late so it's like no one really
cares at the network no that's another
yes I mean I think you can watch our
show what our ultimate goal is were very
positive person so I want people to have
a fun experience when they watch our
show and I think it's the end of the day
so if you had a bad day if life sucks
you still have a TV you got 30 seconds
of not worrying about your life that's
then that's the best gift you're like
the answer to the one percent really
you're gonna be the cure you know we
actually put together we put together a
couple of uh moments from the show that
we thought were really great because if
you guys haven't seen it you should see
it and I wanted to show it here so just
take a look at this you can get an idea
of just how
good and funny Jimmy show yes yeah this
is not my show yeah this is it
oh my goodness maybe you are you doing a
sketch yes I am laptop Macintosh
PowerBook pepper bill no Zenith it's
just a laugh Andy it's just a laugh
no it's just a laptop yes well it is now
tony danza takes to the Broadway stage
to rekindle the magic that was who's the
boss in an uproarious one-man show
Samantha
Jonathan Angela Mona remember the time
Tony had to miss the big game man oh man
the championship game I can't wait
Jonathan and the time Tony caught Angela
dating his best friend I think you guys
were shooting in HD at this point video
camera can you tell me what's going on
there that was a that was not Late Night
with Jimmy I was in college in Albany in
New York and as a show called 40 whacks
W on the Playboy Network it was a show
we started and just like a bunch of
college kids got together and like try
to admit characters and I I just had a
Tony Danza impression I just figured
good he's still watching you got the
essence of dances well I just on who's
the boss he would say everyone's name
the same like Mona
Samantha Angela
Jonathan exasperated oh my goodness yeah
we're gonna add a lot of laughing
where's the deal with music like you I
feel like you do a ton of music stuff on
the show like you performing music and
you did
when you're on SNL by the way if you
haven't seen his SNL I think best one of
the season Thanks so funny that was
really really funny show and there's a
lot of you there a lot of music sketches
on it you do a lot of music stuff on the
show I feel like you're like you wanted
to be a rock guy and like you were you
just ended up I mean you may be wrong
you were also funny in like it was I
could go either way but yeah I'm like
your Neil Young it sounds like Neil
Young I just I like I like thanks I like
just like listen to music that's like
one of my favorite things so I like when
I started as an impressionist so I would
do impressions of Jerry Seinfeld or I
started doing music in college I added
like you know at the time was like Dave
Matthews Band or something or like
things like that so then as when I got
to Sarah live I would do impressions and
musical impressions so now that I have
my own show it's like I get to fill up
an hour so if we have a thing like Tim
Tebow and I have a David Bowie
impression you know some writer just
puts the guns like we should create a
man called Tebowing lightning ball and
I'm wearing the Broncos Jersey no mic
Tim Tebow - geez
tim tebow - Jesus Christ
it's can't win by myself but with your
help am i super fun you guys did it yeah
I gotta say I I really appreciate you
guys having me here and I love the set
it looks so good the Lighting's good the
camera works here your crew is amazing
backstage but if you don't mind I love
the interest music that you had and I
would like to just take it out with the
little break dancing right here because
this reminds me of like a nice you know
I actually wrote that you did yeah you
did write the music you want the intro
music crank it up can we get the intro
music for Jimmy just couldn't be done so
as you possibly can we're not a very
technically advanced stereo
yeah
party I think that's a good place and
adjustable here we get down everybody
everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
