right it may be too expensive than what
they'd like to pay you know they may
feel like you know 500 channels nothing
is on I mean there's some frustrations
but at the core of it TV doesn't is not
broken so I don't think that even a
device like like boxy that comes with
the new user experience you know and you
take on on DVR it's not overnight
everybody is switching I think the the
traditional industry the incumbents they
have time to go through a graph you know
a gradual transition that is I think is
much easier than a then facing a cliff
I'm of neurone n and I'm the founder and
CEO of boxy and I have our new device
boxy TV it's a $99 box it has the
ability to watch live television either
through basic cable or antenna and it
has a dual tuner built in so it's not
only watched one shell live you can also
record two shows at once what's new and
amazing about this live er is that
there's no real stories on the box the
recordings are actually being uploaded
to the cloud and that means that this
box offers users the ability to record
how much they like and watch it on any
screen they like knowing that you can
just record whatever you fancy for me it
means I'm recording every Seinfeld
episode now every Simpsons episode it
changes the way you use DVR the other
thing we have obviously is you know some
key apps of Netflix we'll do YouTube
Pandora and so on we start a company in
New York and then my friend Tom was was
in Tel Aviv and then we got together
five of us three of us in Israel and two
of us here I moved here to New York in
1990 and of 99 beginning of 2000 I was
blown away by just the amount of
channels we didn't have that in you know
in Israel I always loved gadgets I
picked up the TiVo from Best Buy in
Union Square and that was you know it
like it was for many people which
completely changed the way I watch
television then in 2003 or 2004 I hooked
up the first PC to
to the TV it was running windows you
know media center and then Tom came from
Israel and I had the next box and he
modded my xbox and put XBMC on it and
that's where the bug settled and he said
you know this is so complicated we can
do something with it and make it more
accessible we wanted to make a boxy
device back in 2003 2004 and to us it
was clear that the product that would be
a great TV experience is no it's just
not enough it needs to be also a great
experience on on additional screens and
that means a completely different
architecture we came into this business
really from a product perspective not
from an industry perspective we weren't
as savvy about the different you know
interest and the way the machinations of
the business are actually working think
now we're much more sophisticated in our
view of the industry and I think we got
to know the industry much better and the
industry got to know us and we found out
there's places where we have
disagreement about the future of
television what users want but we have
also many places where we we actually
see eye to eye so I think we found a way
to be a bit disruptive but not
destructive what we're doing with the
boxy TV is groundbreaking in many fronts
I think on the cloud DVR it's a real
technology challenge that were able to
address but we think this is one
innovation in the media industry that is
going to be actually great for consumers
and great for the media industry as well
so we're very excited about it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
