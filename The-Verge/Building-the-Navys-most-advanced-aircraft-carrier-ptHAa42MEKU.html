technologically advanced and most
expensive ship ever built this weekend
the Navy christened that ship here in
Newport News Virginia while much of this
weekend's fanfare will surround the
christening
this is a project that has been going on
for four years and it won't be delivered
for another two so we came to Newport
News Virginia to see what the ship looks
like and what it might look like in the
future the USS Gerald Ford replaces what
the Navy called its Nimitz class
aircraft carriers a fleet of ten nuclear
warships designed in the late 1960s in
commissioned in May 1975 the Nimitz
class is still in operation but in 1996
Navy officials knew they'd need a new
ship for the 21st century the Navy
wanted the house at least 75 aircraft on
the new ship's deck and it wanted a
better nuclear energy system as designs
progressed those requests became more
precise and more numerous newport news
shipbuilding company work to turn those
requests into reality first the company
decided the Ford would use electricity
for power instead of steam in the Nimitz
class carrier I had a lot of service
team weather went to the laundry the
galley a lot of areas of the ship so
here we replaced all that with with
electrical powered systems so there's
less maintenance to do right those steam
pipes corrode you have to go do
maintenance on the valves and flush them
you know we cut them out replacing
overhauls here you won't have to do any
of that the cable this is designed to
last life of the ship very low
maintenance that would allow for a host
of new innovations four of those new
innovations stand out the first is
something called flexible infrastructure
architecture this is a modular design
concept so if the Navy wants to convert
a room from being a storage space into a
boardroom for example it can do that
without having to hire big crews to take
care of the work another innovation is
advanced weapons elevators relying on
electromagnetic fields instead of cables
these massive elevators can carry twice
as much material than their predecessors
so we have one less aircraft elevator
than Nimitz class this has three as
opposed to the four
all that was part of the design to
enhance flight deck usage so that's a
key aspect right that's what the carrier
does a third major change is the use of
an electromagnetic aircraft Launch
System known as Emil's these use an
electromagnetic field that catapult
aircraft into the sky
previous versions of these launchers use
steam and cables compared with their
predecessors emails are lighter smaller
more efficient and more reliable they
can also launch a fighter jet every 45
seconds and then there's the
multifunction radar known as a dual band
radar these combined the tools used for
big picture scans as well as precision
targeting in the past those activities
were completely separate now those two
pieces are the same this means fewer
radar antennas are spinning and fewer
people are required to keep tabs in the
ship surrounding missile this is a
design that has not been battle tested
that's a risk this is a boat that's
supposed to remain on the water for 50
years and it's a design that's supposed
to last for 80 but engineers are
confident that it will having greater
electrical power capacity you can bring
on new technologies for the life of the
ship it'll have enough air conditioning
and ventilation and electrical power so
that no matter how the technology
changes going forward which we may not
even know today we'll be able to upgrade
swap out and bring on that new
technology without having to change
infrastructure of the ship our
innovations like these worth 13 billion
dollars which is the amount of money
taxpayers are expected to spend on the
Ford before it's complete a report from
the Government Accountability Office in
September said maybe not the report
called the project high risk even though
Newport News Shipbuilding says the
warship is structurally 100% complete
already only time will tell if that
concern is warranted in the meantime the
people overseeing the ship's progress
are confident it will carry the US Navy
well into the 21st century we're going
to bring all the shipbuilder expertise
to put this great ship together and then
we work in
in conjunction with with the crew with
ships forced to start turning it over to
them little by little and we get to know
them personally and see them take
ownership of the ship and take it and
drive it so that that's the thing I'll
remember</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
