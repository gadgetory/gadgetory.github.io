forward event in San Francisco
California
and I am wearing the Apple watch on my
wrist this is a 42 millimeter version
it's the full Apple watch so this one is
a $5.99 and this is my first time using
one that's actually working and getting
to play around with all the different
interaction modes so for example you can
swipe down from the top each
notification you can scroll through them
with your finger but that's kind of
twitchy so that's where the digital
crown comes in trying to actually spin
it with your thumb is sort of hokey but
if you just take one finger and move up
and down on it it actually feels pretty
good and I found that this is got a
little bit more resistance than the
original Apple watch demo that we tried
last year so I'm pretty happy with it if
you hit it you go back home and you can
hit it again to go to your apps you can
scroll around throughout see the finger
you can also zoom in and out with the
digital crown and there's just a few
apps loaded up on here there's one here
is an uber app uber and it may have a
difficult time with the connectivity but
there it is so I just hit that button to
request an uber if I wanted to
so I'll hit the crown again to bring it
back home I can hit it again to go
Center it and then I hit it again to go
back to the watch face now the other
button here if you hit it once it takes
you to a friends list and you can scroll
through with the digital crown to find
the person you want to contact tap on
their face the tap call so the other
thing you can do if you swipe up from
the bottom and you get to this area
called glance you set up which ones you
want to have in your phone and then you
can swipe through to see a whole bunch
of customizable widgets style
information you can tap into look at it
again digital crown go home the last
interaction that I try is force size so
if you just hit the thing really hard a
60 it acts like a second tap and then
you can go through and look at your
different watch faces so it's like this
one and even go through and customize
then I can tap on each element choose
what I wanted to show each complication
and that because when they Rogers so
overall it feels pretty good even this
42 millimeter one feels a little bit
small to me I like a big watch but it
you know it looks great the leather
feels really nice to my wrist the crown
I thought it was kind of hoping but I'm
actually more impressed with it than I
thought it takes a while to sort of
learn what all the different
interactions are but once you do I
imagine it's pretty simple there you go
this is a working Apple watch it should
be available in April and again this one
starts at five</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
