am here with two of lenovo's new thin
and light laptops he's were announced
last week just getting a look at them
now though this is the Ultrabook this is
the lenovo thinkpad t430 you and so this
is an official ultrabook it's not coming
out till later this spring because it's
got the next generation Ivy Bridge
processors from Intel it's really thin
and light and it's got a sort of
traditional thinkpad look and feel
you've got the pointing stick here and a
big touchpad here not actually really
working right now so can't really demo
much so over here we've got the thinkpad
s431 has an optical drive and also has a
little bit more power it's going to have
standard voltage Ivy Bridge processors
it's also going to have discrete
graphics from Nvidia up 22 gigs of RAM
what else is going on with this it's
also got a thunderbolt port one of the
first pcs to have that sort of a similar
look and feel to what we've seen on the
ideapad line the brushed aluminum on the
palm rest and sort of a book like look
there so overall really nice options
here on the thin and light front from
lenovo looking forward to taking a
deeper look at them all in May when they
come out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
