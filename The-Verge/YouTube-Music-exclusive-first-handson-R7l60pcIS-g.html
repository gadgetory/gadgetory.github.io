I'm about to go hands-on with the new
version of YouTube music so this is what
YouTube music is like when you're logged
in as a red subscriber as you can see
I've got some basic tabs here my
homepage the trending tab which shows me
things like what's hot on YouTube rising
stars or spotlights on artists that it
knows I like and then finally I've got
this tab of things I've liked over here
and those are videos that I was watching
on YouTube music and decided to give a
thumbs up to now what's interesting is
that all of these videos that I like
will actually be saved to an offline
playlist called the offline mixtape so
I'll jump over here and you can see all
the videos that I like are automatically
here and I've got some storage settings
here so I can let it know you know how
many songs do I want to have in that
offline playlist how much of my memory
don't want to take up do I want to do it
only over Wi-Fi or also you know what
kind of audio quality do I want I could
get you know a number of different
things there so you could actually save
the videos to go offline audio only and
just listen to them as if they were
music so another thing that you'll
notice here inside of this app which is
kind of interesting is when you're
inside of a music video so let's go back
to our main screen here let's say we
want to watch some mmm so I click on
this and it loads without ads which is
obviously really nice I can change the
screen size here so I can get it kind of
small with some information down below I
can really stretch it out and obviously
I can go into a horizontal orientation
to get a much bigger video a nice thing
that you can also do here is look at
what's up next and so this is a mix made
for me based on Eminem I've got some
Dave Matthews Band and that's because
right now it's set to a lot of variety
on this station
so YouTube music gives you this little
slider here you can set it to recommend
things that are way kind of out there
sort of balanced or less variety in
which case after mmm you're probably
just going to get some more mmm if I go
back into my playing now tab you can see
that I can check out some related stuff
and the way they do this is trying to
think about what a music listener wants
so I've got a bunch of Eminem videos
right off the
here I've got a meghan trainor video
that i'm watching let's say I was in the
car and I didn't want to watch the video
anymore but I wanted to listen to the
audio I can toggle this clip up here now
it's playing audio only I toggle back
we've got the video and obviously it
just keeps playing the whole time
there's no skipping or stopping there
so here I've got other versions so I've
got the official version I've got the
audio only version and I've got cover
versions so that's one of the things
that they want to show you in YouTube
music is not just the official stuff
from the artists themselves but also you
know related stuff from fans or the
lyrics version here so there's all about
that base the video there's all about
the base that audio version there's a
cover and there's all about the base you
know a live performance of it so that's
kind of what they're trying to give you
in muted music there's one other cool
feature here which is if I go into the
search field here you'll notice search
is done very much for music so I type in
def leppard here I've got my def leppard
I get the artists and the station I can
also check out some of their top videos
but obviously what makes YouTube
interesting is they don't just have the
artists recorded catalog they've got the
live catalog so if you were to go to
type in Def Leppard and Taylor Swift now
you've got all these videos of them
playing together which is kind of a
unique experience that really only
YouTube is going to be able to offer you
and then down here I've got both Def
Leppard the original song lyrics only
I've got another version of them playing
it live and I've got some more tracks
with them and Taylor Swift together</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
