invested in them and met amazing people
using the internet to change the world
our generation has an opportunity unlike
any other we can create small empires
without anyone's permission we're back
in Soho now there are three ways to make
a website either you code it yourself
you hire someone else or you use one of
the many platforms available to get some
help now Squarespace has spent nearly
the last decade focusing obsessively on
making it as easy as possible to make a
beautiful website so that you can spend
your time doing what you love oh hello
I'm Alexis hey Anthony howdy
so this is Squarespace welcome Wow I can
already tell how much you guys care
about design Squarespace is a content
management system that helps people make
websites blogs and post them online so
you go to the website I pick one of our
designs and you can manage the site
yourself why did you want to go into the
CMS space so it was 2003 and I was in my
dorm room University of Maryland and I
want to make a website for myself and
really at the time everything seemed to
be this $2.99 race to the bottom like
bargain bin you know kind of service and
that really didn't appeal to me it
didn't fit with my personality I you
know I saw the website as sort of like
you know my online clothing it was like
this this is gonna be the thing that
everyone sees when they when they look
for you online not very many people
we're thinking about bringing a game
design to the Internet yeah CSS was
there rounded corners were not a part of
it back then I remember that rap shit'
yeah
yeah you too round a rectangle was you
know for image little things in the a
stick you ugly heck completely
ridiculous but like why what what there
was no one else doing this right so why
why you why were you the one in o3
thinking you know what design is gonna
matter I just I really wanted it for
myself started in my dorm room you know
built the software by myself
in 2003 designed it launched it in
January 2004 I actually ran the company
almost alone for the next three years I
was doing everything from customer
support I would answer all the tickets
at a certain time every night and wake
up and answer some in the morning and I
just have that as a routine for years to
the server infrastructure to design to
everything writing all of it I was as
can be expected
completely and totally stressed out like
out of my mind like problem stressed out
but good problems kinda I mean like this
is his level of stress where I'm walking
down the street and a voice in my head
that voice in your head that's supposed
to tell you like the good thing to do is
telling me you can't do this anymore
your own voice in your head saying that
and I push the voice off until I've
always like shut up voice I got this I
got this you can find yourself in a
position where it almost feels like you
don't know how to get out of it oh you
don't know the the step you need to take
to kind of bring to the next level and
that step actually was hiring what I did
in those early years kind of to a fault
and maybe ten years could have been
eight or seven if I would have gotten
some of this stuff right is I really I
really tried to do too much alone and I
was always really good at you know the
engineering stuff and the creating stuff
and I could write and do all these
different things and so I would fall
back on those skills but what I what I
did what didn't come naturally to me is
you know recruiting people to the
company and figuring out how to
determine if they're a good fit and if
the relationship was gonna work and so I
waited too long to do some of my initial
hiring and then after I waited all that
time
um the hiring supposed to unstress you
not stress you more and I actually made
a lot of mistakes in my initial hiring
because I was hiring
the wrong people yeah I was hiring I
hired some of the right people too but I
mean not such a good ratio let's say you
know it's very very dangerous when you
get yourself into a position where you
start to have a need right like I'm
falling apart I'm stressed out I really
want to hire you I really want help you
start to make compromises and see the
positives over the negatives and you're
not balanced and how you're evaluating
things during that phase I I think I I
could have done a better job there so I
stressed out I stressed out the
infrastructure I I didn't use the right
litmus test when when bringing certain
people on frankly I had never really
worked in another company besides this
one startup before us I didn't really
even know what things look like I don't
know what a manager looked like I didn't
know how much stress was supposed to be
removed for me when hiring certain kinds
of roles it was just like I'm just used
to stress at level 10 so I guess if it
goes down a level 9 that's pretty good
uh-huh and yeah is it was hard what is
what is your stress level number at
right now with it right now maybe like a
6.5 and then if we like shard the
database properly like five main floor
big bookshelf
I love ladders on bookshelves cool right
I don't know if that's not that's not a
load-bearing ladder is it should I try
to you could try it this is one of those
offices it's like they're certain
apartments I walk into and you're like
where I know I'm like you're so much
cooler than a raised platform yes so
it's actually the same cost to rip up
the floors put all the wiring in the
floor as it is to build this platform
and so we kind of used it as like a
little bit of a design element to
segment off the workspace and he came
out quite nicely
Alexis Alexis I'm Derek so Elias
pleasure to meet you pleasure pleasure
so would you marketing so Derek and I
work on the podcast radio team so if you
guys hear some Spotify you guys hear
some Pandora if you guys hear us on this
American life that's our team so this is
definitely one of the best looking
offices we have been in do you work with
someone on this is there there some
interior designers some professional
cool person who picks all the stuff out
of it no so actually all the stuff on
the shelves is from us and employees and
you know our designers and things like
that or old things I have
Squarespace started out as one college
students vlogging solution and over time
it came to be a platform for online
portfolios and eventually in-engine for
e-commerce
we're here in Tribeca to meet with a
design agency that is doing all of the
above our backgrounds are really both
really strange and weird I used to be a
ballet dancer in a former life what has
been really interested in technology my
father is a photographer so at a certain
point I got injured and those interests
kind of came together in a new way I
went to school for computer science and
art my career has been in marketing and
web design and all that kind of stuff
but we really found our sort of energy
in terms of working with outside clients
was making films about brands and
telling their stories and that's really
like what we really like to do using a
documentary style to tell stories
Squarespace is a CMS built around
helping people create beautiful things
and tell their stories on the Internet
but what does it do for your business
we found Squarespace working on a
project we were commissioned by wylie
dufresne to design his new restaurant
brand and website and we decided to use
Squarespace for that and it was right
around the time when they started to
offer Commerce and
we as a small design studio is just us
and we have a couple people helping us
we're looking for something that allowed
us to create really quickly and and
really beautifully and we created
photography and a logo and a simple type
treatment and very quickly we were able
to get our clients assets into the site
and make it beautiful we have a store
that we work on now which is called
general store which is our old studio
which was a storefront and people
started coming in and asking us if they
could buy things from our conference
room which was really weird
yeah good son you're probably on to
something well it was kind of yeah it
was weird so we had like I don't know if
you guys can see that but that's Paul
Francis our White Buffalo
he has his own website also Paul Francis
calm he's prolific easy eyes like
all-knowing all-seeing but he was on our
wall in our storefront and people would
come by and say like hey how much how
much for this thing and we're like it's
just ours we're not really selling it um
Paul was not for sale yeah yeah wind up
happening there was we started to have a
desire to curate things people could
actually buy which I think is a really
strange way to start any commerce slash
retail business our hope is to sort of
help help reduce the choices that you
need to make to find really great things
to surround yourself with first off how
old are you I heard a rumor that you
were like 15 and a prodigy I'm not 15 um
it's one of those is true I know I'm 21
recently I joined this company when I
was like 18 you joined the company or 18
and shouldn't you have been in school
yeah that's maybe why were you in school
um so I went to art school for six
months and that was a lot of fun okay
so I left and then I was running an
agency with the Rena mine for like two
years and LLC's and signing them when
you're 16 doesn't really work too well
so that was that was a little icky but I
turned 18 and I was like alright I'm
going to finally sign my LLC papers and
then we ran an agency and then
squarespace hired us for some contract
work and then I spent more time here
than my own office and so I was like
well I'm going to join this company what
uh what are your friends think about
what you guys do for a living they think
that being in stir it means that I'm
naive things that I'm inexperienced that
I'm just chasing a what's it called
what's that a dream yeah just a dream
and I don't want to just through in
their perception of it or tell them
because I'm ahead of the curve yeah and
we're doing things that are very
exciting we're growing at rapid paces
for the company ourselves and we're just
learning new advertising techniques that
are not used by any other company what
if professori shows up day one first
message and says all right
hmm you guys need to start a web design
consulting agency yeah report back to me
in a year and have at least three
clients yeah you think that is perhaps a
future for how one might look at
education yeah I mean you you learn more
about relationships between people right
because like you're working with this
client it's like you have to sustain a
relationship with them and and like that
was like how do you email clients like
you can't say certain things and I got
first I would just beg ya with man like
check this stuff out like like you can't
say that and you can't just just like
drop a link on them and be like just
give me some feedback you got to be the
constructive about it so there's stuff
like that that you really learn on like
how to communicate with people and then
figure out what people need want all
that other stuff that like really
teaches you something that I don't think
you get to learn in or out
there seems to be a kind of more
mainstream appreciation for design and
what do you think that means in the
future if more products are being
thought of more thoughtfully with how
their design better lives I think
people's lives would be better if all of
the products that we use every day so
what do you mean by that I'll give an
example there was an older gentleman
that came into our store and he saw that
we have a toothpaste that's $10 which
when you think about toothpaste ten
dollars kind of seems like a lot of
money he was kind of hemming and hawing
about who who in their right mind would
pay ten dollars for a tube of toothpaste
and the toothpaste happens to be it's
made by this company Marvis and they
have these really awesome flavors and
it's actually kind of more of an
experience and if you think about it you
know you're brushing your teeth
hopefully at least two times a day and
if that experience could be something
that's really special and great as
opposed to you just this thing that you
have to do wouldn't that extra a little
bit be really nice just in your general
life and so I I told him that and he
came back and he bought it and he was
like okay you know what I'll take you up
on this let's try this toothpaste and he
came back the next morning and was so
excited it's like the toothpaste is
amazing he brought his wife back with
him he was really excited about it
immediately you got to try this tooth he
did it in old man boys to his like no
tooth peach is great you got a shine is
cane and just Billy's incredible Birds I
really need to see what this toothpaste
is all about looks like normal
toothpaste
that's so portable Wow I could brush all
day am i love to swallow this
you're not the boss of me but some are
more random more or just interesting
stuff that you've seen Google you
Squarespace for the sites that get
traffic are never the ones you expect
like the big name-brand sites that are
using Squarespace right now highest
traffic site for a while and it's looks
like four or five years ago was a it was
a Knitting site it was actually a yarn
store in SoHo called Probie and she's
got this like great following of people
that love the store and love what she's
doing and that's the most high traffic
site on the system that's crazy
what's this what is the coolest thing
you've seen someone do using Squarespace
it's cool to say I mean there's tons of
nice web sites which is like amazing
there's like tons of amazing stuff that
come out of developer platform then I'm
just like people did that in no way
someone figured out how to use that
thing and it's like I only thought that
would like be in my debt box and never
appear in production and then there's
like beautiful artwork that goes up like
I'm just we like go through like all the
sites that we have and it's just amazing
to see like the different types of
people that are on the platform like
amazing artists and then these huge
bloggers and then you know someone like
selling some weird junk on us I'm there
a store and all that other stuff it's
like where did all these people come
from you must know that hearing all of
this stuff sounds like a just total
success parade like like from inception
to present it has just been amazing and
I think in a lot of ways it probably has
been yeah but you got it you got to give
some of us out here yeah just a taste of
the worst moments of yeah sure moment is
terror and panic yet is it there's a lot
along the way um here's the here's the
quick version of the hurricane sandy
thing our data center is on Wall Street
we know Sandy's coming and
the data center flips over to backup
power yet 24 hours before they've got
enough fuel for a week they've gone
through multi-day blackouts before it's
totally fine usually I think like the
cell towers and stuff weren't completely
dead at this point
I somehow get like one email through to
my phone and it's from our head of
systems and it says something along the
lines of massive problem basement of the
data center is flooded the fuel tanks
gone we have 12 hours of electricity
left essentially what comes out there's
fuel headed for the building that's
going to run out of fuel but we at the
data center have this separate fuel tank
that has like a couple hours worth of
fuel in it and it's determined that we
can carry fuel to the fuel tank 17
flights of stairs up the skyscraper and
if we do that at you we can keep the
thing online and we do that for three
days and it's stayed online the entire
time it did not go down and I mean they
were like barrels of like diesel fuel in
the roof and we set up systems and
people would like be it every stairwell
and carry it up and all this stuff and
it is one of the worst experiences of my
entire life and I cannot believe that we
actually made it through that like that
but it was just just crazy thing where
I'm like walking down there with my
backpack on in the morning and I'm like
really really after nine years after 10
years really I'm walking to the data
center I'm walking to this and what are
some of the values that you share with
Anthony a passion for universal building
blocks the idea of creating structures
that are reusable that you can build
upon I do think that also you know he
has tried in his product to create
something that is simple and elegant and
beautiful and he's trying to make
something that everyone can
enjoy and share it's almost like you you
don't have to focus so much on on the
design of your website but more so on
the content of your website it's awesome
to know guess that there are humans
behind the product it's a technology
product but knowing their dedication to
it is is really awesome
there's humans behind the behind the
code they're making it happen there are
a lot of people who watch this
yeah we're either thinking about
starting their own company or are
running one right now yeah you want to
know like here's someone who's clearly
had a ton of success how did he get
there
I think there's always this feeling
early on where people like like there's
almost this expectation that you have to
have in your mind this this sort of I'm
gonna change the world sort of make a
dent in the universe kind of kind of
ambition right but it's actually okay
early on to just kind of solve small
problems in layers until you actually
get to a point where you have the
capacity to do that I was having a
conversation with one of my friends
recently I was like you know if I went
back and explain to myself when I was 13
years old you know you're not gonna be a
fighter pilot
you're not coming Star Wars but instead
you kind of have this passion for a
content management system it's really
weird but somehow I just fell in love
with it code is the electricity
of the 21st century like back in the day
like people were like electricity we can
do something wondrous things of these
don't have to worry about steam and you
know wearing my pressure differences to
get things to move code is like the new
platform to really invent things and
making things with and so it's like if
you really do love creating things in
this in this century it's like code is
the way to do that I think to be a
creator and an inventor of this the
century it's like you got an axehead
let's be real here
yeah there are smarter less stressful
ways to make money it was making a look
at right so why why stay why go through
that like what was Reagan longer finally
like um I love programming right so I
got to do that and I got to make things
which was always something I had done
since I was since I was younger I felt
like the thing was having an impact you
know people loved it when they when they
used it and that's a really really cool
feeling to give somebody a platform
where they use it they didn't think they
could get that thing done before it
makes them look really good and they put
their ideas on this thing and sometimes
it changes their life and you get those
stories sometimes and and it sounds
cheesy but it it really is a great it is
a great feeling it's a good like honest
thing I made this thing give it to you
spend a little bit of money and you're
winning - it's it's cool one person
alone cannot build an empire and it took
Anthony three years to realize that he
needed help and when he finally got it
even
things kept going well they were
extremely stressful so it seems only
fitting that Squarespace has grown to be
a really impressive company now building
a platform that makes it easy
trivial really for countless
entrepreneurs to make beautiful websites
so they can focus on what really matters
