institution in the 39 years since the
show first aired audiences have moved
from analog sets to the internet
Saturday Night Live is no longer
confined to Saturday night so as the
show is gearing up for its christmas
episode we sat down with cast member
Taran Killam to talk about the evolution
of SNL and his new comic book the
illegitimate Taryn thank you much thank
you let me start that again no we thank
you much ord yeah thank you much Oh
Karen thank you very much you so my
really thank you much you I thank you
much it's Paula right yeah I miss
cherish I don't know it's a phraseology
as all I'm saying this is exactly hi
Wanda the street art it's perfect how
are you doing I'm excellent help myself
great great congratulations on an
awesome season thank you buddy thanks
yeah you're getting a recurring
character with the Jebidiah Atkinson
yeah yeah you never know how does that
ever know how does that start with a
dang that is that's a complete fluke
that was a text from Seth the day of the
show saturday hey we have this idea for
an update character come up to nine and
do a read-through if you can this
afternoon and yeah the Seth and the
update team wrote that and and we
performed it less than 12 hours after i
had first heard of the idea so you just
never know it's funny cuz like a
character like that a clip of that clip
went kind of viral on the internet is
there any push for certain clips to go
viral no just absolutely not ya know
that's the frustrating thing sort of as
a performer like Warren come on man but
make a tshirt of that put in the lobby
but it really is so much of this show
and what what people connect with is
dictated just by the audience an
audience response and I could even tell
that that hit more than any than other
things from my own social circle when
friends reach out through texts and
stuff you know what I mean yeah it's
exciting that your friends on the show
the first year maybe even the first few
months but nobody's going to text you
know every week but that was one where a
lot of people reached out to tell me how
much they liked it this season it feels
like we're seeing more pre tapes
certainly obviously the first season we
had fake commercials with John Belushi
is there a push for more pre tapes now
yeah yes there is
Lonely Island changed the game man but
but truly what those guys accomplished
is so amazing and it's they they
connected in a huge way with it with a
new generational audience you know this
tech savvy era social media society that
we live in even that even though the
sketches are normally around the same
length there's something about the look
of a pre-taped that matches so much of
what people are saying online in terms
of Funny or Die clips or stuff you'll
find on youtube so I think that's why
those travel well and they do tend to be
the this slightest bit shorter yeah and
I would say in general pre tapes tend to
have more of a musical element to and
the biggest things online you know the
things that get the most amount of hits
or anything musical any music video you
know that's all the stuff that people
will play over and over again because
they want to want to listen to it
writing the pre tapes does that start
before the week because it's so big yeah
when I came in Lonely Island had already
achieved sort of Goliath status so their
process was sort of like you know the
producers would kind of go to them and
hey what are you doing this week and
they'd get to kind of go off and manage
that but none of us have the track
record that they do so people
everybody's submitting stuff cast
members are submitting pieces writers
are submitting pieces for the table and
then even then something might might
happen later in the week what will also
occur is that something that was
pre-taped a week previous maybe like
played all right but didn't have the
host in it wasn't necessarily topic
time-sensitive so that'll get delayed
and they'll bring that back a week later
and do some additional reshoots that
happened with mo Kiki myself and Matt
nas are two of our pre-taped directors
just kind of went out on the street and
just shot it ourselves most of it and
calling in favors from people in
different departments and cast wise and
then it played pretty good it didn't
have the host in it and the part that
Anne Hathaway ended up playing was
Vanessa Bayer ok so we did reshoots and
then kind of beefed up and so
as well when we when we did it the next
week you were saying about like youtube
and hulu and also you mentioned like 20
or die or above average are these new
platforms providing more opportunities
for creative original content it is it's
a very interesting time because someone
in Kansas City can be their own
distributor really you don't I mean if
you have elbow grease and the idea and
that and the equipment you can have
people see your work you can make a TV
show now to get people to watch it has
to be good yeah I mean and and so the
television industry is run by
professionals who have all put in their
time and who have studied the craft and
who are experts who they are
professionals so I think that's why it
still remains the go-to source for
entertainment you know the sort of
mainstream stuff but there is great
stuff on the internet that that's done
more independently and then they tend to
just be immediately scooped up by by the
evil corporations would you say that the
SNL fan is different than a fan of say I
said calm or any other shows absolutely
I myself am a fan of SNL and up into up
to the day before I got hired could tell
you who is funny who wasn't what they
should do more of what they should do
less of because fans feel like they own
the show and they do fanzone the show
right it's it's lauren has said often
that it's the most like a sports team
the TV show that's most like watching a
sports team because a new roster comes
in and there's game day on Saturday and
you have a different performance every
week and people you know follow their
favorites and love you or hate you based
on how good you were just in recent
history so speaking of promoting you
said you have a new comic book I do yeah
and this is creatively the thing that
I'm by far most proud of it inspired
comics in particular and and and things
spurred from there be it animated series
or movies are what inspired my
imagination
Ninja Turtles x-men Batman spider-man
you know this is what made me want to
play pretend this is what made me want
to be other characters it's it's really
why I'm doing any of this so it's just
also an art form that I respect so much
it's a platform that I respect them that
I love and that end that I was very
curious about to you know yeah the
traditional trajectory of an SNL career
is this into comedy movies or maybe a
your own TV show after you know if
you're lucky and I guess you know I'm
not too worried about that right now
because if it comes great and and you're
only in so much control a comic book
felt like something that I could manage
more on my own as opposed to you know
spreading myself super thin / very you
know sort of like lofty goal of produce
the you know riding and starring in my
own movie it's something I'd like to do
down the line but but this just felt
like a good first step into something
that I love</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
