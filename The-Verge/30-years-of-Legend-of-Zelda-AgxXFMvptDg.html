has sold over 65 million copies spanning
18 core games in a single timeline these
games weren't released like traditional
sequels they sat back and forth while
branching into three parallel stories
according to Hyrule historia Nintendo's
official documentation of the Zelda
timeline the series story actually
begins with 2011 Skyward Sword on the
Nintendo Wii then it goes to Minish Cap
and for swords and finally ocarina of
time where it splits into its three
different parts so why the heck to
rededicated bands continue to follow
such a convoluted twisted timelines for
30 years in County well The Legend of
Zelda marked a defining moment in
videogames it had free roaming nonlinear
gameplay that required players to
explore not simply push forward there's
also the mesmerizing iconic soundtrack
which I confess I've had stuck in my
head for 30 years
then there's the commitment to the
character Zelda is one of the oldest
video game franchises but Nintendo has
stuck with its poor parts the green
tunic the Master Sword the reliable
heroes and villains the timeline is
messy but the heart of Zelda is reliable
you can pick up link between worlds
without having ever played the original
games because the games have their own
intricate stories the timeline is as
deep or as shallow as you want it to be
meaning 30 years later now is as good a
time as any to finally give it a try</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
