long commute back and forth and he has
holding his job between Earth and his
moon sci-fi radio presents an adaptation
of Philip cadence sales pitch philip k
dick is a great American novelist of the
20th century he wrote over 40 novels and
a bunch of other stuff he is usually
associated with science fiction not
wrongly he spent most of his career
published in that field and a lot of his
work includes aliens and other planets
and rocket ships but he also is one of
the most typical examples of how a great
writer transcends category because his
work seems to connect to a critique of
contemporary society it's a metaphorical
absurdist surreal you mind if I smoke
it won't affect the test he was the
source for the movie Blade Runner which
came out shortly after he died and in
retrospect was the very very first salvo
in what became a kind of slow
recognition and legitimation of his
efforts and all his books are now in
print and he's very famous
so it's that very rare happy ending in
literary history where the forgotten
writer or the marginalized writer
becomes really important to a lot of
people and very widely studied and and
read and enjoyed and unfortunately he
wasn't around to be part of that well I
first discovered philip k dick when I
was living with a friend at 18 years old
she gave me a copy of Scanner Darkly and
oh my god there's sex and drugs and it's
for adults and it's science fiction and
I just didn't love it was just the best
thing ever I felt like I was being
spoken to and I did that thing that the
kids do they go and they buy a giant
stack of books and they read it like in
a month but it wasn't actually until I
went to college I had a teacher taught
to end regime of Electric Sheep in
American literature class and he taught
it right alongside TS Eliot's the
wasteland and F scott Fitzgerald's The
Great Gatsby as if it was a equally
worthy work of art and that had the same
themes and when I saw that I was hooked
and I realized that not only did dick
speak to me as a person as an individual
but that he had his finger on the pulse
of what was important in literature in
the 20th century which was basically
coming to grips with our newly secular
and cold world and and how to stay human
in the face of encroaching technology
my first encounter was a when I was in
college I was studying literature at
Harvard and reading great literature and
my escape from it was reading literature
that was considered not so great like
science fiction when I eventually got
into the film business one of my dreams
really was to do philip k dick material
what really mattered to me was the movie
not just take a central concept from one
of his works and turn it into an action
movie but that it capture all of the
dimensions of philip k dick swerve i
mean we could go to a Tolkien fest and
we would find people equally entranced
by Tolkien we could go to a TS Eliot
fest I'd be there maybe all be equally
infatuated ideas but there's a unique
nourishment that people seem to get from
Dick's work of a kind different
relationship we don't
I think celebrate the man I think we
celebrate a construction man but I think
that construction tells us a lot about
what we want what we want is somebody
who is on the edge who has been not so
high in the thin air that they've seen
over the mountain but they're also dizzy
you know they're also have some altitude
sickness he became my model for what
sort of novels I wanted to write and I
wanted to be funny and scary and strange
in exactly the same measures my first
aspiration was really I kind of sit
almost it's you know embarrassingly
silly that I just thought if if my books
were just taken to be like the next best
thing since he's not around you know it
kind of you know okay like B+ philip k
dick novels that was gonna be good
enough for me I just wanted to write
more of what he did I was pretty selfish
person at 18 and 19 at 20 I'm not sure
I'm not sure how unusual that is a
nothing particularly unusual but it
really was a slap in the face this this
work to say you know what what are you
doing
are you living your life I I credit my
marriage to Philip get dick in the sense
that it gave me the ability to be
empathetic enough to have a quality
relationship I credit my ability as a
father to philip k dick again my dad
wasn't particularly present and Philip
he takes on a particularly good
surrogate dad but his books are his art
is a very good moral teacher during the
60s there used to do this thing that if
you took LSD your brain would change
forever and you could never go back
it crosses so many barriers of your
involvement it really sucks you in to
reality that there's no distance there's
no aesthetic distance between it as
you're reading it that's a kind of
literature that really interests me
literature that changes the way we live</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
