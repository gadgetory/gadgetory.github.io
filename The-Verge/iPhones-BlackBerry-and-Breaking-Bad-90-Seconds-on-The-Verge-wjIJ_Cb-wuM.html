September 20th 2013
I'm marques Brownlee aka mkbhd and this
is ninety seconds on the verge what a
week it's been we had GTA 5 iOS 7 and
now the new iPhones the iPhone 5s and 5c
went on sale online and in stores
worldwide this morning
however the gold 5s the star of Apple's
flagship lineup is in short supply with
store quickly selling out of online
orders Apple has confirmed the shortage
and according to a Wall Street Journal
has instructed suppliers to increase
production of the gold smartphone an
hour the 5c selling well we won't know
just yet as Apple has kept the numbers
under wraps but we may find out this
Monday after the debut weekend sneaking
under the cover of Apple's fanfare
BlackBerry has announced some very sad
news as rumored earlier this week the
company will be laying off 4,500
employees the struggling smartphone
manufacturer has been forced to take
drastic action in the wake of losing
almost a billion dollars last quarter
it was previously reported that
BlackBerry's board is hoping to sell the
company in whole or in pieces as soon as
this November and finally Breaking Bad
is ending but you can take a piece of
the show with you forever
Sony Pictures has put hundreds of props
from the hit AMC show on auction it's
range from $10 to $5,000 in feature
items such as Tuco's grill and Hector
Salamanca's wheelchair if none of these
items make sense to you you clearly need
to catch up on Breaking Bad which you
can do when AMC marathons every episode
starting September 25th all the way to
the series finale on September 29th and
that's it for today's top stories coming
up next week we talked to the woman who
found a billion dollars cash after
subscribing to the verge and mkbhd
YouTube channels</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
