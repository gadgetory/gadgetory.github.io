traveled here to cologne germany for
photokina 2012 it's the biggest and
premier photography trade show in the
world and we've seen cameras of all
shapes and sizes but though the
megapixel war and cameras may be over it
looks like the sensor size war is just
heating up a full-frame sensor is it the
same equivalent size just 35 millimeter
film and what that does is enables a
person to get the very best experience
from their lens so there's no crop
factor no multiplication multiplication
factor so 10 millimeter lens the wide
angle is 10 millimeters rather than
maybe 60d 50.6 multiplication factor
full frame is of course the leica former
because it was invented by the inventor
of the first Locker Oscar Banach 24 x 36
millimeters and still very attractive
because you have very low depth of field
the larger the sensor is and especially
with like a lenses that all have a very
large aperture that's the application
and the style of images that makes a
system so popular so full-frame sensors
have actually been around for a while
but they've always been in big heavy
expensive cameras that are designed
exclusively to be used by professionals
but what we're seeing this year at
photokina is full-frame sensors coming
to the masses to everyday people
the fill frames answers in our high-end
islas at the d4 the d800 the d800e and
then making the fill frame available for
the d600 it will make if you'll attract
much more people it's a bit of a natural
evolution with technological
developments there's great to
understanding in the manufacturing and
the technologies involved so also
quantities produced can have an impact
on price Canon and Nikon both announced
DSLRs that are lighter and smaller than
a lot of their products before and also
more affordable they're about two
thousand dollars each and they each have
full-frame sensors but the company is
really bending the laws of physics this
time our sony and Lika Lika announced a
new M rangefinder with a body barely
larger than a mirrorless camera and a
full-frame sensor and Sony's new
cyber-shot rx100 the appointment shoot
but it still got that same enormous
sensor in it synthesized that's really
matter and I think it's a key success of
the nine because it was full frame and
as you can see and competitors they all
now go for full frame I don't personally
don't believe we need a full frame
camera I've worked on camera
architectures from large format medium
format down for 20 years and given that
if the the camera system is designed and
optimized for whatever sensor size it is
you can get image quality that's that's
that's better than just basically
scaling up and throwing more surface
area to censor and we have now a lot of
enthusiasts who are now at the level for
example the d7000 which is a great
imaging device but they want to step up
they want to make even better pictures
they want to have them device it has
even better image quality and the nikon
d600 go if it makes it available for
everyone so I affordable fill friend
DSLR make
great images it has the features that
are coming down from the d800 the d4 are
professional very high in this large so
yeah this is now going to be a request
of the market so we are fulfilling this
huge demands so now the question becomes
how far can camera manufacturers taken I
would expect that over the course in a
period of time that those kind of sensor
is filtered down into the lower price
cameras I don't know we're sure about
the future of the BSR will bring I think
that this is a very nice opening for the
whole market enthusiast Oh need a great
image quality in a very compact eyesight
body you have to have a certain distance
between a fencer and the length in order
to our
make the proposition work as a whole so
there will be a challenging aspect when
it comes to the size of the camera when
you actually want to have a full frame
proposition in practice in camera but
this is something you know we like
challenge and we always look at consumer
needs so we'll definitely keep you
