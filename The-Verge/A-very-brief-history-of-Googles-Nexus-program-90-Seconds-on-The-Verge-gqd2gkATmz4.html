Android experience but at what cost i'm
evan rodgers and this is 90 seconds on
the verge multiple rumors this month
appointed to a new silver program from
google showcasing the best of android at
carrier stores according to the
information android silver would
actually replace google's more mid-range
nexus program though never a big seller
google's nexus program has had a big
impact on android let's take a look back
this is the nexus one the first
so-called google phone debut January
2010 made by HTC and running the then
brand new android 2.2 froyo that's
always been the hallmark of a nexus the
latest and greatest Android with nothing
added by carriers or manufacturers that
means no touch with no sense UI and no V
CAST google has released one nexus phone
per year rotating between top-tier
manufacturers after HTC made the first
one samsung took over for nexus s in
December 2010 followed by the galaxy
nexus one year later LG has been the
latest Nexus OEM making both 2012's
nexus 4 and the latest Nexus 5 that all
leads us to today the Nexus 5 is only
six months old which means a new model
wouldn't be expected until later this
year while Google hasn't released sales
figures it has said the Nexus 5 is a
quote strong performer and in 2012
Google expanded the Nexus program with 7
and 10-inch tablets but let's circle
back to Android silver the closest thing
we have to that program right now is
google play edition a selection of
premium handsets like the new HTC one
with pure android if silver ends up
replacing the nexus and gunning for the
high ends what will fill the void in the
middle that's a good question for more
on android silver check out the verge
coming up google unveils its gold
programs which is just a series of
bedazzled moto x's</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
