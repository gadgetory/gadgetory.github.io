are looking at the Nokia Lumia 710 the
first thing you'll notice this is pretty
pretty standard black design it's got a
solid button on the bottom unlike most
windows phones have come out which have
been capacitive buttons if you look
around the device you've got standard
camera buttons you've got the volume
rocker and if you look at the top you've
got the microUSB port which is a little
odd you've got the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and you've got the power
button now the interesting thing about
the microUSB is that you're usually
seeing those more on the side and on the
bottom on the back you've got the 5
megapixel camera you got the single LED
flash and the pictures you take with it
are pretty standard we kind of size it
up with the Samsung Focus flash the HTC
Radar 4G and they're all pretty much the
same kind of picture quality more or
less maybe a little bit of a saturation
difference but you're not going to
notice unless you really look carefully
there is no front camera so if you're
really big on video chatting you're just
kind of out of luck here the display is
a three point seven inch what nokia
calls a clear black LCD
it's basically an LCD with some better
clothes than we've seen before the big
problem with it and although it does
look very nice in front the biggest
difference if you look at the focus
flash side by side you'll see the
viewing angles are a little off the
device runs Windows Phone which as with
every other device it's more or less the
same experience you're getting across
all the phones you've got basically on a
fundamental level a form over function
and design it looks very pretty you've
got this kind of Metro UI tile design
but all in all you've got this kind of
weird design choices you've got a search
button the search button actually takes
you back to being Universal every single
time apps like Twitter
they'll constantly reload when you open
it actually makes it for a much slower
experience and it does give any nerves
after a while in addition to 7.5 mango
updates you hold the back button here
you've actually got its kind of
multitasker we kind of go back from the
windows it's an improvement it looks
really good but if you're used to iPhone
or Android functionality you're just not
giving the same experience so one thing
that Microsoft's been very adamant about
has been lack of customization so
basically you're getting the same look
Nokia's actually added a few apps of its
own though on the small scale you've got
a new theme which is Nokia blue is
actually a more navy blue compared to
the bright one we have now this phone
actually has three GPS apps we loaded it
up you've got regular Bing Maps of
course you've got the teen ailable
centric TeleNav and you've all
so got nokia drive the maps are actually
powered by NAVTEQ which nokia now owns
the other app that nokia has is the
nokia weak hair app and if you click on
it is literally as just an app that says
how much nokia cares about you it
respects for privacy doesn't collect
your data and if you want to click on
the privacy policy you get a ton of
bright blue obnoxious links the other
carrier centric app is t-mobile TV which
as the name suggests is just a streaming
service you get a 30 day trial or at
least a week out of 30 day trial with
our review unit and after that it
actually has a monthly subscription fee
at $49.99 in contract Lumia 710 is
actually a pretty decent Windows Phone
devices certainly stacks up to the likes
other focus flash on AT&amp;amp;T and even the
radar however you are patient enough CES
is just around the corner in mid-january
and Nokia is sure to have some Windows
Phone announcements at that time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
