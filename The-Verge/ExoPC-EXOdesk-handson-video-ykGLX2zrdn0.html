CES 2012 and we are here with the CEO of
X OPC and he's going to be demoing the
XO desk forms take it away sure so here
we have is an extension of your
workplace here we developed a HTML 5 UI
that runs on top of Windows Windows 7
and I'll do a little demonstration so
what we did is we want to make sure that
you're able to be much more productive
so we have a keyboard and your mouse
you're able to do all your interactions
what we have is a app launcher of all
your different applications and
shortcuts able to remove the keyboards
to show you
so let's say if you want to verify say
the weather and you're able to have all
your applications aren't your desk while
doing all your work if you want to
remove an application on you use your
gesture out so very simple calendar and
so on destroying different widgets if
you want to change your background it's
very simple really customize the look
and feel
again this is made to be productive
instead of typing where you want to go
we're able to launch and interact with
your screen while you're working now
let's say it's a 12 o'clock and you want
a little rest and you feel like playing
some piano all multi-touch
so very simple very intuitive and
there's so many different you know
possibilities so let's say if you want
to do example play a game board this can
be example monopoly this could be chess
put this in a 32-inch table coffee and
you're able to to launch everything here
different types of keyboards
play your music just drag your cassette
are you music
now let's say you want a while you're
working you want to see what's what's
happening so you do it different
gestures here where you get a different
timeline of your tweets your Lincoln or
Facebook all in a very simple way
so for also education we're going to be
working on a few pilots here will show
that to you
so think about a whole digital classroom
with the desk
we're able to launch this would be a
shortcut to example it could be a excel
word everything you can just launch your
applications here this could be kind of
a wheel for a game and you can change
it's pretty much it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
