we are looking at the I'm watch which is
an Android watch it's running android
1.6 so of course it's a highly
customized version and you can see we've
even got a notification area here it has
a 240 x 240 screen company says that
it's basically the same screen as the
ipod nano and it's got a bunch of cuts
custom apps that they made they made an
email app they made a facebook app
they've made a twitter app there's
weather and news and a few other bits it
needs to pair to a smartphone over
bluetooth in order to get its internet
connection over tethering and so you can
do that and then it'll work as a
Bluetooth headset and then you can also
get online with it to do various things
it's got four gigabytes of storage so
you can play music off of it and there's
also a headphone jack on the side so you
can listen to it now there's only one
button it's this button on the side and
it basically functions as a back button
over the entire OS so there's no home
button you just need to keep hitting
back back back to get home it has a
capacitive screen which in my testing as
you can see here sometimes tends to miss
swipes so it's not running especially
well it's powered by a 450 megahertz an
atom processor at a9 processor actually
and the production models will have 128
negative ram and a 400 million battery
this model only has a 64 megabytes of
RAM because it's just a prototype the
company says that it's in production now
and that you can they're getting ready
to ship the first pre-orders out or they
wouldn't give me an exact release date
it retails for 349 dollars for this
basic color version which comes in a
bunch of different colors and that's the
I'm watch</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
