the top job for five months and there's
one point he keeps driving more than any
other mobile first in the cloud for a
mobile-first cloud-first mobile-first
cloud-first he's now firmly stamping his
mark on the software giant and a long
letter to microsoft's more than 100,000
employees
Tudela outlines his vision to reshape
the core of Microsoft first and foremost
he's dropping the devices and services
focused that former Microsoft CEO Steve
Ballmer brought in and instead
refocusing on cloud and mobile its
Microsoft going back to what it does
best its software roots that calling of
the devices and services focused doesn't
mean Xbox or surface are going anywhere
just yet
in fact Adele remains committed to
Microsoft's game console and describes
its latest surface pro 3 tablet as an
example of how Microsoft will build
first party Hardware in the future if
anything the Della's letter is largely
an omission of how Microsoft is changing
and how he as the new CEO wants to
change the company's culture to get
there one of the core things that we've
gotta realize is that this business does
not really respect tradition what it
respects is innovation on a go-forward
basis some of those traditions already
appear to be out the door when the della
opted in to bring Office for iPad to
fruition and traveling to the heart of
Silicon Valley to impress and relaxed
and informal surroundings the timing
comes shortly before Microsoft reports
its latest financial results and amid
rumors the company is planning layoffs
shortly adela doesn't touch on those
aspects of course instead focusing on
the future quote we will collectively
transform this company and seize the
great opportunity ahead
something-something mobile-first
cloud-first
