Verge's YouTube page to hear about the
new pixel phones but today we aren't
talking about that instead we are
talking about dating apps because us
tech nerds deserve love just like
everybody else I'm going to help teach
you how to get better at dating apps and
hopefully help you find some love
full disclosure though I'm single too
but to be clear it has nothing to do
with me and everything to do with all
the trash humans in New York City I
report on dating apps for the Virg type
a pretty clear idea of what makes the
dating apps differ from one another
how you should pick your best profile
photos and how to send the first message
so we're going to go through this
together and then when you end up
meeting the love of your life because of
me you can write and thank me so to get
started you're gonna obviously need to
figure out what dating app you're going
to use how much time do you have to
dedicate to dating and filling out a
profile are you really serious about
certain things like religion do you want
more of a serious thing or more of a
fling there's truly a dating app for
everyone you've probably heard of tinder
and bumbles but there's also gay dating
apps like Grindr and scruff relationship
oriented apps like hinge which is what I
use coffee meets bagel and OkCupid and
religion based apps like J swipe and
Christian mingle so there are lots of
dating apps the key thing to remember is
you just want to use the one where you
think the people you want to date are
think of dating apps like bars I want to
go to a sports bar on football Sunday
because I don't really like football but
basically dating apps have specific
values which affects how they're
designed and the communities they create
bumble for example prioritizes women's
experiences by only allowing women's
message first meanwhile hinge thinks
messages are more important so it allows
people to like a specific thing about
another person's profile and comment on
it before matching that person will then
see your comment and can then decide if
they want to match with you to keep the
conversation going
or skip tinder on the other hand
requires both people to match before
allowing anyone to message so think
about how you want to interact I like to
use hinge because I'm looking for a more
serious relationship and swiping on
tinder feels kind of superficial to me
now with that said it takes a long time
to fill out your hinge profile you have
to include a bunch of photos and answer
a bunch of questions but I really
appreciate the people who do that
because I get a better sense of who they
are as actual human beings
okay so now that we've picked out our
app let's fill out our profile okay
first let's talk about photos I've got
lots of photos of myself here that I
have printed out just like any normal
person in 2018
the most obvious rule of thumb here is
to make sure your photos actually show
off your face and that you don't use a
ton of group shots so I have a couple
photos like this has to go this should
probably go it's definitely gotta go and
I love my friends but they gotta go too
see ya let's discuss selfies a little
bit here selfies are great we all love
them but you should not use too many of
them on your profile because people who
are looking at you want to know that
you're a real human in this world so as
much as I love this picture it's gotta
go now you also want photos of yourself
doing activities I'm a tech reporter
that's not very exciting but I love to
eat so here I am with nachos Here I am
with an empty plate anyone who looks
profiles should know this girl like Z
food last but not least don't have
anyone who could potentially be your
lover in your photos even if it's your
brother or sister if anyone has to look
at that photo and be like hmm who is
that person no okay so I'm pretty
satisfied with the photos we've chosen
so I'm gonna move them right over here
and on hinge you have to answer prompts
one of their prompts is where to find me
at the party and there's a bunch of ways
you can answer this but some answers are
better than others
so I talked to the CEO of hinge and he
told me that for this prompt lots and
lots of people say hanging out with the
dog or the cat or whatever which is a
financier and cute but honestly it's
been done so no this emoji and not on
the dance floor I don't really know how
people would respond to this and also
it's kind of negative so I'm just gonna
not do that I'm down to two answers here
one of which is pretty positive and the
other which is negative and one of them
is easier to respond to than the other
you really want people to be able to
read your profile and have something to
say to you without having to think too
hard because of that I'm keeping the
dips answer I'm from the Midwest
I love dips it says a little bit about
me and hopefully someone will message me
and tell me about their favorite party
tip I'm definitely gonna do a burger and
show my mom my beautiful project I
didn't work today but yeah this is a
great profile I'm really satisfied with
it now let's talk about messages the
advice here is super clear don't rely on
basic comments like hey or hi or how was
your weekend hinges CEO tells me that a
confident statement actually performs
25% better than a question in terms of
whether a conversation moves off the app
so try a confident statement like I
don't know spinach artichoke dip is the
best let's assume you're now in a great
conversation that's enough to ask
someone out on a real date most people
just want to know that there's enough to
go off conversation wise to actually
have a drink or coffee or go on a walk
with someone just don't make your first
date an entire plan for a day because
you might not actually like this person
and you do not want to be stuck with
them here's my PSA now where I need to
say that you need to stay safe out there
online dating still means meeting
strangers from the internet and that's
scary so make sure you tell your friends
and family where you're going and maybe
even share your location with them if
you find my friends or Google Maps
definitely make sure they check in with
you throughout the night all right so
with that said let the games begin
all right well thanks for watching I
also co-host a podcast called why'd you
push that button from the verge which is
about all the choices we make with
technology so go check that out and
there's spinach dip
Pizza check my wing the buffalo chicken
dip anything can be a dip if you put
your mind to it friend Johnny</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
