- Hey all, this is Nilay from The Verge.
We're here in New York City
in front of our office.
Tesla gave us a Model 3 for the night.
So, I'm just gonna cruise
around the city, pick up
some friends, and see what they think.
Let's go.
This is actually the fully
loaded version, so it's
extended range.
It gets 310 miles on a full charge.
It's got all the options.
So, the car starts at 35k,
that's what Tesla says,
but this model, all the way
loaded up, red paint, fancy
wheels, the whole nine,
is 60k basically.
So, pretty up there.
And the first person we're gonna pick up
is Ashley Carman, a great gadget reporter,
whose been reviewing
a lot of cars for us.
Here she is.
- Okay.
- Oh, and Becca's here too.
Hey, Becca.
- How you doing?
- So, Ashley, you are a gadget
reporter on Circuit Breaker.
- Yes.
- You have done a bunch of
screen drives for us, you did
a BMW 5 Series, you know, Rolls Royce--
- Yep.
- You did a Hyundai.
- Yep.
- The Hyundai was nicer
than the Rolls, I think.
(laughter)
I am gonna ask you to do a
series of challenges in this
car, because you're looking
around, there are no buttons,
there's no knobs--
- I've also never been
in a Tesla before, so--
- You've never been in a Tesla before.
- So, this is all new to me.
- So, if you've been in a Model
S, you'll probably be able
to figure this out pretty easy.
Challenge one--
- Okay.
- I just want you to turn
on some music, very basic,
people do it in cars all the time.
- It's very basic until
you have cameras on you.
(Nilay laughs)
Okay, let me see.
I'm gonna go with the music note,
I'm gonna press the magnifying
glass, I'm gonna put
on Fiona Apple--
Because that is, for some
reason, I think it's the winter
it's making me--
- Very dramatic choice.
I want you to change the direction
of the air vents.
- Okay, so I see the
temperature here, manual--
- There you go.
- Is it seriously gonna be this?
- Yeah.
Isn't that cool?
- What?
- So, the way this works--
- Such a crazy--
- There's a jet that blows
up and a jet that blows out,
and when you move this around,
those two interact and it
blows faster or slower and
it directs the air towards
where you're going.
- This is just not how
I think about vents.
- It's just so cool.
- Yeah.
That's pretty dope.
- I want you to lock the doors.
- Okay, well, there is
no locks, I don't think.
(Nilay laughs)
I'm gonna go back to this
handy-dandy car menu.
I'm in the locks menu,
I found the locks menu.
- I will tell you that
this confused the hell out
of me earlier.
- I don't know, Nilay,
I'm in the locks menu.
This feels like the place.
- You are in the locks menu.
It's right here.
Beep.
- Oh!
- That's the door locking.
- I didn't even think to look up there.
- Well, it's funny because
it's the main thing you want
to do, so it's up here,
it's like it's always
at the root level.
This map--
- Yeah.
- Get rid of this.
It says Google in the corner.
Those are some Google maps.
- Yeah, see, this is what
really stands out to me, because
if you haven't tried a bunch
of cars, you don't realize
how terrible map interfaces are.
- Really?
So, it's Google Maps
on the screen, but the
navigation is actually cool.
Ashley, you're a gadget reporter,
this is like a $60,000 gadget, does this
appeal to you, is this like a good gadget?
- As far as the actual
display goes, this really just
feels like an iPad Pro
to me, and that's nice.
I actually really like this display.
I was super skeptical,
I even wrote like a Hot Take
when they announced the model,
I was like, &quot;It needs a head's
up display&quot;, because I love
heads up displays.
This is around the BMW price range
and the actual car feels a
lot cheaper, like this wood
paneling, I do not dig, it
feels, I don't know, and
this side door, it doesn't
feel like $60,000 to me.
- Right.
- This feels very, like, utility.
- Right.
All right, well, thank
you for coming on this
ride with me.
- Yeah.
- I assume you're going partying now.
- Yeah, I'm just so ready to tear it up.
(Nilay laughs)
- All right, so, I've been
driving this car for a while
now, just picking people up,
cruising around the city.
It is ridiculously fun to drive.
And then the other thing
I've noticed is people are,
they are drawn to this car
like nothing else.
The red paint helps.
If you want any other color but black,
you have to pay $1000.
I recommend buying the
red paint for $1000.
You know, from the outside
just looking at it, it's got
a lot of that Model S vibe.
It's a little bit more
aggressive in its design.
Everyone's expectations
when they get into it are
completely blown up, because
you're expecting to be in a
car, and the inside of this
thing looks nothing
like a traditional car.
So, a lot of people have been
asking me how this compares
to a Model S, yo, is that Marques?
(horn honks)
Marques!
What's up, buddy?
- What's good?
- You own a very famous
Model S named Apollo.
- Yes.
- I follow the adventures
of Apollo all the time, and
you spent like three days in
a Model 3 recently, right?
- Yeah, so we spent a
little time in a Model 3.
It compared well in a lot of ways,
and it's really familiar.
I've driven some other
cars that don't compare
in like any way to mine.
It does a couple things
better than my car, and
it does a couple things worse.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- What does it do better?
- The UI here, it's a little
faster, the touch response
is faster.
It's also updated and
the maps are a little
bit better.
The front trunk opening is a little bit
finicky on Model S's,
just everyone's Model S.
Model 3 is just, one hand, close, easy.
If you get used to the air
suspension on a Model S,
then the coils here will feel
a little too firm.
If you get used to zero
to 60 in 2.4 seconds,
then this might feel a less than that.
- How old is your Model S?
- About a year and a half.
- Okay, so here's my big
concern with this display.
It's basically a giant tablet.
Five or 10 years from now--
I mean, you don't hold on
for a phone for five or 10
years, you don't hold on to a tablet.
Is yours slowing down at all?
Do you think that's
gonna make it five years,
10 years, as long as you keep a car?
- I do view it the same way as you.
I did lease my car
anticipating it like a piece
of technology and I don't
expect it to last as long as a normal car.
So far, in my year and a half,
it hasn't slowed down, so
that's good.
I'm hoping it doesn't, because
that's kind of important
that it keeps up with all
the things I need to do,
like unlocking it on the screen.
- I find myself wondering,
A, are regular people going
to be able to figure all this
out, and, two, like, honestly,
it's a computer and I'm with you.
I mean you probably change
phones faster than me.
I change my phone every 25 minutes.
- Right.
- And this kind of scares me.
I've got to be honest with
you, that it's kind of locked in to this.
And you can get
over the air updates, but
are they gonna swap out
processors in 10 years?
Things like that.
Or are they just gonna call them all back
and give people new ones?
- Yeah, I think it would be
cool if they actually changed
out the computer because
I know the computer in
the Model S, I thought they
would have updated already,
because it's been the same
since the beginning of Model S.
(bouncy music)
- Compared to Auto Pilot on
your S, do you find this one
better or worse?
What was your response like how it--
- Yeah, the actual driving
part was identical, just
having all the cars in
front of you and sensing
everything around you is the same.
But my problem with it
is the physical control of Auto Pilot.
So, on Model S there's a
separate stock, you double tap
down, and if you want to
change the distance between the
car in front of you, you just rotate it.
In this car you have no Auto
Pilot stock, so you double
tap the drive stock, and
then to adjust the distance
of the car in front of you,
you have to go into a menu
and hit up and down in
the menu on the screen.
- Whoa!
- So, you know, you're
not, you're technically not
really driving and you can
afford to look off the road,
but I feel like they could
have done way better with that.
- Yeah, I feel like they
went, this is a weird phrase,
maximally minimum.
- Yeah.
- There's as little stuff
as you can have over here,
and sometimes when you're
actually just driving, you want
those controls around you.
- Yeah.
Some of these buttons are
unassigned, for the most
part, and they can, as they
learn about how people use
the software, assign them,
so I think they can use that
right wheel to control
distance, because now it's
unassigned while you're in Auto Pilot.
That would be easy.
- So, this car, I was saying
earlier, is almost 60k,
because it's all optioned out.
- Yeah.
- The base model Model S
is, I don't think anybody
gets one, but it's
close to that range too.
Would you get this specced up
versus getting a Model S at
the base level?
- I think at 60 grand, or
roughly what this is, I would
pick an optioned up Model 3.
- Really?
- Because baseline Model S,
you don't get Auto Pilot,
right, you have to pay extra.
Baseline Model S, you
don't get glass roof.
Baseline Model S, you
don't get premium speakers.
So, it'll feel similar, but
I feel like you'll get a
better experience with an
optioned up Model 3.
That's just my opinion.
I haven't driven a baseline Model S.
I could be proven wrong.
But Tesla will always tell
you Model S is a better car.
That's just my opinion
on if you're gonna drop
exactly 60 grand, that's
probably where I would lean.
- All right, man, well, I
have stolen you and driven you
around in circles too much for the day.
I'm gonna let you go.
Do you want to plug your channel?
- Yo, MTV HD on YouTube
or any other social.
I did a Tesla video, it might
have been this exact same car.
- I think it was the exact same car.
- It was this exact same car.
- I changed it from
Auto Focus to the Verge.
- That's amazing.
Take it easy.
- Thanks, Brother.
I've got to get this thing
back to the Tesla dealership.
Oh, hey Loren.
Come on in.
Loren, do you want to come with me
to the meatpacking district?
- I do.
- Because I have to get
this car back to Tesla.
- You know, I love those clubs.
- Who doesn't love a hot club?
So, this is Loren Grush--
- Hi.
- Who you probably know from Space Craft.
- I cover the other Elon company.
- So when you think about
Elon, right, obviously
SpaceX like really inspires people.
- Oh, yeah.
You know, it's funny, I saw some comment
the other day that was
talking about just the kind of
sheer difference between how
the two companies are covered.
You know, SpaceX has got
its criticism and people who
like to criticize it, but
overall, most people kind of
acknowledge that the company
has been a big disruptor
in like a very old-timey industry.
Ironically space is
kind of set in old ways.
- But I wonder, the way Tesla
has covered it, is like,
they have competitors.
SpaceX doesn't have like
consumer level competitors
the way Tesla does.
- Yeah, I mean, they have like
one or two major competitors.
But in space, having
competition is, everyone kind of
says it's good.
The more other companies elevate, it all
elevates the industry.
It's not, it's definitely not the
same field as cars, by any means.
And the difference too,
I think, is this is more
to towards the consumer.
And SpaceX, you know, not everybody
launches rockets.
- No.
- Not everybody needs their
rockets to be launched.
So, it's a very different type
of market and maybe that's
kind of why things are different.
It just sounds like they have
a lot of production problems,
and that is just not an issue for SpaceX.
(Nilay laughing)
If anything, they have an
abundance of rockets because
they keep landing them all the time.
- So, when you're in this car
and you're looking around it
do you see any family ties
between all the Elon companies?
- Elon loves a streamlined aesthetic.
- He's doing something with
these cars that make them
look really different.
If you look at all the cars around
us, they all have grills,
they need air intakes for
their engines.
This car doesn't need one,
so they just flattened
out the front of the car.
They designed it around
being an electric car.
- And all my stuff is up
in the hood right now.
- That's true.
That front trunk is actually like
pretty useful.
So, I'm gonna do something.
- Okay.
- So, we're on the West Side Highway.
I'm just gonna put the hammer down.
- What's the hammer?
Can you even do that in New York?
(Loren screams)
Oh, my god.
Please don't put that in the video.
(squealing)
That's like a freaking
roller coaster ride.
- [Nilay] Yeah, I mean, this
car has a ton of torque.
- [Loren] I like speed,
it's just unexpected.
- [Nilay] Yeah.
- [Loren] And it's also a car.
Like, I don't like cars.
- [Nilay] You don't like cars?
- [Loren] Well, I do like
cars if I'm in control.
- [Nilay] I see.
Do you want to drive?
- [Loren] No.
- [Nilay] You sure?
- [Loren] Maybe.
- [Nilay] Do it.
It's not my car.
So, very basic stuff--
- [Loren] Yeah, what do I do?
- [Nilay] First, your mirrors.
Phil, Phil, come back.
Stop!
- [Phil] What's wrong?
- [Nilay] Nothing's wrong, I don't think.
- [Loren] Put the hazards on.
Put the hazards on!
- [Nilay] I don't know how.
- [Loren] Go around us!
- [Nilay] You guys, we need the key card!
- [Phil] It's in the car with you.
- [Nilay] Oh.
Okay.
We're good. We're good.
Put your foot on the brake.
And then now you're in drive.
- [Loren] Okay.
Sorry.
- [Nilay] I didn't know
where the key card was.
(laughing)
- Oh, that's fun.
- Do you see what I'm saying?</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
