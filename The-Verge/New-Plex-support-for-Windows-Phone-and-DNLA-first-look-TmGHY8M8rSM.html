and i'm here at the plex booth at
showstoppers and we're looking at some
of the new stuff that they've got Plex
is a media server system that lets you
stream from a computer or any media
server to all kinds of different devices
they have a mac client they have an
android client there's an app for iOS
and now they're branching out into a
whole bunch of new things and adding
some new features so let's take a look
at the Windows Phone client which is one
of the coolest things so the plex client
is pretty in functionality pretty
similar to the iOS and Android apps you
can look through your various servers
and they have channels which is kind of
like the way Roku does it you can see
different sites and watch things that
way there's a queue which has movies
that you've sent yourself to watch you
get an email address that you can send a
link to and it puts it there there's
also new recommended feature Plex is
launching some new social features that
will plug into Facebook and let people
say hey you should watch this video and
then it'll show up in your recommended
cute for you to watch so it's got the
Metro UI it's a pretty nice-looking app
and it's pretty full featured for
everything that flex can do and you can
stream movies and all that pretty easily
so they have Windows Phone and all of
this stuff over here they have there's a
DLNA app there's a nap in the Samsung
store there's a new google TV app coming
out they already have one but it's
getting a refresh to look better from
far away back on your couch and
basically their goal is just to be
everywhere and lets you stream from a
single server single space to any device
in your house and the whole stack just
got a lot bigger and that's what plex is
up to at CES</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
