at the world's first smartphone with a
thermal-imaging camera at about here
this is the cat s60 it's just been
announced Mobile World Congress just
before and basically uses a fluid camera
at the top here combined with a regular
camera and the effects are kind of cool
as you imagine you can look around and
see all the thermal hotspots and the
kind of unique things obviously
combining the two cameras to get you
like a sense of the object so you
actually see in the thermal imagery from
so I'll give you a good demo so it's my
hand and a table in front of me I'm
gonna put my hand down in front of there
and just still see the thermal print and
you can imagine like a scenario where
you're a fireman I'm not I don't go to
the gym that much so I'm definitely not
a fireman you imagine if you were and
you turned up at scene of a crime it's
like someone's burnt a house down and
you find like fingerprints to stuff like
that that's a good good example or your
electrician you're checking out a fuse
box or even in construction work and
looking at like he just painting out
buildings any sort of stuff at that and
obviously all the focuses at the moment
are for on the sort business side of
things you could imagine in the future
if these start to get built onto regular
consumer phones that you could do like a
our stuff in games which would kind of
use the thermal camera it could be kind
of interesting to see where that goes
it's obviously a regular Android phone
it's got a Qualcomm Snapdragon 617
processor free gig of ram and it's
coming out in May and so it's obviously
a rugged phone so you know you're not
going to be buying this as a consumer
but this sort of technology is the first
of its kind and we probably see it on
future smartphones so I was a quick look
at the cat's X 60 and if you want to see
more from Mobile World Congress then
