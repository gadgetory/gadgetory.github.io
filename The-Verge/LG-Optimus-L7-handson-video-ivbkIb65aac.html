we're looking at the optimus l7 which is
a very high end of LG's new else style
line and there are a few as there were
spec bumps from the l3 to the l5 they
respect bumps from the l5 to the l7 as
well get a 4.3 inch WVGA display a slim
shell so it feels pretty good in the
hand high style there's less chrome on
this than there is on the l5 sort of a
full satin chrome bar at the top not at
the bottom you get more of the white at
the bottom this bottle is available also
in black you can tell here we have the
white and the black models both have
chrome and this is running Android 4.0
as I mentioned this wvga the l5 is hvga
so you can kind of take your pick what
resolution you want an android 40 there
it's running LG skin which bears a
market resemblance to the skin on the 4x
as you can probably imagine feels a
little beta here and of course these
devices aren't out yet so that's to be
expected in terms of horsepower you have
a 1 gigahertz processor and it comes
with 7.2 make a bit HSPA as well so this
you cannot to think of it as a
competitor to the old samsung galaxy s
or even the galaxy s2 probably be them
at the most fitting direct comparison
that's what the market that i think that
LG is going after with this device and
then they're leaving the 4x to compete
presumably with whatever samsung
announces in 2012 so that's a look at
the optimus l7
