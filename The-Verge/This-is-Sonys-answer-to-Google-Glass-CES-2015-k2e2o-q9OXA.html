we're looking at right here is so nice
answer to Google glass this is a concept
only there's actually developer kit
there's a single color that's gonna come
out to developers in March this right
here concept only but it's a full color
display right here in this eye and what
it is right now it's just a prerunner
video but I'm watching the data as you
would see conceptually connected to this
video so right now I am someone with
really nice fingernail polish running
and drinking water all of my face maybe
it's waterproof I don't know but I'm
literally watching the speedometer I'm
seeing the step counter any second now
it's gonna show navigation right now
some will be watching the map like
Google glass you don't see it
straightaway you actually have to look
just up to the right if your peripheral
so obviously the glasses right here are
built-in but the idea of the
smarteyeglass attached is that this
would be something that goes on to your
normal specs it does look really good
actually some really nice-looking
screens a little better than what we see
on Google glass but again what this
looks like when it if it actually does
come out remains to be seen the only
thing that is confirmed to come out is a
smart eyeglass avail for kid that's
actually coming out in March and it's a
full thing looks like 3d glass
essentially it just plays right over
here like bifocals and it's a just one
single color it's actually a really cool
concept that works really well here on
these demos this pre-rendered looks
great we get to see it actually in
action we don't know when we will for
all the crazy future technology and all
the weird wearables check out the
