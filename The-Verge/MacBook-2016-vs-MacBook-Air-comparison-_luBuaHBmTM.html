clear this is not a MacBook Air and it's
not a MacBook Pro it's just MacBook it
was first introduced last year as its
own unique laptop and this is the
MacBook Air considered by many people to
be the gold standard of laptops you
might remember when it was introduced in
2008 because Steve Jobs pulled it out of
an envelope to show how thin it was yeah
interoffice envelopes never looked so
cool now if you're considering one of
these new MacBooks you might be
wondering should I just get one of those
and it's a good question because while
they're both super thin and light and
have great battery life there are some
differences between them and for some
people those differences might be
deal-breakers the first and most obvious
difference between these two is that
this one is available in rose gold it's
not froze cold it's pink it's rose gold
it's not rose gold it's not sunset blush
or autumn dusk or spiked champagne it's
just pink you're just jealous because
that thing doesn't come in rose gold yes
that's right the MacBook Air comes in
silver which is classic also you get
choice with the MacBook Air I could get
an 11 inch model or a 13 inch model
paradox of choice you know what's in
between those two a 12 inch laptop and
that's exactly what this one is yeah but
what about the price this one starts at
$8.99 for an 11 inch model and $9.99 for
a 13 inch model how much does your fancy
just call it a MacBook over there cost
oh this one's $12.99
to start and it goes up to $15.99 that's
expensive
yeah but did I mention that it's Apple's
thinnest laptop ever and also rose gold
a few times actually but really there
are some differences between this new
MacBook and that MacBook Air for one the
MacBook has a Retina display which is
basically a super-duper high-resolution
display so the MacBook Air doesn't ever
run a display but it's still a pretty
nice display well
the 2016 MacBook has been updated to
include a new core M processor based on
the skylake architecture in fact it's
updated performance is one of its
biggest selling points
yeah but the core i5 chip in this
machine is still better plus I get
better battery life with a 13-inch
MacBook Air you get an estimated 12
hours of battery life you get 10 well
the MacBook has a force touch trackpad
which is this crazy technology where you
press on the trackpad and it doesn't
physically move but it feels like it's
moving that's a that's a strange thing
to get excited about also I have a USB
type-c port and that's an even stranger
thing to get that excited about see USB
in general is good for a number of
things it's good for fast data transfers
and fast charging but the problem I have
with the MacBook is that there's just
one port
I repeat just one port so if you want to
do something else like charge your phone
or stick an SD card in there at the same
time you need to use a bunch of adapters
I love adapters you really need to get
out more another small thing worth
noting is that that MacBook is so
compact that the keyboard has a really
shallow key travel which takes some
getting used to oh yeah well when I
close this laptop and hold it up like
this it's so thin and light it's like
holding an iPad I mean this is amazing
design what does your laptop look like
looks like a regular laptop which is
fine I'm sticking with the MacBook Air
it's less expensive and it has more
ports well I'm gonna go take this and
sit in a fancy coffee shop now and see
how many people notice me with it have
fun with your MacBook Air
did you actually paint your nails
rose-gold to match your laptop oh no no
they're just pink</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
