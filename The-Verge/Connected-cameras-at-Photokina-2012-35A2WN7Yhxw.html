biennial trade show that brings together
the latest and best in camera
innovations this year's convention is
still full of big lenses a massive price
tags but it's also playing host to an
increasing number of so-called connected
cameras pretty much every photographer
company now has a model in this range
that comes with Wi-Fi enabled and they
all agree that it's a feature is going
to grow in importance and value
connectivity is becoming very important
we see that a lot of people have
smartphones at the moment and want to
share pictures does it take immediately
if you look at how images to be used in
the world these days this there's always
an ever bigger a requirement for easier
sharing of images so Wi-Fi definitely
enables that process cameras in general
have been I would say a standalone
product but I think people are getting
used to sharing photos wirelessly using
their mobile phones but people are
realizing the fact that you actually
need a better camera to see in person
ever anything I've often wondered why
when mobile phones have had Wi-Fi for
years cameras weren't catching up by
adding what seems like an obvious
feature to content creation device I
would have to say it's probably
technology hurdles most companies making
cameras today are strictly camera
companies and their living off a an
older paradigm legacy architectures
legacy technology that that's kept them
kind of bottled up in a camera path for
technology the priorities for the M
system of a professional use easy to
rangefinder photography so connectivity
for example is not in the foreground
because it's a tool to make professional
pictures and Wi-Fi applications are more
for looking at pictures making a
comfortable at home that's not really
the purpose of that camera nickel was
one of the first manufacturers to
introduce Wi-Fi in the compact camera
segment back in two thousand one already
and now we have come back with actually
one of the first Android enabled cameras
was survived by our coolpix nikon
coolpix s800c evidently for the
connected camera to matter it needs to
be matched by suitably intelligent
software that seems to be the missing
ingredient until now do customers want a
separate user interface experienced or
they want commonality between their
smartphone and their camera and by by
using an android OS we can give them
either either one camera interface is no
me very smart replacing an outright with
a versatility and expandability of
Android makes sense we wanted to offer
something new to the market we wanted to
show that nickel most innovative with
Android you have the amazing opportunity
to share oil pictures you useful the
apps that are available on the App Store
by having an open OS right now this is
the the control interface we have in the
future I would expect customers to be
able to select the control interface and
be able to download it from a developer
and and continue to add on and make it
whatever they want these first attempts
are still very crew and they include
almost no customizations tailored
specifically to cameras until a camera
specific smart OS opposed a number of
companies are trying to get connected by
alternative means Calvin's philosophy at
the moment is we have an oasis in our
cameras that delivers fast performance
high image quality and a good user
experience in a camera
and our adoption of Wi-Fi has been very
much to sync with a smartphone and tease
lies the very capable interface within
the smartphone to enable the transfer of
images so at the moment we're very much
looking at using the best of two worlds
rather than maybe taking a compromise in
adoption of a an unspecified or
optimized OS for now we're going to be
sticking to us on a
I would say a proprietary so it's not
going to be a open source format
continue to develop however additional
applications based on what we feel is
highly demanded by consumers ultimately
everyone's in agreement that notified of
the first smartphones cameras have to
become a little bit like smartphones
themselves in some cases it might have
been struggled to draw a distinguishing
line between the two</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
