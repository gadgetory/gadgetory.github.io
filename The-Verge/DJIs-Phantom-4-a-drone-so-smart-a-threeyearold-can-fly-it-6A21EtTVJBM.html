Verge okay wait Alec can you wait two
seconds okay thank you just take a deep
breath you're getting interview hey
everybody its Ben popper with the Virg
I'm here trying out the new DJI phantom
4 and we're seeing if somebody like this
guy can learn how to pilot using all the
new autonomous features so I've been
flying drones for about three years now
and I've gotten pretty comfortable using
a to stick controller but for a lot of
people that can be a big hurdle to
actually getting up in the air and
enjoying flying okay so this is Kirsten
she's gonna fly our new very expensive
drone of which we have only one and she
doesn't know how to use a to stick
controller but she does know how to tap
on a screen did you bring a screen with
you
I brought the biggest screen I can find
so with the new phantom you can turn on
obstacle avoidance this prevents you
from running into something you can turn
on tap to fly where you just tap on the
screen and the drone heads off in
whatever direction you pick and you can
turn on a feature which tracks the
subject so you draw a circle around them
and it will automatically follow them
so this seems like the future of drones
you're just gonna be pointing and
clicking and telling the drone where to
go using a touchscreen unfortunately
right now you can't just fully use the
point-and-click features to control you
have to actually have someone there with
the sticks that can help you do some of
the more complicated movements so
overall I would say the new features are
a great starter kit for people have
never flown before we can get up in the
air they can manage one shot they can
return home safely they can feel
confident they won't get in a crash
right now they can see going forward
they can see what's below them pretty
soon they'll be able to see in 360
degrees and beyond that I feel like
they'll start to add additional senses
they'll be able to hear and see in
different colors and help us create in
ways we can't even imagine yet right
buddy all right wait let me take your
microphone out what why because it's
dragging on the ground</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
