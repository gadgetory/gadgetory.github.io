new moto G so this is the follow-up to
Motorola's best-selling smartphone ever
which was last year's Moto G it's super
cheap it's designed to be like a
high-end smartphone for everyone all
over the world there's a few big changes
to this phone the biggest one literally
and figuratively is the five inch screen
it's now five inch 720p display it looks
really good it's an LCD it has nice
viewing angles there's nothing terribly
special about it but it's a good screen
the other thing is all sort of small
changes to the way that this works
Motorola says they've spent a lot of
time with customers talking about what
they want in a phone and then built all
that into here so one of them is these
two speakers there now front-facing and
they're much louder they actually sound
really good
the other big thing behind their
removable back here this is another
important thing for Motorola is having
interchangeable backs they have 15 of
them now and they tell me that there are
actually people who buy all 15 and
changed them all the time but anyway
behind that is now an SD card slot
motorola says it found that people use
the SD cards to trade information to
send things back and forth between
devices and not having a slot in some
developing markets was a real problem
for this device so now it's here so
really this now has most of the
trappings of your average smartphone
these days
it has a lot less than the Moto X it
doesn't have any of the cool voice
features it doesn't have some of the
always-on display stuff but it's just a
very standard stock Android smartphone
it seems to work really well it's pretty
fast it has a quad-core processor these
are the amazing things that you can get
with a hundred and $79 smartphone now it
works pretty well it's there's nothing
terribly special about it again it's
just basic sort of stock Android but
it's a solid smart phone and for $179
which is what this costs and it's all
over the world and it's hugely popular
in a bunch of different markets this is
about as good as you're gonna do for the
price it's the new Moto G it's coming
all over the world and it's pretty
interesting for Motorola
