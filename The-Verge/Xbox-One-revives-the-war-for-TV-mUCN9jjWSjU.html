with a huge focus on entertainment naps
an additional development environment
based on Windows 8 that sits next to the
traditional high powered game console
but since then all they've really talked
about is the games we haven't seen a lot
of the new dashboard we haven't seen
much of those apps and we certainly
haven't seen much more of the TV
integration which sits on top of an
existing cable box a strategy we haven't
really seen since
well the Google TV that leaves a lot of
open questions as the Xbox one moves
towards launch so we're here at Studio A
on Microsoft's campus to talk to the
team behind the Xbox one see what they
think of this platform where it is now
and where it might go think back to 2004
we're working on 360 in a completely
different world no smartphones no
tablets no app stores all that stuff
what you do in a box is just play one
game
it runs one thing at a time and I don't
know if most people realize this but in
a console like 360 when you switch games
you reboot the box it's constantly
rebooting into the into the game now
come forward to you know when we were
thinking about Xbox one in this a
different world this devices everywhere
the next-generation gamer is a
multitasker and you sit there and you
realize as an operating system designer
that you have this attention you've got
the customer the next-gen gamer wants to
do lots of things all at the same time
and they want to have something that
changes and grows and evolves but the
game developer wants a very consistent
box they want to know what's going to
run exactly the same way every single
time so they can optimize the art and
have it work as well as it possibly can
and it's really hard to come up with one
Ã´s settle serve both so in a way you
could say we gave up and well let's make
two operating systems one aimed at the
at the interactive growing evolving
world and one aimed squarely at the game
developer so you've been saying that you
are running three different operating
systems on the hood right you've got
three different platforms happening
which one is this is this sitting on top
of it doesn't matter doesn't matter
because it all just works for people
they don't have to think about what
operating system is where it is
definitely an incredible technological
achievement that we've been able to
build all of this power yeah into a
system that this that's the simple well
so the reason I asked that question is
does this looks a lot like Windows 8
notice like Windows Phone and there's
obviously a lot of conversions happening
there is definitely and so
design language but I think when people
see this I think oh windows and they're
like there's an expectation those new
windows II things is that how you think
of it no you know we don't necessarily
think of it necessarily as Windows these
things the things that we think are
really important is it's great to have a
common design language so the people
feel at home you want it to be a
familiar experience but we really put
entertainment front and center on your
television screen
no TV is super interesting because it's
one of the technologies that kind of hit
this good enough point like a long time
ago
once the remotes win cordless and we got
rid of the dials on TVs and then DVR
came along we've kind of been there for
a while and people like it I mean I
could go on about TV I think that's
particularly exciting how do apps mix in
with what a show is and what's the
what's the changing nature of a show and
what you'll see in the beginning is is
the basics you know can you continue
hook up the cable can you get channels
to go is this the heart and soul of your
TV experience I believe it's the heart
and soul of your living room experience
more TV is an integral part of that you
know in the u.s. people watch have four
hours and 35 minutes of TV per day 35
hours a week so if you want to be the
soul of the living room you really have
to have a great TV experience otherwise
people will just be switching him out on
inputs right here's how it works
if you're like most people your cable
box is plugged into the first input on
your TV and a game console like the Xbox
360 is plugged into the second input to
switch from watching shows to playing
games you've got to pick up the remote
and switch inputs and a 360 doesn't know
anything about what's on your TV but the
Xbox one is designed to change that your
cable box plugs into the Xbox and the
Xbox plugs into your TV so watching TV
is the same as before but now the Xbox
operating system is always active and
can overlay your TV signal that means
you don't have to switch inputs to play
games anymore and you can just dive
right in but it also means you can get
notification it's like game invites and
Skype calls while you're watching shows
and you can treat TV almost like another
app you can even snap to the side of the
screen while you play a game but while
that's a clever move to make sure the
Xbox one is always active and always
available it's still kind of a hack the
Xbox one doesn't know what you cave
walks is actually doing you still have
to use your clunky cable interface to
manage the DVR and watch on demand and
the only way for the Xbox controller
Kame boxes by blasting ir commands out
of the new Kinect kind of like the
world's most expensive universal remote
control nothing about this is
particularly clean but even getting next
to TV is a big deal if the Xbox one is
going to take over your living room and
Microsoft is betting that this first
step will open the door to even better
integration sometime in the future
generally when people get cable or
satellite there's an installer that
comes to their house that gets it all
set up and for most people that I can
never touch it again
so we spent a lot of time on this first
experience to try to make it easy as
possible and the first thing we'll ask
you is what is your brand and when I
click Next what we do is we know what
the best command is to understand how to
control your TV so in this case for
Samsung it happens to be mute and yes
that worked and now we know how to talk
to your TV oh wow you know I want to set
up set up one guide gonna ask me for my
zip code I click enter and ask me who my
TV provider is and it only knows the
ones in my zip code right and then it's
gonna ask me which is my TV lineup right
isn't there a element of this where this
is like you're definitely like building
the most refined version of like the
Future Passed like this is the best
universal remote control ever made it
required an AMD processor and like like
windows so I can make this finally work
at this simply like thank God but
shouldn't you be using all this
technology to like really integrate this
stuff and I know I've asked you this
question before in like 15 different
ways it's it's when you see this setup
and you that's like it took all of this
work to make it this this process this
simple there is no one on your team it
was like guys let's just call Comcast's
and ask them if we can pipe in the cable
signal directly oh no I mean I look at
this as a band yeah I think it's not
it's not an or I'm gonna do one or the
other this gets the TV experience Xbox
one and one guy into everyone's hands
hub and then we'll continue to work with
people on in-depth partnerships whether
it be cable or satellite providers at
partners some you'll see like you saw
today are integrated in from from launch
on some we'll see emerge you know in
year 5 of the program right this is this
is the launch of the new generation
so I can just say Xbox watch TV TV Xbox
one guide
there's your programming guide what's on
the Discovery Channel it's gonna jump to
the Discovery Channel
I can just say watch the show mm-hmm
watch this channel and it's gonna change
a channel right to the Discovery Channel
so this is the thing I have a complain
about which is it's showing me the
Comcast guy there it goes right we are
we are definitely watching TV right
through your Comcast box that you
already have in your living room there
are some walls that you're gonna have a
TV right I mean you can't search the DVR
do you have any facility for searching
your DVR this is a place where you can
pick up your set top box remote and you
use TV like you always have which you
can do with the Xbox TV experience and
then we're looking forward to shortly
after release having smart glasses
available as well so you can use your
interact with your set-top box through
smart box what goes through your mind
when you see the one guide changing
channel and a Comcast channel banner go
up does that look like the future to you
or is that a compromise that you guys
back
I think it's an expression of the
reality of the technology that's a
market today yeah now absolutely we talk
to Comcast and absolutely we talk to
everybody but there's a tremendous
inertia of hardware that's in market and
you cannot go and ask everybody to just
go and spend several hundred dollars and
replace all their boxes and come up with
new protocols it's that's not our
reality right so you have to do so you
have to come up with a plan that works
with the install base and does the best
job that possibly can with the machines
that people have and is intended to be
upgraded over time so as new hardware
comes along and new services come along
from these providers it can be more
integrated and they can look as good as
it possibly can yeah right so you've got
to take that first step to get it out
and to start the conversation but it is
a conversation and it will continue over
time so now join me this is right built
in the guide it's showing me what's on
all these various services including the
NFL we have an NFL partnership and
what's on your SkyDrive which is very
interesting so this is my SkyDrive which
store you loaded on Xbox go to Internet
Explorer
and it's a jump right in and Explorer so
I started playing Forza 5 before any of
this happened I logged out in the middle
of the lap and now I can actually it's
for the motorsport 5
yep so I can say Xbox go to Forza
Motorsport 5 Xbox go to Forza Motorsport
5 a.m. you're always talking at
households you're always talking my
families and secondary users which is in
like fat like I think a lot of people
have Xbox is plugged into a TV in the
basement and that's it that's the TV
that runs the Xbox so you're like you're
elevating this to like sit in front of
an entire family not necessarily like
three college kids in a dorm room right
I mean you're making a play for a family
that has a cable subscription is that is
that the target that's it we want
something for everyone I think we'll
have a great service for the three guys
in the dorm room and we round up those
guys for a very specific follow-up
question about it oh great well your
work through a haze of weed smoke I
think you'll be amazed of the power of
Laster and so will they especially in
that state the game side is very much
there's all kinds of horsepower we've
seen developers game developers go
through this kind of transition the
demos are amazing right that feels
familiar in a way and it should feel
familiar right right you want to
continue the legacy of consoles always
getting better in games always looking
bigger but that that shared side that
yeah that app side is really interesting
and you can see lots of evolution and
lots of change there so so Windows after
Oliver as I can just publish the windows
oh yeah totally
and like throw it out there if you know
how to write an app for Windows you know
how to write an app for Xbox one the big
disruptive animation for television
right and even the Xbox one requires a
cable box with a pretty crappy UI to get
the full experience on it
so what hoaxes are you giving developers
to enable kind of a big innovation well
again it's those app channels you think
sad yeah the app channels is where you
can mix in hooking up with your content
and bi-directional communication
real-time bi-directional communication
from your servers to the end client and
have it mixed into a guide that makes
sense
right so let's let's look at one of the
trends and TV shows right you've got a
lot of you know I'm gonna call them
interactive TV shows think to our show
where a lot of contestants come on and
they do their thing and then followed by
a one-hour voting window where everyone
picks up their phone and yeah and then
and then there's a one-hour show
afterwards of the results those are
video games yeah right they're not TV
shows the video games now what could you
do with those if you actually had a bite
a real-time bi-directional communication
with the end consumer does it have to be
a one-hour voting window can it be a
24-hour voting window what could you do
to change the nature of that program
where they don't know the end result
yeah way in advance right that's super
interesting I think we still have 10
years of learning and innovation and
improvement that are ahead of us I mean
if you look at the leaps that we've made
in just three years you know look at you
know the technology that we had when
Kinect first launched with what we're
shipping with Xbox one like this is just
the beginning you know we're not slowing
down if anything we're accelerating so
to assume that we've got hey this is the
best and greatest right now you know
what I don't think that will survive for
all time when you launch a new console
you've got a tremendous amount of work
to do right and you take on as much as
you possibly can and you just just about
kill yourself trying to get the thing
out the door yeah right and you can't do
any more than that and you lay a good
foundation for the future now you've got
ten years to play this thing out and to
keep innovating and to keep coming up
with new technologies and new ways of
having experiences so I view this as
step one and the beauty of Xbox one is
that it is going to change that is the
bet is that it is going to change and
evolve and improve over time and that
these experiences we're all going to get
flushed out and we can't declare what
they are we have to work with content
partners
yeah and together we'll explore this
territory and we've built the platform
which is all about embracing that change
and that's I find that very exciting so
the clock is ticking but a countdown
isn't necessarily to a completely
finished product but rather to the
release of a platform a platform in
Microsoft itself acknowledges will grow
and change over the next 10 years what's
it gonna look like at the end I don't
really know
sometimes I get the sense that Microsoft
doesn't really know but the overwhelming
sense here in studio a is that that
change is what's gonna make the Xbox one
stronger and stronger over time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
