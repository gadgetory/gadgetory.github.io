here and today I'm taking a look at the
new polar m600 wearable so at first
glance the thing looks a lot like a
Fitbit surge but there's one key
difference between the Fitbit surge and
this tippet surge is a sports watch that
happened to have some SmartWatch
features and the polar m600 is being
categorized as a SmartWatch with a whole
bunch of Fitness features so here's the
new polar polar has three lines of risk
wearables there's the V line which is
generally for elite athletes the M line
which is for fitness enthusiasts and
then the a line which is more for you
know a lifestyle device this is an M 600
so this is kind of their mid-range
activity tracking device but like I said
it's a SmartWatch so it's actually
running on an Android OS before I get
into that let's just talk about the
build very quickly this is big not gonna
lie there are two physical buttons here
this one is a quick access button that
will take you to a couple of the menu
options and this over here is a back
button there are also six optical heart
rate sensors underneath and there's
built in GPS which is what you would
expect from a company like polar there's
also a microphone in here so you can
respond to certain notifications using
your voice so let's take a look at what
this tracks we've got open water swim
because it is fully waterproof and will
track your swimming which is great
running mountain biking Road Cycling
there's also indoor cycling I believe
hiking other outdoor activities strength
training pool swim I mean this it just
keeps going and then if you swipe left
you can see all of the Smart Watch stuff
so you've got Shazam and demondo it
syncs data to Google fit you can run
Google Maps there's a Spotify app on
here so all that good stuff
polar is not the first wearable maker to
make a sport watch that is running on
Android wear but one of the sacrifices
that you make when you have a sport
watch that's a SmartWatch is generally
battery life polar says that you can
expect to get about 48 hours of battery
life if you're using this watch with an
Android smartphone if you are running
Android wear and the polar flow app on
iOS so you're syncing this to an iPhone
you're going to get around 24 hours
battery life so compared to a lot of you
know fitness devices
that's not great but it's in line with
what you can get from smart watches all
of the data from this watch and other
polar products is going to sync with the
polar flow app which is free on Android
and iOS this is a relatively new feature
that Polar's introduced that we're
looking at right now called polar coach
where your coach or trainer can actually
see whether or not even working out and
see some of the intensity levels of your
workouts and weigh in on that but this
is also where you're going to control
all the settings and all of the apps
that you want to run on your polar watch
the new polar and 600 costs $329 and
Chips sometime in the third quarter this
year that we don't know exactly what so
stay tuned to the verge for more it's in
a crazy summer of wearables are so many
wearables out there now the first glance
this thing looks a lot like a Fitbit
surge but there is one key difference oh
my god the tripod doesn't work</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
