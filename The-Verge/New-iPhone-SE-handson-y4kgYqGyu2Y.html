can you tell these two iPhones apart one
of them is a few years old it's an
iPhone 5 and one of them is brand-new is
the iPhone se just the SE no number on
it and as you can see they've designed
it to be almost identical to the old
4-inch model of the iPhone all the way
down to even the camera doesn't stick
out any differently so the iPhone se
I'll speak with the camera first it has
a 12 megapixel camera same camera as
you'll get on an iPhone success which is
great because it's really fast and it
takes really really really good photos
and it will even take live codecs but
you'll notice I have two actually this
long press instead of 3d touch in order
to get it it doesn't have three in touch
but what it does have is the same
processor in general internals from the
iPhone success that means that things
are really really fast we can swipe
through apps really really quickly we
can do gaming really well so it's gaming
and otherwise just you know use it like
an iPhone and that's at the end of the
day what it is it's an iPhone it works
really well it works well if you have
small hands or don't want a giant phone
now it starts at a 16 gigabyte model
which I know is a bummer that cost 399
you can also spend more to get more
memory if you like and it's going to be
available on March 31st if you'd like to
see more videos about the iPhone or
about a whole lot of Technology you
