legacy is almost upon us now I'd like to
talk about i phone a couple of you may
have been expecting those I'm Nathan
psycho and this is 90 seconds on the
verge it's been almost seven years and
Apple unveiled its first iPhone the
company has released at least one new
device every year since 2007 last year
released 2 and it likes to maintain an
illusion of secrecy apple's flagship
devices of a pretty good track record of
leaking ahead of major events right now
we're hearing a lot about the next
iphone here's what we know so far Apple
is reportedly working on two new iPhones
with larger screens most sources point
to 4.7 and 5.5 inch models in cases
suggested design more like the ipod
touch and possibly as thin as six
millimeters the larger model is also
expected to boast a display that runs at
a sharper 1704 x 960 resolution other
rumors point to an improved camera which
isn't that surprising and some potential
new uses for its fingerprint sensor but
if you are expecting to see these new
devices at next month's World Wide
Developers Conference you're probably
going to have to wait a little longer
rumors are somewhat divided here but
Apple is not expected to show up any new
hardware at WWDC event will reportedly
focused on the revamp OS 10 and the new
iOS 8 which is likely to include a
health book app and an updated Apple
maps and if Apple's report a 3.2 billion
dollar acquisition of beats happens in
time we may also see an appearance by
you Apple executives dr. dre and jimmy
iovine for more on apple check out the
verge coming up Tim Cook cancels
production on the iphone 6 saying why
can't you guys just be happy with the
phone we gave you last year</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
