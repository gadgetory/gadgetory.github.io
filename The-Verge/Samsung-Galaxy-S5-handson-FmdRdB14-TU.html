we are here in Barcelona Spain checking
out the Samsung Galaxy s5 this is the
company's latest flagship smartphone it
really looks very similar to the s4 it's
got a very similar design language with
rounded corners metal trim alongside the
only major difference with the hardware
here is actually on the back the back
features a new soft touch finish with a
dimpled pattern it really feels a lot
nicer than Samsung's older glossy
finishes it feels very similar to the
note 3 without the leather look but
otherwise it feels pretty much just like
the galaxy s4 in your hand hardware wise
it's a little bit different it's got a
5.1 inch display they've got a
capacitive button for multitasking here
and a new fingerprint scanning home
button on the front there on the back
it's got a 16 megapixel camera an LED
flash and a new heart rate sensor that
uses your fingertip to measure your
heart rate you could still take the back
cover off to access the battery the SIM
card slot it's got a micro SD card slot
as well 2800 milliamp hour battery the
Samsung says gives 20% better battery
life than the Galaxy s4 inside the
galaxy s5 has a quad-core processor it's
2.5 gigahertz 2 gigabytes of RAM it's
really fast and responsive from our
brief tests really no lag that we can
particularly see the interface here is
definitely very familiar to Samsung
users there are some slight differences
if you swipe over from the home screen
you can access the my magazine feature
which was available with a swipe up in
the note 3 but otherwise it's a pretty
standard homescreen the settings menu
looks a little different the tabs are
gone for a more icon based approach and
it is running Android 4.4.2 but
otherwise it's definitely a Samsung
phone it's got all Samsung's apps and
helpers and things like that the new
thing here is s-health
has been greatly improved in addition to
the heart rate sensor on the back it's
got a new exercise coach and pedometer
things like that and it has the ability
to be expanded with third-party apps
that can tap into an SDK that Samsung
will be releasing soon
the heart rate sensor uses the sensor on
the back here and you just place your
fingertip on it and then it will give
you a reading for your heart rate in
about five to ten seconds you can see my
heart rate there
Samsung's gonna be releasing the galaxy
s5 in a variety of different colored
backs there's blue black gold and white
depending on which market that release
depends on which color will be available
initially in the United States we're
going to see the black and white models
Samsung doesn't have a pricing announced
for the galaxy s5 but says that we
should expect it to see it on shelves in
April</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
