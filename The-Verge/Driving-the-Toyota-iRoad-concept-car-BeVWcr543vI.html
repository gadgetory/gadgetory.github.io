are at CES 2014 in Las Vegas you know
one of the great things about CES is
that all sorts of companies call us and
they want us to check out the stuff that
they're working on and we got a call
from Toyota to come out to a remote
location in the desert and drive a new
type of vehicle the company has been
talking about and is excited about and
that vehicle is this it's called the I
road it's a double passenger electric
vehicle that leans when you turn and is
designed for congested cities it's
basically like a hybrid of a motorcycle
and a car and they're going to let me
drive it which is awesome
okay oh yeah oh this is the car of the
future right here oh boy this is
terrifying
it turns very wide and it's surprising
that it's not tip it over
the car feels incredibly light it does
not feel like a motorcycle at all in the
sense that you're definitely inside of a
vehicle you're seated as you would be in
a car the handling is extremely
sensitive I'd go so far as to say touchy
though this is a prototype as far as
comfort goes for being a really tall guy
in a really small car this is pretty
comfortable it's definitely not the kind
of thing you could take on a very long
drive you would not want to get on this
thing on a highway and you probably
wouldn't want to spend several hours in
this car but for a daily commute if
you're going from work to the office and
it's only a few miles this seems like an
incredible alternative to a motorcycle
it really responds quickly to your moves
turning is a little bit terrifying in it
it actually feels at times like it's
going to tip over but Toyota claims this
thing is essentially untypical even as
you round very tight turns it leans
heavily but it does not actually tip
over which is great for me because I'm
inside the car and tipping over seems
like a really bad thing to do when
you're inside a car I went into this a
little bit skeptical and I am pleasantly
surprised this is awesome I want to take
one of these home right now in fact if I
could drive this off a lot and get it
onto a flatbed and take it to New York
I'd do it in a heartbeat although I have
to say I am getting a little bit
nauseous doing this dirt
I think I found my next car and that car
is not really a car at all
it's a weird car motorcycle hybrid
called the I road that you can't buy in
America and will probably never be able
to buy in America because Americans are
frankly too big to fit inside the I rode
at the Toyota I rode I'll see you in the
future
