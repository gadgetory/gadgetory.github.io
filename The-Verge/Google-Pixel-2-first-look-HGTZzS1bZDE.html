serious about this whole make hardware
to compete directly with Apple thing
what about the fact that they just hired
2,000 engineers from HTC to make phones
and what about the fact that they're
releasing two phones today and what
about the fact that these phones have
actually really bold design and they may
already have incredibly good cameras and
they feel more like Google phones than
they do Android phones you see this is
the pixel - and this is the pixel -
Excel and looking at these two phones
I'll tell you what Google is very
serious about making hardware so as I
already said there's two models the
pixel two has a 5-inch screen it's got
these squared off corners and these
giant bezels on the top on the bottom
while the pixel 2xl has a much larger
6-inch screen
the corners of the screen are rounded
and you know it still has some bezels on
the top of the bottom of it now before
we get too far into it I want to talk
about the aesthetics of these phones
Google decided to keep the glass shade
and well you might not like it it's
definitely an identifiable as a pixel
and there are lots of little design
touches here that are just kind of fun I
mean look at these neon power buttons
and the glass shade I mean this white
one is black so it's got this whole
stormtrooper vibe but look I'm just
gonna say it
these phones are not as flashy as the
Galaxy s8 or even the iPhone - head for
example the screens aren't truly edged
edie they've got those big bezels that I
mentioned but they're here for a reason
it's cuz they're front-facing stereo
speakers inside there overall I think
it's fair to say that these phones are
more utilitarian or pragmatic than other
flagship smartphones if I had to pick a
single word to describe the design I'd
actually go with Scandinavian like a
piece of IKEA furniture or a Playmobil
toy or a Volvo or Lego it's more
whimsical than it is glitzy and it's
designed to work both phones are
available for pre-order right away and
they'll be shipping on October 19th
the smaller pixel two comes in three
colors blue black and white it starts at
six hundred and forty nine dollars for
64 gigs of storage the pixel 2 XL comes
in just black and white and it's 814
nine dollars you can get 128 gig
versions of either one for 100 bucks
more Google is partnering with Verizon
again but you'll also be able to get
them unlocked directly from Google the
companies told me that it's gonna do its
best to make enough of them and it has
finally upgraded its online store so
that you can pre-order even if the thing
is out of stock to hold your place in
line let's start cameras now it's way
way too early for me to truly judge the
quality these cameras but I have been
using them for a little bit with
pre-production software and I'm already
impressed the color accuracy the detail
and the texture all seem really good
even on the selfie camera oh and I
should point out that both cameras on
both sides on both phones are identical
you get the same camera whichever phone
you choose on the back is a 12 megapixel
sensor with just the barest of camera
bumps it's got an F 1.8 lens and optical
image stabilization it also has these
things that are called dual pixels and
they're actually the key to what Google
has done to improve this camera
basically dual pixels means that every
pixel on the camera sensor is actually 2
pixels that helps with focus but it also
means that there's just a lot more
information for the camera processor to
work with and google loves information
the cameras are fast and they take
really good photos but Google can use
all that information to do some crazy
new stuff so it can do portrait mode on
both the front and the rear sensors
using its algorithms to nicely cut
around hair and blur in the background
but those dual pixels also let it do
portrait mode with any object instead of
two lenses that are half an inch apart
like you get on an iPhone it's using
data from two pixels that are less than
a micron apart the pixels also have some
other camera tricks there's something
that mimics Apple's live photos so you
can record a tiny 3 second movie with
every single shot you take but Google
analyzes the clip and tries to match the
beginning in the end to make a better
loop and also to cut out blurry movement
it's also going to build augmented
reality stickers directly into the
camera app so if you really want that
selfie with a Demi Gorgon from stranger
things you can go to town and so far the
features here really do seem to work
Google has made all these camera
improvements by adding a ton of machine
learning to the system
and when you're recording a video it's
algorithms view the standard electronic
image stabilization but they've turned
on the optical image stabilizer because
it's able to track its motion in real
time too and combine all that
information together in real time it's a
very smart camera now again this is not
a final verdict we need to do the review
but last year's pixel had the best
camera if you get in a smartphone and
this rich pixel I don't know I think it
has a chance of keeping the crown let's
talk about the rest of the specs on
these things they both have qualcomm
snapdragon 835 processors paired to 4
gigs of ram they use USB C for charging
and no they don't have headphone jacks
but a dongle comes in the box
there are however front-facing speakers
on both models that don't just get loud
but do so without distorting the sound
all to hell
they have bluetooth 5.0 and support a
bunch of new Bluetooth codecs and they
also do auto pairing with certain
headphones just like apples ear pods do
the phones are made out of aluminum and
Gorilla Glass 5 and unfortunately that
means they don't support wireless
charging but they do support fast
charging google says their ip67
resistant which means that their splash
proof but they're not really fully
waterproof really the only notable
difference between these two phones are
the screens the pixel 2 has a 1920 by
1080 screen and the to excel is 28 80 by
1440 which is an 18 by 9 tall aspect
ratio google says that it's using the
sRGB color space if you care about that
and it's also really proud of this
100,000 to 1 contrast ratio it has 4
super deep blacks we can't say if
they're gonna actually be any better
than what you'll get on a Samsung or an
iPhone 10 but they do look pretty good
to me and you know this is as good a
place as any dimension that Google is
also releasing a new version of its
daydream view VR headset that works with
these phones they have new lenses that
are sharper and give a wider field of
view
they've been redesigned to let in less
ambient light and there's a top strap
too if you'd be wearing them for a long
time there's even a new heatsink on the
flap that draws heat away from the phone
that's all I'm gonna say about them
though because I have a family member
that works for a competitor but expect a
full review from addy Robertson very
soon
Google's also doing a lot of Google
things on the
- mainly in the south where it's added a
new gimmick that lets you quickly launch
the Google assistant by squeezing the
phone it takes some getting used to the
trick is to squeeze it really fast like
you're hitting a button that grip it's
super hard like you're trying to crush
it I don't know I think it's fine the
pixel - is also getting the first access
to google lens it's a button inside the
Photos app and inside the Google
assistant that can identify real world
objects with the camera and lets you
search the web for them so to start
Google is only promising that it's going
to be able to identify a limited set of
objects stuff like books and movie
posters and landmarks it definitely
worked in a book when I tried it but you
can also point it at random stuff too if
you want and it might have a shot at
working I pointed it at my watch and it
recognized that it was a watch but it
couldn't tell what kind of watch it was
and finally as it does with every single
release Google is messing around with
the home screen and adding some more
custom features this time the button to
search Google has been integrated at the
bottom on the app dock and then up top
there's a new at-a-glance widget that
will show your next appointment there
now better live wallpapers that are
basically like little movie clips on
your home screen and last but not least
Google has updated the camera software
it integrates a little bit better with
Google photos now are these the world's
most powerful phones that they don't
have the world's most powerful processor
and they definitely don't have the
world's most amazing screen where Apple
and Samsung can hit you in the face with
hardware advances Google has to play a
more subtle game like I said before
where these other companies are flashing
Google if being pragmatic
but it is trying to take advantage of
the strengths that Google does have the
assistant the home screen the camera all
the machine learning all of it is there
so that Google's algorithms can figure
stuff out for you automatically and
that's always been Google's promise let
the AI make things better not just the
hardware we'll find out if Google is
right about all that on October 19th
when they go on sale</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
