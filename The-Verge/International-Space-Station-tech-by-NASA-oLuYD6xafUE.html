and Loren grush we're here at NASA's
booth at CES 2016 it's the first time
that nASA has been at the conference
before and they're showcasing a lot of
the technologies that they use on the
International Space Station then
hopefully on Mars some day we're such
big space turn so we had to come check
out everything that they have here so
we're about to go take a look at it
rubbing out if you're ready give me a
thumbs up that works so I'm about to see
the SLS rocket fire this thing's not
going to fire for a couple years but
this is NASA's next gigantic rocket that
will hopefully take people to Mars in
for us I think we hope maybe the moons
on it but definitely openly to Mars I'm
really close to sing at the very bottom
you don't want to be here when it takes
off the coolant is firing getting the
Rockets ready to go and now I'm being
lifted in the air packs of magical
sleigh or something I've got a countdown
going in my ears oh this is so cool
we've only seen renders of this thing
but this is the most realistic version I
think anybody's really probably seen so
far not to just started building this
thing so it's not actually even done yet
15 t minus 15 all right here we go Oh t
minus dou u minus 10 I'm gonna leave oh
god that's dizzying five four three oh
that's operated the good far oh my dark
did we run out of funding
so this is Billy Allen and he built this
mock-up robot the Curiosity rover but
tell me a little bit about this guy so
this Rover is it's sort of a traveling
rover that goes with NASA and JPL to
public events like elementary schools
middle schools high schools it's meant
to be kid-friendly open for people to
approach it interact with the rover look
at it because when you're thinking of
Rovers that are on Mars it's like you
get those pictures that are back that
are really cool you can't quite imagine
like what is actually going on short of
the pictures so it's cool to see
something in real life that can drive
around this guy's on remote control it's
got a camera it as sensors that will
tell what's around it we've been we've
been teaching it recently to drive
autonomously so I could drive around and
avoid running into things so you
couldn't be bothered to bring the actual
rover from the actual y-axis here is
like this big it's really really big I
mean he really wanted to be impressive
NC yet so this is a consumer electronics
show so how much is this going for and
when can we buy it so unfortunately 2016
I close my eyes it's almost like I'm on
Mars wait I found water guys we found
water so as sean and i have demonstrated
we don't necessarily meet the
qualifications to be NASA ash nuts but
here at the CES booth we've got the next
best thing picture sent astron
so for more from CES 2016 and the NASA
booth head to the verse calm and go to
youtube.com / / click Subscribe appeal
so how's your day going Lauren actually
it feels kinda nice little weird if
you're better than those massage chairs
I'm not psyched about I'm not psyched
about this carpet though I don't know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
