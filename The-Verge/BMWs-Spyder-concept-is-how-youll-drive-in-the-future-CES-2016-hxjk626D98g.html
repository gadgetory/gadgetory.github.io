standing in front of the BMW eye vision
future interaction concept that's a
mouthful all you really need to know is
that it's an IH Spyder that they put a
bunch of crazy technology inside of so
it has a new instrument cluster that is
3d it kind of has two levels one on top
of the other it's kind of hard to
explain there's a 21 inch display in
front of the passenger and the way the
driver interacts with that display is
where it gets really cool because you
just kind of wave your hand around in
space and when you point it something on
the display the car knows you're
pointing at it and then you can kind of
push to select it or you can touch the
steering wheel to select it your choice
unfortunately this is a static demo it's
not actually working on this car but you
can kind of get the idea of what they're
going for and obviously diet is a
production car this is just without a
roof now BMW is a few other things here
as well there is a helmet for motorcycle
riders that has a heads-up display built
into it there's a window in front of one
of the riders eyes and you can show a
bunch of different information in that
you can show collision avoidance
warnings speed fuel phone notifications
that sort of thing it's powered by two
batteries that give you about five hours
of life they're also showing a connected
year now this is a physical mirror a
pretty large where they would go and say
your bathroom or the employer of your
house and it shows status of your car so
you can see
where the car is right now you can see
the camera inside of it you can see the
surroundings and you can select
different routes if say you need to go
to work in the morning you can choose to
browse your computer and modes of
transportation see how long they take so
this car this is wider that I'm standing
in front of is brought together with
your smartphones or thing the BMW is
calling BMW connected which isn't very
google-able but you'll just have to
trust me that's what it's called but
basically this this app gives you a
bunch of insight into what the car is
doing battery level fuel range that sort
of thing you can summon the car to you
if it's autonomous you can send the car
away if it needs to be parked and that
brings me to the final demo of BMW at
CES 2016 which is that they're showing
an i3 a self-parking i3 which we
actually saw at CES 2015 but the
difference is that this time around it's
gesture controlled to cause the car to
park itself so you wear a SmartWatch and
when you get out of the car there's a
gesture you kind of wave the car away
and it parks itself in a spot so kind of
a parlor trick no reason you can't just
press a button on your watch or your
phone or your key fob to park the car
but still pretty cool so that's about it
from BMW at CES 2016 a lot more CES
coverage coming up today and later this
week so stay tuned and subscribe to our
youtube channel at the birds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
