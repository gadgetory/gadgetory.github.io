here in San Diego looking at HTC's vibe
VR headset right now they have this
truck over here we're gonna start
touring around the country and giving
people demos of the developer kit of the
vibe headset the demos about half an
hour long is showing off four different
things and basically you put on the
headset and they hand you two different
controllers when we sell the controllers
a few months back they had wires on them
they've now been improved they're
Wireless so the way the headset works is
that there's two boxes in the corner of
the room shooting out lasers and all
these little sensors on the front of it
track that and that allows you to move
around the room other than that it's
fairly similar to the other virtual
reality headsets that we've seen like
oculus or Morpheus but the big
difference is that because it's tracking
you throughout the room you can actually
move around a little bit and look over
things and kind of interact with things
in free space there are also sensors
covering the two wireless controllers
and that allows it to track where your
hands are and what you're reaching a big
point of this tour and these demos is to
show people that virtual reality is more
than about gaming if Cece is showing
four different demos to cover a wide
variety of subjects one is storytelling
one is painting one of the demos you got
to act as a chef and on one part it was
a game but there's also being called a
job simulator and the idea is that you
could potentially learn skills through
virtual reality HTC wants to have this
on sale starting this holiday season
hasn't said what it's gonna cost yet or
precisely when people will be able to
get it but it's gonna start to detail a
lot more of that probably around October
if you haven't experienced virtual
reality so far and this truck is coming
to a city near you you should definitely
check it out it's a really fun way to
see what virtual reality is capable of
and in particular what the vive headset
is gonna be like when we find out more
about it later this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
