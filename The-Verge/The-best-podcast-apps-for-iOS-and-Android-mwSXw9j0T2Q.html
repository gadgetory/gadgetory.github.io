lot about us
from serial and this American life to
the Nerdist WTF and savage love if
you've got time to listen it for the
commute to work or to make your gym
workout go by a little bit faster
there's a podcast for you but how you
listen makes all the difference when it
comes to enjoying podcast as a whole the
simple truth is that Apple's built-in
app just isn't very good and Android
doesn't even come with its own podcast
app good podcast apps make it easy to
find new shows keep track of every
episode and make listening effortless
thankfully the App Store and Google Play
have you covered if you've got an iPhone
or iPad the best podcast app is overcast
overcast is a clean straight or design
that's easy to use but more importantly
it's got some really nice features that
focus on listening smart speed gets rid
of silent moments and dead air in your
podcasts and that cuts down on the
overall playback time more than you'd
expect
and if you're the type who likes
listened shows sped up overcast as the
most natural sounding results and voice
boost normalizes the volume when both
ends the podcast so no one here is gonna
be too loud or too quiet
overcast also has a basic web version if
you absolutely have to catch that latest
episode and it lets you pick up where
you left off on your phone the one
downside to overcast is you can't stream
shows on the fly every episode has to be
downloaded in advance there are other
apps down Castro Castro that do offer
streaming but you won't find it with
overcast if it argue that Castro is a
bold more colorful design but overcast
still is the best package of features
and simplicity on Android the best
podcast app is pocket casts it's a
full-featured a powerful player that
makes it dead simple to find new shoes
set up automatic downloads or make
playlists of shows you haven't heard yet
podcasts is also available on iOS at 6
podcasts across Android and iOS so if
you have two phones or say an Android
phone and an iPad that's probably your
best option but the standout feature of
pocket pass is definitely its design the
app looks great it's got fluid
animations and it changes colors based
on your podcasts artwork overcast may
pack in more features but pocket cast is
way nicer looking just like an iOS there
are more options pot kicker dog catcher
and podcast addict all do the job but
none have quite the same appeal as
podcast
if you want day best Android podcast app
it's podcasts so do yourself a favor and
stop listening Apple's podcasts app or
searching Google Play for the best way
to listen to wait wait don't tell me
overcast and pocket casts are the two
best thought past apps out there and
best of all they make it fun finding
shows that are worthless
