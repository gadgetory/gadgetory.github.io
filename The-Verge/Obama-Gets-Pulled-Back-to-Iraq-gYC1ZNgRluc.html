withdrawal of American troops Iraq is
once again descending into violence and
chaos a breakaway faction of al Qaeda
known as Isis has seized large swathes
of northern Iraq and is marching toward
Baghdad the Sunni insurgents say they
want to establish an Islamic state that
would span parts of Syria and northern
Iraq the Iraqi government has reportedly
requested air support from the United
States but President Barack Obama has so
far proceeded with caution ending the
Iraq war has been a cornerstone of
Obama's administration and he was
running for office Obama campaign on the
need to wind down the war I know there
is no shortage of Patriots or patriotism
what I do oppose is a dumb war in 2011
Obama announced the end of us combat
operations in Iraq the last American
troops left country by December Iraqis
have taken full responsibility for their
country's security it's difficult to
quantify the cost of war numbers vary
depending on how you count but a
conservative measure says that more than
one hundred and eighty nine thousand
people have died in the fighting the
hall of the mark 2003 invasion with a
vast majority being civilians as for the
financial toll that's an estimated at
one point seven trillion dollars with
several hundred billion more due to be
paid in veterans care after eight years
of war in Iraq and a longer one still
winding down in Afghanistan Obama has
been taking a more cautious approach to
intervention overseas that's because we
have the best hammer does not mean that
every problem is a nail because the
costs associated with military action
are so high you should expect every
civilian leader and especially your
commander-in-chief to be clear about how
that awesome power should be used but
then in June things in Iraq took a
dramatic turn on jun 10th after days of
fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and
Syria or as it's better known Isis sees
Mosul Iraq's second largest city Isis
then took control of Tikrit hometown of
Saddam Hussein and the Tal Afar when he
took mazule the militants freed
prisoners burned army vehicles and
robbed banks of hundreds of millions of
dollars in youtube videos Isis prompts
to take over Baghdad this is President
Obama days after Isis took the first two
cities we will not be sending US troops
back into combat in Iraq but I have
asked my national security team to
prepare a range of other options that
could help support
security forces and i'll be reviewing
those options in the days ahead I do
want to be clear though this is not
solely or even primarily a military
challenge at the time there were still
about 200 American troops stationed in
Iraq to guard the US Embassy in Baghdad
according to The Wall Street Journal and
this week Obama sent 275 soldiers to
reinforce them the US has also sent an
aircraft carrier and other warships into
the Persian Gulf surveillance drones a
man Navy aircraft have been reported
flying over Iraq to gather intelligence
and Obama is reportedly concerning drone
strikes against Isis however given
Obama's previous limited responses to
conflicts in Libya and Syria it's
unlikely that the president would turn
to any of these options lightly at all
American forces will not be returning to
combat in Iraq but we will help Iraqis
as they take the fight to terrorists who
threaten the Iraqi people the region and
American interests as well Obama has a
handful of non-military options which
could even include cooperation with
longtime adversary Iran the US is
continuing to push a rocky Prime
Minister Maliki to implement more
inclusive policies in Iraq failure to do
so experts say made it easier for Isis
to garner support among the disillusion
Sunnis but even that may not be enough
to save a rock and chaos since his days
as a senator Obama has spoken about the
need for less military intervention
abroad but as a rock teetered on the
brink of sectarian war he's fighting
himself reluctantly returning to the
country the question he faces now is how
to stabilize the country without getting
pulled back into a conflict has already
proved so costly in lives and money
