the North Carolina prison and stayed
free for the next 40 years he was in
prison for armed robbery but he was also
unusually good at forging IDs he
collected names from children who had
died decades earlier building a new life
for himself as William Henry Cox and
Louis Vance
he moved from city to city Chicago to
Georgia to Washington State before
finally settling in Waterloo Iowa with
no paper trail police had no way to
follow him 40 years later something
changed the Iowa Department of
Transportation instituted a facial
recognition system now in the department
takes a driver's license photo it also
runs a scan of the subjects facial
geometry measuring the distance working
the eyes and the width of the gene the
final scan will run dozens of those
measurements which can be compared
against a database to see if there's a
match 43 different states are in some
kind of facial recognition system on
driver's license photos in seven of
those states compared with federal
databases to see if any of those photos
matches a fugitive crucially all of the
photos are taken from the same distance
and the same straight-on angle which
makes them easy to compare it's a simple
process but it's become an incredibly
powerful tool for catching international
fugitives you need the same kind of
straight ahead photo for a passport and
it gets stand any time you cross an
international border if you're on the
run from the police chances are they
have a mugshot of you and now they have
an easy way to use it anytime you cross
an international border or submit an ID
that agency will be able to run a scan
to see if there are any outstanding
warrants for someone with your face it's
made it much harder to drop off the grid
especially as that system has expanded
internationally catching US fugitives as
far away as Nepal for Carnes that global
system wasn't even necessary his photo
raised a flag because he was in the Iowa
driver's license system twice once as
William Henry Cox and wants his Lewy
vans
and both men were collecting a monthly
Social Security check as soon as that
hit came in police knew they had a case
of Social Security fraud but when they
paid him a visit they realized they had
something else too this was the same man
thora tees have been trying to track
down for decades Karns was arrested and
on September 4th 2014 he was sent back
to North Carolina to serve out the
remainder of his sentence the Social
Security charges were dropped
Social Security charges for drop for
drop we're drunk
we're drop like I did for him okay we're
dropped okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
