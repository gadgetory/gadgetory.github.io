from the merge office reporting live
following up with our release of
Michelle Obama 360 and assuming most of
you guys are watching because you had a
chance to watch the video and if you
have it then you should certainly go to
youtube.com slash the merge and check it
out because it's it's insane insane is
it's pretty pretty great anyway so I'm
Tracy Olivarez like the free surface
burns video team I am here with real
Milson director Earth video Tom Connors
senior director that's my my mastermind
behind this project and James Brown
James BAM our director also photographer
who took these stunning portraits of
lovely Michelle Obama so we're we're you
know we're gonna kind of keep this short
and simple we really want to target a
lot of questions involving
post-production how did we pull this off
a lot of our colleagues have been
curious about this my friends been
texting me since really so this has been
curious about this and so this is an
opportunity for us to sort of you know
step behind the scenes and share with
you guys what happened so I think we
should just jump into background how how
do we conceived this idea how do we
conceptualize this idea yeah well yeah
well we found out we were gonna do it at
CES this year which was a terrible time
to find out of it but we threw the idea
out there and the White House was very
receptive to the idea of us doing this
in 360 so we got partnered with a John
and some other producers to actually
make this in 360 capturing it and then
that was kind of the easy part the
shooting in physics is not actually that
difficult you set the camera down and
you turn it on it goes it worked and
then the post production side of things
was one you know we we really took our
time trying to like craft our story and
figure out all the sort of creative
avenues we wanted to do because
three-sixty is a very new type of medium
for us to write live in and using it at
least for me in the past I've always had
trouble with 360 content because it is
so far away from the person right I feel
like you lose the chance to actually
engage like I'm very close to try and
James and me right now I can see their
face that I can see their expression I
can understand exactly what's going on
with them but a lot of times in 360 or 7
6 feet away from the camera and you're
very very small and you don't get that
so a big design thing that we wanted to
figure out what this piece is how do we
inject that into a 360 and interview in
a way that feels natural and seamless
and doesn't take you out of it but when
it does it is informative and growing
the piece absolutely and I want to also
state for the record that this is the
verge in box media's first 360 project
so it was a really ambitious for
seditious watch to do 360 when we have
such a high-profile subject I believe
with right I believe I was I've been I
mean Trent we've been trying to do some
sort through 60 content for a really
long time now and I think the first
thing I said talking about it was let's
not do it with anything really important
so we can learn I'm an easy thing and we
didn't do that oh let's do it but I mean
the whole thing about this is like you
say you can't move the camera and and it
all happened so fast and it's the White
House and you've got to get that entire
crew in that and I mean the it has to be
said that the White House were a grown
woman just so supportive so easy to work
for and you know from the photo shoot
side what we were thinking about is how
okay it's not enough just to go and
stick a 360 camera there we've got to
take pictures there's got to be a story
about it and so I think from when we
were working it out we came up with the
the selfie idea we did some tests the
White House loved it and we went off to
do it but the thing that was so
important is we had to do this for real
we had to take that orange back
to the White House we tried to set it
but we had to get that real her real
team there and to sort of show the
background because otherwise it would
look like we shot it on a stearate so
from a design standpoint why why the
orange it's the verge orange right I
mean man it's just you know it's a
lovely color it's it's it's warm it's
bright its crisp and the the other thing
was you know it's this is an opportunity
to photograph Michelle Obama the first
lady in a way that's never been done
before we didn't want this to look like
a Good Housekeeping cover or something
else this had to be for us we have to
own it and what better way to own it is
to embed the color of the verge in the
very features they're not going to work
anywhere else right that's what was so
important I think yeah in it I mean
seeing mixer truly like a warm summer
day but it wasn't it was January and it
was free and why if everybody remembers
I spent 50 minutes outside of the main
security they let me in and they were
very nice yeah and thank you for in
James just too charming so yes so you
know we we came up this idea of shooting
it at 360 we came up the idea of you
know bringing in our average orange into
the White House kind of creating this
really cool hip look right so take me
through some of some sort of ideas first
I guess let's talk about video there you
know 360 with motion graphics and
animations sounds pretty crazy right
imagine that the process of you know how
how do you take space and incorporate
graphics and so they're not secured you
know jarring or you know really wacky
how how you know how did you maintain
this consistency and look and
and flow right silly I think the main
sort of idea that I always kind of came
up with and I throw credit where
credit's due to our past alum Phil
Ribeiro who made a series for us called
the big future where we had interviewed
Bill Gates in a regular interview and he
took that interview footage mixed with a
little bit of a vo script and made these
really beautiful motion graphics that
helped take a standard interview and
expand it out into this big sort of
infographic explainer video on a subject
with an interviewer and it was really
great it was really inspiring to this
piece which was okay can we take that
can take that feel and incorporate that
into a 360 space taking away sort of
that oh you're just in one room and
there's only one thing to look at and
you get bored after you kind of looked
around for a little bit here we've
injected things for you to look at as
much as it makes sense and actually so
talking about process for doing it I'm
gonna sift out of miriam a little bit
because she was the integral in figuring
out all the technical things of this
yeah and yeah let's bring up a traffic
sign just look at this for a second so
get your idea of how the scale of it our
main comp has 129 layers all moving
around at once so forgive my tiny little
laptop of it is creaking a long time
uh-huh so what our main like work out
workhorse when we did this was the
software called metal which allows you
to take 2d animations and bring them
into the 360 space so if you look at
this little phone on the side up here I
take off the metal programming it turns
it it's hard to see because it's small
but it turns it all flat and it will
look very strange in the preview player
let's back up real fast can you explain
how this the idea of what a something
called ecto rectangular view is okay so
the easiest way to think about it
projection is kind of like the classic
world map you see where it's got like
Greenland supermassive in the top and
kind of all the other countries kind of
to normal spaced along the equator
because what it does is it takes a globe
which is a sphere and kind of peels
apart the top of the globe and makes it
really wide so if you look at like this
image of the room we have here you can
see the chandelier is massive and all of
the production equipment on the bottom
is stretched out huge but then whereas
if you look at the interview like it's
pretty close to being right when you're
going here you can snow so if you go in
here you can look down and see that it's
all right it is little clump and this is
a this is a metal thing that's using
cameras in After Effects to sort of
create an approximation of how that will
look
once it's all stitched together so the
idea is you take that flat image and
software you upload it to YouTube
Facebook hopefully you can get that send
that up to them they will take that and
they take that square and then wrap it
into a circle through programming and
that's what allows you to pan around
later yeah and so metal kind of
workhorses it and takes 2d objects that
you put in that are normally in regular
flat and transforms them and warps them
so that they have this curve which when
you put them into 360 view believe in
you you can then turn around and see
them and I think that was to me that was
like a really surprising thing that it
actually you know I think going into
this we had anticipated oh man we are
going to be editing in 360 this is gonna
be a much more complicated process but
really it was pretty much the same as
editing a 2d process you're still
editing in a rectangle it's a two-to-one
ratio instead of a you know 16:9 that
we're used to but everything else was
the same we animate on there and it
trans and how you do wipes just
translates to 360 so you start to sort
of be able to look at that actor
rectangular stretched out thing and kind
of see how it makes sense in 360 in
animating in 360 so it's actually like
super fun to put in all these graphics
and
get to see them in there and then
realize that it wasn't actually that
difficult to do no I mean because you're
basically still editing the same way
it's just you have to be a little more
conscious about cuts and whatnot because
that can feel super jarring yes so that
that's not any point did you are can you
edit with a headset or is it this is all
happen in 2d there are a way to edit is
in 2d for sure there are with there are
a couple plugins that give you headsets
but not for After Effects right now yeah
right so in the future I I can't wait to
edit in VR editing in viewer is going
the best if you give me a keyboard that
can subscribe to my chair and a mouse
that I can just wirelessly turn all I'd
ever do but the funny thing the whole
thing with this video is once you put on
a headset it completely make sense right
I mean when we got into the VR room and
put this headset on I mean apart from
time time myself in complete knots with
the cable of the headset because it kept
spinning around all the time it was
amazing yeah yeah and that's like part
of the design we talked about when we
were coming up with the idea for these
animations on what they would look like
that was something we talked about was
like how does the design of these push
you in certain directions right because
part of 360 is you want to give people
the ability to look anywhere they want
and follow their intestines anyway and
give them things reward them for looking
at reward them for checking things out
right even the setup of how we set the
shot you know we we chose not we wanted
to have cameras there to do those
cutaways but we also wanted interesting
things so if you watch the video I want
a slider bouncing back and forth the
entire time the entire time and we use
that shot once in the piece and we I
wasn't like super into the shop but it
gives some action to that background
right and like staging that out as part
of how we conceptualize this whole thing
right you want it to be able to look at
because we very easily could have taken
us out of that room entirely and left
you in an empty room actually do you
want to explain the crazy cheap we
figured out that for this so because
cutting is so jarring and obviously this
interview is about what 20 minutes long
interview them cut down to 10
so there are some cuts and we've hidden
them in a bunch of different ways but
the easiest way we did it I did was we
took just a straight ten minutes of the
background of all of us crew hanging out
and ended up masking masking it out so
that the background never cuts at all we
have so you can get to show up more
sound effect please actually well this
low this might be a good time
speaking of sound effects to bring in
our yes
our sound guy come on over I'm gonna
actually help out here all right but if
you don't have anyone if anyone had but
if anyone has any questions about the
photography for this entire production
please start dropping them in and once
we get to the question and answer part
of this at the end we will bring James
back you'll be very happy to answer all
of them so Miriam yesterday it was
happening so I've got pretty standard
thing after-effects where I have
duplicates of the main video layers but
one of them has this great mask on it
which I turn it on you can no longer see
the first lady in the eye and Caroline
Adler because we've mashed out a video
of just the background and all of us for
the 10 minute long of the video but then
behind that I have their video with the
appropriate cuts and so we've found a
way to hide those cuts within that tiny
sphere but we don't have to worry about
hiding all the cuts because when you cut
everything around you it's a very
disorienting yeah especially me because
I'm jumping but like this was a way for
us to draw your attention away from the
center of the screen where we could cut
that and then the next stage for that so
figuring out okay how do we cut without
wiping to a full graphic because if we
wipe to a full graphic the entire time
it would get impossible to watch so the
idea was how do we keep you in this room
but do that and our first thought was oh
well we'll just blur out the background
and make the graphics feel like they're
a little bit closer actually before we
get into this let's actually introduce
Andrew has been sitting your quiet
generative
sound designer destroyed air and sound
recordist recorded yes you'll see them
in the video so Andrew we have your
attention
tell us a little bit about the design
well the motivation was the animations
obviously you kind of get the sort of
feel of work what do you want to sound
like by the kind of feel of the
animation so there's like it's it's like
a little cartoony but not overly so you
know where it's not silly I didn't want
to make it silly and also this is like
Russia reality so it's like sci-fi kind
of don't wanted to get a lot of sciency
noises in there yeah yeah I think no is
it true there's a rumor going around
that you recorded some live sounds yeah
I shouldn't even use them throughout the
piece yeah there's a few live sounds we
I couldn't I compiled a bunch of library
sounds that we already had but stuff
that I couldn't find online or in our
sound library I had to replicate one of
them being the tire in the video when it
goes all around a head I we were looking
for our tire in the office and there was
like a hand truck we had to use but yeah
we also have Mariam there's a little
like Easter Egg Mariam that makes a
little sound effect noise like that so
you can hear it
around there it's in the beginning
there's one beginning yeah it's an
especially we had the chance to view
this in the vibe headset yeah a lot and
it was a great it was a great experience
when you put a head
and have those sound effects it's really
fully immersive and it really makes it
come together really recommend it's a
plea from yeah cool okay so Miren let's
go sorry let's get back to this yeah so
yeah so let's let's talk about so this
so we've basically taken this vector
rectangular version we have removed them
and now we have graphics coming up
taking over but we'll we rack where we
kind of figured out is if you put a
solid color up in 360 you're just
looking at blankness like there's no
there's no sense of space there's no
sense of like depth that you get when
you have the footage of the room so a
lot of the things we were playing with
was gradients and putting stuff over top
of that but obviously if you put a
gradient over top of that you're not
doing yourself a favor with having a cut
so how did we do that then well I mean
for a lot of ways we kind of blurred
them out behind the graphics but there's
a nice mathematical theory out there
called the hairball theory that if you
blur out the background the way you blur
is by grabbing pixels from around it and
overlaying them with a slight shifting
effect and so what that does is where
the scene comes together where the 360
video is nice and stitched up it screws
with that so suddenly you have a weird
line in the background so you can't
Fleur the whole image so essentially
what happens is when you're blurring you
have the edges all the edges of the
frame blur the pixels but there's
nothing to blur past the frame so it
ends up blurring blackness which means
you get lines off we get two points on
the top yeah you get two points atop and
it like extreme cases you can get a line
down the whole backwards right footage
pins together yeah and so we solved that
by only simply blurring out a mask of
the front of it so there you can you can
kind of see through the blur the cuts
but it gets to kind of accept that it's
happening but if you turn around when
the graphics are blur you'll see Craig
from donut just completely in film gets
just watching us logo down
well because everyone else was blurred
out and the cut happened but there's the
great thing about VR is our VR and 360
captures is it's actually really high
really easy to hide things because you
can direct people's attention other way
so when these cuts happened one of the
sort of ideas with the graphics was that
will take you away from that we're gonna
take you over here to watch a video or
and take you beyond where this cut is
happening or beyond where something's
not going quite right with the stitch
like you'll know if you look really hard
I'm like disappearing in places but that
and like it's really easy to hide those
things because you have a full way of
creating a language that pushes you so
like one one thing about the motion
graphics that we worked for was a sense
of flow a sense of movement so we have
these lines that push in one way we have
these sort of swig Allah that push in
different directions and that helps draw
your attention to things helps draw your
attention from her to these things and
keep you in that way while we just cut
right there and you never you have to
cancel see ya so that's hope and like
and and that's the big thing I want to
say to everyone is that this stuff is
actually really easy it's it's very much
just like creating video in Premiere or
anything like that in fact how we
exported and how we did a lot of what we
did for this piece was all in Premiere
and we didn't need After Effects seduce
you could definitely make 360 video in
Africa or in Premiere or any final cut
any editing software so you can start
doing some of these things with 2d
graphics in Premiere and even even
without a software like metal which i
think is about 100 and $200 yeah but
these are this is math this if you look
hard enough you can know exactly where
to place it and move it it just makes it
a lot easier and saves a lot of time I
think we should open it up to some
questions questions I know I saw one
question about what camera we used to
shoot on we shot always so we shot
we shot with two cameras but our primary
camera was John Villar camera courtesy
of John Villar and ya work with producer
Lucas Wilson from supers video
productions and if you chance to look at
the John camera it looks like what you
think a 360 camera like it looks like a
Death Star
that was the running joke during
production miniature Death Star yeah
it's really it's pretty intimidating
honestly there's nothing some
extraterrestrial life-forms that are
about to shoot out of that thing yeah we
use primary cameras at John VI camera
and our backup camera was courtesy of
pitocin latrice you can see throughout
the video it's cold but it's actually
for a 7ss yeah
it's really enough so is that one we
used the beginning yeah that's the
opening shot of the photo shoot is based
off total cinemas prototype and also the
credits the end credits the shot of us
gapping around the show a strong telex
in of us yeah what other questions we
have to the question um I think yeah I
think access is a big thing I think I
think we're all unconvinced that
watching it on a desktop is the best
experience I think I think the adoption
of headsets more and more adoption of
headsets will make it a much more viable
thing yeah because yeah in the future
and get cool cardboard it's very cheap
and very easy to do also mixing in a
headset like going back and looking at
it would help would help them so much
yes direct you know the sound effects
brand and that's that's something that
you ran into the sound is that right now
other than some proprietary players you
can't juice or a 3d audio where
essentially if you you can map audio so
you can hear and get the sense that it's
here get the sense that's over here but
in both YouTube and any other player
that's kind of for the masses right now
you can't turn your head and have that
turned with you so it's off-putting but
like that's the future right you want to
be able to look and see that this little
effect up here is making a noise and you
can follow that effect around right yeah
I didn't want to make things too stereo
so when you went 180 it was still on you
you know this sound effect was still on
your left side when you're facing the
opposite way then we'll just kind of put
you out of it so I kind of wanted to
make it so it pans towards the direction
that's going the animation but once you
turn your head I pan it back to center
so it kind of feels like it's tracking
your head but it's you know it's just
kind of we just have to you just have to
but I mean so the other thing beyond
just being able to see it that I think
pitfalls for 360 video is it's very much
different medium than just video and you
have to kind of think about it like that
yeah because the future the future for
this isn't the same as film because you
can't get close right we talk like we
did that for this video because we have
the ability to kind of add in graphics
like that right but if you want to tell
a story about someone you know you're
never actually gonna get very close you
have the great ability of putting people
in their shoes like I got to see at one
point someone did a short film of kind
of putting you in the view and I don't
know anyone who do this and it might be
half lies but let's say hypothetically
someone made a video where it actually
puts you into the viewpoint of a doctor
first and you went through this checking
a patient out and then the next next
time they cut you're almost on the
patient and getting checked out by a
doctor who thought you were just
unconscious but you could see and move
around and look and feel like you were
not being noticed and that's something
that I think speaks to the power of 360
video it's giving you those kinds of
experiences but not necessarily it's not
gonna give you that same kind of
closeness that video does so we don't
get that close up it just reminded me of
film actually they've been powerful in
in 360 or a VR rather as a diamond Bella
butterfly film and in the film you he
puts on a VR headset in like while
you're in VR I think that's a crazy so
another great question actually in just
reading right now how much been teaching
the viewer how to interact with the
experience um it was it was a big deal
in concept like specifically the vine
Q&amp;amp;A section of the video
so there's section of the video where
we're showing off Michelle Obama's bind
Q&amp;amp;A that she did so she would put out
questions to the world and kids adults
would ask her things and she'd respond
and like the argue was a great chance to
make you watch one of those and then
shift your focus with this ball that we
kind of have and big shout out to Luna
North which was the production team that
we can't came in to help us design this
work and it turned out on credit
animated yeah this it's an absolute
absolutely incredible execution of what
we were thinking of and I couldn't be
more proud of them
what is the use of shapes right
skrelp of the piece you need a lot of
uses circles and godly staff yeah these
dotted lines as well and then squares
are the containers and the ideas use
those those circles as you know these
guides writings markers suit because
sort of bringing through the space and
direct your attention with specific
points within the space right and then
you also use the dotted line to accent
where you're actually you should be
turning right so you see a lot of that a
lot of play with basic shapes drop
throughout the piece yeah and a lot of
like the transitions of wipe across the
whole screen end up on whoever's talking
next right which is really nicely
directional you follow the movement
right actually I have a question for for
James Mirim photographer oh sure so
James going going back to the lead image
yeah how how did you manage to get those
those phones so close to Michelle's face
I mean well I feel I'm gonna pop the
bowl just we had this pic photographing
Wow yeah there's a camera you know
following Secret Service was away from
we have 20 minutes with us so the first
shot this was always going to be a comp
what we did is we actually did a test
shoot remember stairs we're trying to
figure it out everybody held out and
then when we came back from the shoot
obviously we had the Pitts lady
we had a background we brought the
background with us and then we went down
to the studio and using a stand with a
big blue balloon on it we got everybody
to stand in groups and hold their phones
the important thing here is if I may
stare
was to get the death around because
obviously this is 360 this isn't 360 but
we wanted the peace in both terms of the
design and also these pictures to have
that sense so we just worked our way
through building up there are groups of
people here we've got individuals and
then just spend a lot of time comping it
all together row to make it look as real
as possible and I think to just really
convey that this is the first lady who's
completely in touch with everybody on
the same devices that they're in touch
with her that's crazy
but know is even the granular details of
the shadows exactly right
so what we had to do in the flares
yeah they're striking across the screens
what's really crazy about this is when
you put it together
there's obviously this huge desire to
make it real but the funny thing is
sometimes you've actually got to make it
not too real for it to look real so we
have the hand on the left there's a
little too straight on so we have to
twist it a little bit of put some
skewing on it to give it a sense of
depth and then the idea with the flare
is to look like lights and bouncing off
the screens people are casting shadows
obviously we have a lot of real shadows
that we could we can use as references
but it's it's it's I think there was
something like two or three hundred
layers from this by the time we finished
it was a hard time tracking down which
screen was on which phone which we have
another question coming in that the
question was 60 frames per second was a
choice question mark which I don't know
there was some shade thrown at 60 FPS
absolutely deservedly so a little too
crispy for me Melissa crispy rather
shoot 24 misses oh no 16 that is
actually a major choice we made because
in headsets especially the experience
goes way up because let's say you're
able to actually feel like you're moving
around
more naturally than you would see
stuttering if you're turning quickly so
we wanted to kind of bake this as
forward as possible so this is something
that can live in the next you know a
couple months as headsets start to
become more available to the public
and you know into the future where there
are years where hopefully everyone's and
headsets I don't know I'm really into VR
I'd be happy we're all in pets it's like
again yeah it's so yeah it was
definitely a choice
it was definitely a choice mostly for
future but right now YouTube plays it
Facebook is locked at 30 frames per
second so if we can get there well we'll
be at that probably any other questions
what did Michelle think about being
filmed in 360 I know James what are you
there I think she loved it and I you
know I photographed a lot of people I
think we were all blown away how this is
we did in the Secret Service with even
with the White House we're dealing with
an incredibly short timeline and they
were just so helpful and she was just so
into it I mean she loved it a team love
that you know it's it's a challenge
because 360 shows everything and
everybody's on camera for the entire
duration so it's it's a lot of moving
fast to think about and I was locked
outside I didn't get to see everybody
else we show people that's something
that we realize is like so many people
we're in this very like sphere important
fun
like people who understood are up on
oculus and like understand the are thing
that's coming out but the vast majority
of the world out there have never done
to see this it's never going to
experience that which is really telling
which was really tough to the gauge if
people liked it or if it's just like
their first experience in the office
but I'll take it and you lose that sense
of right and getting somebody to sit
down with our headset on what to view it
on a phone and see their reactions for
the first time was like wow this is
actually something be incredible right
we just got to keep keep track of that
so going back to your lead image you
come over this idea of paparazzi yes
cameras and then I noticed at if you
scroll to the bottom of the post is
another photograph that's right yeah
right there you see the reverse right
this is yes this is the selfie mode yes
and I think this was like a counteract
to that opening that leave each other we
also didn't want to crop everything so
it's an orange background we went we
took this roll of paper to the White
House the White House puts the pulling
down of the carpet and just wanted to
get the shot with her team this is her
real team and they did this picture you
can see it in the lead picture the lead
VR and the crazy thing about this shot
is this is one front so this one
deliberately no hands have been handed
moved or changed this is just a simple
bit of cleanup first maybe you're
standing on some tape at the bottom
which are just edited that out but
really that's the only bit of retouching
on that as everything else as a single
shot and I think it was kind of nice to
see the lights to see the stands to get
the hint of that incredible portrait of
Lincoln on the left and brother stupidly
I managed to it's such a sort of
juxtaposition to the strong backgrounds
throughout piece and obviously that
opening image so it's nice to have both
you don't have that balance you know I
mean it's doing a furnish it's like
doing the
the flow is going to be on the page they
were very well fantastic
I think the try wrap up yeah yeah yeah
so yeah unless anyone has any questions
for our team we're gonna ask why don't
we just ah the next one guys that was
like one of the first comments I can I
would like to sleep yeah I will see this
is definitely like and I wouldn't make
it clear like it was a good learning
experience for us and I feel way more
confident going into any of your
production now absolutely
yeah I think yeah I think that's like
something you're definitely gonna see
from the future class wants do you do
you know what I want to see you know
what's gonna be the next step is when
you can move that camera oh you can just
wait
