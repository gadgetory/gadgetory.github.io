about to talk to two of the biggest
Batman writers working today James Tynan
and Scott Snyder spoilered if you
haven't read their work because we're
about to get into it so guys basically
you're working in a world where Batman
is not boost way anymore what is that
like well it's sort of Awesome actually
because for me I mean I've been writing
Batman for about four years with artists
greg below who's just been incredible on
the book and this year we really wanted
to sort of have a final battle between
Batman and Joker we realized once they
kind of both went down it would give us
an opportunity to look at the mythology
from a whole new angle who would become
Batman if the legend the only person
that could really be Batman died what if
Batman died and the city was left sort
of completely unprotected who would step
up so for us the answer was Jim Gordon
so he's a deputized Batman he's a city
sanctioned Batman and he's somebody
who's believed in the systems that we
put in place to protect ourselves the
police local government is whole life
and he wants to prove to the entire city
the Batman can be a symbol of
inspiration a symbol of safety a symbol
of safe harbor and faith honestly in
these kinds of mechanisms that we
believe in when things are going well to
make the city a safe place of course
Gotham is going to throw tremendous
obstacles in his way this new villain
mr. bloom and the other sort of half of
the story deals with Bruce Wayne Bruce
Wayne comes back from this battle with
the Joker with a totally new
neurological landscape his mind has been
healed of all its memories he has no
memories of being Batman it's a new
brain almost in his head so it's almost
as though Batman died and Bruce Wayne
came back this is the boy that none of
us saved in the alley and it's who he
would be if he had no skills no
detective skills no no kickass fighting
skills none of it and so overall it's a
wonderful Gotham at least for me right
now to be able to write in because it
gives me
so many new angles on these characters I
loved from Bruce to Alfred to Jim Gordon
two new characters that were introducing
Duke Thomas and ultimately i think you
know when you have a franchise in 75
years old it's so fun to go classic and
use the classic villains and we will
again you know to face and everything
like that and Bruce if he ever comes
back to be Batman again but when you get
these vacations when you get these
moments away from home and you get to
look at your home differently it's so
exciting and vibrant and the fans have
been so supportive I'm really stunned I
remember telling James and being like
this might be the jump the shark or the
ten sharks moment when we lose all of
ourselves but things have held up and
even you know gone beyond our
expectations and the fact that fans are
so supportive of us we really can't
thank them enough it's just Gotham is
the fans they're just wonderful to us so
it's I feel like it's a great time to be
in Gotham right now yeah absolutely and
I mean it and it also it creates
incredible storytelling possibilities
like the ability to tell stories it like
like you said this is a character that's
existed for 75 years and in moments like
this you get to tell tell stories that
no one's read before which is hard to do
very hard to do in in the batman
midlands so with that you know we're now
uh Scott and I are sort of show running
a new Batman weekly Batman and Robin
eternal which takes the perspective of
the entire bat family as as one of
Bruce's great at one of the greatest
threats from Bruce's pass re-emerges but
Bruce isn't there to tell them what this
threat is and how dangerous it can be so
it's now we have we have the opportunity
to tell this story in this moment and
you know
and it's really really fun to see all of
the Robinson and young characters
interact with each other as in a world
without Bruce Wayne as Batman so you
guys are working in a world where there
been a lot of see changes in comics in
general where everyone's changing how
comics work you had secret war zone
convergence everything going on with
image what's it like working in this
environment where you were kind of
challenging the status quo I mean I
honestly feel like it's a golden age to
be involved in comics where if you're
talking about sort of the landscape from
the air I mean creators like us we have
more opportunities than ever to be to be
daring you know on these superhero books
as long as as long as you're sort of
true decor and love the character at the
DNA level companies now are welcoming
calculated risk because of companies
like image and I think because
creator-owned books have done so well or
and there's this kind of new fountain of
creativity in that world and sustainable
creativity where those books are selling
and doing well so I think you know the
superhero market wants that same energy
that is willing to let creators like us
take risks on the character as long as
they know that we want the character
true decor we love the character we're
not trying to break it just bend in such
a way that you get a brand new set of
story opportunities like James said on
these on these classic characters so
really i mean i feel like the
storytelling going on at marvel at DC at
image there couldn't be a better time to
be a comic book fan I mean a creator
certainly there's so many opportunities
and there's such a kind of sort of
celebration I think right now of
calculated risk on these characters but
even it's just a reader as a fan like I
go to my shop my local shop on
Wednesdays and there's so many books
that I'm excited to pick out to pick up
from Star Wars all the way down to the
most and ebook because there's a high
level of quality right now because
people realize that you know these these
books if they're done well can sell on
any in any genre in any company and any
sort of publishing publishing em
I mean I think Scott said it awesome so
is it a challenge to deal with like the
massive pop cultural response that
superheroes are getting in Hollywood
where you have these very static images
of what super girls are supposed to do
whereas you guys are changing the shop
status quo from the source what's the
relationship between the two for you
guys I mean I think the it goes into
some of what's copies just saying which
is I think the fact that everyone's like
the the film and television versions of
a lot of these characters sort of become
the central like iconic versions to a
lot of people and to arrest people with
powerful stories in the comics who have
to do things that they can't do in the
movie it's a good point you have to do
something daring and interesting they in
a way that's just like okay that you
know this is why it's comments like
comics have no budget well you can you
know it like that Scott doesn't have to
worry about the the bat Gordon like
robos who like how much it's gonna cost
you know like he can all of a sudden be
like okay now it has like laser launch
like it's coming out of the arms and all
of that now I'm like and it's just like
it's the only the only budget is our
imaginations act like and that is the
strength of comments is it's just
through its whatever we can come up with
and excite people with
so yeah yeah the only other thing I
point out cuz I thought that's
beautifully sad is that you know when
you come to a con like this what you
realize is you know the filmic and
televisual sort of and video game I
think representations of these
characters bring so many new fans in
this con itself New York Comic Con is
just so robust you see so many new faces
people from all walks of life loving
these characters because there's so much
so adaptable and you realize how elastic
they are because at core they stand for
certain things like Batman for example
teaches us that no matter how tragic
your circumvent the circumstances are no
matter what sort of but falls you no
matter what obstacles you face if you
believe in yourself and you determined
enough you can be the hero that you
dream of being despite all of the kind
of hardship that you've um you've
encountered in your life and if you take
that as the core you can have him in
space you can have him as an angry
Batman you can have him as a as a
happier Batman a Batman 66 there's so
many interpretations and I think those
those adaptations of him when you see
Batman vs Superman or you see the
animated series they bring so many new
fans in and again like I don't feel
there's ever been a better time to be a
fan of the superhero world or the
superhero genre when you look around and
see such a diverse crowd people of all
ages all walks of life race orientation
everything celebrating these characters
in all different kinds of ways I mean
it's really a vibrant and I think
multifaceted fandom right now so
regarding Batman 44 you have Jim Gordon
facing the question gentrification yeah
police brutality in Gotham City what
brought you into that mode especially in
considering the last year well what I
would say this story it's all kind of
energy monsters and robots in a lot of
ways but it's actually deeply about what
Batman means to us in the real world so
sometimes you have a story that you
translate into comic book language like
for example the best the best kind of
example I can cite is the dark knight
returns to me is is a comic book
language story to mutant sir this crazy
gang and two faces running around but
ultimately as a kid all the issues in
that book the Cold War urban decay they
were all there just sort of in comic
book language and sometimes in certain
stories like zero year we do that and in
other stories like and that's what we're
doing in this one and super heavy but
once in a while you kind of peel back
the comic book language and show it in
straight prose and say this is what this
is about and truthfully when you have a
bat man who is believed in the police
and believed in again the systems and
the mechanisms that we put in place in a
city like New York or Baltimore or
Gotham to protect ourselves you're going
to get a story where you come up against
the hard truths and the entrenched
aesthetic problems the Batman sometimes
is going to see and say what do I mean
to these so we wanted it really to be
the Keystone issue of the entire arc and
to be something that said this is this
is what this story is about and what I'd
say is you know a lot of what we think
Batman on the other hand like one of the
great things about the characters you
know what we're doing in Batman and
Robin eternal you can do a story that
globe trots it's all over the place and
this story could not be better I really
i cannot stress enough like doing a
weekly series is hard and what James and
the team has come up with Tony Daniel on
art it is probably the best Batman story
the year twenty six issues you're going
to feel like you got so much bang for
your buck it's a mystery from the past
it's come back to haunt the present in
ways that I think you'll find really
potent and resonant conspiracies and
secrets and in today's world I feel like
a lot of the stuff they're bringing up
even in comic-book language even in the
most bombastic and cartoonish sort of
translation will feel resonant and will
feel potent it might not be the same
issues we're talking about in Batman
right now which I think are particularly
kind of live wire but our goal is comic
book writers i think is always take
material it's personal to us always take
stuff this resident that matters
to us and write them through these
characters so these characters matter
and I can promise you that Batman
eternal at 26 issues is one of those
stories it's something that you should
pick up if you love Batman and Robin
it's pat Robin 75th anniversary you got
every Robin you got a brand new villain
whose scary in the way that I think of
today villain should be scary and you
got a great a great team on the book
it's really something i'm proud to be
affiliated with in any way thanks so
much Scott sure thank you Thanks if you
