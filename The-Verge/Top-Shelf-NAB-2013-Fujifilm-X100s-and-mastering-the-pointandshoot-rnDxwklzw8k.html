on this show we bring you the best in
consumer electronics past present and
future this week the ancient art of
capturing light from kodachrome to
Instagram from cinema to selfies and out
in the deserts of Nevada the future of
it all our senior reporter Brian Bishop
investigates the past five years have
seen a dramatic shift in the creation
and distribution of visual media
digitally shot films now regularly win
Oscars HD is the baseline standard at
home and 4k content isn't is hitting
theaters shaping up to be the latest
front in the battle for the living room
the industry is changing ruin place
that's most evident is right here in Las
Vegas Nevada this is where the National
Association of Broadcasters holds its
annual trade show it's a place where the
people making tomorrow's tools to meet
up with a creative individual that will
end up using them this is nab 2013
here on the show floor there's big name
companies like red canon and sony as
well as a lot of smaller vendors every
type of film making equipment imaginable
is here there's one constant theme 4k
it's here and in a big way sony which
has been pushing the industry towards 4k
capture and distribution showed off to
new prototype cameras for video and
taking stills won the collective
futuristic DSLR if the other borrowed a
lot of design cues from Reds line of
products the company also priced its
home 4k media player which will be
priced at six hundred ninety nine
dollars later this year and what if
you're hungry for even more resolution
red had a clean room on the show floor
where was upgrading owners of the red
epic to its new 6k dragon sensor have
you know the names phantom you know it's
all about slow motion and this is the
phantom flex 4k camera can shoot a
thousand frames per second of 4k footage
this here is a prototype it's not
working about four weeks ago with a 64
gig capacity there's a number of
different capacities you can get you
shoot about five seconds of footage
what's that like in playback and a
thousand frames per second that's three
and a half minutes of footage now price
on this the bare body itself is gonna be
about a hundred thousand dollars but a
full kit we got 140 so obviously this
professional level gear so you're not
gonna be basically buying for yourself
and now that you know it's interesting
you know this right here is the original
phantom flex that has 2,500 frames per
second at HD resolution but technology
has been evolving so quickly they can
make it even smaller which brings us to
the mirror now this will basically shoot
1,500 frames per second in HD resolution
at a much smaller form factor this runs
around fifty thousand dollars all these
cameras capture fantastic high frame
rate photography and uh and I want one I
went all over as technology has advanced
it's enabled professional level hardware
to get both smaller and more portable
cameras can go places they've never been
able to go before but making that
footage looks smooth and steady presents
its own set of challenges
we're gonna have three flies we're
looking at the movie this has taken the
internet by storm the last few weeks the
camera stabilization system uses
digitally controlled gyroscopes with
electronics you can basically figure
your digital SLR in here or the
lightweight cameras and get some really
really smooth shots you wouldn't be able
to get otherwise a pretty exciting
example pay you can go and get some
really creative shots without a huge
bunch of the equipment that you don't
have to use
we are a creative technology company
that makes creative tools for creative
minds so I mean like NAB couldn't be the
more perfect show for us because there's
a bunch of geeks that are super creative
that's us I mean we are we are the nav
crowd so we took our professional grade
zenmuse camera stabilization platform
and have built it in to the Phantom this
crazy high responsibilities very
responsive yeah it goes exactly what you
tell to go
just like that just like that let it
touch the ground and then just drop it
down nice flying man thanks to
people are taking things to another
extreme this is the steadicam curve it's
a motion stabilization device for your
GoPro camera the city cameras the
company behind the original big full
body rig that uses stabilized cameras
for motion tracking shots she's doing
their Goodfellas you zoom in the shining
this is a small version of it twisting
lots of smaller cameras like this go out
he'll be find a way to make these shots
know a little bit less shaky this looks
like it's pretty stable so so now I'm
gonna take this out and go different
book nice
it's not this consumer cameras change in
the game we're also seeing traditional
consumer electronics tripping up the
food chain and opening up some exciting
possibilities this is the bond to from
Terre des hook up to your camera it can
bridge your footage into h.264 video and
then puts it out over the Internet there
are six USB ports you can just plug in
stock sticks from Verizon t-mobile a TMZ
and they say they sense it too tired x
servers and it reconstitutes it and from
there equal footage wherever you want
you know on the air on the internet
directly and what's really cool about
this thing is it takes it used to be you
know you need a satellite truck to do
these things before and I can do it in
this little box right here that cost
about four thousand dollars you have the
sticks obviously but basically if you
take a camera on the field shoot
something and have it on the internet or
anywhere else you want right away with
just this little box
and a lot of ways we're at the dawn of
the golden era technology and creativity
are opening up possibilities that were
only dreamt up just a few years ago
while the gear itself is exciting that's
really only one part of the story the
real payoff is what directors
cinematographers and other creative
professionals are doing with this new
generation of tools and to reap those
benefits you don't need to travel to Las
Vegas just open your eyes
so nobody's carrying around a fork a
cell phone yet yes but shows like nab
are a really good indication of where
the consumer market will be in a couple
years from now what's ten thousand
dollars at NAB might be two hundred
dollars before you know it and the
fujifilm will x100s one of the new
cameras we've seen in the verge offices
may not be two hundred dollars but it's
still a lot of camera for a surprisingly
small price here with me to talk about
it is the Verge's resident photography
expert michael shane and you kind of
love this camera right yeah I really do
why what was so special about this
camera I mean it's pretty yes right from
the fact that it's beautiful looks
aren't everything now it has a great
personality it does see right it's
what's on the inside that counts so
let's get the the basics out of the way
for sure this is it's not a full frame
camera right which means it's not a
35-millimeter sensor unlike some of the
I RN programs like the sony rx1 which is
another compact camera or full DSLRs
like the 5d mark two mar 3 nikon d800
etc right uh but this camera i think is
quite possibly the best cropped sensor
on the planet right now that money can
buy I think Fugees doing amazing stuff
and a fuji ever starts to make
full-frame sensors in a compact camera
watch out uh so does that mean am I am I
gonna take meaningfully better pictures
with this than with any other camera or
like so you I'm curious for you
particularly because you own a 5d mark
two yeah right and you you're a pro you
you know like get paid money to take
pictures sometimes makes you proud um so
but you want this camera you want to
spend 13 hundred dollars you buy this I
do I don't off my 5d mark two doesn't
leave my apartment or the office that
often it's sort of a it's a tool it's a
workhorse it's gigantic it's Jenna big
lens on it you know it weighs a lot yeah
uh but this this is tiny this weighs
nothing and it's unobtrusive people
don't notice this if I'm walking around
the city or I'm in the subway and I lift
my 5d mark two to take a photo it's like
waving a flag that says hello I'm a
photographer and I'm about to invade
your space please turn away yeah exactly
okay but this camera allows me to remain
invisible right and it's it you can make
it basically silent to right so you can
toss these guilty and even doing it's
got built-in electronic shutter sounds
but they're a little dumb you just leave
it silent and it's like it's not even
there
it's it's a wonderful portable camera
and the image quality is fantastic so if
I'm just you know regular guy there are
a lot of cameras out there for thirteen
hundred dollars right across a whole
bunch of different they can look
different at work differently there even
some deals large you get for 13 the
first so if I'm somebody who doesn't
know much about photos but just wants to
take great pictures with a nice camera
that doesn't wait you know forty
thousand pounds yeah is this is this the
one to get not in my opinion okay uh
this camera is a phenomenal camera for
experienced or professional
photographers who are looking for a
second body I mean this camera has a
physical mechanical aperture ring that
clicks it's got a physical dial for
exposure compensation a physical dial
for your exposures the point is this
camera wants to be shot in manual right
or at the very least in aperture
priority mode and this camera its
cousins made by fuji the sony rx1 they
kind of they all a little bit
idiosyncratic and you have to be the
kind of photographer or consumer who's
excited to sort of dive in and figure
out what kind of relationship you have
to have with a camera to make great
picture yeah and this is the kind of
camera that demands that but if you're
just looking to take snapshots of
friends at the kids going out trips and
you want to take great photos and not
really worry so much about making great
photos I think you can probably spend
less money end up with results you'll be
happy with and then take the extra money
left over and do something else with it
poster then on the flip side of that if
I'm if I'm a pro photographer I want
something you know people by DSLRs
because and they're big because they
have all the buttons and all the dial
right it's about controlling image
quality right and and this you think
this has enough of that or at least yeah
the right amount of it I absolutely
think it does okay like I said at the
beginning it's not a full-frame sensor
right but that's that's not everything I
mean until I played with this camera I
was like oh I can't use a camera that
doesn't have a full frame sensor bra but
once I tried this I was sort of
convinced yeah f2 looks a lot different
on a full-frame sensor than it does on
this camera but the image quality is
great it feels great in the hand it's
beautiful to look at from in mind really
it's beautiful I mean that's totally
subjective it looks like a camera from
Lebanon five years yeah I mean it's sort
of a throwback to the old like a compact
camera but the great thing about this
I mean it's a fixed it's one lens it's
fixed but it's 35 millimeters and
artistically speaking that introduces
certain restrictions that I think are
really good having only 35 millimeter
field of you to work with changes the
way you see scenes it changes the way
you make photos and I think uh
restrictions like that make you a better
photographer well yes so that's we
actually had this debate in the middle
of talking about this camera before
where you were saying you know what my
theory is basically put the best
equipment possible in somebody's hands
and they'll probably take great pictures
right like if I handed you if I handed
my grandma a 5d mark to put it on auto
she'd probably take great pictures uh
but your theory is that you know there's
a lot more to taking pictures than just
the camera and and that applies to both
you know taking great pictures with a 5d
mark two and with like a you know
terrible 200 point and shoot that
hopefully no that's not just my opinion
it's certainly not like a revolutionary
new idea how sweet like tweets my mom
this I like I take great pictures of my
moms like man you must have a really
great camera like no mom just took good
picture what you need to do is go get
one of those disposables from like
Target or you know one of those and then
take amazing pictures with that so this
is what I don't think can be done and
this is what we sent you out to do with
ross miller who I'm pretty sure is like
the worst photographer that has ever
existed on planet Earth as harsh okay I
can't comment and basically what I
wanted to see is does the camera make
the man what does the man make the
camera Ansel Adams said that a good
photograph is knowing where to stand you
can take the most perfectly awful
pictures with the best of cameras and
you can take good pictures with just
about any camera you can find on the
street so we went out and bought the
Canon sx260 right now the vessel and
camera on amazon com and we're gonna
give you a few tips to show you how to
take drastically better images even with
a point and shoot like most things in
photography composition can be pretty
subjective but there are a few basic
ideas that will be helpful when you're
getting started always try to be aware
of the geometry in your photo especially
horizons keep your horizon relatively
straight as a starting point you really
should have a good reason for tilting
your camera also be mindful of the
so-called rule of thirds the center of
the frame is generally a zone of despair
and disappointment zooming can help you
achieve a soft blurry background with a
point and shoot but if your subject
isn't at
we far away from you just use your feet
zooming also makes it harder to keep a
steady shot so if you don't have a
tripod become a tripod walls railings
trees that crazy position from yoga last
night do whatever you have to to steady
your hand then there's the light when
you press the shutter button halfway the
camera measures the light in the scene
and choose it to settings for the photo
this is called metering but you can
force the camera to meter different
parts of a scene just by pointing it
somewhere other than your subjects do
what you can to put light sources behind
you including and especially the Sun if
you want a bit more control leave the
plush prison of auto mode behind and try
aperture priority the aperture is the
size of the opening through which light
enters the lens and it also affects your
depth of field at a basic level depth of
field is what determines how blurry or
sharp your background is if auto mode
wants f8 for example but that results in
a shutter speed that's too slow switch
to aperture priority mode and open up
your aperture to a lower number you'll
have a faster shutter speed that might
be better suited to your needs ok so
let's talk about flash as a general rule
just just turn it off except for the
darkest of circumstances most cameras
today will do all right without the
retina burning assault weapon that the
manufacturer decided you couldn't live
without seriously is this how you want
to remember your night it's like a PSA
for bad decisions don't be afraid to
move or to ask your subject to move look
for lamps candles street lights LED
keychains road flares pretty much any
light source around you will be better
than the flash on your point-and-shoot
camera alright it's time to let loose a
little bit take everything I just said
and forget about it then jump into the
point and shoots menu system and try
manual mode with wild abandon
experimentation and failure are how
photographers grow assuming you have a
patient subject you'd be surprised what
some simple adjustments can get you
that's it for our show thanks so much
for watching thanks to bryan bishop for
being here and thanks to michael shane
and especially thanks to ross miller who
i promises are much better photographer
than he lets on for lots more on all
this especially our full review the
fujifilm x100s be sure and check out the
verge calm thank you again so much for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
