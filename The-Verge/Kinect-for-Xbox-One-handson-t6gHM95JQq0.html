virginal we're here looking at the new
Kinect for the new Xbox one and the
Kinect has been totally upgraded and
changed almost everything about it is
different they were speaking in
multiples about how much better
everything is but the biggest things
that it can do now is just track you in
more ways and in more locations it can
basically see in the dark now there's a
1080p webcam but can also use IR to see
even when all the lights are off it
works just fine and it doesn't care what
lights there are but it can also track
so much more about you now it can track
your muscles it can track how much
pressure you're putting on a particular
part of your body it can track the
orientation of your hands and your
thumbs and whether you're moving around
it is super aware of everything you're
doing with almost no lag and almost in
real time it can also identify multiple
people up to six people at once and as
you move around within the frame it'll
actually tell who's where and we'll map
you as such and it can even do so with a
controller so if I'm using one
controller and you're using another and
we switch it'll actually notice that
we've switched and change accordingly it
can measure your facial expression your
heart rate and even whether or not
you're looking at the screen and can
change everything based on what you're
doing so it's gonna be really
interesting to see what developers do
with this new Kinect there's crazy stuff
that's possible but how it actually gets
worked into games and the experience
remains to be seen so that is the new
Kinect for Xbox one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
