this is Facebook home it's a suite of
software that's designed to turn your
Android phone into a Facebook phone it's
a clever strategy but it'll only work if
the software is actually compelling
enough for people don't want to install
and use on that front home is kind of a
mixed bag it basically consists of two
parts a custom launcher and lock screen
that puts your Facebook feed front and
center plus a neat new thing called chat
heads that lets you more quickly get
into text conversations let's start with
a Korra face McComb which is cover feed
cover feed takes every update in your
newsfeed and makes it a full screen
background for your home and lockscreen
in fact Facebook has collapsed the lock
screen and home screen into a single
entity it's a little weird at first but
you can't get used to it for every item
in your newsfeed you get a big full
screen image of either a posted photo or
if the update is just text your friends
cover image you'll see the name of your
friend in the text up top and you can
double tap any image to like it or
single tap it to get controls for
commenting it looks really good and that
there's almost no on-screen controls
between you and the content each update
has a subtle Ken Burns photo pan and
they automatically move in the
background or you can just swipe between
them so what's it like to have your home
screen turn into a carousel of your
friends updates it's both neat and weird
on the neat side I found myself casually
flipping through updates way more than I
did when they were siloed off and
Facebook's app on the weird side well I
have a lot of Facebook friends and not
all of them post the best stuff cover
feed is neat for Facebook junkies but if
you're going to switch home screens then
you need to be able to get stuff done
and quickly hear Facebook home kind of
falls down the way it works is you put
your thumb and little circle with your
own face on it and drag it into one of
three directions to the left for
messenger up for your app list and right
for your most recent app those are
pretty limited options and I find a
completely strange that Facebook doesn't
have a top-level camera shortcut going
into apps you've basically got two sides
on the far left is a traditional full
alphabetical list of all your apps and
on the right is a bookmark screen which
you can't have our folders or widgets of
course though there are buttons for
posting your status updates photos or
check-ins on Facebook if you have a pin
code enabled Facebook home can be a
little disorienting by default you can
interact with cover feed and even see
all of your installed apps without
entering your PIN it only shows up once
you tap an app of course if you're
nervous about this level of access you
can switch your pin to be on the top
level technically there is a more button
that you can use to get your traditional
launcher and traditional widgets but
overall Facebook
huge step backwards Facebook was clearly
trying to simplify things but it's
simplified way too far and even the most
basic smartphone user is likely to feel
restricted home also takes your
notifications and puts them in little
great rectangles that float in the
center of your screen
you can swipe them away individually or
long pressing them to stack them
together and dismiss them as a group for
most people the only notifications that
work this way will be messenger and SMS
alerts but on the HTC first everything
shows up there all that said in my
testing Facebook home has been fast and
fluid with only the occasional pause as
it brings in new updates facebook says
it created a lot of custom code to make
things fast and it shows this looks and
feels nothing like Android the second
big part of Facebook omen is an update
to messenger called chat heads it's a
stupid name for a really awesome idea
Facebook throws the little circular icon
on your screen for your active
conversations no matter where you are on
your phone chat heads work with facebook
Messenger and SMS messages but
unfortunately with nothing else SMS
messages are integrated into facebook
Messenger but Facebook keys and separate
it out from your traditional messages
and that's a little annoying the little
chat heads can be repositioned thrown
around or thrown away quickly and easily
so even if they get in the way you can
quickly toss them to another part of the
screen tapping out a chat head brings up
your conversation with that person on
top of whatever you're doing it sounds
intrusive and weird but in practice it's
stupendously convenient it's more
compelling than the launcher part of
Facebook home and much more likely to
become popular on the HTC first at least
chat heads work even if you have
facebook home turned off I'm pretty much
hooked on chat heads Facebook home has a
lot of interesting ideas about how home
screen should work and it's undoubtedly
fast and beautiful but for now I just
can't recommend that anybody install it
there's just not enough in the way of
managing your apps for most people right
now Facebook has promised that it will
update home on a monthly basis so maybe
it will get better over time still chat
heads is really cool and worth a shot
since home is free you can download it
and give it a try but what I ended up
doing was switching to a default
launcher while still using chat heads
even though I'm not using home I'm
pretty sure that Facebook is still
immensely pleased to have a presence on
my screen even if it doesn't own my
entire home screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
