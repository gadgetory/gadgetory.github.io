that name is absolutely awful
this phone itself is actually really
important it's kind of a restart for the
company LG is said that going forward
it's not just gonna release phones just
because Samsung is putting out phones at
the same time instead
LG's gonna take more time and make its
new hardware account the g7 is the first
product designed under that new
philosophy it's got a notch good cameras
and some AI smarts but ultimately the g7
isn't as good as it could have been or
needed to be to truly compete the g7 s
overall design has a lot in common with
last year's v30
there's glass on both sides curved edges
and a nice refined look it's IP 68
water-resistant and there's an actual
powered button on the side this time so
the fingerprint sensor around back
doesn't push in anymore there's also a
dedicated Google assistant key which I
found way more helpful and more
convenient than Samsung's bixby button
you can press it to bring it up
assistant or hold it down to open google
lens and learn about the things around
you now I still really wish I could
remap this button to do whatever I want
but just like Samsung LG's not letting
you do that yet
we've asked and it sounds like it's a
possibility for the future the front is
dominated by a 6.1 inch IPS LCD display
and it's got a resolution of 31 20 by
1440 now it doesn't have the same
perfect blacks and contrasts as OLED but
the LCD screen is colorful it's crisp
and it's easy to read even in direct
sunlight there's a special super-bright
mode that cranks brightness all the way
up to a thousand nits for a few minutes
overall I have no complaints about this
display whatsoever but I don't love that
not see this phone looks a lot like the
iPhone 10 but on the iPhone 10 that
notch houses Apple space ID system and
there's nothing that fancy or
sophisticated on the LG sure you get a
little bit more screen by pushing your
notifications to the corners that's
really the only upside I've seen
now if the notch really bugs you LG lets
you change the top of the screen to
black or other colors if you want to
kind of hide it that's fine but all this
just makes me wonder why this phone has
a notch to begin with around back LG's
staying on brand and sticking into its
familiar dual cameras
that combines a primary F 1.6 aperture
camera with a secondary super wide lens
that's got a 107 degree field of view
and F 1.9 aperture now that's not quite
as all-encompassing as some of LG's
previous super wide lenses but I'm still
a huge fan of the creative flexibility
you get with this combo I just find
myself using that Y perspective more
often than I would a portrait lens or
some gimmicky monochrome black and white
sensor Huawei now puts three cameras on
its phones but none of them give you
this view now when it comes to overall
picture quality these cameras are good
but don't measure up to the pixel to
galaxy s 9 y YP xx Pro or iPhone 10 in
terms of detail and image processing but
for the first time in years
LG's front-facing camera is finally
decent the eight megapixel sensor
produces selfies with good sharpness a
nice even exposure but the thing is all
this thin qai camera stuff that LG has
been hyping is pretty mediocre when you
open the camera app you can tap the AI
cam icon and the camera is going to
analyze what's in the frame it'll try to
figure out what you're appointed at is
it a flower is it an animal and when it
knows it'll try to make adjustments so
you get the best possible picture that
might mean adjusting settings like
contrast or color balance or saturation
it'll boost blues in the sky make
flowers more vibrant and try to make the
food you're shooting look a bit more
appetizing in these straightforward
examples the AI can help snap a decent
photo without making you adjust settings
yourself but the AI is guesses at what
the camera is pointed at are often bad
and wrong you'll focus on various
subjects and you'll see words flash on
the screen the show at the AI thinks
that it recognizes so it might correctly
identify a dog for example but then
you'll see a stream of unrelated very
dumb suggestions appear alongside the
right one and when that happens you
wonder if the LG is making bad decisions
that could make your image worse and not
better
so for most cases just use standard auto
mode or manual if you want full control
LG is also known for best-in-class sound
so that g7 retains the headphone jack
and quad act of its predecessors and
notice give you amazing audio if you've
got the right high five phones new this
year is support for DTS X 3d surround
sound which is aimed less at audio files
and more people who just want their
Netflix to feel more immersive so the g7
doesn't have stereo speakers but LG put
a lot of work into the single one on the
bottom it's called a boombox speaker and
it's designed to use the inside of the
phone as a kind of resonance chamber so
your music can get super loud you can
feel every bass note and drum beat
vibrate the phone in your hand as you
use it which is kind of neat though it
does make the g7 feel a bit hollow
inside now LG says the boombox speaker
sounds best placed down on a table and
that's true
it's way louder than most other phones
today but a single speaker only takes
you so far and it's very easy to cover
up with your hand by accident day to day
the g7 is fast and a great performer
thanks to the Snapdragon 820 5 processor
and 4 gigabytes of RAM inside he also
gets 64 gigs of storage plus a microSD
card slot if you need more room but LG's
own software is still a weak point for
the g7 that's just one example
every time you download a new app you've
got to restore the app launcher to keep
things in alphabetical order every
single time so I think LG either needs
to try harder at software or just make
the change to stock Android now the g7
runs Android Oreo out of the box and
LG's promising it's gonna do a better
job at software updates this year we
know how this works I'll believe it when
I see it but Android P is optimized for
this new wave of phones that have these
notches so hopefully once that's
available LG gets it out fast
now I found battery life to be somewhat
disappointing during my testing the g7 s
3000 milliamp hour battery is smaller
than last year's LG phones and many of
today's flagships especially for phones
that have screens that are this big if
you're using the phone a lot you're
gonna have to find more power at some
point in the day that's just the truth
of it the bundled charger does to stuff
the g7 very fast and it supports both
wireless charging standard
but neither of those things really makes
up for having a small battery to start
with so LG was helping to blaze some new
paths and revitalize its mobile business
with the g7 thin queue I don't think
this is gonna get the job done the
trouble really starts with that
god-awful name there are people who'll
buy this phone no matter what and that's
because of its fun camera and amazing
audio they'll be happy but this isn't
some grand reinvention of LG's phones
I'd say that g7 is pretty iterative and
it looks a lot like an iPhone so when
you stacked the g7 up against 2018 s
best smartphone contenders it's hard to
find one feature or standout thing
that'll make this device or short buyer
hit no it's not a thousand dollar phone
like the iPhone 10 but it's not much
cheaper either so it might very well
have the same fate as its predecessors
and send LG back to the drawing board
again hey thanks so much for watching
be sure to check out our new YouTube
channel verge science a lot of people
worked very hard to make this happen
and it's full of awesome videos so check
