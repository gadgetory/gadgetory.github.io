Shaffer and we just got a pretty big
donation for a new executive producer to
help with the show this is 90 seconds on
the verge sponsored by my great aunt Liz
Google is officially getting into
smartwatches in a very big way the
company today announced android wear a
version of its popular operating system
designed for wearables details are still
forthcoming but here's what we know so
far taking a cue from the company's own
glass headset Google now plays a major
role here providing automatic passive
reminders the watches will also connect
with Android smartphones so that you'll
be able to get all the notifications you
want you'll be able to interact with an
Android wear device either by touch
screen or by using your voice for things
like dictation and search and because
it's a wearable the watches will track
your steps best of all Android wear will
support circular watch faces and
Motorola has wasted no time taking
advantage of that the company is calling
it moto 360 and it's much more elegant
than any SmartWatch we've seen thus far
Motorola hasn't released any details
like battery life or screen resolution
but it's promising the watch will launch
globally this summer LG has also
announced the g watch with the more
SmartWatch conventional Square screen
the company says it will come out in the
second quarter of this year google says
it's working with a handful of other
Android partners including a sous HTC
and Samsung and that's it for today's
top stories coming up our executive
producer says I need to settle down with
a nice girl and to call her more often</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
