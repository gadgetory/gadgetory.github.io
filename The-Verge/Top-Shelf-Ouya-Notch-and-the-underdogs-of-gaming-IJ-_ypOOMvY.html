and on this show we bring you the best
in consumer electronics past present and
future this week a new wave of gaming
platforms we've said it before that this
is truly the year of the hardware
startup the baby shows in tech CES South
by Southwest and last week's Game
Developers Conference have been
dominated by upstart companies who
aren't making apps or software but are
building tangible and sometimes wearable
projects Kickstarter is obviously a
catalyst for all of this the platform
has helped to finance everything from
the pebble smartwatch to the upcoming
oculus rift virtual reality headset one
of Kickstarter's biggest success stories
isn't just trying to build a gadgets
though they're trying to build an
ecosystem for decades your living room
has been ruled by just a handful of
gaming companies like Nintendo Sony and
Microsoft now via and devices like in
videos project shield and arguably even
the steam box are vying to break up this
tradition of three Booya is a $99
console built on crowd-sourced funding
in the Android operating system it's now
shipping to about 60,000 of those early
backers and will soon hit retail stores
like Best Buy and Target in June our own
editor-in-chief Joshua Topolsky was one
of those early backers so I stole his
idea to see how a great idea turns into
a real-world product who was really one
of the earliest Kickstarter success
stories the company met its goal in 8
hours and raised more than eight and a
half million dollars for was ultimately
a really simple purpose bringing all the
new innovative games that are being
developed for mobile platforms back to
the TV for $99 we have pre-sold a box
but also an open platform and an
invitation to developers to create fun
games for the big screen again now nine
months later he is starting to ship to
the more than 60,000 people who backed
its Kickstarter campaign ours appears in
something like a shoebox and you almost
wouldn't know there's a gaming console
in there the actually is about the shape
of a Chinese food takeout container it's
a slightly deformed silver and black
cube with a glowing ghoulia logo on the
top there's a power jack on the back
plus all the ports you'll need to
connect it to the internet and your TV
it's nice looking without being
particularly remarkable de is designed
to be super hackable even it's hardware
you can open it up and see what's inside
with just a screwdriver and the company
even gives you the blueprints to 3d
print your own case it's all very nerdy
really inside the GUI is basically an
Android from there's a Tegra 3 processor
and a gig of ram and the whole thing is
based on Android 4.1 jelly beans but of
course this isn't an Android phone it's
an Android console whatever that means
one thing it does mean is that the Ouya
comes with a wireless controller a gray
and black thing about the size and
weight you'd expect it is all the usual
controls 2 analog sticks triggers and
bumpers a d-pad and the standard four
buttons we had decided that instead of
having a B X&amp;amp;Y though they've used oh u
Y and a which is just insanely confusing
a is where B normally is U is x o is a
why is y at least so that's something
there's even a touchpad in the middle
like the PlayStation 4s controller but
this one you mostly just use to Mouse
around the interface when the d-pad
doesn't work quickly it's a decent
Bluetooth controller even if it does
feel a little cheap and plasticky in
places and some of the buttons feel a
little mushy and uncomfortable there are
lots of other controllers you can use
with you like the PlayStation 3 and the
Xbox 360 controller but you have to root
to use the best of them and that's
really a whole different subject from a
hardware perspective do use a decent
first effort it's nice looking pretty
minimalist and at least feels worth it's
$99 price tag let's be honest none of
that really matters what matters is how
it games so how does it game so at this
point I've kind of spent a lot of time
with Yui and I have lots of thoughts and
opinions but I want to see what somebody
else thought so I brought Ross Miller hi
Ross so to basically just go nuts with
the Ouya and somehow you ended up here
what what is this game I'm doing this
game is called the ball and I was very
intrigued by obviously the the great
name to it no I'm sorry
you know mysterious I will say it looks
good it does look I'm surprised my
favorite part of it though it was like
there's three buttons there is push the
ball there is pull the ball and in my
favorite there is look at the ball yes
right there if you did it I can get
anywhere I can do anything I want and
then I hit the I guess the Y button and
then it's fine it's it's you know it's
one of those kind of like puzzle game
it's not a big deal it does show that it
is capable
of a pretty decent 3d game and yes so
this is the basis the weird stick of
this thing to me and tell me if you've
seen the same thing they have a bunch of
games I think it's like a hundred games
or something right now and most of them
you've poked around a little bit most of
them are super basic right there not
only ports of android games but ports of
like really simple really low and
android games I mean that's the thing
like this is launching with a pretty
sizable like number of games it's not
quantity its quality there's something I
would say that really stands out right
there flagship game is Final Fantasy 3
which was a which was a cool game like
25 years it's that or it's you know it's
cannibals which is just a fun little
game to run around with
I mean she's also like it's and it's a
fun game and it's not bammy the Xbox 360
flex she gave me to argue with was
galaxy war it was simple it was colorful
of you I had a good time playing
cannibal is the same way that being said
we've played Final Fantasy 3 before we
played Mega Ball before I mean it's it's
interesting that it's here but we're
still at the point where like it feels
kind of like a glorified tech demo in
hardware right and so this was the this
was the weird thing to me as I've been
playing through it and we've just been
messing around side loading games and so
leah has their own separate store they
have a whole different way for bringing
apps into their ecosystem they're
enforcing it you have to have free apps
you can't charge people for downloads
and so they don't have Google Play but
they're constantly upselling you and
let's let's not forget I was learning
this earlier and I bought the full
version cannibal I don't know how much I
just still don't I got an email receipt
a minute ago that I still don't know how
much look I'm terrified to look at how
much $20 game I was in thousands of
dollars no and I mean like but like it's
unfortunate it's not clear this menu
system is unfortunately vague so there
are there are a couple of different ways
to get games on right so there's the way
hooya wants you to do it or the easiest
way on here which is their store they
have kind of a discover away and I have
a neat way of actually bringing up
interesting games that makes it so that
they're doing it by engagement so like
if a lot of people play a game it rises
up and more people get access to it um
but they also they have this big thing
about being hacker friendly which is
sort of true you can like open up the
box here and get inside this is
basically just like a smartphone inside
here so you can get in and hack around
and play around yeah it's nice but you
can also they have emulators which let
you play you know Super Nintendo
and 64 games emulators themselves
actually come in the store so you can
really easily download a bunch of roms
and throw them on a USB stick and stick
it in here that's awesome yeah but then
where this would be really really cool
is if you could actually play like these
really great games that are on Android
Android has all these cool games like
shadow gun which we're playing right now
right and you just can't play them on
here like we figured out a way to
sideload them but it involved we had to
go and download a file browser and then
we like stumbled into it after hours of
looking and then every its AirDroid and
this the other thing is to like it
doesn't always work to like write try
shadow going doesn't work every single
time you pick it up Netflix seem to have
a few issues to yeah I mean it's an open
platform but it's also not a supported /
platform it seems well right and all of
these things like shadow gun I've paid
for shadow gun like 40 or 50 times but
today to do it now is you're either you
know conning Google out of a licensing
fee by going and get the Play Store and
doing it that way right or you're
illegally ASIC essentially pirating
these apps and the thing that kills me
is like there's no good reason I can't
just get shadow gun no on this site I
would gladly pay for it I would I want
to play it on my TV it looks great on
the TV but but it's just not there and
like I don't know how it gets there and
you're looking that's what does it take
here's the super interesting about
Android it's a platformer but it's a
platformer with other ecosystems on top
of it there's a Google Play Store it is
always like people complain and
criticize it for being almost too open
like you don't know what to get it's a
giant wealth of apps and you have these
people who are building stores on top of
it Amazon most famously Tegra zone if
you have a compatible device which is by
the way it says yes India is another app
ecosystem the idea is to curate I guess
it's kind of wide like the heavy bright
voting these games up we want to show
the best and we want to curate to this
audience the almost a platform within a
platform sure and and we've you know
seen there are a lot of different people
trying to create these different
platforms but for like does this can
this work like what does it take for
them to get to the point where can they
get around having the Play Store and
still be successful selling me a hundred
hour game console like do they have to
go get everything else because that
seems a lot harder than just like I
could buy an Android phone and plug it
into my TV and that would work
like what's the why why I mean an
Android phone like who is going to do
that who's gonna grab their Android
phone and think great I can put three
wires into it and I'll have a decent
experience and it feels a little
tethered I'm like the matrix do it no no
maybe this is like it's sold to
consumers as sit down play some games
enjoy yourself it's only 100 bucks the
problem is you nee an Xbox for like
maybe $200 even much better array of
games right it's not as small I mean
this is adorable but like you're
basically selling a dream and the first
60,000 people have gotten this the
Kickstarter back you know these
Kickstarter backers this is the dream
realized this is not one of the normal
console makers they're trying something
new they're breaking out and it feels
open the problem is but that's thing I'm
not going to ask this is the dream being
realized I'd like if this were the dev
kit if booyah was sending this out to
all of the people who wanted to develop
apps for it and being like here's some
great games it works mess around figured
out and we're gonna launch with tons
more apps and more games and more stuff
you can do like that would be great but
people who like this is Josh to Polsky's
he bought this he backed them on
Kickstarter and got this Josh as far as
I know doesn't want to build a game he
wants to play a games and right now out
of work clearly has a lot of hello is a
fair point but he just wants to play
games and for right now it's this isn't
a good gaming platform it's a fun way to
like mess around and it's easier to
route and get inside but like my dad is
not gonna want to do that he just wants
to sit down and play maybe my dad's
into shadow gun shadow gun but yeah but
he can't right and so like I guess
hopefully they get there maybe
eventually over time but I feel like if
I'm one of the 60,000 people who already
bought one of these I'm just now sort of
crossing my fingers that my hundred
dollars eventually becomes worth it even
though like I have a thing but it
doesn't seem like it's worth here's
here's the thing like that bothers me
the most there are two like two people
need to worry about the people who
bought the dream who know it's a
Kickstarter thing it's not gonna be
fully realized like you buy a pebble
smartwatch earlier you've got it doesn't
do everything it was promised but it
gets something and you get to like it
feel like you're a part of something you
visited this is it okay if you're making
stuff like you're gonna have a good time
with this if you're playing you're
getting the portal experience like
you're just going to the Ouya portal
you're getting that these games it's not
much there we have a lot of support
we've yet to see it realized and that's
a problem and this is coming to retail
what early June 4th you yes I hope
there's a lot
more there to see cuz hope so too it's
not gonna be a good first impression you
come out the box and you get a free
version cannibal that charges you god
knows what to play the second level or
whatever and they owe them my life now
it's possible I don't have a home
innings that's that's the thing so I
mean it's it's a great idea it's happy
it's open but this isn't the dream
realized yeah and it does feel like the
beginning across the whole thing like
this interface here is sort of nice but
there's some messy stuff and even like
little animations are really clunky
which just doesn't work at all I do like
that we have this controller which I
actually kind of like in some ways it's
not bad it has a front touchpad that's
very like you know you know hello ps4
right it's basically and it's sort of
layers cuz it's like you for the most
part can use the controller and then
every once in a while it just breaks
down and doesn't work anymore and then
you're like oh well you have a trackpad
just use that and this if you are a nerd
if you like this kind of stuff
you're going to enjoy this right but
this is gonna be invest buy for $100 in
June and they have a long way to go
before I tell you in June to buy it for
even at $100 I don't know maybe that's
just me but again it's open it's great
but I mean like it's again that there's
no Netflix there's no place for
Minecraft or whatever
I mean well so minecraft is actually
kind of a great example of all this
right as minecraft is both an app that
something like ooh yo really means like
I would imagine there are a lot of
people white whatever so minecraft is
something like on Ouya if this were $100
and it were a great minecraft machine
for your TV people would buy that that
would be exciting and if it were the
same for you know a lot of other games
but they have it's called xbox welfare
and minecraft is also kind of this
platform that has built a whole world on
top of itself right like it started as a
game and it became this thing that
people build houses on and they build
their own games on and they do all kinds
of such mechanic you can't break things
like that in Minecraft though so it's
yes you can yes anyway though but I mean
is it fair to say that that's kind of a
what somebody like who you should be
looking to as like how do we build a
real community around this and make it a
viable company I don't know what the
answer is like I don't like that it's
it's almost a paradox we weren't open
like so we can do whatever we want with
it but we also want curated so we know
what's good so it's like right you have
a store that's awesome and like you find
great things and that's what 19 hours
and the people do or the 90% that people
do and the other 10% like you can just
do what you want right
making that balance like apples went one
way and roids a hole went the other
and no one's quite happy yet so he is
really digging into that 10% I guess for
now and I guess maybe they never get out
of that but like minecraft made it work
by getting to just that 10% but the
thing is if you want a viable platform
you've got to make it happy for anyone
who doesn't just want to create like
they just want to experience with other
people create right so we actually at
GDC this past week had a chance to talk
to Markus Persson the who's not and like
teachers legally change his name notch
is a way better name but so we had a
chance to talk to him at GDC about
Minecraft and all of this building a
platform and how to really be successful
in kind of this indie video game world
and we talked to him about what's coming
up next what he's up to and how indie
hardware fits into gaming from now on
I'm TC Sadiq with the verge and I'm here
at GDC 2013 I'm sitting on a white couch
somewhere in the future the future of
gaming I'm joined by Markus Persson you
might know better is not the creator of
Minecraft thanks for joining us Oh likes
that with us so GDC is a lot about the
future of gaming you know you had EA
introduced battlefield 4 here this week
which was unusual but the story has
really been a lot about indie games free
games casual games what do you think
that says about the industry in 2013
that's such a focus I think it's it's a
it's to me it gives me hope for the
future because kind of gaming goes in
trends and for a bit for too long
stretch it was a focus on the huge
productions of kind of play ones games
that they only played at one time and
they had huge budgets and now that games
are getting a little bit smaller young I
think day we can get some more
experimental games going you you're you
got minecraft on the Xbox 360 which was
kind of a feat do you think minecraft
would have existed at all if you hadn't
tried to go directly to console from the
beginning no definitely not
it's the game was kind of - out there -
to be kind of friend want to have a like
backbone like that um you know obviously
Xbox Playstation Nintendo aren't the
only platforms coming out
booyah for example which you're gonna
have your name etched on when it comes
out it's gonna be is
getting a lot of momentum why did you
back that project basically because I
think the more consoles the better
because if there's no competition then
it might get more open
seems like cosel's are getting more open
which is really cool and yeah you've
been kind of a big presence on
Kickstarter you know funding great
projects what do you think about
Kickstarter in terms of the future of
game development do you think it's the
industry is gonna shift towards that
kind of model being the primary way that
games get funded and developed I kind of
hope not because it's very front loader
the consumers take all the risk which is
not really nice to consumers I think the
main benefits is that smaller studios
who want to do something slightly larger
get some initial funding and that we can
have larger studios develop games
internally without having get publisher
money so they can focus more in actual
quality of the game so it's more
directed to the fans of the genre
you are Minecraft obviously started on
the PC and you've made some disparaging
comments about where Windows is headed
Windows 8 in particular and infamously
you refused to certify minecraft for
Windows 8 so what do you think about
valve steam box and kind of the push
towards Linux as a as a gaming operating
system I have like this yearly ritual
cannabidiol try to install Linux to try
to use it it never really takes and it
never really works for me some reason I
think if Linux gets to the point where
it's actually like more
consumer-friendly than Windows then that
would be really really good are you
gonna continue to develop for Windows
then in the meantime and not focus on
Linux at all or are you gonna try to do
things in parallel I think we're gonna
try to make sure that what we do is kind
of cross-platform so that they get kind
of desktop version it's not Linux
Windows and Mac there's also a lot of
excitement you know beyond consoles
about new ways of interacting with with
games you new peripherals we have leap
motion coming out we have new virtual
reality stuff Gabe Newell has talked a
lot about biometric feedback and what
are you as a developer most excited
about what you want to get your hands on
for me right now it's the oculus rift
definitely it's I I kind of was one of
those kids growing up to hope that
the yard will become a Fame and then you
got to try that
we're shooting dinosaurs games without
possibly the horrible death on nightmare
and yes but with oculist actually kind
of passes a threshold of being not good
to actually being good we're kind of the
more use the MOR reverse immersive gets
and you you were one of the first to
receive an early kid right now so you've
been playing around with it a lot yeah I
mean minecraft is coming to the rip
sooner that's that's a up to gents I try
to leave those decision saying but I
have been trying to play around with
make adding oculus rift support to the
dominating libraries well I could have
been to lace it actually do they're
actually have a lifting of it but it's
kind of iPad product in office at the
moment Mojang is being now minecraft is
huge
do you still feel like an indie
developer no not in the last service it
depends on what you mean by in the
developer I mean we are independent they
owned and we tried to make the games we
want to make for the sake of making from
games and not necessarily just to make a
profit but we're for me in the game
developer more meals like the garage
developer someone's sitting at home just
making games that'll cure passion and
then that sense that no we're not really
in there
so garage developers that are working
now I mean knowing what you know what
would you tell them if they're starting
out today they're making the next
Minecraft from their from their bedroom
I think it's just make games for
yourself and try to have a critical eye
to what you do so don't just make
something and kind of pat yourself on
the back but actually try to look at
what it is and how it works and why it
doesn't work and what works in it right
than that but if you yourself genuinely
like the game that there's gonna be
other people who like it as well thank
you so much Marcus thank you that's our
show thanks so much for watching thanks
to TC Sadiq notch and Ross Miller for
being here for lots more on Leah and the
whole new indie gaming phenomenon be
sure and check out the verge calm
thank you so much for watching we'll see
you next week
