and last month Microsoft introduced the
new surface pro it's a really big tablet
that's meant to be is with a keyboard
case and can be used with a stylus
they're the same type of device but
they're used in some pretty different
ways vibrate Pro is still very much a
tablet it's keyboard types great but you
still to rely on touch to get around and
the service Pro is really a full laptop
you can use the touchscreen but there's
also full trackpad and keyboard controls
too I'd like to thought I fit pros so
natural when you're using with touch
it's an iOS device after all so
literally every app is designed for it
the service pro does a much better job
when you want to keep your hands on the
keyboard when this is designed for the
desktop first after all so touch can be
a little bit awkward the difference
extends to apps all my favorite iPad
apps are here which means I can use some
really powerful and free versions of
Photoshop that's still mobile Photoshop
I can use actual Photoshop on the
surface that's the kind of difference is
gonna make it hard for pros to pick the
iPad pro the real professional app just
aren't here yet on the other hand touch
support isn't quite as strong in Windows
apps so if you're looking for a tablet
first and foremost there might be reason
to think twice about choosing the
surface one thing that artists will love
is iPad pro stylus is one of the best
I've ever used the service pen can be a
little bit less natural but I love that
it has an eraser every stylist should
have one I really wish the Apple pencil
had an eraser but it is really
responsive and has amazing palm
rejection
although quality will vary from app to
app same goes for the surface my
handwriting looks beautiful in OneNote
but less so elsewhere the iPhone is also
much more limited when it comes to the
kickstand it only has this one angle and
putting it together feel like folding
origami here that's not a problem with
the surface the kickstand is built into
the back so it's really easy to move and
you can put it pretty much any angle the
other like this one angle or you get a
new keyboard here you're good with
pretty much anything the one angle also
isn't great for balancing in your lap
because there's a short keyboard it
constantly feels like it's got to fall
over on the surface the key book can be
a little bit bouncy but you don't have
to worry about it falling at all part of
that has to do with the iPad size it's a
little bit taller and a little bit wider
than the surface it almost feels like a
big book which is kind of nice the sort
of supposed to feel a bit more like a
clipboard it's a little bit smaller but
it's a little bit heavier to you run to
side by side apps on both they look
really big and nice on the iPad but
chances are you'll get a bit more done
with two desktop apps on the surface and
that's what's so interesting here
the history of these two devices colors
so much of how you use them the iPad pro
is a tablet first and the surface pro is
a laptop first both are trying to be
right in the center but for now we have
to choose which side you want the most</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
