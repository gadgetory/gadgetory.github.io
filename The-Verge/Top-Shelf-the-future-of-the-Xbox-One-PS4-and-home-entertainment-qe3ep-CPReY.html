and I'm here in sunny smoggy June gloomy
Los Angeles we're here on the floor of
III it's the biggest video game
convention in the world and this promise
to be one of the biggest ones ever
microsoft and sony are showing off all
kinds of new stuff for their consoles
nintendo has all kinds of convincing to
do it seems like every game maker on the
planet is around here somewhere showing
off all the games that's coming out with
this year Microsoft kicked off the week
with a huge press conference showing us
game after game designed to run on the
new xbox one we saw the TV and video
game mashup quantum break Forza 5 and
it's drive at ours battlefield 4 and
it's crazy exploding of everything in
the world and many many other games
there's even a new halo we also saw a
lot of smart glass which figures heavily
in bday Xbox one plans plus a new design
for the xbox 360 and most importantly we
got a price the Xbox one is coming in
November for 499 dollars sony came out
later on monday at another huge arena in
LA and just started taking shots at
microsoft the ps4 which we finally got
to look at and play with will cost just
three hundred ninety nine dollars and
you'll be able to sell your used games
and the ps4 won't check to make sure
your online oh and sony has a great
store for indie developers sorry I
microsoft sony did roll out a line of a
great looking games to from the amazing
open-world shooter destiny to watch dogs
where your primary weapon is your cell
phone so nice pitching the ps4 as the
console for real gamers while
Microsoft's trying to be every
entertainment device to every the rest
of the week was littered with great
looking games we couldn't play because
they're not ready and other great
looking games we couldn't play because
the lines were way too long nintendo's
new mario kart game is fun but its mario
kart game battlefield is ambitious but
not yet what we hope it will be and fifa
14 does look just as great as we felt
III is really only the beginning this is
just stage setting for the next few
months and especially for this holiday
season when gamers all over the world
can finally get their hands on the x
is one and ps4 and for every answer
we've gotten this week about the new
consoles we've only found more questions
so we sent our own Paul Miller to sit
down with Scott road a sony worldwide
studios playstation software product
development head to get some answers
you're launching a new console okay here
we are playstation 4 so this is the
start of the next gen I'm crazy excited
for this year what what do you think
defines next-gen what if you didn't know
which console was running on or the
hardware behind it you saw that games
next-gen that games not what would you
say that is it to me it's it's about
doing more of what we've seen on this
generation so it's it's not just there's
not some overall technology that's
necessarily better but overall the
PlayStation 4 is more powerful so for
example if you wanted to attach a deeper
physics model to every single enemy that
was on the screen and you want a higher
volume of those you can do that while
you're also putting an advanced lighting
model on the whole scene all of its
bigger and better that's what people are
going to notice you guys have gotten
this really great perception of being
the one for for gamers yeah what is it
about the games that that made people
walk away from these keynotes and think
Sony's games are about gamers and
Microsoft doesn't quite get it I think
man there's a million ways to answer
that question and I think a lot of it is
just some of the culture that's come
through from from a lot of the leaders
in our in our group it starts for me
with with shoe who is my boss and is
genuinely a gamer I love to play games
Adam who was on stage loves to play
games so when we talked to devs it we
don't go in with a spreadsheet and a
calculator and say okay this is the
profit margin on this game we're talking
about game features and how it relates
to movies we've just seen and how it
relates to other games and did you see
this did you see this mechanic in this
game and did you try this not
necessarily like game a B and C on
PlayStation beat game a B and C on exit
or not it's just a bad so overall I
think it's a general it's it's what
PlayStation stands for I mean again I
love to talk about this subject
because you can say look at a game like
heavy rain when it first came out not a
lot of places would approve development
on that game because it doesn't quite
make sense on the spreadsheet but it
advances our medium of games to a place
that it hasn't been before the
goosebumps right so it's true right it's
crazy it's really force blow its toll
it's really I mean that right and and
when shoe says that he means it and when
you know Adam Boyes goes out you know he
announces transistor onstage and right
today last night I don't get turns out
at all I don't have any idea what that
is but it but but but you did get that
it was that it looked beautiful and
different right so the point is the
first time he sees that he comes back
gift sends me a text give me a call hey
you're not going to believe how cool
this looks right and that just kind of
goes on we have to get this in the
family and then dev see that passion in
it just becomes a two-way thing what
would what happened to motion gaming for
you guys it's not really here at the
show you talked about at the launch you
talked about your technology for the eye
but I've always seen one game here fact
most of the PlayStation 4's aren't
plugged in to an eye and I think what is
really a big issue for me is that the
the PlayStation 4 is not shipping with
the eye as a default well to answer the
last question it's it's not something
that we wanted to require our customers
to purchase it's also not something
certainly back to the previous point
about about creative vision and kind of
freedom on teams it's it's not something
we wanted to mandate for every team as
well so what kind of taking it one step
at a time if there are great ideas that
come from great developers either inside
or from third parties or from our from
from indys from you name it we actually
embrace that completely but it's not
something that we're going to cram down
people's throats how did you guys feel
when you got to say that word out loud
or I don't know that it's because it's
394 the words and phrases 309
say it's a phrase so absolutely great I
mean it was an amazing feeling so you
know this plan went nuts absolutely and
we went nuts I mean we were kind of
Hooten just like everyone else because
this plan has been in place for years
you know developing a brand new console
takes a long time so with a goal that 0
was kind of put in motion about three or
four years ago you saw this at the
februari event where we talked about how
we talked to all the different
developers you know what are you liking
about the ps3 what what would you like
to see changed that's all real all that
happened and our goal was to build the
most powerful console at a price that
was affordable and we set that target at
399 and all the great engineers in Japan
mark cerny was leading all those teams
everything all came together the game
developers all came and said what they
wanted we made sure there was you know
eight gigs of the fastest Ram out there
I mean all these things that developers
wanted still manage to do all of that in
a machine that was super slick looking
and still did it for 3 99 that's why
it's something it's a moment that we're
very proud of and we were all that was
accentuated when our competitors
announced morning that it was 499 how
did that so no I mean were there
high-fives rounding are you kidding me
up so so so so like a low fuzz so we
were out we were all in rehearsals all
day so at the at the sports arena where
the the e3 event was the press
conference so you know that some people
are at the press conference everyone's
got looking at Twitter everything's and
as soon as it one ounce yeah there's
running up and down the aisle woohoo you
know makes our announcement that much
better so I just wanted to clarify the
the drm stuff there's been a little bit
of confusion because you guys again to
great applause I really can pay
attention to Microsoft's announcement to
great applause you know announced on
disk you're going to allow people that
you know they're going to play used
games and they don't have to connect to
the internet all the time that
you know be very clear Paul back laid it
out pretty clearly then you guys also
said some stuff though about developers
being able to set their own drm I just
want to you know clarify what what that
means and also what the drm policies are
for digital it's not that developers are
setting their own DMI drm we we set a
very clear policy about about physical
used games and there's a reason that you
know kind of that one-two punch just
basically saying look the your games you
bought them you can play them on your
machine at home and you want to play the
metra friend's house you take it to your
friends house and you play the policy is
very simple and we're setting the
precedent on definitely how we want all
first party games act and for me
personally I believe that you know why
would it make sense right for anyone to
come up with a used game drm policy
that's that's that that that isn't fair
to consumers well so so there are other
ways that your guys's policies right now
contrast with with the current gen or
are you guys the same it's the same
thing because we are seeing right in the
current jam the current gen like this
game comes with an unlock codes you get
a special sword for the person first
person who buys it or you know the
online activation to that so that less
than he was it going to limit at all
attempt to look it two different
questions so first question could a
publisher come out with a special piece
of content that is an unlock code that
makes it more valuable to the first
purchaser sure that could happen it
still doesn't prevent secondhand sale of
that game but I wondering if there's any
new ways you gonna try to discourage
that or no it's not it's not a goal to
discourage it I think we came right out
and said that the online pass you know
will go away because that's because it
requires a PS Plus subscription to play
multiplayer online does it make sense
for an online pass to ask you to pay
again it just doesn't make any sense
right so that's that's why we came out
very clearly and said that you know no
more online pass okay yeah what why does
some playstation plus cost to play
multiplayer
people have been used to having maybe a
subpar multiplayer experience on
PlayStation and also having that for
free so where's the where's the balance
there now that you have to pay from if
you're going to put it that way I think
that that does cost a lot of money to
run a set of online services that's what
I'm at yeah and I think of the reason
that you're moving that way yeah
absolutely can be better at multiplayer
absolutely okay you know if you're gonna
put it that way tell me that you'll be
better at multi and I think that that is
that is absolutely our goal you know we
want to provide a service that's very
robust and that offers you all kinds of
great value and it there's other
services there too and we're not going
to do silly things like not going to put
the movie services behind the pay gate
because that doesn't make sense you
already pay for it right so we're
treating this as fairly as we can you
know for all the customers out there and
making sure that they get a ton of value
and that they do get a better service at
the end of the day is there any reason
to believe that so that the PlayStation
4 will be any different than the
PlayStation 3 as far as your guys's own
entertainment services sony has this
vast library of movies and music that no
other publisher has and so let's take
advantage of it let's find new ways to
take advantage of it let's let's make
that PlayStation customer happier than
any other customer out there and what
Michael did say on sage is that it's to
his it's to his benefit that playstation
4 succeeds is that going to be connected
to PlayStation Plus in ways that the
people will be able to we're not
announcing how all those things tie
together I mean there's there's all
sorts of different permutation what are
there what does game or friendly content
mean like what do gamers want I think
what michael was referring to is that
there's obviously when you think of kind
of the stereotypical hardcore gamer you
kind of think of a certain genre of
movies I think that's what he was
referring to this would be all the fast
and furious man if there's no zombies it
doesn't make it on no it's it either you
know but but in that girl's name okay
yeah and I think
who knows what that means I think that
that gamers like a pretty wide variety
of movies so Gaikai I think I know I
assume Gaikai was coming the game
streaming was coming too at launch so
what why is that being delayed or is
that being delayed it's just it's a
service that's going to continue to grow
over time and I think that it's um you
know still a relatively new technology
and understanding how that's going to
work with PlayStation content on not
just PlayStation machines but on all
sorts of other devices there's still a
lot that that has to be worked out and
that was Andy's point he was he was
verifying that a beyond on all devices
here you know your smartphone your
tablet all that stuff but that it would
continue to grow over time I mean a part
of the family now and it's launching
early 2014 yeah that's what he knows and
you guys talked about select classic ps3
games being playable over Gaikai we
haven't announced exactly which I think
Andy's just making a point that we're
gonna start there and again that that
library is going to grow there's so much
in the PlayStation library from 17 years
I just didn't backwards compatibility
has been something that has been over
promise under delivered by everybody in
the Indiana me all the time yeah is
there any reason to believe that it's
going to be better this time what people
will still be playing history games
because i don't know if i have room for
a ps3 and a ps4 and xbox 360 and xbox
one in my welcome by the last two then
so again that is part of the goal is
that gaikai will not only reach out to a
whole different set of folks out there
but that it might satisfy some of that
need to play some of your older games
this is total tangent but I'm a huge
twitch TV fan yeah when you get the
notes you stream yeah I was really
excited about that because I think
that's I love enjoying games vicariously
and watching me all the way it's cool
but then microsoft announced which and
i'm at which guy yeah that's where I go
every night which you know games me to
sleep
where you guys surprised that microsoft
announced twitch streaming and do you
think that's just obvious that's obvious
but I don't know that we were surprised
either i mean this is this is an
industry this is the week when everyone
announces all their deals and
associations with all these other
technologies and companies so things
happen I mean was Microsoft surprised
when we announced redbox and flixster I
don't know your service is a little
different yeah and that it will you can
someone can jump in and play your game
right eventually through gotcha is that
the yeah that is that is that is kind of
the long-term goal there it's pretty
interesting it's a pretty interesting
idea I think someone is going to come
and help you out with something you have
in trouble with that's pretty neat and
so that will all happen through the
console interface you're watching
somebody over their shoulder then you
press a button yeah that is over yeah
again and then that is the long-term
goal this long-term goal and then will
that happen when die-cut launches or
maybe even longer than that not a
hundred percent sure okay you said you
get these sort of vertical slices of
these games and in the early stages and
obviously these are all still pretty
early are they there any that you get to
have a good time ps4 crazy next-gen
games that you can go into your office
right now sit down and have a good time
with I mean you can do that with
everything that you they saw at the show
like those were live gameplay demos that
you saw when you walked in last night so
yeah all those games I can I can play
those same sections it's just I can't
wait until all that stuff is revealed
because I'm really excited about how
that looks in that game so absolutely
all right all right Dina thank you so
much thanks take it easy so there's this
buzzword being thrown around next-gen
we've seen next-gen games we've seen
next-gen consoles it's really just all
next-gen everything what does that
actually mean we've seen dozens of games
of every shape and size but what makes
them next-gen we sent sean hollister our
resident next-gen expert to find out
what's the next generation game really
we came to e3 2013 to find out here
we've got the playstation 4 the xbox one
scenes galore but what are these games
all about of course better graphics play
a role Xbox and PlayStation developers
are competing to build the most photo
realistic virtual cars we've ever seen
and most every ps4 and Xbox one game
looks way better than games built for
the previous generation of consoles
characters and environments are more
richly detailed and where many ps3 and
xbox 360 games didn't even technically
run at 720p full 1080p HD is practically
a given what could be more glorious than
exploring a giant open-world at 1080p
Assassin's Creed Black Flag dead rising
3 even metal gear solid 5 are promising
huge environments to explore whether
you're sailing a pirate ship around the
Caribbean hiding from hordes of zombies
in a giant city or navigating
Afghanistan by horse those vast worlds
are also more interactive and immersive
than ever before some promised to let
you carve a path through the world
dynamically changing the environment
while others simply put armies of
characters on screen at the same time
those characters might not just be
cannon fodder either they could each
have their own backstory and make you
think twice about shooting them in the
back of the head even as open world
titles do away with the idea of breaking
games in two levels the graphical power
and speed of next-gen machines are
helping to bridge the gap between
cutscenes and gameplay while there's
still work to be done it may no longer
feel like you're watching one game and
playing a different less graphically
impressive one while we're talking about
seamless experiences how about throwing
multiplayer into the mix several studios
are working on titles that allow friends
more bitter rivals to seamlessly join
your ostensible single-player game while
others are trying to build multiplayer
games that feel like they have a real
merit when you turn off your next
generation console or PC the game won't
necessarily end at least not if you've
got a companion app for your smartphone
or tablet you'll create worlds command
armies that remotely help your friends
or use the device as a virtual reality
GPS so you all get lost in a virtual
world we're just beginning to see what
next-gen games are capable of here at e3
2013 looking at the work of developers
who began building these games with only
a hunch about the possibilities on tap
and even then we're only seeing the
initial versions of these games they
created
there's still plenty left to explore so
we've seen next-gen games we've seen the
next gen consoles and now all that's
left is to actually play the things so
that's it for a show this week thanks to
scott roadie from sony for being here
and of course to sean hollister and paul
miller will be back next week but
unfortunately for now I have to go I've
been saying I'm super 8 for way too long
we'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
