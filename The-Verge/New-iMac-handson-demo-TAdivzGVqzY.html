here with the new iMac it is really
really thin you can see it's got justice
5 millimeter edge on it and it's
actually kind of an optical illusion
because if you keep turning it you see
it's got a really aggressively rounded
back so there is some depth here it's
just apples cleverly hidden it from you
but the effect works really really well
and until you come all the way around it
actually does appear to be just 5
millimeters then the other big
improvement here is the display Apple
isn't calling this a Retina display but
they're using all the kind of the same
techniques so it's optically bonded
glass you've got the same kind of
software powering a pixel doubled screen
as you'd find on the retina MacBook Pros
this thing can run an effective
resolution as high as 1920 x 1080 but
other than that you know when you're at
a normal distance you're not going to
see pixels on it other Apple isn't
calling it the retina display come on to
the thinness and the the great new
screen this is kind of the first reason
you'd have to buy a new imac in years if
you had an iMac and kind of seeing the
iterative updates come out there hasn't
really been a reason to push you forward
but I would say this new display and
actually the thickness of this thing
makes a really compelling product
