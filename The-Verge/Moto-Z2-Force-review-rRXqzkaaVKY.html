every year they should be faster take
better pictures and have a battery that
lasts longer but Motorola's Moto Z two
forces evidence that this isn't always
the case sometimes phones can take a
step or two forward but even more
backwards the z2 force is coming to
every major US carrier this month for
round $720 and for that price it's hard
to recommend just about anybody
Motorola's made it faster and added a
dual lens camera but the battery has
been shrunken down just for the sake of
thinness and probably in hopes of
selling more moto mods the big selling
point of this phone is that it's got a
shatterproof display Motorola promises
that the 5.5 inch 2k screen won't crack
or break from the everyday drops that
would spell doom for other smartphones
the secret to all this is that that
display is actually plastic several
layers of plastic and it makes plastic
he sounds when you press on it in
certain spots and the topmost layer is
very prone to scratches I've only had
this review unit for a few days but it's
already starting to pick up marks from
living in my pocket can't imagine how
it's gonna hold up over the course of a
few months or a year with the old moto
is the Motorola let customers replace
that top layer themselves for about 30
bucks but that's no longer an option on
the upside the CT force is definitely
tough I dropped it on in the pavement
when I was taking off the latest moto
mod and it came away with just a few
Nicks but water is a different story
there's a nano coating applied to the
phone that should keep the Z tube force
safe in the rain or from a spill but you
can't submerge it so it's not protected
the same extent as the galaxy s 8 HTC u
11 or the iPhone 7 for over $700 and own
a phone that's advertised as being tough
it really should be once you're over the
invincible screen gets actually using
the Moto C to force it's blazing fast
inside is the latest Snapdragon
processor 4 gigs of ram 64 degrees of
storage and a micro SD card slot in case
you need more space
all of Motorola signature Android
improvements are here moto display gives
you a helpful view of notifications as
they come in without waking up your
phone and motive oh no is it someone
show me command for opening apps or
showing the weather or the calendar I
didn't really use the show me command
because Google assistant can do all this
stuff and it usually does it better too
the second headline feature of the z2
force is its dual lens camera both rear
cameras are 12 megapixels
one shoots color and the other one
shoots monochrome black and white now
when you pair those with a flash it
looks like a smiling robot face but
overall Motorola still isn't making much
progress at the important part which is
capturing better quality images this
camera works just fine and good lighting
but elsewhere these photos can't shake
that taken with a smartphone look
they're muddy and over-processed
motorola takes advantage of having two
cameras with some cool depth of field
tricks you can blur the background of
your subject but the effect feels fake
and artificial
kind of like on the iPhone or you can
remove color from either the foreground
or background of your shot or take quote
true black and white images using just
the monochrome sensor these ideas are
clever but it's the execution where
Motorola falls flat and there are plenty
of apps that can do these same functions
and get better results where Motorola's
gotten the most criticism about the z2
force and deservedly so is in its
downsized battery which has a capacity
of just 27 30 milliamp hours that's a
big drop from the 3,500 milliamp hours
that we got last year but thanks to the
efficient Snapdragon 835 processor that
change doesn't really tank the phones
and dorrance they'll still get you
through a day of typical use even when
you're snapping on moto mods I saw
between four and a half hours to five
hours of screen on time so the big
question then is why did Morel make this
choice in the first place for a thinner
phone I guess but the Moto Z to play is
thinner than this and actually has a
headphone jack here we're again left
without a headphone jack and most of all
this whole thing just feels like a
barely disguised way of selling more
moto mod battery packs when you're
talking over $700 that's a lousy feeling
cost-cutting doesn't stop there either
there's no wireless charging on this
youtube force you've got to add a $40.00
moto mod for that and the included
charger isn't as powerful as the one in
the box last year there's not even a
style shell to cover up that camera bump
these decisions scream of the company
clean profits and accessory cells first
and their customers second and that's
ultimately what syncs the Moto Z to
force some people have said a thinner
phone makes it easier to use moto moneth
and carry them around but in all
seriousness how often are you going to
be carrying around a Bluetooth speaker
or a film projector those moto mods are
still novel and fun JBL speaker sounds
great in this new 4k 360-degree video
camera would be a ton of fun for
vacations video quality is excellent
outdoors but it's also $300 which makes
it a total non-starter for a lot of
people Plus why wouldn't you just buy a
battery pack or a Bluetooth speaker that
works with your other gadgets too this
whole moto mods concept but once seemed
like an innovative idea is now holding
back and restricting motor oils design
very few people are gonna pick this over
a galaxy s 8 sitting beside it on the
same shelf now to be fair motorola still
makes very good phones at the g5 plus
and the z2 play but this just isn't one
of them not when you can get a one plus
five with the same specs for nearly $250
less or the galaxy s 8 for about the
same cache if you really need a phone
and a screen that won't break just buy a
good case</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
