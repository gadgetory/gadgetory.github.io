with LG's brand-new g7 thin cue phone
the newest in its G series line it has a
6.1 inch qHD plus display LCD screen
though not OLED unfortunately you'll
notice that there's a notch there which
that notch can disappear actually you
can turn it on or off so if you want
edge to edge you can do that if not you
can disable it inside it has a
snapdragon 845 processor with 4 gigs of
ram and 64 gigs of expandable storage if
you use a microSD it's also ip68 water
resistant and dust resistant and it has
a 3000 milliamp hour battery that
supports both wireless charging
standards alright so let's talk a little
bit about the camera system I'm back
you'll notice there's a dual rear-facing
camera system both sensors are 16
megapixel one of them is ultra
wide-angle supporting which LG has used
on other models but this one LG says
should be a little less distorted at the
ends on the front you have an 8
megapixel front facing camera and all of
these cameras support what LG says is
its smart AI camera system the AI smart
camera supposed to help you take really
great photos so it'll look at the scene
you're taking supposedly recognize the
scene and what's in it like flowers or
people or food and then pick a filter
for you to make your photo look at best
and yes this has been kind of
controversial with all the rumors going
around but LG has indeed put a dedicated
Google assistant button on the side of
the phone right below the volume
controls similarly to Samsung's bixby
button the Google assistant button
cannot be programmed so you're stuck
with it although LG is saying that maybe
in the future depending on feedback
they'll let you change it up so like
other phones on the market like the
iPhone and a bunch of Android devices LG
is shipping its phones with a notch but
unlike those other phones g7 actually
lets you toggle the notch on and off if
you don't like it you can customize what
you see in the notches place so let's
say I don't like a full black bezel I
can actually turn the bezel part around
the notch into a rainbow gradient or
another type of grayscale gradient I
think this is kind of gimmicky but you
know what I like that you get the option
you don't have to use the notch if you
don't like it LG is also preserving the
headphone jack so Congrats to all of you
out there who loved the headphone jack
the reason it seems to be doing this is
because it has a support for something
called DTS X virtual surround sound
which is a virtual surround sound system
that you might see in home speakers and
the like but if you use wired headphones
or wire and speakers you should LG says
get more of a cinematic experience when
listening to music or watching videos it
also maintains the quad act that LG is
known for the phone will ship with
Android Oreo we unfortunately don't have
pricing because LG says it's leaving
that to the carriers to announce we also
don't have availability just yet but it
should be coming soon
