Windows 10 they talked about a lot of
stuff most of which we were expecting we
saw everything we thought we'd see with
Windows 10 we saw Windows 10 running on
a phone we saw it running on tablets we
also saw some really neat Xbox stuff
where you could stream Xbox games too so
it was all kind of what we thought it
would be but then the huge reveal at the
end hololens Microsoft has new
technology where they can literally show
you holographs in your living room or
whatever space you're in using a crazy
headset now Microsoft didn't let us film
or take pictures of anything that we saw
with hololens but we got to try it and
it was pretty great it saw a demo of
Minecraft and it was wild and you put
these things on and you looked down at
the table and there's a castle just
sitting on the table made out of
Minecraft blocks and you can look around
it and there's no lag everything reacts
to your head movements as though it were
real they obviously look like digital
objects it's not like photorealistic but
it was kind of incredible
there was a Skype demo where he would do
a Skype call and there would be a little
window hanging out with the head that
you were talking through the person and
he was looking at on a surface and he
could literally draw on top of the world
that I was looking at him on top of the
real world so they did a walkthrough
where they helped us like install a new
light switch and so there are these
wires sticking out of the wall and
healed like circle the wire and say take
this wire here and connected to this
screw here on the thing that I'm
actually holding it was a really smart
way to use this technology really
something I didn't expect they would
have thought through that well but what
they haven't thought through is all the
gestures you can look around to point
things and you
and tap they call it an air tap and
that's kind of about it you can also
talk to it to like switch tools but you
can't actually grab stuff and manipulate
it in space which you really would like
to do because you know as good as your
head might be your hands are way better
at manipulating objects that's what
they're designed for right the last demo
that we saw was Mars JPL the Jet
Propulsion lab is working with Microsoft
and they have a system where you put
this thing on and it literally
transports you to Mars it's not as
deeply immersive as an oculus rift so
you don't really feel like you're there
but what's cool about it is they mix the
real world with the Mars virtual world
together so there's a full-scale thing
of the Mars rover just right there and
you can stand in front of a monitor and
the mouse on the monitor you can slide
it off of the monitor onto the Martian
landscape and so your mouse you're using
the mouse and you're moving the mouse
pointer around on the surface of Mars it
was crazy
so overall what does all this mean for
Microsoft I think the most important
thing as cool as hololens was is that
Windows 10 is on the right track they've
simplified the UI they've made it much
easier to understand and there's no
longer this insanity of a million
different versions of Windows on a
million different devices there's just
one Windows it's called Windows 10
you're gonna be able to get it on your
phone and on your tablet and on your
laptop and on your giant huge monitor
that you've got in your meeting room
there's two cameras on and it's all
windows and that's the way it always
should have been
that's the way it's going to be later
this year and that's really exciting the
hololens stuff presumably it'll come out
that seems like they're pretty far along
I'm pretty excited for it but it I think
of it the way it same way I think of
something like Google glass or
self-driving cars or any of these other
crazy moon shots that we see other
companies do and yeah they'll sell it
that'll turn the real product but it
shows that Microsoft has got real
ambition they're not just going to you
know coast on making money off of
selling copies of office they really are
trying to invent the future here and
there a lot further along than we give
him credit for
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
