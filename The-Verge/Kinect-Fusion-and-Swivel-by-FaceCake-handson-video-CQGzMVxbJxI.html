sensor connected to a to a PC Windows 7
PC running the connect at windows site
work and this is what we can do i can
basically i enter a virtual fitting room
so just using my hand like there is down
down down the left and they slip at I
ongoing reform in this morning maybe a
nice little water for men like a
briefcase there myself a little business
book going on there when I switch the
briefcase between my hands I can see
hardwoods both sides jacket on over here
so I can get us really sent to trying on
clothes and virtual environments because
connect consume you see my skeleton can
map device onto my body I can do a few
other things I'm going to just clear
this one out go for
all involved with the stuff over here
and I see them trying to get into skiing
now I'm in the Pacific Northwest the
skiing would and I could make a location
as well so
and over here I can take my skin look to
the red car isn't quite going to work is
David we get the idea let me um show you
one more thing is just to go quick look
at the printed dress I'm gonna go into
women I think I'm here
so technically you can try the printed
dress on the butcher you can apply the
printing dress on so there you go if I
step back we can see the tweets on
circus of address i can go to move
around see a little bit of how it might
look so the birds really wants to see
we're in a formal gown Tom that's the
idea there you got a nice purple number
as pertinent yeah I think about you
there you go I just step onto the
catwalk onto the red carpet with your
hair to go down left hand side that
amateur seems
and then if you hit the camera above
your head it's going to take a snapshot
of me which we're obviously going to
post on faceboo so the idea here is when
David puts his arm into the sea and the
software's basically saying my hand on
this is inconsistent I can see movement
relative you know that scene is pitch is
what I'm expecting that the whole bunch
of pixels which are moving all together
in fact so it's segments that objects it
sees that as a separate object which
contract and simultaneously and you can
do that but potentially over multiple
objects what we need to do is similar
training to keep track mobb things each
one of those is simply fairly rigid and
what we show in this demo is by tracking
by knowing the position of the hand and
of course knowing position of everything
the background you can enable multitouch
so when favorite actually touches
anything as a physical seen you know the
system can see for those fingers are now
you know collocated with parts of the
scene for previously scanned in and they
can even put it in a paint mode so you
could do to this multi type pain on
anyone on arbitrary service retina going
to be flat surface takes the curve
so what sort of them like use cases we
do you expect this to be known won't you
see them I mean we've seen a lot of
interest in multi task right and I think
there are certain applications are at
you know in a way that is used in phones
in the States these days but i think we
think there's a lot more opportunity for
different forms of interaction in
different scenarios so you know keep on
a mouse on going away for tech center
food okay you know that's a great great
combination is it work but as we
starting about computers coming to more
different application areas so like in
in the kitchen when you're busy doing
something or you wanted to do i make
wanting more ad hoc interaction so
you're in a mobile scenario and you just
want to be able to project some content
and then interact with in terms of 1500
planar surface</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
