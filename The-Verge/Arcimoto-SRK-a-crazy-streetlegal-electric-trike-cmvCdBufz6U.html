it's a three-wheeled electric vehicle
we're a little bit fungible there's a
whole lot going on here when you glance
at this thing first off we've got
motorcycle handlebars here got the
throttle right here on the right for
reverse up here on the handlebars
this one's importantly that regen
braking so while you're driving he gives
some of that life back to the battery it
reminds me a lot of the BMW i8 in the
weekend that we spent with that a little
over a year ago because you can't really
bring this thing anywhere without people
stopping you for pictures or asking me
what it is or how they can own one or
where they could ride it this is made by
a company out of Eugene Oregon and this
is not the first time they've ever made
something like this but this is
definitely the latest and greatest from
the last version of this one they've
shaved the weight down from 1,700 pounds
to a thousand pounds they also dropped
the price pretty significantly now this
thing costs 11900 it's an electric
vehicle so we get a lot of torque off
the line as soon as you get on that
throttle but I've been told that this
prototype version only has 60% throttle
it's kind of hard to believe because it
really moves when you hit it and you
kind of get that that fun jolt back in
your seat that effect is doubled by the
fact that the motors are up here in the
front so you're being dragged along by
this thing the other really gnarly thing
about the front wheels and the whole
setup up here is the suspension which is
totally why it looks like something off
of an Indy car or an f1 car or something
and it makes the ride really really
smooth we're also really down low which
helps with that stability it looks like
a really crazy vehicle but it's really
safe at least it feels that way but I
should mention this was the second time
that we tried to take the ARCA moto out
during CES the first time we tried we
had some problems with the hydraulic
brake system the keep in mind these were
prototype vehicles and our Komodo is not
just some company that showed up at CES
that we've never heard of before we had
some faith in what they were able to do
and we wanted to take the S arcade back
out on the road so we got another chance
later in the week this thing does 0 to
60 in about 7 seconds
this prototype version is doing about
0-60 about 1002 40 who picked this fast
hit that is fun you could have you could
never leave the city and have a lot of
fun with this thing but getting on an
open stretch like that is highly
recommended the other really cool thing
about this vehicle is I rising a lot of
the Tesla Model X you've got this
windshield that goes all the way up and
over
you can look straight up at the sky but
now that we got a chance to move let's
look forward let's give this thing some
gas or some charge where the hill
