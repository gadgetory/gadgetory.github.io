here with our new executive editor
dieter bone hello in this totally not
contrived situation during which we
oldest us Samsung yeah they just had
their quarterly earnings like earnings
like everybody else in the planet and
the news wasn't super great yeah they're
down there down there their net profits
were down year-over-year and that's the
first time I think that's happened since
they had their big galaxy phone
explosion and their their other like
their operating profit the other profit
measure has been down for three
consecutive quarters
so basically Samsung was the only
company on the planet other than Apple
that was like completely rocking and
rolling on phone sales and kind of just
like Apple they've kind of hit the
plateau but Apple's phone sales are up
yeah but the people are a little bit
concerned about Apple but Samsung's is
more dire than Apple's it seems and but
the problems seem like they're not
necessarily United States right there
and like you're up there definitely in
China but smaller so the the China thing
is the the big problem so glad sab out
put up a really excellent piece where he
makes the case that the way that Samsung
one there's a few ways but one of the
ways they want is they had really good
parts and they could sell for cheaper
than anybody else and a good enough
phone and that game worked for them for
a long time but they're getting beat by
that at that same game by people in
China's job seemed a long way cheaper
phones
yes screens making cheaper phones larger
screens but they're good enough quality
and they've they're just they're a
better fit for that market right now so
this leads into what I think is like my
universal theory of Samsung which is
that they own display companies right so
they're not totally vertically
integrated but they're very closely
aligned with this huge display
manufacturing facility as ships to in
ships so if you look at the TV market
Samson totally took over TV market by
being the first to ship huge LCD TVs for
sheep and now they own that market if
you look at phones what's happening in
phones the screens are getting larger
and larger Samsung obviously the first
to ship gigantic OLED phones and nobody
knew that this was going to be a hit but
they were able to ship so many screen
sizes and then optimize against a huge
screen like the Galaxy Note 3 they'd be
being enormous Lee successfully for
anybody else could catch up I think that
leverage is kind of over for them I
think I don't know that phone's
necessarily going to bigger than
yes I wish I could say I agree with you
but I don't know cuz every time I've
been saying phones aren't gonna get any
bigger for two years now and I've always
been wrong right I just think we're
we're at a point now if you look at like
like you know apples Mac sales are gonna
back up get it and I've had sales are
shrinking I think you're gonna end up
with a really big phone and a laptop and
somebody has to try out what tablets are
gonna do and the only company it's been
really successful in tablets is Apple
yep
this is a gallon it's have s that's the
tab of this thing by the way this is the
grossest feeling substance yeah that's
all produced that was the other thing
that came out of the earnings call is it
sounds like they are finally getting the
message that we don't enjoy this plastic
this it's only taken several years yeah
and so apparently they're gonna have
another flagship phone released that's
not a note later this year that's gonna
have you know better materials and
that's got to be a reaction tab
I mean cuz apples gonna do a big phone
and if I mean I've been waiting for a
big iPhone for long I mean the main
attraction of this device to me it's not
the pen or Samsung's weird software but
its gigantic screen but every time I
look at one I'm jealous of it ya know
that's that's the thing that when you
like talk to actual regular consumers
especially in the US but I think in the
other markets - it's like why didn't you
get an iPhone oh I wanted the bigger
screen so once that goes away Samsung is
potentially in big big trouble so how do
they differentiate a solid they have to
do a better job of what like they need
to like do what HTC does and make a
nicer looking phone but that certainly
hasn't been enough for HTC so they also
have to fight and shine like I I
wouldn't want to be Samsung right now
but they've been so successful and
they've like risen above the stereotype
that it's you know really really crappy
software really really cheap design if
they can do that and just execute better
on the plans they already have in place
get-get Tizen phones on the low end make
high-end phones seem nicer and better
and make their software actually feel
compelling and not yeah right I mean
those are all hard problems but they're
actually they are attacking all three of
those things well particularly because
they're in constant conflict with Google
over what Android should be right so
they're the Samsung is the only company
that has ever managed to turn a profit
on Android really yeah and they're doing
that on tablets on phones and now on
watches
they're having that fun right so hard to
be Samson right now anyway that's us
