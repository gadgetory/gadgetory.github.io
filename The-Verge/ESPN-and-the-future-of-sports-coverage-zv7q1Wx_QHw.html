SportsCenter we are all sports all the
time and that's the way it's going to be
continuing Sunday's New York New Jersey
meeting up big time they were robbed out
of course please take that off the rest
they were here a long time it was a year
ago this week that we took the air with
the pledge very simply that we would
bring you the most comprehensive sports
news programming that you would find on
television
it's time for Mike and Mike on ESPN
Radio and espn2 as we approach
Thanksgiving things starting to come
into focus back and better than ever
Mike and Mike presented by Progressive
Insurance our guests if you watch sports
you watch ESPN in nearly four decades
since it first went on the air the
company in the small town of Bristol
Connecticut has become the first and
last word in games news and analysis but
now when news breaks on Twitter and
highlights show up on vine long before
your TV ESPN has to become much more
than a TV it has to be everywhere and it
has to be there now if you look at how
video had been processed over the last
50 years there was a single wire that
was used to transport something from
point A to point B now that it's really
the ones and zeroes and at the data set
we can use it we can address it it can
be sent along a network this building is
4k ready an 8k capable we're now in the
1080p range not everybody can get that
signal yet because the cable companies
can't broadcast that but we are
delivering that Sports Center has always
been the most important show at ESPN and
this year it got a huge upgrade a new
10,000 square foot studio in DC to the
newest and highest tech building on
ESPN's massive campus it's a huge
space-age collection of screens cameras
and cables designed to be live 18 hours
a day and to help SportsCenter move at
the speed of the internet that studio
allows us to do things I think with
virtuals technology with the catwalk
walking through you have six screens
that can go into three that can go into
one Kevin is the king of the catwalk I
just want you
there's no one that walks the gallic
like I embrace change in technology and
so I think I think that that studio
allows I think Hannah and I to kind of
welcome the country everyday to say hey
these are the toys that we have let's go
all through it together
we're gonna try this new thing and let's
experience it together I mean everything
we do is to try to create that mix of
efficiency infrastructure at work flow
right what does the content need to do
with it how can we help them and that's
been our goal you keep people tuned in
by giving a good story when they want to
find out something that's going on in
sports they usually tune the ESPN
because they know that we are going to
be going out finding all that
information out and being able to
present it to them in a way that they
can understand and that helps them
understand what what is going on whether
it be with NFL NBA whichever the sport
maybe that's what we do it's what we're
expected to do and that means that you
know whatever platform they're using
whatever time of day it is however
they're connecting with their friends we
need to be there because that's holding
up our end of the relationship that
relationship has changed
ESPN's mission has always been to be
everywhere sports fans are now that
means fantasy teams and Twitter and
being there when we want to watch the
game on our phones and it means being
ready for anything the advantage we have
at ESPN is that we're in order sports so
for the most part many things we have to
cover are on schedules we can get people
in the places where they can report that
stuff we can think about the cadence of
the day and how that should roll out in
the mobile space the social space and on
air the hard part and the most fun is
when Odell Beckham jr. does something
you've never seen before
and that's when it's like all right
where is everybody and what is this like
and how does this show up in the social
space if you are slow and want to make
it beautiful you can't live in the
Twitter space because some guy just held
his phone up to his TV and put it up on
Twitter and then here we come
eight minutes after the play happen with
the tada look at this beautiful opening
and we've got music and natural sound
and you're like I already saw it dude
guys
he receive Odell Beckham jr. taste I
think the core still stays the same it's
highlights its reaction its our analysis
talking I think now we can just kind of
add some some layers to the story that
we couldn't get before the challenge for
almost everybody else in the interest
how do I create it what do i do how do I
compete how do I cover this story about
the Red Sox getting these two guys for
us we don't even worry about that
we've got people we're gonna plug them
in place we've got experienced people
know to tell the story then the question
becomes okay now it's told what do we do
with that content cable TV at least the
way it exists now is dying services like
sling TV are unbundling the channels but
people are also just canceling their
expensive subscriptions and are finding
other ways to see what they want to see
these P n says it's okay with that but
it still has to figure out how to adapt
everybody's doing cord cutting people
are watching Netflix etc so what can we
do to still give the people the the
viewing audience the ability to see live
programming that's what separates ESPN
from all the other networks is all the
live programming you don't really want
to watch a game late because you already
know who one kind of takes the fun out
of the game so how can we do that better
the platform's keep changing you know
whether it's Apple TV or Roku or you're
trying to make it prepared for a
snapchat or Instagram in the last year
we have seen just a we did about 3
million video views a month on
over-the-top devices and Twitter and a
year later that numbers are combined
about 70 million digital is the perfect
example of like I have three kids and I
don't know what's going to come out of
their mouth next you know that's the
digital space it just rolls right if you
turn it upside down and you say change
is the normal you know not you know
change is disruptive but we know that
things are constantly going to change
then you can cope a little bit better we
don't know what's out there we don't
know what's going to take hold it's 3d
going to come back who knows what what
is going to be out there so the
infrastructure here the concept was how
do we make it so it's more flexible
adaptive and open to what's going to be
presented to us neck
that's the thing about the future you
can make plans and invest millions of
dollars in a brand-new facility to help
data flow more places more quickly but
you never know exactly what's coming so
ESPN is learning what every media
company in this century has to how to
build a network that isn't just on TV or
on the web but everywhere wherever
they're consuming our product we want to
be able to have what we can available to
them to serve sports fans anytime
anywhere under any platform there are
our future and we keep that going for
them
