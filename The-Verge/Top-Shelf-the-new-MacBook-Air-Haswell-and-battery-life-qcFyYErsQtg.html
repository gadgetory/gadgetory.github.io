Pierce and this week we're talking about
this brave new weird world we've somehow
found ourselves in it's about laptops so
the thing is laptops haven't really
changed for like two decades they've
been different and faster and thinner
and more powerful but they haven't
really looked any different but now in
2013 we're in this place where we might
have a world where we can do all sorts
of different cooler things with laptops
and it all comes from this little Intel
chip called has well let's talk
processors we asked a lot of the
processors in laptops whether we're
playing games running Photoshop or just
browsing the web and a dozen different
sites while listening to music and
chatting with their friends we want to
do everything we want to do it all at
once and we don't want to do it we're
looking for power that's why a lot of
people have turned to tablets and
smartphones lately the armed ships and
those devices last forever they let us
do a lot of things but Intel's catching
up with a new breed of processors and
latest laptops that offer all day
battery life with the same kind of
performance you can expect from last
generation and a fruity finish I think
you'll find a LED phone the new version
of Intel's chips the core i5s and I
sevens we'll probably find inside your
laptop are called as well the name
doesn't mean anything but the
implications are huge Intel's promising
major performance increases better
graphics performance or gaming and
watching movies and most of all better
battery life much much better battery
life there's a lot of complex
engineering behind it but the short
version is that the power system the
chip is now better integrated which lets
Haswell chips ramp up and cool down much
more quickly there are many different
Haswell chips each with a different
flavor profile and character that
enhances different activities in
different ways there's the ultra-low
power y series chip and then there's a
high-end graphics chips the Irish card
so to let you play games on an ultrabook
that's never even been close to possible
but here's what that all means
manufacturers can now build thinner
laptops and tablets than ever before
because they don't need to put in as
much battery to get four hours of
battery life they can also build much
more powerful machines than ever before
because the graphics performance is so
much better or they can do what we're
already seeing a lot of drop the new
chips into existing models and just
watch battery life shoot for the roof
which brings us for the new 13-inch
MacBook Air last year's model was
already the best all-around laptop on
the market thanks to good hardware a
great keyboard and trackpad in solid
performance this year's model changes
almost nothing at least on the outside
there's serio mics on the side instead
of just a single bottom like that's
literally it on the inside though this
has well we tested a one point three
gigahertz core i5 model which came with
a very slight performance decrease over
last year's 1.8 giga hertz model but i
didn't really notice the difference the
story here is the battery life the new
air lasted 13 hours and 29 minutes in
our test more than double last year's
model and well above what intel says has
well should offer 13 hours and 29
minutes is enough battery life to
completely change things this is the
first laptop we've ever seen that can
legitimately claim the last you all day
the new air is cheaper than last year's
models starting at just 1099 and it's
still the best all-around laptop on the
market but it's also the first to the
dramatically new breed of computer and
it means that Intel can finally offer
the ability for us to do anything we
want on our laptops and do it all day
long sometimes the best does get better
with age
so Apple made the macbook air probably
the best laptop on the market better
without actually changing much of
anything they just dropped Haswell in
and you know watch the money pile up but
on the windows side manufacturers are
trying a lot of different weird things
trying to figure out if there are other
ways we might want to use a PC Lenovo's
probably doing the best job they have
the ideapad yoga which has the weird
flipping hinge and then there's this
this is the thinkpad helix and we first
saw it at CES and this is probably the
computer people have been waiting for
the longest it's a tablet it's a laptop
and there's kind of a lot of people
excited about it so I took it for a spin
this week to see if this might be a real
competitor to the laptop we've known and
loved for so long we've been waiting for
the Lenovo ThinkPad helix for a long
time after its debut at CES where the
detachable laptop tablet hybrid was
easily one of the best things we saw all
week we waited for the device six months
later it's finally here but it's not
quite what we've been waiting for
basically the helix is tablet but it's a
tablet with a dedicated keyboard dock
which has a big battery and a fan in it
the battery makes it last much longer
and the fan means the helix can
overclock its processor and run even
faster when it's docked the helix is
many things but it is not well designed
it's full of asymmetry and awkward
angles it's really the furthest thing
from a gorgeous unibody device like the
sony vaio pro or the macbook air the
hinge is ugly and exposed as if it's
missing its housing there are screws and
buttons and rubber feet and stickers
everywhere none of which lends the
impression that this is at all a
well-made sleek attractive laptop
there's an awkward odd flap on the back
that sort of covers all of that but it
looks weird and out of place by itself
it's big too the tablet itself weighs
1.8 pounds and the dock adds two more
it's eight tenths of an inch thick too
and even though the matte black carbon
fiber body feels rigid the seams aren't
connected well enough on the plus side
the helix does get the benefit of
lenovo's expertise with keyboards and
track pads the curved concave Keys feel
great and the trackpad is smooth and
responsive even if it does have a few of
the same quirks as most Windows laptops
there's even a track point nub if you're
so inclined though the buttons for track
point users have now been integrated
into the trackpad the display on the
helix is good and bad the 11.6 inch
screen is 1080p which is great but
having that many pixels on such a small
display can actually make it really hard
to see and click some text or icons or
web pages it's hard with a mouse and
even harder with
your finger there's an integrated
digital pen which helps a lot and I
found myself using it a lot more than I
thought not for drawing really but just
for getting around the operating system
and doing some of this small on-screen
things that are hard to do with such
small targets but it's not enough and
Microsoft really needs to improve how
Windows handles high res screens movies
look great in 1080p as do games so you
really can't play many games thanks to
the integrated intel graphics here
actually the biggest problem with the
graphics here is that they're already
outdated the helix runs a mostly clean
version of windows 8 on an ivy bridge
processor last year's model which really
doesn't make sense when Intel's new
Haswell chips are already out
performance on the helix is really good
especially when it's connected to the
dock and able to use that fan but has
well promises better performance better
graphics and especially a better battery
and the thing is better battery life
might be killer here because it's
already pretty great we got more than
eight hours of battery life with the two
parts connected and more than five hours
for the tablet alone for something this
powerful with this many features that's
pretty great here's the thing though
it's not performance that's the problem
with the helix its design lenovo did
indeed make a powerful Windows 8 tablet
which not a lot of companies have done
and it coupled it with a good keyboard
and a good track pad but in doing all
that Lenovo seems to have forgotten
design entirely I'd much rather have
something like the yoga which is heavier
but much better-looking and more
cohesive or even the thinkpad x1 carbon
which is just a thin beautiful powerful
laptop design isn't everything but
you're sixteen hundred and seventy nine
dollars should buy a lot more care and
attention to detail and even if you
think this is the right form factor for
Windows 8 I don't personally but even if
you do this isn't the right way to do it
so joining me now to talk about all this
is like all of the laptops in the world
and Nilay Patel are managing editor
laptop this is these are laptops so this
is like the beauty the best part of this
was like it took me no time to just like
walk in and be like what are the crazy
laptop so I can find they just they're
all they're all right here for the
industry is crazy that tops so I want
sort of the macbook air okay so what do
you wish Apple had changed things about
macbook air because they did right they
like it's the stereo mics are cool but
otherwise they didn't change anything
like yeah should they have all right
let's green or I think mostly about this
what 1099 I think for most people this
is like a lot of you should buy and I
think what's interesting if you look at
this array of machines Apple is like the
only one trying to solve the problem of
how do we
the better actual laptop everyone else
seems focused on other problems there's
nobody else so every time I meet with
the Nova they call it the pc plus era
right so i like to call it the the
post-pc era and the Nova's like no we're
just gonna build a piece of it are you
so crazy this is the helix yeah i just
want if you are spending your time if
you're the product manager right it's
that Lenovo you know we're gonna build a
new thinkpad and our engineers are
spending time building this door like
can you see this look at this way this
door what's happening just I mean it
looks there's a there's a very appealing
Batmobile aspect to this we're like when
Batman opens the door to his car like
many flaps move that's cool but like I
don't but you're not that man I mean
like this door hides two additional fans
and like I get like the processor is
overclocked and when you put it in the
dot like to get it sure I understand why
all these decisions are made but I don't
understand how they arrived it we're
gonna solve this problem because I think
the problem most people have is my
laptop doesn't the battery doesn't last
long enough the trackpad is no good I
mean you should spend all of your time
focusing your engineering area if your
windows laptop manufacturer yeah you
should spend all your time right there
yeah making that good not here well
taking this crazy with this sort of
lenovo runs into the same problem and
this is like a big Microsoft problem
it's been like nobody's made a good
track pad and I'm inclined to not
believe what that's all their fault like
Windows needs to get it together and
it's the same with like these high res
screens where everything looks really
tiny on such a high res sports screaming
that's a whole different game really
right I mean I there's there's obviously
like the interplay of like software and
hardware and you can see the specs in
the window side or like kind of out
racing the software a little bit and
Mike look Microsoft will get there I
think they know they need shipwrecked
screens but it's just like that you I
look at this array of products and it's
like all of these companies have done
they're doing crazy things that are like
structural about their laptops or like
how are we going to innovate on form
factor and it's weird because I really
like that acer over there yeah which is
the reason I like it is because they
spent a lot of final spin making a good
laptop like it's awesome I think yeah
it's really enough last I love on our
team like wrote like
woman like how much he loves it typing a
context right like it's a great little
laptop and it's then it like they didn't
try to do anything except build a laptop
with the form factor is true to itself
I'd like this dell the most interesting
thing about this dell is this you're
never going to use this computer life
threats right but that's what makes it
like interesting and like novel and you
look at the ads and always spinning
around the end just like this let me
just show you what i do with this thing
every time I every time I get it I get
it I don't I don't even turn this thing
on I just stand here and I'm just like
oh right oh you just just see how hard
you can hit it and it'll go back and
forth great but like is that the problem
that people are trying to stall so I
don't know thing is like this is the
question to me it's like we all of these
most of these anyway a couple of these
are like regular laptops but every other
one is trying to solve this like I want
a laptop and a tablet right problem
right and like I don't know that's a
problem I don't know anyone who owns a
laptop and like an iPad and is really
pissed that they're not the same fri
thing is this are they screwing up
trying things like is a pre Haswell era
they couldn't build tablets with windows
right like that was hard they did the
surface pro i think is an excellent
example what happens we try to put full
windows and a tablet and Windows RT is
apparently just been a non-starter right
most these companies are you in building
and it's mostly a battery life thing
right like that religion Oh battle rifle
fitness in the rep so they android
tablets I think for most of these
companies have also been a non-starter
RT tablets have been a non-starter so
they're like we need an operating system
to build tablet products here's full on
Windows to do that we need a fan and
running an Intel processor and so we're
going to build a laptop and we'll try to
shoehorn it into a tablet as well just
to get some product on the market and I
think that has led a lot of these
companies to make what are fundamentally
mistakes rightly all of this like this I
mean I so this is like fine but like
when your lap like what am i doing I
mean like they're 14 it's like here's a
tablet and we're just going to like add
pieces to it until right and I get it
like this is like if you are a
manufacturer and you're looking at the
ipad and you're like this is what people
do with their ipads and it's like you
know what people hate doing our ipads
this like this is not a look at it what
do you what is this right right yeah
and I think they'll I think the Haswell
processors like now that they're out and
they can make reasonable computers with
like all then right cool all day battery
life so the thing is I feel like this
this kind of thing can work like it's it
feels like a laptop like I don't
personally when I was using it I like
never used it like a tablet I just used
it like a laptop but it works is left
out as a good keyboard a good track pad
it's sturdy it's humongous but like this
could work I I don't know if anybody
wants it necessarily and this is 1700
hours and that's ridiculous but like I
feel like this could work I guess right
like it is I think the biggest problems
just do for us is that the macbook the
base model macbook air is 1099 right and
the ipad is five hundred dollars and you
can buy both of those products and they
work together a little bit more right
like more or less but you're in at least
a content ecosystem regularity they
understand each other they're aware of
each other and that that's like a that's
expensive it's two things but they each
served or use case really really well
and I think the these products like
you're saying you never use this as a
tablet and when you do pull it out like
this is a big heavy tablet and it's
sixteen by nine which continues to be
the wrong aspect ratio for tablet but
it's right for a lap like this is like
the thing that was a fundamental cool
you know what school those you can see
like four hundred thousand words of
texts all at once we realize I just
started somebody has to know that like
somebody had to have picked this up at
some point in life and like this isn't
great this isn't right but well but that
door is like Porthos I don't worries and
it's like they don't worry about that
Steve just keep working yeah I I just
feel like they everyone at any laptop
companies st every single day i'm steve
i just feel like just in general you
desert this is solving problems that
don't exist look right but they have to
they have to try right so that's the
question is like where where do we go so
like haswell's cool because it takes
what we already have and makes it into
like what we've always wanted to be
right like this all day battery life
thing intel has been quoting for like
three days or four three years whether
it's like actually real now like our
laptops like 12 hours is all day I don't
need more than 12 hours is interesting I
did the peas and has wealthy area in
that there's the time-lapse the
okay actually lasted longer than the
battery and the camera that was taking
the time was ridiculous so the air
because it was just letting one page i'm
doing like anything strenuous it
actually lasted for 17 hours that's
great in the camera went like died well
I mean that's I think so it's like
that's you know if battery life at 12
hours battery life it's like na mele
concern anymore look if you're using
your laptop for more than 12 hours at a
time like thing down rethink things so
stop writing on a hinge right exactly
take a break come on Steve just close it
go see your family yeah but so like is
there do we just have to sort of if I'm
lenovo right do I just give up and like
keep making the same thing I've been 50
years look I think Microsoft is there
they've picked a direction Windows 8 I
get there for better or worse they're
leading the charge and touchscreen
laptops like build touchscreen laptops
like a that's cool but don't don't try
to figure out what to do with this like
don't have this problem like this is
fundamentally problem with all these
like at some point you end up dealing
with this micro right just down the line
all of these detachable keyboard and
it's like what are you gonna do with
this or just leave it like you have to
look at this like just you made this
object and this object might enhance
like this computer but fundamentally
it's like this is gonna end up in a yard
sale some someday like 14 year old me is
gonna come staggering along like what is
this know what's gonna happen is your
it's gonna break like I can putting this
thing in my backpack in this like weird
little flap will just catch on side yeah
I don't I don't need to just hate on
this one like I'm I'm just saying like I
think each of these I think what we've
discovered after all this exciting with
form factor innovation innovation yeah
is that these form factors need to be
true to themselves okay I'm the thing
that these manufacturers can do is
directly compete with the macbook air
right like they this is I think we've
agree that in terms of general-purpose
laptop for like regular people that's
pretty much the best you can get right
now sir and they need to go up to that
idea itch is the last all day has a
reasonable amount of price and
performance a reasonable mix of price
and performance the track that is good
the screen is decent I mean it's not
some of these the vaio right there has a
higher resolution screen like you need
to go after this you don't need to go
after a market that is kind of nice and
doesn't exist does that market is mean
you
eating live or the ipad there yeah what
I mean it seems like we've sort of that
like that market has been seated to
Apple like you've gotta win at tablets
and that's okay and nobody wants to
spend 1700 hours on a thing that they
think is a tablet or even a thousand
dollars like right if something is
primarily a tablet I feel like you can't
charge what people are charging for this
but I think the one exception is the
yoga and this like I've talked about
this way too much and I keep coming back
to it but it's like I really feel like
they kind of nailed this cuz it's like
yeah you could just use it like a
regular laptop and you'd never know and
like the trackpad is as good as it can
be on Windows and there's a touchscreen
and you know it's thin and pretty light
I have the 11 inch one upstairs and it's
like my favorite 11-inch creature I've
ever used but then it also if you like
really want to do crazy stuff you can do
this and it you know is a half-decent
tablet at little weird as this but like
when I was reviewing the thing I wound
up like putting it down sort of like
this just watching movies a lot I I
think this is this is this is where you
get right and yeah it's almost like a
it's almost like a tell but here's how
you know what if one of these products
is going to be successful these hybrid
products like can you see mechanical
stuff right like yes you can with here's
a surface like yes you can like there's
mechanical stuff involved like there's
the vaio duo which is like just add this
thing a festival for the eyes in terms
of like hinges and really pretty good
and it does this really i got like ours
just trying to see but a second you see
this I'm telling you yes I can you see
this on a computer and like look at the
other side that you can see the ribbon
cable like the second you're aware of
the ribbon cable like your product is a
fail and I'm sorry I love Sony I think
they're it's cool they died but this is
never going to work the reason this is
successful is because all of the
mechanical stuff that makes this what it
is is totally integrated right so like
that's that's it it's like okay this
makes sense like I understand a laptop I
understand how to open it i'm just going
to keep opening it right until it closes
a kid and now it's now is doing this
thing and i think this is intuitive and
make sense to consumers where all of
this is just complexity that nobody's
asking but isn't that the problem like
aren't we in this place where we need to
be you know moving forward and like you
know not to keep using apple as like the
last unum everything great but like I
became out the iphones but nice
I phone is like my example of that where
they came out with this thing and
they're like this is different we
promise it's better we think you're
really gonna like it and like maybe
there's there's something to that like
we've been in the same place where like
you know if I held this up next to you
know lenovo laptop from 20 years ago you
know they were both lenovo laptops and
like that's good on one hand but really
bad on another just like a lot of
health's has changed in 20 years like
why hasn't this and I mean that hasn't
changed did we just three years sure but
like I guess maybe did we just nail this
three years ago I guess touchscreen is a
big one things look at higher res and
then I guess just like thinner and will
eventually just carry it around and
it'll be this big and not only cool what
you know the thing of laptops and this
is just my theory is that I think
laptops they're essentially like the
perfect expression of the ti 99 and I
was like eight and that's what computers
are thinking like that's how they become
but those computers appeal to a really
narrow subset of people like my parents
don't want to use a lot they've never
asked me for laptop they've an iMac and
iPad yep stop using the dead back they
only use the I've had my niece nephew
have no interest in laptops like they
just want to use the iPad I think this
is like there's like this narrow window
of people who grew up with computers
that look like this and they this is the
ultimate exploit we've hit like this is
what the computers look like that are
going to look like there are really good
options now the second you try to
deviate from that like build hinges and
ribbon cables like you start building
something else that like isn't that
right and you're going to try to
shoehorn like we find we get it like
these have evolved to their final
condition right the next step is all
these touch devices and those touch
devices need to be true to themselves so
I think yes these will inherit qualities
of those devices made I don't know that
any of this form factor innovation has
led us anywhere meaningful and like the
surface pro i think is it's about as
good an example of like let's build a
tablet that's a keyboard and already
leeward laptop and it has a singe in a
kickstand and so if you look at it like
why didn't you just go for that right
but maybe that's what we're going right
is that like it you know people will
have like a desktop and a tablet in a
tablet becomes the portable thing and
maybe this is like we're slowly taking
like awkward baby steps toward that even
where eventually though desktop
computers are coming back i mean i think
if tablets become what everybody thinks
they're gonna become which is like the
future of how we compute on the move
yeah then yeah I think desktops are
coming back I think in like they'll be
thinner and cheaper and it'll basically
be like your TV and your computer
sitting on your desk all at once and
that'll be really you like get real work
done because nobody's ever gonna you
know with the on-screen keyboard of the
ipad no matter how good it gets you're
never gonna want to like really like sit
down a new business on your iPad okay so
you get to hear right you know like poor
shoes let's I mean maybe these are just
like the ugly baby steps toward really
ugly ugly day I really do perfection but
I just think like the the whole this in
trees like they're these are attempts to
compete with the ipad and not attempts
to compete with the macbook air right
and in doing so but they cost more than
it costs more than a crow Gator and in
do in in failing to recognize where they
need to compete they all miss the mark
wildly in indifferent all different ways
except for except for that one except
for the s7 over which literally is like
we should compete with macbook air and
they made a really good confuse they did
except that it's like and it has it has
surround sound on the bottom did you
guys earlier yes yes like function and
it says professionally tuned on the
inside just kiss you didn't know how
I'll get it well i agree i think this is
like toshiba says amateur tune yeah like
yeah I mean it's yakka sony Sony was
like we're gonna compete with an
applicator and like Brett Sony to they
made if you are engineering a hinge for
your display that has to support the
full weight of the keyboard off the
ground like just stop just think about
what you're doing like how will this
keyboard be more rigid if it's sitting
on the table or if it's 13 inch off the
ground like what you should understand
it'll bend in the middle and like just
stuff like that it's like what do people
want they want they want to spend over a
thousand dollars on these on the people
who spend over a thousand yeah that's
where they want they just want them to
feel sturdy yeah and if your thing is
bending in the middle it doesn't matter
if it's made of carbon fiber
hypothetically speaking yeah yeah thank
you see I think flex is away when you
type on it it doesn't matter if that
means over the long run it will be
more durable like this which is the
argument that I've been hearing from all
the windows people like it's more
durable because it's flexible which
