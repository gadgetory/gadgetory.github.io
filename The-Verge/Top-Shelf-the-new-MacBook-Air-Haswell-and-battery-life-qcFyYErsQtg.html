Pierce and this week we're talking about
this brave new weird world we've somehow
found ourselves in
it's about laptops so the thing is
laptops haven't really changed for like
two decades they've been different and
faster and thinner and more powerful but
they haven't really looked any different
but now in 2013 we're in this place
where we might have a world where we can
do all sorts of different cooler things
with laptops and it all comes from this
little Intel chip called has well let's
talk processors we ask a lot of the
processors in our laptops whether we're
playing games running Photoshop or just
browsing the web and a dozen different
sites while listening to music and
chatting with their friends we want to
do everything we want to do it all at
once and we don't want to do it while
looking for power that's why a lot of
people have turned to tablets and
smartphones lately the ARM chips and
those devices last forever they let us
do a lot of things but Intel's catching
up with a new breed of processors and
latest laptops that offer all-day
battery life with the same kind of
performance you can expect from the last
generation and a fruity finish that I
think you'll find a LED phone the new
version of Intel's chips the core i5s
and i7s will probably find inside your
laptop are called as well the name
doesn't mean anything but the
implications are huge Intel's promising
major performance increases better
graphics performance for gaming and
watching movies and most of all better
battery life much much better battery
life there's a lot of complex
engineering behind it but the short
version is that the power system the
chip is now better integrated which lets
Haswell chips ramp up and cool down much
more quickly there are many different
Haswell chips each with a different
flavor profile and character that
enhances different activities in
different ways
there's the ultra-low power Y Series
chip and then I use a high-end graphics
chips the Irish card so to let you play
games on an ultrabook that's never even
been close to possible
but here's what that all means
manufacturers can now build thinner
laptops and tablets than ever before
because they don't need to put in as
much battery to get four hours of
battery life they can also build much
more powerful machines than ever before
because the graphics performance is so
much better or they can do what we're
already seeing a lot of drop the new
chips into existing models and just
watch battery life shoot through the
roof which brings us for the new 13-inch
MacBook Air last year's model was
already the best all-around laptop on
the market thanks to good hardware a
great keyboard and trackpad in solid
performance this year's model changes
almost nothing at least on the outside
there's stereo mics on the side instead
of just a single bottom like that's
literally it on the inside though this
has well we tested a 1.3 gigahertz core
i5 model which came with a very slight
performance decrease over last year's
1.8 gigahertz model but I didn't really
notice the difference the story here is
the battery life the new air lasted 13
hours and 29 minutes in our tests more
than double last year's model and well
above what intel says has well should
offer 13 hours and 29 minutes is enough
battery life to completely change things
this is the first laptop we've ever seen
that can legitimately claim the last two
all day
the new air is cheaper than last year's
models starting at just 1099 and it's
still the best all-around laptop on the
market but it's also the first of a
dramatically new breed of computer and
it means that Intel can finally offer
the ability for us to do anything we
want on our laptops and do it all day
long sometimes the best does get better
with age
so Apple made the MacBook Air probably
the best laptop on the market better
without actually changing much of
anything they just dropped Haswell in
and you know watch the money pile up but
on the windows side manufacturers are
trying a lot of different weird things
trying to figure out if there are other
ways we might want to use a PC Lenovo's
probably doing the best job they have
the IdeaPad yoga which has the weird
flipping hinge and then there's this
this is the ThinkPad helix and we first
saw it at CES and this is probably the
computer people have been waiting for
the longest it's a tablet it's a laptop
and there's kind of a lot of people
excited about it so I took it for a spin
this week to see if this might be a real
competitor to the laptop we've known and
loved for so long we've been waiting for
the Lenovo ThinkPad Hilux for a long
time after its debut at CES where the
detachable laptop tablet Hybrid was
easily one of the best things we saw all
week we waited for the device 6 months
later it's finally here but it's not
quite what we've been waiting for
basically the Hilux is a tablet but it's
a tablet with a dedicated keyboard dock
which has a big battery and a fan in it
the battery makes it last much longer
and the fan means the helix can
overclock its processor and run even
faster when it's docked the helix is
many things but it is not well designed
it's full of asymmetry and awkward
angles it's really the furthest thing
from a gorgeous unibody device like the
sony vaio pro or the MacBook Air the
hinge is ugly and exposed as if it's
missing its housing there are screws and
buttons and rubber feet and stickers
everywhere none of which lends the
impression that this is at all a
well-made sleek attractive laptop
there's an awkward odd flap on the back
that sort of covers all of that but it
looks weird and out of place by itself
it's big too the tablet itself weighs
1.8 pounds and the dock adds two more
it's eight tenths of an inch thick - and
even though the matte black carbon-fiber
body feels rigid the seams aren't
connected well enough on the plus side
the helix does get the benefit of
Lenovo's expertise with keyboards and
track pads the curved concave keys feel
great and the trackpad is smooth and
responsive even if it does have a few of
the same quirks as most Windows laptops
there's even a TrackPoint nub if you're
so inclined though the buttons for track
point users have now been integrated
into the trackpad the display on the
helix is good and bad
the 11.6 inch screen is 1080p which is
great but having that many pixels on
such a small display can actually make
it really hard to see and click some
text or icons or webpages it's hard with
the mouse and even harder with your
finger there's an integrated digital pen
which helps a lot and I found myself
using it a lot more than I thought not
for drawing really but just for getting
around the operating system and doing
some of this small on-screen things that
are hard to do with such small targets
but it's not enough and Microsoft really
needs to improve how Windows handles
high-res screens movies look great in
1080p as do games so you really can't
play many games thanks to the integrated
Intel graphics here actually the biggest
problem with the graphics here is that
they're already outdated the Hilux runs
a mostly clean version of Windows 8 on
an Ivy Bridge processor last year's
model which really doesn't make sense
when Intel's new hazard chips are
already out performance on the Hilux is
really good especially when it's
connected to the dock and able to use
that fan but has well promises better
performance better graphics and
especially a better battery and the
thing is better battery life might be
killer here because it's already pretty
great we got more than eight hours of
battery life with the two parts
connected and more than five hours for
the tablet alone for something this
powerful with this many features that's
pretty great here's the thing though
it's not performance that's the problem
with the Hilux its design lenovo did
indeed make a powerful Windows 8 tablet
which not a lot of companies have done
and it coupled it with a good keyboard
and a good trackpad but in doing all
that Lenovo seems to have forgotten
design entirely
I'd much rather have something like the
yoga which is heavier but much
better-looking and more cohesive or even
the ThinkPad x1 carbon which is just a
thin beautiful powerful laptop design
isn't everything but your 1600 and $79
should buy a lot more care and attention
to detail and even if you think this is
the right form factor for Windows 8 I
don't personally but even if you do this
isn't the right way to do it so joining
me now to talk about all this is like
all of the laptops in the world
and Nilay Patel our managing editor this
is these are laptops so this is the
beauty the best part of this was like it
took me no time to just like walk in and
be like what are the crazy laptops I can
find they just they're all they're all
right here the industry is crazy so I
want started the MacBook Air okay so
what do you wish Apple had changed
things about the MacBook Air because
they did right they like it's the stereo
mics are cool but otherwise they didn't
change anything like yeah should they
have alright it's green or I think this
what 1099 I think for most people this
is like a lot of top you should buy and
I think what's interesting if you look
at this array of machines Apple is like
the only one trying to solve the problem
of how do we
build a better actual laptop everyone
else seems focused on other problems
there's nobody else so every time I meet
with the Nova they call it the PC plus
era right so I don't like to call it the
post PC era and the Nova's like no we're
just gonna build a piece this is the
helix yeah I just want to if you are
spending your time if you're the product
manager right it's that Lenovo we're
gonna build a new think pad and our
engineers are spending time building
this door like can you see this look at
this this door what's happening here
just I mean it looks there's a there's a
very appealing Batmobile aspect to this
we're like when Batman opens the door to
his car like many flaps move that's cool
but like I don't but you're not Batman I
mean like this door hides two additional
fans and like I get it look like the
processor is overclocked and when you
put it in the dock like I get it sure I
understand why all these decisions are
made but I don't understand how they
arrived it we're gonna solve this
problem because I think the problem most
people have is my laptop doesn't the
battery doesn't last long enough the
trackpad is no good I mean you should
spend all of your time focusing your
engineering area if your Windows laptop
manufacturer yeah you should spend all
your time right there yeah making that
good yeah not here well taking this
crazy with this sort of lenovo runs into
the same problem and this is like a big
Microsoft problem it's been like
nobody's made a good trackpad and I'm
inclined to not believe that's all their
fault like Windows needs to get it
together and it's the same with like
these high-risk screens where everything
looks really tiny on such a high res
screen that's I think all different game
really right I mean I there's there's
obviously like the interplay of like
software and hardware and you can see
that the specs and the windows side are
like kind of out racing the software a
little bit it might look Microsoft will
get there I think they know then you
just repress screens but it's just like
that you I look at this array of
products and it's like all of these
companies have done they're doing crazy
things that are like structural about
their laptops or like how are we gonna
innovate on form factor and it's weird
because I really like that Acer over
there which is the reason I like it is
because they spent a lot of finals and
making a good laptop like it's awesome I
think yeah it's really enough last I
love on our team like wrote like
like how much she loves it like it's a
great little laptop and it's then like
they didn't try to do anything to build
a laptop with the form factor is true
itself
I'd like this Dell the most interesting
thing about this Dell is this I'm never
gonna use this computer like rest right
but that's what makes it like
interesting and like novel and you look
at the ads and it's always spinning
around yeah just like this let me just
show you what I do with this thing every
time I every time I get it I get it I
don't know I don't even turn this thing
on I just stand here and I'm just like
oh right I just just see how hard you
can hit it and it'll go back is that the
problem that people are trying to solve
so I don't know I think it's like this
is the question to me it's like we all
of these most of these anyway a couple
of these are like regular laptops but
every other one is trying to solve this
like I want a laptop and a tablet right
problem right and like I don't know that
that's a problem I don't know anyone who
owns a laptop and like an iPad and is
really pissed that they're not the same
what I think is this are they screwing
up things like is a pre Haswell era they
couldn't build tablets with Windows
right like that was hard
they did the surface pro I think is an
excellent example of what happens we try
to put full windows and a tablet and
Windows RT is apparently just been a
non-starter
right most these companies aren't even
building and it's mostly a battery life
thinnest in the real web so they Android
tablets I think for most of these
companies have also been a non-starter
RT tablets have been a non-starter so
they're like we need an operating system
to build tablet products here's full on
Windows to do that we need a fan and
running an Intel processor and so we're
gonna build a laptop and we'll try to
shoehorn it into a tablet as well just
to get some product on in the market and
I think that has led a lot of these
companies to make what are fundamentally
mistakes rightly all of this like this
yeah so this is like fine but like when
you're a lot like what am i doing I mean
like they're 14 it's like here's a
tablet and we're just gonna like add
pieces to it until I write and I get it
like this is like if you are a
manufacturer and you're looking at the
iPad and you're like this is what people
do with their iPads and it's like you
know what people hate doing with our
iPads this like this is not a like I
what do you what is this right right
yeah
and I think though I think that has well
processors like now that are out and
they can make reasonable computers with
like all then right cool
all they battery life so the thing is I
feel like this this kind of thing can
work like it's it feels like a laptop
like I don't personally when I was using
it I like never used it like a tablet I
just used it like a laptop but it works
is left out it's a good keyboard a good
trackpad it's sturdy it's humongous but
like this could work I I don't know if
anybody wants it necessarily and this is
$1,700 and that's ridiculous but like I
feel like this could work I guess right
like it is I think the biggest problems
just do for us is that the MacBook the
base model MacBook Air is 1099 right and
the iPad is $500 and you can buy both of
those products and they work together a
little bit more right like more or less
but you're in at least a content
ecosystem regularity they understand
each other they're aware of each other's
and that that's like a that's expensive
it's two things but they each serve
their use case really really well and I
think the these products like you're
saying you never use this as a tablet
and when you do pull it out like this is
a big heavy tablet and it's sixteen by
nine which continues to be the wrong
aspect ratio for a tablet but it's right
for a lap like this is like the thing
there is a fundamental cool
you know what's cool those you can see
like four hundred thousand words of text
all at once we decided somebody has to
know that like somebody had to have
picked this up at some point no I feel
like this isn't great this isn't right
but well but then or is like don't worry
don't worry about that Steve just keep
working again yeah I just feel like they
everyone at any laptop company I just
feel like just in general you these are
this is solving problems that don't
exist okay right but they have to they
have to try right so that's the question
is like where where do we go so like
haswell's cool because it takes what we
already have and makes it into like what
we've always wanted it to be right like
this all-day battery life thing Intel's
been quoting for like three days or for
three years it's like actually real now
like our laptops like twelve hours is
all day I don't need more than twelve
hours I did the the P Sun has wealthy
air yeah in that there's the time-lapse
the
okay actually lasted longer than the
battery and the camera that was taking
the time was ridiculous so they're
because they're just letting one page
I'm doing like anything strenuous they
actually lasted for 17 hours that's
great from the camera went like dive it
well I mean that's the thing so it's
like that's you know if battery life at
12 hours battery life it's like not a
concern anymore look if you're using
your laptop for more than 12 hours at a
time like thing down rethink things so
stop right on that hinge right exactly
come on Steve just close it let's go see
your family
yeah but so like is there do we just
have to sort of if I'm Lenovo right do I
just give up and like keep making the
same thing I have yours look I think
Microsoft is there they've picked a
direction Windows 8 I get there for
better or worse they're leading the
charge and touchscreen laptops like
build touchscreen laptops okay that's
cool but don't don't try to figure out
what to do with this like don't have
this problem like this is fundamentally
a problem with all of these like at some
point you end up dealing with this micro
right just down the line all of these
detachable keyboard and it's like what
are you gonna do with this or I just
believe it like you have to look at this
like just you made this object and this
object might enhance like this computer
but fundamentally it's like this is
gonna end up in a yard sale some someday
like 14-year old me is gonna come
staggering along like what is this know
what's gonna happen is your it's gonna
break like I kept putting this thing in
my backpack in this like weird little
flap will just catch on side yeah I
don't I don't need to just hate on this
one like I'm I'm just saying like I
think each of these I think what we've
discovered after all this exciting with
form factor innovation innovation yeah
is that these form factors need to be
true to themselves okay and the thing
that these manufacturers can do is
directly compete with the MacBook Air
right like they this is I think we've
agreed that in terms of general-purpose
laptop for like regular people
like that's pretty much the best you can
get right now sir and they need to go
after who that idea which is the lasts
all day has a reasonable amount of price
and performance a reasonable mix of
price and performance the track that is
good the screen is decent I mean it's
not some of these the VAIO right there
has a higher resolution screen like you
need to go after this you don't need to
go after a market that is kind of nice
and doesn't exist does that marketers
mean you
or the iPad there yeah I mean it seems
like we've sort of that like that market
has been ceded to Apple like you're
gonna win at tablets and that's okay and
nobody wants to spend $1700 on a thing
that they think is a tablet or even a
thousand dollars like right if something
is primarily a tablet I feel like you
can't charge what people are charging
for this but I think the one exception
is the yoga and this like I've talked
about this way too much and I keep
coming back to it but it's like I'd
really feel like they kind of nailed
this cuz it's like yeah you could just
use it like a regular laptop and you'd
never know and like the trackpad is as
good as it can be on Windows and there's
a touchscreen and you know it's thin and
pretty light I have the 11 inch one
upstairs and it's like my favorite 11
inch Peter I've ever used but then it
also if you like really want to do crazy
stuff you can do this and it you know is
a half-decent tablet it's a little weird
so that's this but like when I was
reviewing the thing I wound up like
putting it down sort of like just
watching movies a lot I I think this is
this is this is where you get right and
yeah it's almost like a it's almost like
a tell but here's how you know one if
one of these products is going to be
successful these hybrid products like
can you see mechanical stuff right like
yes you can with here's a surface like
yes you can like there's mechanical
stuff involved like there's the the VAIO
duo
which is like just add this thing a
festival for the eyes in terms of like
hinges are really pretty good and it
doesn't like hours just trying to see
but a second you see this I'm telling
you yes that can you see this on a
computer and like look at the other side
that you can see the ribbon cable like
the second you're aware of the ribbon
cable like your product is a family am i
I'm sorry I love Sony I think they're
it's cool that they died but this is
never going to work
the reason this is successful is because
all of the mechanical stuff that makes
this what it is is totally integrated
right it's so like that's that's it it's
like okay this makes sense like I
understand a laptop I understand how to
open it I'm just gonna keep opening it
until it closes again and now it's now
is doing this thing and I think this is
intuitive and make sense to consumers
what all of this is just complexity that
nobody's asking but isn't that the
problem like aren't we in this place
where we need to be you know moving
forward and like you know not to keep
using Apple as like the last unit of
everything great but like Apple came out
with the iPhones
but nice
iPhone is like my example of that where
they came out with this thing and
they're like this is different we
promise it's better we think you're
really gonna like it and like maybe
there's there's something to that like
we've been in the same place where like
you know if I held this up next - you
know Lenovo laptop from 20 years ago you
know they were both lenovo laptops and
like that's good on one hand but really
bad on another cuz it's like a lot of
health's is changed in 20 years like why
hasn't this and I mean that hasn't
changed
dude we just three years sure but like I
guess maybe did we just nail this three
years ago I guess touchscreen is a big
one things like at higher res and then I
guess just like thinner and we'll
eventually just carry it around and
it'll be this big and that'll be cool
well you know I think the thing with
laptops and this is just my theory is it
I think laptops they're essentially like
the perfect expression of the ti 99 and
I was like eight and that's what
computers are thinkin that yeah that's
what they become but those computers
appeal to a really narrow subset of
people like my parents don't want to use
a lot they've never asked me for laptop
have an iMac an iPad yep stop using the
back they only use the iPad my niece and
nephew have no interest in laptops like
they just want to use the iPad I think
this is like there's like this narrow
window of people who grew up with
computers that look like this and they
this is the ultimate but we've hit that
like this is what the computers would
look like that are going to look like
there are really good options now the
second you try to deviate from that like
build hinges and ribbon cables like you
start building something else that like
isn't that right and you're trying to
shoehorn like we find we get it like
these have evolved to their final
condition right the next step is all
these touch devices and those touch
devices need to be true to themselves so
I think yes these will inherit qualities
of those devices they I don't know that
any of this form factor innovation has
led us anywhere meaningful and like the
surface pro I think is it's about as
good an example of like let's build a
tablet that's a keyboard and O'Reilly
word laptop and it has this hinge in a
kickstand and it's like you look at it
like why didn't you just go the lot
right but maybe that's where we're going
right is that like it you know people
will have like a desktop and a tablet in
a tablet becomes the portable thing and
maybe this is like we're slowly taking
like awkward baby steps toward that
where eventually though desktop
computers are coming back I mean I think
if tablets become what everybody thinks
they're gonna become which is like the
future of how we compute on the move
yeah
then yeah I think that's ups are coming
back I think in like they'll be thinner
and cheaper and it'll basically be like
your TV and your computer sitting on
your desk all at once and that'll be
really you like get real work done
because nobody's ever gonna you know
with the on-screen keyboard of the iPad
no matter how good it gets you're never
gonna want to like really like sit down
a new business on your iPad here you
know like poor shoes let's I mean maybe
these are just like the ugly baby steps
towards I just think like the the whole
listen trees like they're these are
attempts to compete with the iPad and
not attempts to compete with the MacBook
Air right and in doing so but they cost
more than it cost more than that go
together and in do in in in failing to
recognize where they need to compete
they all miss the mark wildly in in
different all different ways except for
except for that one except for the SFF
which literally is like we should
compete with a MacBook Air and they made
a really good thank you they did except
that it's like and it has it has
surround sound on the bottom and it's as
professionally tuned on the inside just
kiss you didn't know how good well I
agree I think this is like Toshiba says
an amateur turn but if like yeah I mean
it's a Sony Sony was like we're gonna
compete with a MacBook Air and like
Brett Sony - they made if you are
engineering a hinge for your display
that has to support the full weight of
the keyboard off the ground but just
stop just think about what you're doing
like how will this keyboard be more
rigid if it's sitting on the table or if
it's off the ground okay you should
understand that it'll Bend in the middle
and like just stuff like that it's like
what do people want they want they want
to spend over a thousand dollars on
these on the people who spend it with us
yeah that's what they want they just
want them to feel sturdy yeah and if
your thing is bending in the middle it
doesn't matter if it's made of carbon
fiber hypothetically speaking yeah I
think flexes away when you type on it it
doesn't matter if that means over the
long run it will
more durable like this this which is the
argument that I've been hearing from all
the windows people like it's more
durable because it's flexible which
means it like we're I don't care it
feels like job and like that I think
that is like just it's so simple it
compete with that don't compete with you
out yet and we'll get we'll get there I
promise you it'll be okay yeah thank you
so much go go tell some taking this
elbow that he needs to like exchange
everything
this batwing computer and I'm leaving oh
the fans are spending yeah you know it
happens and that everyone is our show
thank you so much for watching thanks
Danny like to tell and all these weird
laptops for being here and I stop
breaking my computers please I have to
say these back it's somebody you're
gonna give me trouble anyways thank you
for being here and we will be back with
lots more next week we have coverage of
all these laptops including the full
review of the ThinkPad helix at the
verge calm and we will see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
