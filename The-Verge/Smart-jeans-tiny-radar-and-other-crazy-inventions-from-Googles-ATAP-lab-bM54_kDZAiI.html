to build products for everyone in the
world we tried it looked at technology
and see by using technology can we make
a difference to a fundamental problem in
people's lives Google IO is a show all
about the future
there are wild crazy things happening
here that could happen in a few years or
not at all we don't know the exciting
things that they're happening pushing
those things as Google's advanced
technology and projects crew they're
building a modular smartphone and
software with the rigs doing
jaw-dropping 360-degree movies but their
newest projects availed here this year
shows are really different our hands is
an amazing instrument it's very fast and
precise but we still look able to
capture this sensitivity you know user
interfaces just still quite clunky the
most insane thing ain't app is showing
off here is project soli this is a tiny
little radar system that can pick up the
smallest movements of your hand one of
the examples they did was something like
the watch so you want to change the
hours or seconds you can literally just
hold your finger and twist or pick it up
a little higher than twist a second it's
the kind of thing that takes you from
having to touch your device to touching
over it or picking up gesture Google's
already played around with that with
Android wear but this idea takes it way
out let's go project soli goes
hand-in-hand with another project called
jacquard this is basically conductive
fabric they've created it can be woven
into anything any sort of fabric we have
to make interactive garments possible
using existing when you talk share
techniques and existing means actually
supply chains we have to adapt the
textile industry so every textile mill
in the world can weave throughout the
textiles each app is basically created
its own fiber that is more conductive
than anything else that's out there
Google basically wants this built in the
shirt sleeves and pants and they're not
just doing this alone either so working
with Levi's and today they announce a
partnership
we're gonna see some of the first
clothes with this coming out we don't
know when we don't
and look like but imagine a pair of
jeans that's actually like a touch pad
or a code where you can control music
with your wrist that's the big idea here
one of the smallest things here is
actually one of the biggest ideas
it's called project fault and a tap to
take on mobile security project vault
will enable secure communications and
storage they've created a very small
computer inside a micro SD card that
lets you do everything from encrypt
video chats to actual communications
without letting your phone or computer
see what you're doing the big idea here
is that your data stays with you and you
can put it into any sort of device and
not worry about whether it's secure it
can be used from mobile to desktop to
the Internet of Things and well that's a
wrap almost this is the phone that
basically lets you swap out cameras
batteries whatever you want to do to
make it your phone they're almost ready
to launch this in Puerto Rico later this
year so today they showed it turning on
and taking a picture that's about as far
as we're going so the big idea here is
really that you'll be able to customize
your phone and maybe upgrade a couple
pieces here and there a few years later
that's a really big idea it's just not
ready yet a tap has a really interesting
vision of the future but it's a lot to
take in and a lot of these things seem
like they're super far out even modular
smartphones we thought they'd be here
sooner they're not that's just the way
it is but it is nice to know that
someone's working on these problems
