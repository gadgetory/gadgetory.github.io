we're here at CES and Capcom this is the
alt workstation say $5,900 death it is
essentially the most opulent ridiculous
outrageous desk / workstation you've
ever seen it essentially it comes with a
robotic crane arm and a reclining chair
that work in concert to let you go from
a scanning to a sitting to a flat on
your back position all while looking at
a monitor and using a mouse and a
keyboard so this thing uses magnets on
its death to hold a keyboard in place
and the magnets within a special
mousepad to hold the mouse in place that
way when the death starts moving
backwards and you started reclining
nothing else falls off and you can
essentially keep working once you're
stationary and lying flat on your back
and then your laptop will sit into a
docking station off to the left so you
might think that this is a completely
ridiculous way to do anything lying flat
on your back with thousands of dollars
of Technology floating above your face
but it's actually quite comfortable and
because there are magnets in the desk
you actually can do work you know
opening up a tab here and going over to
the verge calm and it's pretty natural
they've clearly thought through how this
is supposed to work and you know I would
actually do this if I had $5,900
and enough space to have a reclining
workstation so the device is only
shipping to northern California right
now that's I guess where all work
manufactures it so that's that's where
they're focusing on right now so you
need to live basically in the San
Francisco Bay Area to get your hands on
something like this
you also need fifty nine hundred dollars
to spend on a single desk but if you
have that money it's well it's well
worth
shop takes a little time but once your
legs recline
you're then doing this perfectly natural
everyday activity of working with a
gigantic curved screen sitting above
your face</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
