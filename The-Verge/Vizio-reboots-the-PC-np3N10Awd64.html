Walmart if you ever been in one you
probably know they sell a lot of Vizio
TVs here well you probably don't know is
that vizio is an American company it's
actually a really small American company
it's 400 employees it's about half of
them work in the call center with
walmart's help they become the number
one TV manufacturer united states now
that small team is taking the experience
and strategy its learned here and it's
moving to the PC I you know people look
at the pc industry and then go you guys
crazy right we have analysts it'll say
you're crazy that's this a huge market
granted but it's it's packed with large
elephants right people companies that
have been in the industry for a long
time they have twenty thirty percent
market share how are you going to seat
them they've got teams of 50,000
employees you just can't do that you
can't enter amateur stagnant market and
hope to capture a lot of market share
and you know are the the easy answer to
that is that's exactly what the TV
industry was eight years ago ah you know
for anybody who's thinking of starting a
company don't avoid the mature market
sometimes those are the easiest ones to
go disrupt because everyone's asleep
one of the things that's striking about
your product is that you're running
stock windows right there's very little
customization down below there's none of
that one of the biggest trends I think
over the past three or four years has
been really tight coupling of hardware
and software even but you're running
kind of this very stock this could be
windows anywhere the quiet disk do you
think about that when you're designing
the hardware well I mean good size yeah
the choice to actually remove a lot of
that yeah cleaning all of that off I
think goes hand in hand with the design
and the approach that we took the
philosophy we we took which is really
dude to break it down to its its minimum
form of something that's very striking
but not going to be cluttered I think
windows is a especially devolution
that's coming with Windows Windows 8
it's it goes very much hand in hand with
with the cleanliness of the design and
the impression that you get not only
when you see the product close your
laptop and you open it up and see
windows running on it obviously I
readers are incredibly excited about
getting a being able to just buy a 10 pc
is it tempting though to to take sort of
the subsidized to push that price even
lower and starts to compete yeah it is
it is but you know we thought about it
for 30 seconds I mean honestly it's it
first it's a differentiator right it
does set us apart so it's very easy to
market a product that's clean when
everything else is you know completely
messed up yeah so it's a sad state of
affairs it is sad and so you can stand
out just by building the you know making
the correct decision and the the design
of the product we considered the bottom
as much as we did the top and going with
the philosophy of all details but but
minimal breaks minimal surfaces not
having the stickers and all the crap
that ends up on PCs and laptops I hate
opening up a pc and saying stickers all
over the place and flashing blinking
LEDs and I know each one of those has a
purpose and there's a reason behind the
choices that were made to put them in
there but we countered that by asking a
lot you know I be equally proud to leave
this on the table like this because I
think it's a beautiful design as
it's not an embarrassing side you have
to flip over I think there's a benefit
that vizio has entering this market is
we don't have the legacy that that our
competitors have you know where the core
of this was to to to retain these four
pieces the one thing that's really
interesting and the entire pcmark to me
is track that how did you manage till
the trackpad that's good and is it
actually good it's good you get to you
get to try it later okay I mean we're
still actually we're in mass production
tomorrow on our laptops and we're still
fine-tuning today and tonight on the
track pads its a mix of hardware and
software first you have to pick the
right hardware you've got to pick a
sensor from a top vendor it's the shape
and the size relative to the keyboard
actually matters a lot the physical
click mechanism and the substructure
that actually holds it so there's a lot
of hardware choice not only component
but also mechanical on how you build it
and then from then on it's software
tuning and it's driver tuning and it's I
mean we I could go on for six hours and
all the volcker details of how to make a
good track pad let me ask you this this
is it I believe you I'm gonna have to
try it and find out but why were you
able to do this and no other vendor has
ever been able to focus it's it's
realizing that track pads have sucked
for a really long time and making that
something that we wanted to get right so
here's the all-in-one a lot kind of
going on here toss me out the hinge this
whole hinge is mounted to the subframe
inside the LCD that the back cover goes
over so all of the mechanical heart
connection points are happening
happening inside here are all desktops
dropping not all months all ones are
growing all ions are growing absolutely
so all ones are growing I think the
compiler generative laptops yes
absolutely it's the fastest growing form
factor in pcs by heart so and I think
that's you know people are getting
enough horsepower of an all-in-one it's
it's it's easy it's beautiful I don't
have a big you know four liter box do
you think that's because people have
tablets uh I don't know I don't know if
that's because I mean that that goes
right back to the center of digital
hobbies I've got this consumption device
and walking over with it I've got a
pearl made my stuff somewhere yeah i
think it's i don't know i ask a question
i don't know exactly why
it's growing and the interest in its
growing I think you know very very high
and I think this will be one of the top
performing all in ones yeah in the world
when we launched it
how are you gonna sell these guys are
you going to walmart yep same thing so
yeah you know if you're watching what
Walmart's doing go into a top walmart
recently and you will see them
transforming their electronics section
into something that honestly competes
with best body and they're ratcheting up
what they're bringing in there
ratcheting up the quality of the retail
experience there and so that matches us
perfect most pcs are still sold through
kind of traditional retail and you know
we hope to bring these this premium
product to the mass market right and
that's what we do we don't you know it's
very easy for us to actually sell this a
two thousand dollars and we define
that's not interesting to us what what
we like to do is create great technology
and sell boatloads of it to every every
American every consumer that wants it
being a being a small American company
actually has its advantages and
disadvantages right and we tend to focus
on the advantages and actually leverage
them as best we can disadvantage is we
only have so many resources and we can
only do so many things what that makes
us do though it makes us focus it makes
us focus on the products that we think
are right and get those done and get
those done well because i'm not going to
build you know a hundred different
products and different categories we
just can't do that we have to get into a
category win it and move on to the next
one and be very deliberate about what we
do which is so that's actually i think
that's actually the good side of having
to have focus and being small but i
think the other advantages were we're
extremely fast we can move
extraordinarily quickly we can think
about a product and actually have it at
one of our retailers within six months
and I mean you know conception design
electrical engineering software
engineering EVT pvt full design
verification key way shipping and
actually have a sit on a retail shelf
within six months no other company can
do that in the consumer electronics
space there's kind of a lot made in my
part of tech industry that kind of a new
company where you can't be a hardware
startup but you can't just start making
a hardware
Hospital you guys seem to be defying
that trend yeah what would you say to
somebody who wants to do a hardware so
it if that's where your passion is and
that's where you think you can make a
difference do it there's no there's no
reason I you know again we entered an
extremely mature industry 10 years ago
TVs it was stagnant dead we came in and
and and really disrupted it in a lot of
ways hardware it's actually a physical
instantiation of software that's kind of
what's happening nowadays right i mean
we're shipping a tablet and great there
is a tablet it's great hardware and
everything but that's really a physical
instantiation of android right so you
can't be couple the two totally and if
you if you're a product guy if you're
somebody who just loves products and you
think you can innovate hardware it do it
there's no reason you can't do it
especially now the way that technology
is done the way that you can leverage
parking companies in the amount of
talent that's out there there's no
reason not to do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
