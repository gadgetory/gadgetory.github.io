one of the most exciting times of the
year the the type the type is all messed
up I guess we'll just wing it uh Josh
what did you think about what was the
biggest trend of CEO so we're just
worried it's gonna wing it I guess um
you know CES is an exciting time there's
that there's a lot of excuse me I'm
sorry I'm sorry okay the first at CES
2014 I'm Josh Topolsky i'm ross miller
and this is our morning show that we do
every year here we recap the previous
day's events and announcements we talk
about what's coming today and and
yesterday was a quite a day it's very
busy he's quite the same thing is every
year obviously this whole week is very
see us with the official days today so
yesterday's where all the companies
dozens and dozens a press conference has
happened yeah all the announcements are
made to ya show floor there's no
surprises yeah I mean and and monday is
historically the previous day that we
just went through is you know huge
events lots of announcements lots of
companies cheerleading their products
and talking about their amazing
innovations and all the new stuff is
there everything is beautiful and
wonderful yeah everything is everything
is innovative and you've never before
seen it and you know actually is
probably something that's that's best
expressed through showing you a little
bit of it so so take a look at this good
afternoon miss happy new year it's great
to be here at CES 2014 you know 2014
really is the
of the Internet of Things our theme for
this year is with energy Oh possible
this year is all about play we know you
want one device for everything from what
to play premium tablets for both work
and play we are not just about commotion
but emotion it's not just cutting edge
technology but it's for serving a higher
purpose making lives better this
philosophy drives our innovations I
believe this some z's innovation
innovation this innovative feature
couple other innovations innovation our
new Wharf a handyman we have the zing
boom park life ban touch fitness
activity monitor about a hand for our
9000 series top loader front load of
laundry pairs Tegra k1 the world's first
192 core processor this is the world's
lightest aps-c interchangeable lens
camera this could be the tiniest gadget
Sonia has an LMA we are calling them
throw devices Easter eyes when I'm
calling the reference standard for 4k
say hello to the Asus Transformer book
you a kid need 300 so many products to
play with in so little time to play
what's true now on to the main event the
all-important television category this
year at CES we're going to hear about
three other very important letters you
HD ultra HD 4k 4k entertainment the
curved shape a curved design curve the
curve
how does it how do you think it's gonna
impact how he was experience your movies
excuse me I'm sorry I'm sorry okay it's
live shows folks so a lot of innovation
happening in a nation have a lot of
excitement over the lot of love making
your life better you know I have to say
just generally speaking the yesterday's
announcement sweet sauce Samsung we saw
LG nvidia was the previous evening the
last really event of sunday night so
that i'm kind of counting that who else
did an event yesterday asus sony
qualcomm intel right intel had something
out and Johnson really really president
but but but i will say that that that
and I actual take Intel out of that
makes a little bit but because I thought
their stuff is very strange and
interesting it's definitely liked by the
numbers by the book I always think this
year more than any yeah you've done this
obviously longer than I have the person
it was palmed for several thousand years
ever i'm doing it up doing the CSO this
thing started the 60s you've been doing
it since the 20 I've been doing it since
the since the 1620s which is what's
amazing about it but very different
scene back then but I remember like
every year i've gone up into this year
like there's always been some flagship
product were like wow that's insane yeah
first year I came he was a palm pre
obviously last year was oculus rift yeah
I which is a big surprise yeah so far
we've seen nothing like that everything
I don't think we've I don't think we've
seen a slam-dunk product frankly I think
the show this year and this is is is
there is an admin flow last year we
expected kind of a mellow show and I
think we saw we got a lot of surprises
this year I would say maybe our
expectation of surprises is a bit higher
and as a result we may be a little bit
more disappointing with what we see I
think that you can't have the same kind
of show every year and so we'll have to
see but but the other thing too it
really I think we felt somewhat similar
to this time last year also because the
big announces we saw her from the
smaller companies that don't have the
big press conference right that's right
and in fact a lot of them didn't have
press conferences at all and oh you just
said that didn't you I just repeated
what you said any any reinforcements at
any rate so so but one of the one of the
big things at every CES is televisions
right people I mean the companies that
come here they have to talk about
televisions they need to talk about
child
but we saw a ton of TV news yesterday
you know in my opinion the most exciting
if we're going to talk about a sighting
TV development okay I feel like LG doing
a webos television is the is the big one
that's a very sad center for like the
best new innovation because it's just a
new interface to a smart TV which is
basically them trying to get rid of the
set-top box still claim input one so to
speak right before someone else does for
them well I think LG's doing some
interesting things first off they're
using a real platform you know they're
not just grafting their stuff onto some
weird proprietary build they throw on
one TV then don't do it on the next it's
not like this random smart TV software
they're saying hey we have a platform
it's called webos you can build apps for
webos it's built to work well as with
like html5 apps which is how all these
companies are building they're building
their apps for TVs or at least they will
be for the LG TV and it has a real
thought behind the way you you use it so
you know here's a look at it right here
and i think i think you know that's kind
of a big deal the only problem is and
we've discussed we discuss is on the
verge casa and i think some shows
yesterday you gotta buy an LG TV right
not like they're distributing this out
into the world for anybody to use on a
television want iOS that you got to
buying iphones that's not entirely
unprecedented right did you have an LG
TV I don't have um i have a panasonic
kind of sams do you know anybody with an
LG TV i don't i'm not saying people
don't buy them but they get i don't i
don't really walk in like a what TV is
that because to me it's still it's just
a black rectangle that puts that plays
xbox and playstation right i I do
everything I can to avoid the smart TV
interfaces if this gets me to like at
least curious them to try it out like
that is a great thing for LG to pull off
right I mean to me I'll take I'll take
an innovation in software over an
innovation like these curved displays
that everybody was showing up right LG
had a curved display yes and I wonder
five inch curved display and I know they
had was it hot was it 105 it was at the
85 I think it's 77 85 and 105 well at
any rate they showed off curved displays
which so far nobody has actually been
able to identify why why we should be
interested in curved displays I mean
they've said there are reasons but I
don't really buy them samsung at a
curved display samsung dead who else was
that it samsung LG
battling it out for Sony did Sony do not
have a perv TV so that's this is the
other thing and then for que por que
yeah which is which is more real this
year than it was last year and I think
probably the most interesting part of
that is Netflix and Amazon buying into
4k in a big way and forming partnerships
with a lot of these companies LG had
Reed Hastings the CEO of Netflix come
out and talk about you talk about the
webos interface but they also talked
about Netflix doing shows doing all of
their shows in 4k right and they can die
and i have to say listen to that like my
first thought was like and we talked
about a little bit yesterday there's no
time warner cable there's no comcast
there's no charter so any of those
companies on stage with them saying yes
we're part of the 4k revolution right
know if you getting a 4k television you
want to watch 4k content that delivery
system is going to be internet streaming
that's right because gotta be it's got
to be streaming and you don't yet you
don't hear I mean cable I guess
presumably will come around to do in 4k
over traditional cable lines over copper
I mean I I assume they can I don't know
why they wouldn't be able to they can do
1080 at least photo-optical I mean when
you think about how artifact at 1080 or
720 is on on cable delivery I do wonder
if that's even possible but the new
standard is h.265 which is being built
into a lot of these new televisions the
industry seems to have agreed on it for
for getting reasonably sized packets of
data down to these televisions and these
receivers and getting it on to your
television but you know I feel like
we're still I feel like Time Warner and
Comcast are terrified of people asking
for more bandwidth trying to push more
bandwidth down there down the pipe and
so I just I feel like we're still very
far away on 4k TVs even though you're
going to be able to start to buy them
you can buy them now you'll be able to
buy even more throughout 2014 right and
maybe you have a better memory of this
but I do know when the HD television
start becoming a big thing obviously
cable and not caught up yet you'd have
to buy a special HD receiver it costed a
premium yeah if it was available at all
that's right um the infrastructure I'm
hoping you know is there if not it's
gonna be a huge I know the next five
years that's brilliant I think next five
years will lay the groundwork but it's
going to be a slow climb
or climb in my opinion maybe then then
agents HD was slow at least in the US so
so that's I think that's the main stuff
for televisions it is there anything
else that happen I mean the only the
court you know the tangential to that at
least somewhat sony did announce a 4k
camera right so if it's not Amazon
Netflix it is your home movies with you
4k camcorder which is two people say
camcorder anymore I don't think they do
handycam ago uh yeah what is a handset
yes that's a brand name but you know
interesting I mean there are 4k cameras
in existence now there are plenty of
them people are shooting 4k right now so
that's not a huge innovation do they
mention a price point I don't think some
of the handicap line is generally that's
more consumer right its consumer facing
product if it's if it's cheap enough
that would be really interesting right
but we don't know yet I don't see why I
don't see I don't know if that's a major
leap for them because in terms of
processing 4k you know cameras do that
all the time I mean you can you can
process higher resolution images I think
the issue is the optics and they're
probably cheaper optics in there so it
could be a consumer level product for a
reasonable price right of course in
you've no witness it's always us trickle
down all right it's gonna go
professional to prosumer to consumer to
your parents right so what else was it
was was where the big story at six
stories and it this does feel like
almost a rehash last year so far the big
story course again was wearable yeah but
not just the wrist either and this is
we're getting to Intel but bought
wearables about sensor bed sensors there
are no buts answers actually which is my
to my frankly to my disappointment hello
Russell you could assert into your pants
the track your butt moon actually so r
another thing russell brandom did a
report earlier in the week with notch
smart up it's a startup company uh they
do sensors into your shirt the track
your shirt movement I don't see why you
could do his pants no yeah notch is
interesting because there's almost a
it's almost abstracted from this whole
idea of a specific thing you put on like
a watch or a band or an ankle thing
there's no my ankle thing but uh bet
that's called an ankle bracelet for
blown but last year we started to see
just the a taste of wearables and this
year it was Sony and sams that Samsung
have 0 or LG LG LG and sony what do you
didn't really did they mention it that
much I know they've had a SmartWatch for
a while but like they talked about they
touched on on where
they have this tennis racket right it's
his mark tennis racket which is very
interesting you know but there is there
is certainly Intel talked a lot about
their wearables I mean where they wear
their chips can go and what's
interesting is that it was a cool idea
last year and now this year all the
major companies are either touting
products that are that they're making
that are their Fitbit competitor or you
know they're FuelBand competitor or
there at least talking about how
important wearable technology yeah like
and I think even like a gaming cover
like razors like looking at smart as I
they you announced that Nabu last night
you know which is against a crazy
company to think about doing this and
what feels kind of off the mark is that
we're seeing it for a record your data
or gives you data it doesn't really
tackle the input thing yet they need the
right metrics right I remember we would
see us avail Casey had found something
that was very interesting like that I
cameras like a VR thing oh the pivot VR
yeah or is it veer side of it i think
pivot view that's not never like you
strapped this is cool i don't know if
you guys have seen i thought this was
kind of an amazing product it is in
basically it looks like the thing from
Elysium in a way that the like the body
mod or whatever but it tracks your body
movements attracts your arm movements
and it looks really really natural i
mean you can see there's a little bit of
lag but you know that you can see
Casey's arm is shaking a little bit and
shakes in the in the in the game and i
gotta say you you match this with by the
way they also have leg attachments
apparently and this is not that
expensive it's jacked in the back of his
head that yeah because elysium thing
yeah but i mean you you you that's good
no you match this with with an oculus
headset I mean that to me is I mean this
goes beyond wearables this is a crazy
you know body immersive experience for
you when you're playing a game we're
doing all sorts of things I mean this
doesn't have biometrics right this is
just straight up for games train up for
you can imagine a situation where you
have something like that you're tracking
your biometrics you're playing some sort
of like activity game or exercise thing
or you know whatever sports game on your
105 inch curved TV you know and not the
heart guys like something I remember
valve saying six months ago when they
looked
biometrics and obviously that's a
company that just thinks about random
stuff all the time yeah but the ID like
if we check your pulse and you start
getting more scared in a game we can
actually make the game effect right no I
mean I think that's a really cool and
exciting idea i mean even playing dead
rising on the xbox one you know there's
a there's a feature where you can say
you can scream over here and the zombies
will hear your voice that's pain come
towards you and you know at first i was
like well this is a weird gimmick like
i'm not really buying into this but then
after doing it a few times i was like
wow this really is adds a whole new
dimension to the game I mean you do you
are interacting with it in a way that
you would have never been able to do
before and it has a real visceral impact
on what's happening on screen so seeing
stuff like this I mean I think it's it's
you know we're talking a lot about
wearables things like pebble watches
that will actually had a great showed
off a great new watch alright very
fashion-conscious yeah i mean the the
second pebble that called the pebble
steel is definitely i think a huge
upgrade from the previous device they
did but you know we're talking about
wearables like that smartwatches and
fitness trackers there's a smart
toothbrush which is not really a
wearable but i think falls and oh yeah
well we had me the for class trips we
need something like that i right hey
this is definitely the follow-up to the
for ya but but but when you think about
how you could apply some of this
technology to experience as a gaming or
driving or you know activities that
aren't just strictly like hey I'm
exercise and I'm sleeping here's what I
wonder about wearables okay America is
not no I'm just speaking as an American
America is not known for and as a person
who's not known for this not known for
being like real into fitness and being
healthy right i mean at least in the
last like 30-40 years right we sort of
been on a slow march towards morbid
obesity across the nation so i just
wonder like we're making we're making
all these fitness devices all these
tracking devices i mean i bought what
was the we thing of the the value step
on a balance board i bought the balance
board I used the balance board for like
a month and then I was like the bounds
more went under the sofa Brandon never
slid back out I the balance board is now
there's a pile of pennies discarded fur
it looks like there's another Chihuahua
underneath the sofa that is just for
coverage of balance board so like
I wonder what I really wonder is people
are buying the FuelBand they're buying
fitbit's clearly there's a people think
there's a market for it there seems to
be a market for it or do people actually
want to use these for extended periods
of time are they going to commit to
using these things because it would be
kind of awesome if we start thinking
about that stuff I mean if we are if we
become a nation or even a species of
people who do and this is the quantified
self idea do we care to numerically
count our steps are calories you know
and I'm unashamedly while those kind of
people who I do track calories all the
time and Rihanna steps but the calories
you to input your food intake right yes
that's one of the does that is like that
is the most annoying thing but you think
you think this is a trend that's a real
trend I don't know I feel like we're
still in this kind of halcyon days of
wearables because the design isn't
really ubiquitous people don't know
where they want to put it if anywhere
right I'm this kind of rates the Intel
keno which was the most interesting
keynote yeah Intel Intel showed us some
sign with some of the stuff they showed
off yes uh jarvis jarvis beautiful i
know you have a list we can go down your
list if you want no no this is great
let's do I want to hear I went to hear I
don't wanna Jarvis okay right yeah well
I mean I let me explain what Jarvis's I
it's just it's it essentially it feels
like a bluetooth earpiece but it's one
that has kind of an AI it kind of works
with you on this right it's essentially
the iron man jarvis it's it's like Siri
if there is i guess i mean a serie if
Siri were just in your ear it's almost
like the movie is almost like her right
in the innocence that it's like this
companion that is speaking to you it's
like a personal conversation you're
having you know I haven't seen that yet
by the way full you know I haven't seen
it either so but I've seen the
commercials and yeah I feel like that's
enough that's enough to know what her
what happens in her they die they all
dying right right spoiler alert I don't
know too soon coming na i die this is
getting gonna day I die great question
but no they and I think the reason Intel
is doing this I think this is a way to
sponsor don't we touch your answers
canon a I'd I love to hear what you
think hashtag verge cat go ahead no no
this is not verge casket i shagged first
! that would be great okay uh nobody
also were like this is somewhat of a
business thing 24 in telekis until
dominate the pc market the screw the
pooch on mobile and that's become a big
thing you know this is intel getting
ahead say we know wearables will be a
thing we don't know what it looks like
you know well we're going to set the
ideas and then if you want it look we
know how to do it so just please use us
well i think this is interesting
you see Google saying hey google glass
you're going to wear this thing on your
head you're going to get information in
the corner of your vision you know
you've got apples take thus far is hey
you're gonna have this personal
assistant on your phone she's going to
give you all this information Google is
also doing Google now so it's a little
bit of that you've seen some you know
you've seen some of these devices the
watch is where they're trying to say
like don't be looking at your phone
we're going to find better ways to give
you certain types of information this is
an interesting take on it where there's
no screen there's no there's no
interface beyond you know the
conversation you're having I mean
obviously there is a a verbal interface
so I think it's an interesting take I
just love the idea though that you're
gonna be I will be having a conversation
we talk about distraction right if
you've ever tried to listen to two
people talking at the same time it's
basically impossible so I love the idea
that we'll be having a conversation and
Jarvis is going to be updating me on
some some very important information and
it's like will be a will be completely
okay or even more compelling didn't talk
about this but I feel like what they're
especially even more compelling is auto
translation and this is I'm like Jarvis
could actually like translate lives
talking job listen well that would be
amazing I mean it will try things like
that but I mean I mean if this device
had the ability to pick up audio that
well and could in real time process it
and deliver the translation I mean that
would change that could change like how
we watch movies friends right you know
instead of doing instead of watching
films will change how we learn languages
instead of watching films with subtitles
you may just be hearing the dialogue
read back of course I guess it's like
dubbing so that doesn't mean ad Jarvis
is a better dubbing but you know dubbing
is wack okay I mean it looks horrible
and it sounds horrible but it might be a
totally different thing and this is the
thing what Intel like it wasn't a
consumer focus event as much they had a
couple things but it was more it was
like vision aspirational get dreaming
and most of the things we saw where this
is the next phone you probably to buy in
six months that's the next tablet you
might get so it wasn't as interesting
because these are very familiar
ubiquitous products right the exception
being in this is we're getting to the
transportation stuff and you like you
did a lot of us of to its automotive
yeah its weight on before we remove what
else what else it intel announced or
what are they talk about that the one
big adjutant he did and this is
we hired rumored was there an initiative
to put windows and Android right this is
this is a thing this was another thing
that happened yesterday is asus did this
android and windows they're like you can
have an android tablet and a windows
tablet and a windows laptop right and an
android laptop i guess if you that's a
thing that you want which I don't know
why you would and Intel is is pushing
for this as well I this to me feels like
the the touchscreen laptop movement the
convertible like hey it flips into a
tablet and now it's a laptop like I
don't really believe that that's how
people want to use these devices I think
if you at the right side screen which is
a smaller screen and a great doc for it
you can have a tablet experience that
becomes a slightly more laptop like
tablet experience and I think you can
have a more simplified laptop but I'm
not sure that that people necessarily
want a device that's trying to do both
things and I think that when you try to
do and I think that that in a way
Microsoft has shown there are real
problems with this and when you try to
do both things right it becomes you
compromise it does feel like allies were
like for a fact like the windows 8 form
factors that just did not sell right
they're like oh we got this right we
have this 13-inch yeah the 12 inch form
factor laying around why don't we put
android on it then maybe we can sell
some of these things which is you know
maybe we're being cynical but I do feel
that there again it's like is there a
market for this product how do you
create a market for it I mean my
experience is I like a smaller tablet
and a small laptop and they do very
different things so anyhow so the other
big story of the show transportation
that's where you were going that's what
I'm going to it cuz that one is someone
aspirational but it also feels a little
more actualized we're about to get in
this field were like you know
self-driving cars is a big thing those
are trying to get approved really fast
you did the Toyota i-road would ya
fascinating I took I took this this I
rode device and we've got a story up on
the site and a great an amazing video
the I road is a three-wheeled they say
to passenger that it's really like one
regular sized human and a kid or
something your your regular size team or
what Toyota's or what sorry I said which
was to Homo sapiens from Japan as the
most politically correct very very play
the record this so this thing is
actually really cool what did
is there meant for car sharing programs
essentially how we have city bikes in
New York you can grab take somewhere and
then drop off they're going to start
doing these in Asia and Europe it's a
three-wheeled leaning vehicle does about
can go about 30 miles an hour top speed
Wow and I think 50 kilometers is the
range so it really is just an inner-city
commuting or you know from a short trip
from the suburbs to the city but it is
so much fun to drive it's a lot of even
for and I'm a big guy like I fit in okay
it's a ton of fun to drive and when you
think about if you could imagine a city
where let's just say half the cars or
replace the people who are commuting
around the city half the cars or replace
with devices like this I mean it's also
all electric obviously well not
obviously not often this is that's an
ocean development tube yes tell you how
fuel cells as well yeah like that's
gonna be a big story about a fuel cell
announcement I believe yesterday and you
know there's clearly look automotive is
changing I think Tesla has has really
realized the imagination for what can
happen in cars and you know Google with
the self-driving car audi last night
showed off a self-driving car that is
they had stuff last year they showed us
it's apparently even more advanced this
year but there are is transportation is
getting really interesting people are
taking it seriously and it's not just
hey we put a bigger more interesting
stereo or GPS unit in the car it's we've
changed the way you're thinking about
about driving I mean Audi's idea is that
you'll be in traffic and the car will
switch into will switch into some mode
where it drives for you so you can read
a book or exact take a phone call or do
whatever even like to get set back this
one we know is gonna have the 2015
Corvette yeah there's display is
basically gran turismo which may be a
little black they kind of gamma phi
little makes me a little nervous people
are like feeling this is Gran Turismo
yeah I mean people will definitely abuse
it yeah but or they'll start playing
grantors that's any more boring that's
problems with humans really with what
Chevy's doing but but but we have this
this Audi right do we have a clip of
though so also to set the stage first
last year did the self-driving car with
the Audi but it's really in a parka
Ziggler went to do an Audi demo and they
and he got in the car and it parked
itself yeah like okay that that is very
very like
fascinating like we were all amazed by
it yeah this is obviously want to show
off a little more so Chris got to do a
few extra things with it this year yeah
well you just we should show this so
here's Chris test driving or test riding
the newest the newest version of Audi
self-driving vehicle this chris from the
verge and today we're looking at a pair
of Audis you're definitely not going to
find your local dealership wonder eyes
for you one reads traffic light over
Saudi has worked with the city of Las
Vegas to wire up all of these
streetlights so that they're actually
downloading information about the
programs that the streetlights are
running on the Reds the greens in real
time and Audi is calculating when the
lights are likely to change the engine
is currently completely off the car has
start/stop technology and because it
knows when this light is going to change
the red to green when there's five
seconds left the engine automatically
turns on so we're ready to go normally
with a start/stop engine the only time
then turns on when you let your foot off
the brake and then there's a little bit
of a delay before then just ready to go
with this by the time the light changes
you can press the gas and you're good to
go
and one of the great things about the
car being able to the tech when it needs
to start the engine is that if you're
not paying attention the stoplights
you're looking around you can feel the
engine start you can feel it on the
pedal the brake pedal you can sort of
here then gin a little bit so that kind
of gives you a reminder that you need to
start paying attention with lights about
to change from red to green the system
is only live in a few European cities
right now and it's very difficult to
scale because every major European city
does their traffic lights differently
it's a little more homogeneous in the US
but it's still a huge task to try to
take in all of this traffic light
information collected in a server farm
and in Germany and process it can get it
out to all the cars so this is a slow
process the Las Vegas deployment just
receive yes of course but over time
hopefully we'll see this more clothes
later we took their the highway to see
what happens when you fall asleep while
your self driving cars slugging along in
a traffic jam okay here we go please
watch the traffic around me because this
is pretty scary
lego so it says driver attention please
take control of people after five
seconds starts bring down and image
slider on well just switch to switch
back off again something's happens still
in development that's a that's a loud
beep the idea is hard to ignore and it's
absolutely we want the driver to know
that he's supposed to do right it uses a
variety of sensors both inside and
outside the car to make this happen
inside there are cameras but actually
keeping on my face I fall asleep the
card text that atomically shuts off the
piloted driving and if i take too long
to take to pull the car you'll actually
bring it to a full stop put on the
flashers and call the cops so there you
have it just like last year out is
throwing a lot of new technologies yes
and neither of these technologies are
ridiculous notions that want to receive
away today they're real and there's good
reason to think they'll be in production
person so pretty incredible I mean it
yet nobody I think there's this this
feeling of safety because you got
somebody behind the wheel there but when
you see them just like taking their
hands off the wheel and there's like an
18-wheeler whizzing past them it reminds
me that you're in a scene from fight
club or like they just like over the
week yeah crashing yeah it can't look
like a chef it's not it's not crashing
no it's like very boring it comes to a
stop yeah no it's pretty incredible and
that'll be that hasn't we haven't put
that up the video up as a standalone
yeah no that'll be in like an hour
that'll be that'll be up on the site in
just a little bit so you guys can
rewatch it and it's a really cool report
from Chris so I think that's that's kind
of the show we have a lot of stuff
happening today this is the first of the
first we'll be doing them throughout the
week and of course later tonight we'll
do the verge cast after hours and I
don't know if we don't have any live
post show events today no but we do have
one more interesting thing right now
obviously we're we're doing the show
while Cass riders kino an apology's for
that of course yeah if people are
watching both thank you yeah there's
there's if you didn't know there's a
cause for a keynote going on right now
that we're covering live but it as an
apology I Mia culpa for us the Sony
president news lien president mike
Fasulo will be here he's this is first
interview ever as
sunny president yeah very cool he'll be
here in the studio in studio live with
Daniel and Neil I will be doing an
interview with him and that's in it's
about eleven o'clock when I say 11 but I
will say you're literally going straight
from the hour and a half but we'll have
to see what their schedules like over
there but so yeah and well and by the
way we'll have a bunch more interviews
and hands on all kinds of demos and
stuff from the studio here like I said
verge casts at night first will be
happening every morning than 90 seconds
on the verge of course every day so
plenty of video lots of video coming
from the verge that is first and we will
see you guys tomorrow morning take care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
