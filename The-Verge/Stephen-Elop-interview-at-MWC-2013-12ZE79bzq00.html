my Stephen Elop nokia CEO right here at
Mobile World Congress in Barcelona do
you want to give us a quick recap we
just finished your press conference
which is just announced it yes indeed we
announced today for new Nokia products
and I think the most important theme
from these products is they were
products intended to reach more people
at lower price points and what you saw
today was a number of our great points
of innovation from the high-end devices
landing in lower price devices including
two new Lumia devices and two new
feature phones that we introduced today
right so most of the presentation as you
say is about the trickling down of your
high end features into more affordable
price points but I also feel like our
audience is more interested in maybe the
things you didn't announce the things
that didn't show up and the things are
kind of anticipated and hoped you might
show us one of them is not gets happen
and I know you usually like to deflect
those questions but you yourself I
record nokia ball 2011 said that there's
great potential in the tablet space
markazi sorry last year said that he's
spending a lot of portion of his time
designing and lockets have so we know
you're working on it but when are we
actually going to see that materialized
in the product and so we certainly
haven't announced any tablet products
what we're doing right now is watching
very closely some of the dynamics that's
that are taking place in the tablet
market particularly with the
introduction of Windows 8 the new
surface products from Microsoft and so
forth we're really trying to understand
the dynamics of that market and to make
sure that if we were to enter that
market that we would do so in a very
differentiated and compelling way so
it's an area to continue to study but
it's still an opportunity for us right
so specifically about the service
product do you not feel at least a
little bit betrayed by Microsoft because
they kind of stole in on your area of
strength which was designed you know
very high-end design no we we actually
think that our areas of strength like
design imaging location-based services
that we are unmatched in the industry in
those areas and so of course everybody
tries to work in those areas because
they're important to the the person
using the device but we are very
confident in our strengths in those
areas and look forward to competing with
whoever the
or the company is that may be
introducing products so even the surface
being out there you still think it can
compete with it you see I think there's
a broad opportunity for it all sorts of
products in the tablet space just as
there is in the smartphone space so yes
absolutely okay so you and I spoke here
last year and I'm let me see and you
said you'd never be more confident about
your choice would windows phone for a
smartphone person is that suitcase that
you still confident us absolutely we
made the decision about two years ago to
place a big bet on the Windows Phone
ecosystem and what you've seen in those
two years is successive ways waves of
products the Lumia 920 is a flagship
device the world's most innovative
smartphone is clearly capturing the
attention of consumers we're very
excited now today to be able to talk
about a full range of Lumia products
from the lowest price 520 all the way up
to the 920 and so now we have the
building blocks in place it's time to
continue to make sure we get these
products into the hands of consumers
because when they use them they love
them so we just have that work to do
it's rare enough you just say the nice
way to capture detention and it did but
you still haven't had that kind of
runaway success with your flagship
devices and there is this feeling that
Nokia's biggest device at least until
the smartphones is always the next one
is there's always the build up
anticipation to the next one when are we
going to see this hero high-end device
let's say your Galaxy S free your iphone
4 iphone 5 so the Lumia 920 as it was
introduced saw lineups of people in the
united states in the United Kingdom in
China in India we see that product as a
beautiful high-end flagship product
which is casting the halo effect across
all of our other products I get emails
every day for example from people all
over the world who say we love the 920
but can you do something at a lower
price point so I can afford it for
example and there in that case we have
today both the 520 and the 720 being
introduced and so the impact of the 920
is very good as we've said before the
demand for that product exceeds our
supply even today and so we're in a
situation where our expectations
that device are clearly being sarcastic
we're pleased with that and of course as
I said at the end of this press
conference a few minutes ago there's so
much more still ahead here in 2013 so
there's lots of excitement still to see
no it's understandable and surely it's
good for consumers for you to bring
those features down in terms of
affordability but at the same time again
Apple and Samsung are selling their
flagship products add those price points
so evidently there is also a market for
the high price points and the question
is how long can nokia sustain this focus
on the lower in the mid-range in terms
of at least volume sales without really
competing with those big brands what
very time we are really competing with
those big brands I was very proud for
example late in 2012 just after we had
announced the 920 our competitors had
announced their flagship products and
when people put out there and said these
are the products that are leading the
pack there were three or four products
listed the Lumia 920 was one of them
we've clearly established ourselves as a
company that can compete on that basis
we have work to do to get that
information into the hands of consumers
to make sure that in a retail sales
environment they're being well presented
and all of those things but we've
demonstrated the ability to do that so
we have the capacity to do that and
we'll continue to do that while at the
same time making sure that we're
increasing the volume of our sales by
driving to lower price points with some
of that same great innovation so let me
just bring you back to last year's MWC
again when you and I spoke you said
particularly with respect to the
PureView 808 that 41 megapixel sensor
and all of that oversampling technology
you said the reason you bring that to
market was because that was going to be
one of the devices that people going to
remember we are not seeing that same
level of technology that same level
innovation this year and a lot of people
again hoped that over the past year you
might have been able to combine that
exact photo 1 megapixel sense with
Windows Phone firstly would that ever
happen maybe will we ever see it exactly
when we're going to see the next big
innovation step from not yet so I'm not
going to make future product
announcements on the day that we are
announcing a whole bunch of new prada
but one thing I'll challenge in your
question is the Lumia 920 also was a
major groundbreaking device with the
first use of mechanical optical image
stabilization to create great low-light
photography what you're seeing from the
PureView collection of technologies
whether it's low-light capabilities
lossless zooming like in the PureView
808 and a variety of other things that
are still ahead are all sorts of amazing
technologies and of course you should
reasonably expect to see us keep pushing
on that because we've said time and time
again that's a leading part of our
differentiation we are clearly leading
the industry in imaging and photography
and we're very interested in continuing
that so watch this space 2013 is going
to be a very exciting year thank you
very much thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
