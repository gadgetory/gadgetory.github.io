whole life but the only real way to know
what space is like is to go there
unfortunately NASA hasn't picked me for
its next astronaut class but I've got a
ticket for the next best thing
meet the Vomit Comet well that's just
its nickname it's a plane that does
parabolic flight to simulate zero-g I
should probably not buy them but first I
wanted to know what to expect so I turn
to an expert for help my mom first time
but my boss Brian Moore's told me she
got to fly on an old plane that NASA
used to own that did zero-g in order to
test out new technologies for space
don't suddenly try to do a whole bunch
of jumping around and swinging around
right away get yourself keep your head
still okay so what we're the name of the
drug they gave you I don't know but I
can tell you what they gave me all right
well thank you for your advice and
terrifying forecasting mom I love you
well that was helpful at that point
there wasn't much more to do but we are
headed to the place where we're gonna
make all of my astronaut dreams come
true a Newark Airport I've been thinking
about it for so long and we're getting
so close but I haven't put two and two
together that we're actually going to do
this today I think once we're on the
plane then the butterflies will start to
set in parabolic flights have been used
in the past to prepare astronauts from
what microgravity will feel like and
these days is also used to give
civilians a taste of
astronaut life now that we're on the bus
I'm just mildly pretty cowardly alright
sorry
it's a plane so the flight breakdown was
like this can you tell I was really
excited Martian gravity just made
everything feel so easy so of course the
first thing to do is something that
sucks here on earth I promise I do
actually work out so now we're at
one-sixth gravity or lunar gravity and
it really felt like the plane was
slipping away from me
okay so before we go fully 0g you got to
understand how this all works the planes
flying in these parabolas or basically
it does a series of peaks and valleys as
the plane climbs it starts to slow down
before reaching the top of the peak the
entire plane and everyone inside shift
into freefall that's when you experience
zero-g it's a bit like the floating
feeling you get when you're on a roller
coaster that's zooming over a large hill
just imagine when you float to the top
of a pool except without the water and
you move just slightly and the floor
immediately becomes the ceiling the
entire room is changing perspective all
the time
at first it's really disorienting and if
you get going in one direction it's hard
to recover luckily there were some ropes
to grab on to heck even the astronauts
on the space station have to learn to
get a grip just to do their jobs there
are foot restraints all over the ISS so
that the crew doesn't float away while
performing delicate lab work
my job was just to not crash into the
back of the plane
so you may be wondering why they keep
yelling feet down
well these weightless experiences only
lasts around 22 seconds and you gotta
get on the floor as the plane starts to
speed up on its descent as the plane
does a valley you then pull extra G's
1.8 to be exact
imagine feeling like someone is pressing
down on all the parts of your body this
may seem like the boring part of the
trip
but being able to sustain extra G's is
another part of being an astronaut when
you ride on the Soyuz you pull about 3
to 4 G's during launch and then 5 G's
maybe even eight during the descent back
to earth but of course the fun part is
the floating and after I got the hang of
it
I tried to do some tricks I was weirdly
obsessed with flipping
thanks to my preparation though I didn't
get sick that was not the case for the
rest of the flight getting sick in space
is a very real problem to an astronaut's
first get to orbit many deal with
something called space adaptation
syndrome as the body's sense of balance
adapts to microgravity
after 15 parabolas the experience
definitely started to take its toll and
when the pilot said we were done I was
kind of relieved and I couldn't wait to
tell my mom that I'm better at space
than she is he's so glad I finally got a
taste of what bean and zero gravity
really feels like even if it was for
just 22 seconds at a time but maybe
that's enough to send me into orbit now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
