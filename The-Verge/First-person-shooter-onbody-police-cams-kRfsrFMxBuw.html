connection to police abuse being
recorded although on film and not
necessarily on video was the police
abuse during the civil rights movement
in the South and Selma Alabama and
various cities where you saw the fire
hoses and the dogs being turned on on
yeah breaking up just thinking about it
a few years ago on New Year's Eve a BART
police officer shot and killed a man
named Oscar Grant and this was captured
on four five six different cell phones
from different angles this technology
had arrived and not only has it arrived
in everyone's hands who has a cell phone
camera but it's also arrived with the
police departments who are now using
this
the latest technological advance that is
likely to revolutionize policing is on
body recording systems you got to be out
of your damn mind what happens on the
street away from the cruiser has always
been the subject of a lot of contention
and a lot of litigation you'll have
somebody making a complaint about a
police officer and if it's one citizen
and one officer you can have an
accusation and then denial by the
officer and nobody really knows what has
happened now we'll have the ability not
just to know what happened but to to
treat that systemically to make police
forces better and make them more
protected than people civil rights there
are a number of vendors now who are
working in this space that have on body
recording systems the real gold standard
the one that really hits it right this
time
it's axon flex and it includes a
back-end that's called evidence calm
the axon flex is a breakthrough point of
view video system that will
revolutionize transparency with axon
flex
it's simple you record in the field you
dock the unit which automatically
uploads and then you view and share your
files on evidence comm you can better
protect your officers today with taser
and axon
we developed the x26 2003 made it with a
camera so the camera came out with that
as well as an accessory called the Taser
Camp when we launched it very
well-received hot let's start filming
things that aren't being you know
exposed to just tasered the plants the
only way to do that is put a camera on
someone well no one's gonna walk around
the camera it's gotta be warned
we'll conduct that customer we were with
taser devices many years ago when people
said yeah you'll get a few guys to learn
the vast majority this planet is going
to be using taser devices and we know
cameras are rapidly exploding right now
that's where it's going three years ago
the cheese were saying now we're not
going to take cameras they're being
recorded where they like are not all you
do is take an iPhone off your head and
record these officers or take a look at
how many CCTV cameras around throughout
the world they're being recorded where
they like or not so the question is
don't you want to be recorded from your
own point of view we have 50 units that
we deployed back in October we purchased
these 50 for the one-year pilot program
I don't see why anyone wouldn't want to
use these there's nothing for me but a
positive thing it's nothing but a good
thing for me this street drugs shootings
we just had a homicide in this apartment
complex last night
is everything in anything how are you
okay so why are you drinking out here
and why are you dropping stuff out of
your pocket look this guy's going
running does having a camera prevent an
officer from engaging in behavior that
he wouldn't behave on if he didn't know
he was being taped I don't know perhaps
in some cases but in other cases I
imagine that the officer believes he's
doing he or she is doing the right thing
at the time so the guy comes out of
nowhere and is a complaining that you
know he doesn't have a gun and I'm in
the wrong for pointing my gun at him and
I didn't search the guy yet I don't know
that he doesn't have a gun underneath
this waistband hey shut your mouth if
the citizens are able to see what we
have to put up with and what we actually
do there they're more likely to
understand why we did what we've done
that doesn't matter I am armed
keep walking partner for what it's worth
it's hard to argue that the police
shouldn't have the same rights that you
or I have but it does make sense that in
order for this to be useable as evidence
against someone that it's in line with
the Miranda rights that they should have
to be notified that they're being filmed
will be used against a court of law the
other white diplomat attorney and you're
talking directly to a person they may
look at it but they don't say anything
about it because they're not sure or
they don't or they don't care because of
the situation we're in
I've yet to have someone say don't
record me then I would say arrested when
the police film you they will quickly
bring up the fact you have no right to
privacy in a public space despite the
fact that they will say that this is a
private issue that they're dealing with
him that you can't film them we we
generally supported you know the use of
videotape because we think that the
transparency is necessary and you know I
think in the end it's good for the
public or I think it's important that
the information be retained I mean that
people have access to that information
most citizens aren't concerned about
this issue enough to bankroll a lawsuit
to question whether or not we the public
have a right to the video being recorded
by the police officers working on the
public staff if you ask the police why
you can't as a journalist get a copy of
that tape they say to protect the
privacy of the person who they claim has
no privacy in a public place so it
starts to feel a bit Orwellian once you
start navigating these public records
requests the end of the shift we go back
we take them off we put into a charging
station now it starts uploading all the
videos
starts uploading those to a secure cloud
called Kevin is calm all of this data
that an officer is going to generate by
wearing one of these systems is
protected can't be manipulated can't be
deleted and attentionally by officers
and will be available for defense
attorneys prosecuting attorneys civil
rights advocates and police command
staff for oversight purposes and that's
something that hasn't been available to
any of us before every action is
recorded if you go into this file as an
administrator it'll show what you did
it'll tag
you know Joe Blow did this today he open
up the file made edits but it keeps the
original file - who has access to these
videos can these videos be used in your
defense or is it just something that the
government will use to get you
unfortunately because on body recording
systems are so new not that many
agencies have policies to deal with them
you know I've had people that watched my
videos and it's almost to the point that
they looked like they don't actually
jumped through the screen to try to help
me like a video game and we'll see what
that officer had to do versus them
seeing the defendant here dressed in a
three-piece suit hair combed sober
looking like an upstanding citizen but
when we dealt with him you know six
months earlier he was drunk
belligerent very angry at us for
whatever reason and we had to arrest him
infinity billions or go around aimlessly
Toronto turn around okay I'm gonna sleep
on the officers we've had several
officers that were real hesitant in the
beginning like four and five months ago
because they didn't like the fact that a
camera was on their head and they maybe
felt like they were being watched those
same officers have been the last week or
two have come to me and said hey if you
take my camera away I'm gonna be upset
technology is inherently neutral that
can be used positively you can be used
negatively there are absolutely
significant civil liberties concerns
when you implement either a dashcam or
an on body recording system
down on the cloud it's my back and forth
audience has huge reasons to be hopeful
about the use of this technology because
it's it's gonna cut down on bad
interactions between officers and the
people that they interact are things
that we've missed until now because we
haven't really bad the officers
perspective and now we do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
