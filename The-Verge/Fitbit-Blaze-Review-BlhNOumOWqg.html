dominating the for this tracker market
that's not hard to understand why their
products are super simple you just put
them on your wrist where I'm all day and
they tell you if we're moving or if
you're being lazy with the new Fitbit
blaze that it's trying something a bit
more stylish more sophisticated maybe
more smart question is how does it work
just like other fitbit's the $200 blaze
will track your daily activity count
your steps heart rate age high while
you're sleeping and put all that data
into Fitbit SAP on your phone where you
can compete with your friends this one
adds a few new tricks there's a nice
color screen and the watch tells you how
to do certain exercises and it will
track your workouts automatically but
above all else Fitbit is pushing in the
style and fashion with blaze because you
can swap bands between Silicon weather
and a pricier steel option the steel
frame around the blaze is kind of huge
even on my wrists Blaze's screen is the
nicest one fit that's ever made it's
bright even in sunlight colorful very
easy to read
you can pick between a few watch faces
although not a big fan of any of them
they aren't terrible and some change
colors based on your heart rate swiping
over one brings you to the today's
screen and that's where all your key
stats are your steps heart rate distance
walked calories and floors climbed sleep
over again and come to the exercise mood
blaze supports tracking for all the
basics running walking biking and even
weights and it automatically log a
workout if you've been more active than
normal for at least 15 minutes but
there's no GPS built in so you've got to
carry your phone with you you're going
to run outside and want to track your
route that's pretty disappointing from a
200-dollar fitness device another
disappointment is that the blaze for
right now at least doesn't even remind
you to get up and move around that that
says that's coming in a future software
update then there's Fitz tower feature
the blaze that shows you how to do
certain workouts by showing you people
like animations on the screen it's
useful but the blaze doesn't really give
you any feedback on whether you're doing
things right
something the Microsoft band is really
good at even so as a daily fitness
tracker blaze works really well it's
really accurate accounting your steps
and distance though I'm less confident
in the floors climb numbers which always
seem kind of off and heart rate is a
mixed bag it's decent for Oh 70% of the
day but much less reliable when you're
deep in a workout Fitbit calls the blaze
a smart fitness
not a SmartWatch but it's still not
really as smart as I like
there are notifications for calls text
and calendar but that's it no Facebook
no Twitter no Instagram not even email
now I can understand why you'd want to
tune those things out but the option
should at least be there they are music
controls when you're playing music on
your phone but again this is all pretty
basic stuff but that brings us to the
blazes big strength battery Fitbit says
in the last five days net charge and I
can actually vouch for that it'll go a
solid four days at least
and let's just say I'm thankful for that
battery life since this thing's charger
is ridiculous
you've got to pop out the blaze and put
it in this little plastic housing that
bits definitely pushing the style with
the blaze and I'll let you decide how
it's doing there but as a fitness
tracker there's really just not enough
here to recommend it over the charge HR
in fact you can look at the blaze as a
really nice charge HR and if that's
worth 200 bucks to you by all means but
I'm fine waiting to see what comes next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
