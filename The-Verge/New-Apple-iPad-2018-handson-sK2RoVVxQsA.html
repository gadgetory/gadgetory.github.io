and we are here in a high school in
Chicago and what we're looking at is the
new iPad from Apple now this is
available to both consumers and students
it replaces the old nine point seven
inch iPad so this has a nine point seven
inch screen and there's a couple of new
features with it internally it's got the
Apple a 10x processor and then it has
support for the Apple pencil which I'll
talk about in a minute but otherwise it
is basically the same iPad that we've
become familiar with over the past
couple of years again it's a nine point
seven inch screen it has touch ID on the
home button here you got speaker on the
bottom of course your lightning port
front facing camera rear facing camera
of course this model is an LTE equipped
one so it's got the panel here and of
course your Apple logo very
straightforward there's nothing really
new in terms of the design here it is
very much an iPad but it is a little bit
faster than the one that was released
last year thanks to that new processor
and then of course the big new thing
especially for consumers and educators
alike is the support for the Apple
pencil this is the first time that the
Apple pencil has worked with an iPad
outside of the pro line so you can use
the pencil of course to navigate things
but one of the things that they've been
showing off here is new iWork suite and
one of the new ones is keynote here you
can create presentations and draw and
animate them with the pencil so even if
you are creating a presentation and you
make a drawing on there you can actually
let's get to my drawing this is I
apologize it's really bad but there's my
plant growing up out of the soil there
which I drew with the pencil just a
couple of minutes ago so of course and
then it'll class works with all of the
other Apple pencil supported apps so you
can use it to take notes you can use it
to draw you can use it with any other
app that's uses the Apple pencil the
pencil is not included in it however it
does cost $99 extra which hasn't changed
it's not missile surprise it looks like
an iPad it feels like an iPad it acts
like an iPad it is very much very much
an iPad it's nice to have the faster
processor it's going to be a little bit
snappier than last year's model of
course the support for the Apple pencil
is great I really would have liked to
have seen this
our connector here a lot of the demos
that Apple showed off during its
presentation we're showing off things
that were you were creating for classes
and things like that
and they require a lot of typing now
Logitech is making a case for this which
is like a rugged keyboard case which
will sell separately but it would be
great to have the smart connector
because then you can use a smart
keyboard which is a lot slimmer and
easier to use with the iPad but
otherwise you know it's an iPad that's
really all there is to say about it it's
going to be available at the same price
as the last year's model it's $329 for
consumers $299 for educators to get a
little bit of a discount and it's gonna
be available this week for more on the
new iPad and all the other stuff that
Apple announced today at its event here
in Chicago be sure to check out the Virg
