we're looking at Lenovo ThinkPad x1
tablet this is essentially Lobos latest
attempt at a tablet that can do sort of
more than just a tablet so the basics
first
you've got twelve inch display here F HD
resolution and then inside then I've is
packed in an Intel 6th generation Core
processor so you can get up to the m7 in
here and so it's not going to be quite
as powerful to say something like the
social pro 4 but perfectly capable for a
tablet this setup this size and the real
interesting part of this is the Nova
support a stand so like a kind of like a
kickstand and bitter kicks out it just
pops like that and then there's quite a
lot of resistance until you can angle it
and then it it sort of it doesn't really
stick stick in place beside light
doesn't click into place it's just
literally resistive and so this means
you can obviously stand it up just like
this
as with any tablet that sort of converts
and stuff it does have a little bit of a
screen wobble and you notice it at this
sort of angle and it will kind of like
bounce like this I'm assuming maybe with
the keyboard attached it's probably
going to be a little bit more stable and
so we're kind of reserved judgment on
that but what it also does that kind of
makes it more than the tablet is there's
these modules and so this one here is
essentially they're calling it the
productivity module and basically it's
going to give you more ports to your
HDMI on that side and a usb on that side
but it also gives you five hours of
battery life this is where it kind of
gets width and so you've got a switch
that will take this kind of hinge off
here and you literally remove that and
then you plug this in it's not it's not
really quite as simple as you might
expect so you'd probably expect to just
push it down be a chap to have these
flaps open for it to secure in place and
that locks it in place what it does do
is it it makes it feel a little bit more
comfortable to hold and it's not
particularly like the tablet itself is
1.75 pounds with the keyboard it's 22.4
so nearly two and a half pounds so it's
not particularly tablet and then adding
this one is obviously going to make it a
little bit more heavier and but also you
get the five five hours of extra battery
life there's another two modules and
they only have one of
here today so this is the one with the
intel realsense camera so you obviously
going to get free d scanning and stuff
of that with this one but obviously it
can be at the bottom so you don't be to
use it for like logging into windows
turn with your face and if you like that
and the other ones a projector so your
bid to project media out onto the wall
and they're all optional and the
productivity ones $279 and the projector
ones 279 and the 3d imaging one with the
realsense camera is $149 and the actual
tablet itself and it's going to debut in
February for eight hundred and
ninety-nine dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
