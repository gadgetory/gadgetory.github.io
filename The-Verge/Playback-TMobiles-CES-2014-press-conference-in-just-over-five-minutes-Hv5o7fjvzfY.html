traveling Europe in this case I think
I'm gonna have to help Jeremy oh do you
guys take checks this is ridiculous
let's go to Vegas you didn't notice the
utilization of Macklemore on my entry
here I'm not you I just love
Macklemore his manager gave me tickets
and so I'm in there with Roger having
fun talking about tweeting in this
amount of humanity that is so big I've
never seen it circled me I mean no
this was four gigantic human being my
CFO Braxton Carter hid in the bathroom
I'd only go to jail I mean it's been a
few months I don't feel like going back
I said can you can I just ask you are
you sure AT&amp;amp;T wants to kick me out she
said to me yes I spoke to the CEO of
AT&amp;amp;T and she wants you to leave huh I
don't know thank you very much for that
viral response to my treatment I was
placed in the New York Post slightly to
the left of the question as to whether
Kim Kardashian's selfie was photoshopped
and right above former governor Spitzer
being caught sucking someone's toes in a
topless tough where is Roger you ever
take another goddamn picture of me I'm
gonna shoot you wouldn't it be fun if
writing now I did the Michael whatever
his name is thing off to the less those
of you that were here last year it
started here with some connection that I
saw with all of you and with customers
that this industry blows now that was
then and there's a visit now but in
order to talk about the now let me just
do one second on each of my friendly
competitors if you don't mind let's
start with Verizon if you think about it
we grew up thinking the family plan was
a nice thing to give a family they all
sat together they got lower prices and
it was good for everybody that is total
horseshit
okay sprint by way just some a lot some
ala summarize them as an impaired brand
right now with a network capability that
won't be here for a while customers
should be able to leave and when it
turns out to be whatever they're gonna
have that beams up Scotty then go back
AT&amp;amp;T
AT&amp;amp;T is a total source of amusement for
me because they are the one that takes
my this is the part where you
 your pants rugged so how many net
ads for t-mobile in 2013 4.4 million
that has made us the fastest-growing
wireless company in the u.s. now I can
tell you what's going to happen from
here when we announce the next few
things we are either gonna take over
this whole industry or these bastards
are gonna change the whole industry is
going to shift and we will still be
highly successful and I don't give a
goddamn either one of those things if
everybody switched to t-mobile from
Verizon Sprint and AT&amp;amp;T the savings for
customers would be twenty billion
dollars now a fun part about this is
that right now I am going to send a
cease and desist letter to AT&amp;amp;T to stop
their advertising to say there the
faster you how many billboards they're
gonna have to take down and because it's
just not true anymore this is gonna
change things completely and there's no
tricks there's no trickery
problem solved anybody wants to switch
now can't so what you're gonna see now
is 1.645 million customers came in q4
but we've only been doing uncarrier for
eight months which means tons are locked
into contracts here's some scary stats
forty percent of families say they would
move if somebody paid their early
termination fees and by the way AT&amp;amp;T
customers come over to this plan and if
it doesn't work they'll pay you to come
back it's beautiful
hey John there there's increasing
speculation that you guys might be
acquired by Sprint or somebody else
could you talk about how that might
affect customer decisions to take you up
on some of these shipping offers yeah I
mean obviously you know that and the CEO
of a public company
drool and say you know we don't have
anything to say about that I have a
couple things to say about it actually
there are options for the industry in
the future then our consolidation
capabilities that would provide
significant scale and capability but I
believe what we are in any of those
equations is a brand a focus on the
consumer a change agent a maverick in
the industry that I believe the United
States feels is extremely important so I
think what we're doing in any scenario
will prevail anybody ever go sing
