today we're taking a look at the new
Samsung gear fit 2 this is the first
update to the activity trackers from the
original one was launched in 2014 and
there are some new features with this
one so let's take a look so the first
thing you're going to notice about the
Samsung gear fit 2 is that it's bigger
than the first one this is a 1.5 inch
Super AMOLED display and Samsung said it
was designed that way so that you don't
have to sort of twist your wrists around
to see information if you're looking at
it like this you get a full display of
info it's also a lot softer than the
original band that one was it's kind of
stiff and inflexible on the underside
here you have optical heart rate sensors
so it'll take your heart rate
intermittently throughout the day and
also show your active heart rate when
you are active
it is a touch sensitive display but you
can't touch it to wake it you have to
use the physical buttons and a side here
to wake it and then you can swipe
through swipe to the left and you get
more specific information and you can
add more to it apparently for now one of
the things that you can add to it is a
Spotify app it's really the only
third-party app that will run on this
and that's for music control from your
phone so one of the things that Samsung
has added to the Samsung gear fit 2 is
the ability for it to automatically
recognize when you've started exercising
because you basically don't have to go
into any menu and hit start to start an
exercise or stop it you can just start
running and cycling and it's also great
for sleep trapping because it means you
don't have to toggle into some type of
sleep mode and remember to do that
before you go to bed another pretty
notable addition to the Samsung gear fit
2 is that it does have GPS onboard so
runners will greatly appreciate that
Samsung says you should get about 3 to 4
days of battery life with this and up to
5 in standby mode which means it's just
tracking steps nothing else Samsung says
it's also as waterproof as its newer
Samsung Galaxy phones so in terms of
compatibility what will the band work
with well it will work with Android
phones that are running Android 4.4
later unfortunately though it won't work
with iOS devices so if you're an iPhone
user you're out of luck it also won't
sync the data to any type of desktop
application but you can use it as a
standalone device if you don't have an
Android phone you'll just have to look
at all the information on the fitness
fans
itself in terms of availability Samsung
says this will ship sometime early this
summer it will cost $179 now that is a
little bit more expensive than some
lightweight activity trackers that you
could get not as expensive as a
SmartWatch though so kind of depends on
what you're looking for be sure to stay
tuned to the verge comm for our full
review of this eventually and also don't
