checking out LG's new V 30 premium
flagship phone Allah takes is one look
to know this is the nicest Android phone
that LG's ever made it's also one of the
most powerful but it loses one big thing
that power users might really care about
but let's start with the design the V 30
is covered in glass on both sides and
it's got a shiny metal frame in between
it's also got a big tall 6 inch quad HD
OLED screen that curves at the sides but
it's not as corrupt as the Galaxy S II
they still look a lot alike though now
the d30 s bezels are very minimal it's
got an 82% screen the body ratio and
it's also got every important spec
checked off Snapdragon 835 4 gigs of ram
wireless charging water resistance and a
headphone jack with a quad DAC that
audio files were loved LG has also
gotten rid of that awkward and gimmicky
second screen that was on the b20 and I
say good riddance to that but right away
fans of the b20 will notice something
different about the back there's no
removable battery this one is a sealed
in 3300 milliamp hour battery and that's
got me a bit concerns since the via 30
is such a big screen Samsung used to the
same size battery for its new Galaxy
Note 8 but Samsung's last note burst
into flames sometimes so that's a bit
more understandable
thankfully the V 30 still has the dual
camera setup that LG is known for the
main 16 megapixel camera has an aperture
of f/16 so it's going to pull in more
light than just about any other
smartphone for those nighttime shots the
super wide angle 13 megapixel camera has
less distortion than ever and I really
like the unique perspective that it
gives you to me this seems like a better
use for a second camera than just a
portrait lens which is what Apple and
Samsung are using
penalty's putting a big focus on the
beat 30s 4k video recording features you
can apply professional color coding to
your foot it's right on the phone itself
and if you do prefer to edit on your
computer the p30 can record videos in
lock format to retain the most dynamic
range and detail the microphones inside
you can record audio and lossless
quality and they won't distort so if you
had a kind of person who records every
moment of a concert here's your new
phone the worst thing about the v30 in
my early experience continues to be LG's
software which hasn't changed much over
the last few years and remains an
eyesore the phone is running Android
seven nougat and this time LG has added
face unlock and voice unlock so you can
say okay google or come up with your own
phrase to unlock your phone face unlock
is pretty quick but don't count on it to
be quite as secure as Samsung's iris
scanning so here's the upshot if you
love using their phone to record and
create content which is what LG's V
series is all about and this might be
the phone for you we'll just have to see
how long that battery lasts when it
ships later on this year as for price
it's going to be pretty expensive this
is a flagship phone and to step above
the g6 but if nothing else that screens
got me excited for the pixel to excel
which is rumored to be manufactured by
none other than LG</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
