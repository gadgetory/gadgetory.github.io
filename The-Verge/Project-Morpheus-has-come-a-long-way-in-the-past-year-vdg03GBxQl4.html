tried out Sony's project Morpheus at the
2015 Game Developers Conference project
Morpheus got announced here for the
first time last year it looks pretty
similar so the question is is this
project Morpheus better than the one we
saw a year ago the answer is definitely
yes Morpheus is still weird and that one
of the things that makes it unique is
its ergonomics it fits on your head very
differently it feels a lot lighter this
means it doesn't feel quite as close to
your face but it also just sony has
designed a lot of things really well the
field of view I don't think is actually
wider than a lot of its competitors but
it feels rounder it feels a little bit
less goggles scheme and the optics are
just really beautiful it's incredibly
crisp is still you can see a little bit
of sort of screen door pixels but it
just looks beautifully smooth they've
been using move controllers since the
very beginning but the move controllers
are a lot better now this is the year in
which everyone tries to sort of figure
out how do we actually interact with
virtual reality and last year there were
three ly a lot of trouble trying to
actually track what you are doing but
now you can shoot a gun you can pick up
a phone you can use a standard sort of
Sony controller and everything is
tracked pretty well I'll be it not
across a huge amount of space Sony is
one of the first people to actually put
the are on a timer it wants to ship this
in this first half of next year
and it doesn't seem like it really has
many games so far with it right now
they're showing us some demos but
definitely have potential there's a
fantastic demo called London heist where
you're a jewel thief and you're shooting
with the move controller and you're
talking on your phone with one hand and
you're looking for something in a
cabinet with another so they definitely
have some interactions down but we're
going to be waiting over the next year
to see if they can actually bring any
games to this hardware that they've
spent so much time working on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
