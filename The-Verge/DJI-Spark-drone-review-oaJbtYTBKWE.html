this is really a drone for beginners for
somebody who's just getting into this
hobby when you're a starter with drones
there's four things you have to consider
the price the performance usability and
the portability the first and the
simplest price at $4.99 this is by far
the cheapest drone DJI has ever made the
Mavic which is just a little bit bigger
and arguably as portable is twice the
price at $1000 so if you're looking to
get into the Hobby but don't to spend
too much cash the DJI spark is the
easiest way to go the next big category
is obviously ease of use what's
interesting about the DJI spark is that
you don't need a remote control in fact
you don't even have to pair it with a
mobile app you can launch and land it
from the palm of your hand and control
its movements with some simple gestures
that makes it by far the most accessible
unit DJI has ever produced let's talk
about gesture control it uses computer
vision built right into the drone has to
see you with the camera and then it can
respond to your commands you hold in the
palm of your hand
DoubleTap the power button and it will
take off then extend your hand and you
can start controlling it like a Jedi
left/right up/down give it the
old-school movie picture move and it'll
snap a shot of you wave and they'll head
out to about 20 feet to take a more epic
aerial view you can wave it right back
in and it'll come land in the palm of
your hand this gesture control stuff is
really magical and in my experience
worked really well on the other hand you
are giving up the remote so if it works
ninety-nine out of a hundred times
there's going to be that one time you
accidentally wave and the drone starts
flying away indoors that's not good and
definitely terrifying if you're a
beginner you can also control the spark
right from the mobile app you get little
thumb sticks on the screen to fly which
works aw but it's definitely not ideal
the DJI drone also allows computer
vision for tracking subjects so draw a
little box around yourself and it'll
follow you in dodge obstacles and it has
a couple of cool pre-programmed shots
built in there that'll circle around you
fly away or do a michaelbay ask helix of
ever-expanding epicness
the other big thing when it comes to
ease of use is portability and the spark
is definitely the winner from DGI in
this category it's about the size of a
smartphone and the weight of a soda can
even with an extra battery it's still
weighs less than the mattock the spark
has a visual positioning system that
sees the ground below it and can hold
this position even without a GPS signal
it has rotor guards that snap on meaning
you won't lose an eye or a finger even
if you bump into it it's definitely the
kind of thing that's light enough to
take on a hike but off of the sort of
thing you could fly indoors at a family
gathering the next big thing we care
about with a drone is performance for me
that always starts with battery life
small drone small battery the spark is
rated for about 16 minutes on a full
charge and with aggressive flying or
strong winds you're looking at more like
10 to 12 minutes now the nice thing
about the spark is that you can charge
it on the go with microUSB something you
might have lying around for a smartphone
or tablet the small size of the drone
definitely makes it convenient but it
can be a problem when their strong winds
you can see the spark fighting to
maintain its position and because it
only has a two axis gimbal you're going
to see some of that movement in your
video footage the spark has some
intelligent flight features built right
into the software it can automatically
follow you and avoid obstacles while
headed forward and it can pull off some
fancy pre-programmed cinematic shots but
remember you're only connected to the
drone over Wi-Fi so range is going to be
an issue two times when I was using
these pre-programmed shots the drone
lost connection in the middle of doing
its fancy michaelbay move that was ok
the drone knew what to do went to a safe
height return home and landed but if
you're a beginner with a drone a few
hundred feet in the air and you lose
connection that can be terrifying
the spark can shoot 12 megapixel stills
and 1080p video that's good enough for
Instagram but obviously not professional
grade of course for $4.99 the same price
is this part you can also get the DJI
phantom 3 you'd have a lot more range in
battery life much better video quality
and a 3 axis gimbal for that price it's
really about the drone that fits your
lifestyle what's crazy about DJI drones
is how quickly they've been getting
smaller in size the phantom 4 came out
in November of 2015 6 months later we
got the Mavic which is about half the
size and weight of a phantom a year
later and we have the spark which is
half the size and weight of a Mavic at
that rate by this coming Christmas we
might see something more like this a
tiny little quadcopter with a camera
inside the spark has a lot of powerful
features that rival much larger more
expensive drones it's not a toy that
absolutely anybody can fly but it's
definitely the closest we've come yet to
the perfect starter drone something
accessible easy to use that anyone can
pick up and get great results with even
if they know nothing about how to fly
