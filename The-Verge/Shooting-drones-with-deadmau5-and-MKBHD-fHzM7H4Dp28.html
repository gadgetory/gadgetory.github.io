man with very particular tastes he likes
things fast high-tech and a little bit
out of control
inside the mansion a stuffed moose
sports a top hat a colossal chrome rifle
adorns the wall dozens upon dozens of
knobs panels and plugs help him craft
those special sounds oh and drums lots
and lots of drums I was here to meet
deadmau5 along for the ride with Sam
Shepard the verge of social media
mastermind as well as our friend marques
Brownlee or his Internet knows him mkbhd
neither of these guys had ever flown
before
smells like New Jersey hidden out here
in his newly built home is EDM artists
Joel Zimmerman better known as deadmau5
that's me opening the door not dead nice
is into tinkering recording songs
driving fast cars and flying drones you
know like anyone else I I started out of
course just grabbing a fan I'm getting a
feel for it and then you know realizing
how easy it is to control because you
know the thing that we kind of I had my
reservations about we're you know dudes
that fly fixed-wing aircraft and stuff
like that you know I'm like ah man you
gotta be we're remodeling excuse us and
you know they be flying those things and
you know is so sensitive on the joystick
but those guys like you just drop the
remote you know and it's like oh and
it's good I'm like okay and I got really
comfortable with that so then I just
figured you know I might as well just go
for it and then try the 1,000 but then
more op now was like oh maybe I'll just
take the the phantom with the zenmuse on
it because I could just get it out of
the car and rip it up bro you know
whatever and that's like kind of a knob
I would be scared to fly the US I still
get a little freaked out
well he does have some very big and very
expensive toys Joel was really
interested in flying the newest of the
new gji is recently released inspire one
quadcopter alright this is are you
playing dramatic music and I'm just like
also don't don't include the math music
my wife told me not to do that the
inspire one takes the big lead features
at the s1000 and combines them with the
run-and-gun nature of the phantom
resulting in a unique drone at a new
price point so I've flown the DJI
phantom before but this is my first time
flying the inspire one everything has
been pretty much the same the way you
turn it on the way you get the
controller connected and now I'm going
to try and take off and not break this
incredible machine
so I'm piloting right now and marques is
on the gimble operating the camera it
definitely is a lot faster and a lot
more powerful feeling than the Phantom
the controls are super easy because I'm
only using one of them for camera
control so up-down left-right I
basically can follow everything with one
finger so I'm going to go up a little
bit and as you see when I go forward and
then stop it kind of pulls back like
it's throwing on the brakes which is a
cool feature doesn't drift the inspire
one at least for now does lack a lot of
the autonomous features found in many of
the drones on the market you can't set
white points or have the drone
automatically follow you both huge
features we recently saw at CES it does
however feature an optical sensor facing
directly down allowing it to fly without
GPS making it much safer for flying
indoors first we decided to see if it
can keep up with Joel's ATV and a few of
his other toys
it makes you feel like a kid again yeah
I was gonna say like growing up we went
through a bunch of RC cars and you use
it for like you know few weeks few
months and then it's like the battery
dies whatever but this is like completed
football game because flies having that
fair dimension to just literally explore
see what you can do with it I think
that's the age and people like that a
lot I could see this doing real well in
like sight surveying construction I mean
we were like hella wanting some Tim
Hortons coffee this morning and there
was nobody here and if you had that it
could just be like go to Tim Hortons and
come back and it came back with the
coffee that's a world that's like oh
that world is five years away Amazon is
like testing that right now yeah I don't
know man I'm like I'm so 50/50 on the
fence of whether this is just like a
hype thing that's just gonna be fun for
a hobby kind of is it just a fad where
one's like oh I need one and then most
people get one or like actually only
crash it you don't buy another one
yeah cuz you have to be willing to crash
it and then repair like that's gonna
happen to you it's kinda like an RC car
I've never flown anything at all before
today but I'd been like a huge fan of RC
cars and just racing little cars around
and basically like the fact that these
are so user-friendly helps a lot where
you add that axis but it's not a big
distraction because you still have full
control it still breaks for you it still
stops so much less of a pain in the ass
to land of your back
that's not a drought go go like over the
over that shed not towards the road this
is a how we deal with unidentified
flying drones on my property
take it up a bit Oh
think I can get it first time
one shot one kill
damn like that was a good one in a
million that was awesome
drones are getting cheaper more powerful
and more ubiquitous everyday yet no
licensure training is required to fly
them the technology has clearly outpaced
the law recently after one crashed onto
the White House lawn
President Obama basically acknowledged
there are no regulations in place I've
actually asked the FAA and a number of
agencies to examine how are we managing
this new technology because the drone
that landed the White House you buy and
RadioShack I mean I have no confidence
in the FAA doing the right thing and
obviously they busy they're either gonna
shut it down or nothing right you know
and they can't shut it down it's too big
you can't put the genie back in the
bottle like everyone already has these
crazy powerful units but there are it's
hard to imagine a legal framework where
we could keep what we have with and also
stay safe well that's that's gun control
101 you know we can't stop people from
armed robbery but we still have gun
stores and you can still get one you
know with the sufficient paperwork maybe
just some basic training and then when
you get certified your unit or your
remote or your control apparatus is you
know obviously down to your unit and you
have a tag or a chip and then that lets
you so you would be liable and you have
to ensure that unit for any dumbassery
like homeboy at Yellowstone Park you
know it's like whoops you know we'll
technically it's it's legal because you
know it didn't say I couldn't you know
what I'm like well you're a dumbass and
yeah you spend like 10 hours on the
flight simulator to get your
certification you're flying it the FAA
knows who you are and where you are and
if you crash like they can take care you
know what I mean it's if an incident
happens you smack it into a building and
you know freak out an old lady or
whatever you know then that's that's you
responsible for that not not the
community not drones just you you know
because you're an idiot
in the meantime flying drones is an
airborne Wild West with pilots writing
most of their own rules deadmau5
wouldn't have it any other way</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
