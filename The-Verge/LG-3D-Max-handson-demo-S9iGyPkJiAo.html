looking at LG's latest 3d handset the
Optimus 3d max now it bears a striking
resemblance to the old Optimus 3d and
there's a very good reason for that it's
basically the same phone it's being
billed as the world's thinnest here at
nine point six millimeters but the
screen really looks and feels exactly
the same to me as the Optimus 3d that
I've used before you can press the hold
press and hold the button on the side
label 3d here to get into what they call
the 3d space and if you own an optimus
3d the screen looks very familiar to you
I know unfortunately you can't really
appreciate the 3d effect on this video
here but but hopefully you get from a
vague idea of what they're trying to do
with this carousel and and the effect is
very similar to other eye glass free 3d
phones that you may have seen or used in
the past it's this lenticular effect so
the the resolution is notably decreased
you have kind of a bar a vertical bar
effect across the screen and if you go
like this with the phone you're going to
get some some some artifacts as you go
from side to side but that's to be
expected it's no different from any
other lenticular display so another cool
feature is the ability to upconvert 2d
games into 3d and the effect is
surprisingly convincing here we have
Angry Birds and you're used to seeing it
in 2d but it's actually really
convincing the sprites the platform are
very clearly invisibly in front of the
background of the game there are four
capacitive buttons along the bottom
which kind of gives you an indication
that this was designed from the start
for android 2.3 and indeed it is running
Android 2.3 out of the box however LG is
promising an ICS update so hopefully
we'll see that sooner rather than later
on back you have the two camera lenses
so that you can capture 3d video and
stills LED flash in the center
and and that's about it certainly not as
attractive a device as the 4x or even
the l7 but if you're dying for 3d I
glass free 3d and a phone this is the
latest and greatest option so that we
have the Optimus 3d max from LG</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
