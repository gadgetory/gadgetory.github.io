viewfinder and moved much of the control

fully compatible with the new camera the
USM is coming in October it'll cost
eight hundred dollars with the kit lens

will indeed have a new smaller 19 pin
dock connector port that jives with
rumors we heard last month and one of
the reasons cited is that the headphone

device all your old stereo docks be
damned how much would you pay for a
high-quality android game apparently
less than a dollar dead trigger a zombie

cents but according to developer
madfinger the piracy rate even then was
quote unbelievably high no word on how
it plans to monetize the game but the
iphone version still cost 99 sets and
it's great you should buy it and finally
twitter is set to be the quote official
