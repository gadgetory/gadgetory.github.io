verge and I'm here with the Visio CT 15
a no-nonsense beauty of a thin and light
ultra book PC at three point nine six
pounds and point six eight inches thick
it's a slim trim machine despite the
fact that it has a 15.6 inch screen and
it looks even slimmer than it actually
is
thanks to the beveled black edges that
recede into the bottom of the frame you
don't get a lot of ports on this machine
with just a couple of USB 3.0 sockets an
HDMI jack and a headphone port but you
do get a core i7 processor a 256
gigabytes solid-state drive and a
beautiful screen the IPS screen has wide
viewing angles deep blacks and generally
looks crisp clear and fairly bright but
unfortunately the rest of the videos
accouterments cants white seal the deal
the keyboard is extremely shallow and
yet you need to press down hard on the
stiff keys to get them to actuate
reliably the touchpad feels good at
first with perhaps just a little bit too
much friction to its textured surface
but you soon realize that gestures lag
including ones as simple as tap to click
last but most assuredly not least and
the reasons why you wouldn't want to
pick the CT 15 is its battery life we
got about three hours and 20 minutes on
our verge battery test and about the
same in real world use it may be called
an ultrabook but without the portability
to match it's a hard sell despite the
lovely screen and eye catching design of
the CT 15 I can't really recommend it to
you unless you're looking to go for the
$900 version and settle for its faults
but we do have high hopes for the Vizio
C and 15 another Vizio laptop with the
same design and screen but with a
quad-core processor nvidia graphics and
the ports that the CT 15 lacked</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
