reporter and overall camera nerd here at
the Burge hey I'm James BAM I'm the
photographer Cameron hood and I just did
the features of the first lady always
hit the one-up me I'm here comparing the
brand new Galaxy s7 edges camera again
so it's probably the leading camera up
until this thing the iPhone 6s plus so
we've been out shooting on the streets
of New York with these we're going to
take a look at some of the results that
we got so we went out onto the streets
of New York wanted to put these cameras
really through their paces first one was
how fast are they yeah so the camera on
the galaxy s7 edge launches extremely
fast samplings been doing the double tap
the home button to launch the camera for
a little while now but the s7 it's
faster than ever and so we gave
ourselves a little bit of a contest here
of these taxis going through the
intersection down in the West Village
and I was basically waiting for taxi to
hit the crosswalk as soon as they hit
the crosswalk I'd take my phone out and
try to take the picture as quickly as
possible or trying to get the taxi in
the middle of the intersection and you
can see here with the iPhone this is the
best that was able to get I tried a
couple different times right the iPhone
you have to pull out of your pocket you
have to hit a home button or the power
button and then slide the camera icon up
and then you got to wait for the camera
to punch and then you can take this off
how long is this whole process going to
take that's like two seconds two or
three almost I mean was enough that I
almost missed this taxi takes me that
long to find it and then let's skip to
the Samsung image here and I caught it
almost back at the line Wow so that's
probably like four feet yeah and I mean
we're working with a wider angle lens
which we'll talk about in a bit on the
Samsung I wasn't able to get that taxi
in the shot with the iPhone the Samsung
is also faster to focus - you're messing
around with that the auto focus on the
Samsung
notices when new things are in the frame
it does a better job of guessing what it
is you're trying to take a picture of
whereas the iPhone still has to hunt for
that focus it feels a lot like an older
contrast action autofocus on a camera
what are you talking about some of the
images yes so this is just some general
details and raindrops on flowers and
both of them are pretty similar I mean
this is the iPhone image here we've got
really good detail but there's a lot
going on it's also we put we
deliberately put the trees in the
background so sometimes the autofocus
will come through it will actually try
and focus through the screen but no real
problems for either camera on this No
one big thing about samsung's new camera
is that both the front and the back
camera are f 1.7 the brightest lens you
can find on a smartphone right now
iPhones working with that 2.2 so that's
a big difference not just in the amount
of light that I let in but also in the
depth of field so we took this picture
of this tiny little jug did a little
small as bottolota guys that we found on
the street and I think these two images
are actually pretty similar it yeah it
almost looks like there isn't much
difference here you can see some color
difference and everything but as far as
depth of field that didn't look terribly
different but the big difference comes
with these images of the cobblestone you
know the background here is actually
relatively InFocus you can make out that
grille over there on the band I should
just point out here you know this is red
paint yes but if you I mean if you look
up here you can see you can make out the
grille in this red van up here right
it's much harder to make that out on the
Samsung yeah because it's got that
really shallow depth of field and you
clearly see the line of focus on this as
well yeah and Lily going across the top
I really like the Samsung yeah here
so now let's go we're gonna shift into
some low-light photos because this is
basically where most people take their
photos if you're not outdoors than
they'd like you're in a bar or in your
coffee shop or it's nighttime this is a
really challenge this is probably the
worst the iPhone did out of all the
things you have tried and we should
point out here that we couldn't really
see this without the picture yeah we
were in the dark on dark on dark so this
is actually much lighter than it looked
at the time yeah it handled itself
relatively well considering it was pitch
black almost yeah back on us in this
coffee shop it's a world of difference
whether the Samsung hear that difference
from f 2 point 2 to F 1.7 the iPhone one
there's not really much to work with it
looks yeah kind of awful the one from
that 7 is zoom into that you actually
have some detail yeah you can see the
sort of the individual swirls and
absolutely love the cappuccino and the
s7 edge is optical image stabilization I
think that helped this image as well
really strong but it has to this point
there's a point here because the lens on
the Samsung is wider mmm and there's
that corresponding rule that the white
of the lens the slower the shutter speed
can be before you see the shape another
big deal also in low-light is food
images yeah I think both of them perform
pretty well considering again we're in
really awful lighting situation that's a
really awful food picture yeah and this
one's not too much better again a lot
yet more yellow Samsung image this this
is amazing because you can clearly see
that there was a very similar focus but
this is back focused a bit because if
you go to the front down here this is so
you can see the softness here yeah and
then so the focal plane is actually
midway through and we get close to the
iPhone it handles itself pretty well but
that seemed crisp Detailers yeah here
it's definitely a lot muddier than the
same but the funny thing is it gives if
you zoomed out the overall impression is
that the picture is sharper but if you
zoom in right it's kind of they're close
but it doesn't have the Christmas to the
Samsung good so another coffee photo
another popular picture that people
would take again and challenging light
yep I think this time the iPhone
actually wins out yes
the Samsung much more contrasting like
we saw on the
that car right much better color in the
iPhone foot the interesting thing though
is there's two rules to come here
because if you're just gonna shoot
publish then the iPhone is definitely
better however if you were going to
shoot publish from the Samsung phone and
you want it just to play with it a
little bit with some you know some
adjustments you actually have again more
shadow detail to play with right and we
see this in this next extra to there's a
lot more detail in the shadow on the
Samsung whereas the iPhone handles the
color better yeah but it definitely
darkened out the blacks so it's kind of
locking into saying this is what the
picture is going to look like whether
you want it to or not right let's move
to front-facing cameras because
obviously selfies either video thank you
the iPhone again f 2.2 lens on the front
five mega mega pixels Samsung is five
megapixel as well but F 1.7 you actually
put everything in focus I had it far
enough away from the sort of minimum
focusing distance the resolution is the
same but the Samsung looks much better
right if you go to the Samsung one again
it's wider but look at the color it yeah
it just seems sharper and there's just a
bit of bit more contrast now a little
bit closer a little harder your Telugu
yes definitely a cooler image from the
Samsung but also it kind of missed the
focus a little bit so it shows it can
kind of go again one way or they own
back a little bit yeah and then a
low-light example of the front-facing
camera this is a truly horrible picture
by anything about that that is I
couldn't possibly take a whispered
iPhone brighter Samsung much flatter
image G out sharper image but you really
see how much wider it is yeah so for
that front-facing camera you're just
going to get a lot more in yeah and then
lastly here we have some just you know
always got to get a flower shot in here
we've got a lot of bright colors this
was actually shot indoors and some more
challenging light so this is the iPhone
more saturated colors focus isn't quite
as good actually had a lot of trouble
getting it whereas the Samsung is
actually able to nail it again you know
honey that if you compare the
straight-up picture the iPhone
definitely looks better but thinking
about well how we could great I can
grade this what I could do to it right I
actually have much more choice example
now another big thing with these two
cameras is obviously video in Samsung
like the iPhone can both not shoot 4k so
we put both phones right up against the
big window in the High Line here in New
York looking down there's not a ton of
difference here the iPhone is definitely
a flatter image over here and the
Samsung a little crisper a little more
contrasting and definitely a touch
warmer yeah now both cameras can also
shoot really slow motion 240 frames a
second so up upwards of five times
slower
Cleanser 10242 times cut and you did a
quick test here just sort of chasing
down some pigeons because there are lots
of them here in New York and if you
really want to go deep on it the Samsung
stock camera app has a manual mode and
you can go in and change the shutter
speed to change the ISO you can change a
lot of stuff whereas on the iPhone you
can't really change much and what you
can change has been buried in the
settings menu if you want to even just
change the frame rate to shoot slow
motion or shoot 4k you can't do that in
our app anymore which is really really
frustrating so I think we were all
expecting the s7 edges camera to be
better it's basically at this point a
generation ahead of die phone 6 where
the end where Apple is out with the
iPhone in general we're gonna really
need to wait to see the iPhone 7 to I
think to find something that's comprable
with s7 edges in that sevens camera and
I think the results sort of proved it
today I mean it's sort of an informal
test we're here on a laptop we're not on
a big monitor anything but from what you
can tell on the phone in on the laptop I
mean I gotta say you know I do not like
Samsung software never have but as far
as the app goes you just can't fault it
and the pictures speak for themselves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
