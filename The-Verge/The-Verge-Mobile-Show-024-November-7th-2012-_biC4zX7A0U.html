are we're trying something new it's
exciting it is episode 24 we can
remember fifth I am dieter bohn i'm dan
seifert and i'm chris sigler and here we
are on hang out and it's yeah we're
chillin we uh we heard your complaints
and your we heard your love for that
making a complaint seems we buffering
for some people yeah we figured we would
give you something else to add to your
complaint list we're live sure we're
live if we're not live whatever will be
live eventually so yeah so we're trying
the new thing and it worked well for us
once before and hopefully it'll work
well again and we are alive and so we're
just going to spend the next 20 minutes
or so talking about the fact that we're
using hang out and stuff I would like to
say that hangouts is making it much
easier to interject and interrupt
whatever your train of thought was
dieter so so plus one for that and
apparently I'm fully an HD and no longer
grainy and fuzzy which is amazing can I
before we start talking phones can I
just make an important point so kylie
minogue has a new album out and I was
just sampling it a few minutes ago and I
have to say it is not very good it's
called the Abbey Road sessions which
first of all invoking the Beatles when
you're kylie minogue is probably not the
best move but it is not i don't
recommend i mean if you have you know
Spotify or RT or whatever I guess you
know check it out but I wouldn't buy it
I would not spend a dime I this
particular it does not get the Christie
glar stamp of approval apparently maybe
it's a concept album where like it act
that the album actually syncs up
perfectly with a movie like I'm
imagining watching fast and the furious
while listening to this kylie minogue
album what does she do any any Abbey
Road cover
is there like any beatles covers at all
on it i I don't know Dan I only made it
to tracks in before I couldn't take it
anymore uh but I would like to suggest
you you guys uh you know flats not here
so I guess we can't get the full quorum
but we should start every mobile show
with an album review really yeah I just
reviewed Kylie Minogue's Abbey Road
sessions and next week it's it's one of
your turns to to review and album so get
ready I'm throwing that out there um
sweet I what phones now I guess can I
make a kind of make a visual joke you
may its Lumia 920 oh god it's somebody's
everybody's making fun of me for not
being able to lift the Lumia 920 I can't
believe you still haven't sent that to
me I asked you to send that phone no no
no no no no no no no no no no no that is
a lie I offered to send it to you and
you refused because you said you did not
want the black version you only wanted
cyan version i would i would definitely
prefer that I go to corroborate dieter
story Chris poo-pooed all over the black
version because all he wanted to see was
site in look I would definitely prefer
the cyan version but getting trying the
cyan version out of Josh's hands is akin
to lifting the entire world it's not
possible it I don't have the strength or
the mental power to do that so I think
that I mean maybe I can still get that
black version from you then eventually
dieter ya know I can i can send it to
you that's totally gonna happen yes I
just negotiated a phone live on the air
in exchange for nothing apparently I was
feeling really down in the dumps after
listening to that kylie minogue crap but
now I'm feeling much better about life
you know you just see you could see it
in your face and since your faces in
such high definition on this new google
hangout um you know you can really see
how it
end up your day getting that uh that
Lumia 920 it is right everything's
brighter except the room that I meant
which is still better now we can talk
about thumbs for real so what do you
guys want to know i mean i wrote a you
know a big review in collaboration with
josh and thomas and Vlad I think made it
was a whole lot of people had input on
this thing and you know we gave it a
score it's there's there's a lot I can
say about it still I think it's I think
it's the best Windows Phone device i
like it slightly better than the x
despite how you know heavy it is and i
do want to point out that just because
it's heavy like that's that's not
necessarily the worst thing ever i mean
it's it's a big chunky phone and it's
like it feels really dense but i mean
the thing I said about the overall
design of it is you kind of I don't know
you kind of learn to have an affinity
for it you kind of start to feel like I
don't know defensive of it in a certain
way um because you feel bad for nokia or
because there's legitimate reason to
feel defensive about it no because it's
it's legitimately good Hardware
legitimately feels good in your hand so
you're feeling defensive about the
design of the phone or the phone in
general well both and I think that the
the the well I don't know if defensive
the right word like it's like I've used
a couple of inappropriate metaphors to
describe it but it's like you've got a
slightly embarrassing uncle but you love
him you know I'm really well and like
you could totally overlooked the things
that other people can't and so you might
make fun of them every now and then
yourself but you don't really mean it
and you you mean it lovingly but if
anybody else makes fun of them you will
beat them down okay interesting it's
kind of like when you tease your kid
brother and yeah like you know someone
else comes along and teases your kid
brother and you just you know aren't
gonna stand up for that yeah yeah so the
the thing with the 920 though is like I
mean aside from the you know the weight
issue that might be a prob
for some users the hardware is is pretty
fantastic right like it looks great and
it's the same design that we've seen on
the since the n9 and then the Lumia 800
and the 900 and we've liked all of those
designs yeah so it's the same thing and
it's got a much nicer display and I see
I see me now and and you know much ice
to display and it's refined and and
things like that so I mean there's I
think little to complain about with the
hardware itself yeah so I mean the
there's two reasons that it's ostensibly
so thick one is the wireless charging
and two is the the PureView camera which
is mounted on Springs and we have talked
at length about it and so I need to
address there's been a lot of complaints
about our review score and I want to
address we gave the the camera and ate
at the end of the day and part of the
reasons like it's incredible in low
light it's pretty amazing but it also
doesn't match what you see on the screen
or what your human eye sees and not
everybody takes photos in near darkness
right you just most of the time you're
just taking photos and when you're just
taking photos you kind of need to know
exactly what you're going to get exactly
what it's going to do and it takes I
don't know I would say more effort than
I would like out of a camera phone so I
just took a picture of this yellow
coffee cup and you know it it looks a
little bit washed out relative to the
actual color of the yellow coffee cup
and you know it might be technically a
little bit more true but like it takes a
little bit more effort to get it to feel
like a great camera great photo you know
in my and that that you know and I think
that reading other reviews are on the
web and you know talking other people at
the verge and other people at the build
conference which I went to last week
with Tom you know that that opinion
seems to be pretty Universal that the
camera has got some amazing technical
things that it does but that doesn't
necessarily make it an amazing camera
for most people in a way it kind of
feels like a like a you know a high-end
SLR where you know in in the wrong hands
you can take some really terrible
picture
with it but if you know what you're
doing you can do you know good things
with them right yeah I was going to make
the point that uh we had discussed the
camera quite a bit before publishing the
review and it seemed to be like if you
are really into photography and you want
to tweak your photos after the fact the
the 920 produces a great base to start
with but just to for most people the
photos that come Adam it just straight
out of the camera on the phone and are
being shared or whatever aren't quite
don't have that punch that you get from
other smartphone cameras that really
make them look impressive right away
yeah I don't know oh well can I just say
that that despite the fact that I don't
intend to really use this phone the
price is such that it's difficult to
justify not getting one doesn't mean it
they the 820 I mean both both on
contract and off contract prices are
extremely aggressive and and I suspect
that Nokia is selling because the off
contract price is so aggressive I can
only assume that Nokia is selling these
AT&amp;amp;T at or below cost I mean 454 the 920
350 tons be off for the 820 is out of
control to put things in perspective
that's only fifty dollars more than what
t-mobile is charging for an on contract
note 20 you know well it's funny because
if you look back to the 900 is the same
pricing scheme for the 900 i believe i
think on contract it was a hundred bucks
and then off contractor is 450 and at
the time when the 900 came out we could
say that the 900 had kind of last year
specifications right it had the slower
processor lower res screen and stuff
like that but the 920 he's got a modern
processor it's got a high res screen and
it's still only 450 off contract so I
mentioned this earlier today when the
pricing actually came out I was like you
know I really wonder what Nokia's
margins are on this particular with this
pricing yeah now what color would you
guys get I'm I wanted it like as you
guys know I'm a huge cyan fan but I was
talking to tom warren earlier today that
I'm a little disappointed that the cyan
is Matt know you should really happy
that I really do not like the colossi
versions at all I really look yeah I
just I just think they look kind of
cheap I I much prefer the mat and I
actually i think the scions cool but I
think the black fits with the aesthetic
of the phone really well it's just like
a you know I don't know I had a black
900 and it was boring either you know
it's like at the cyan is great and the
cyan is like you know I really cool
looking I really like that gray that
they showed off at launch um which I
haven't yet actually had chance to see
in person so I'll reserve final
judgement on that but that looked really
really short and ATT is not selling that
one as far as I can tell they're selling
black white red yellow and cyan yeah so
i'm sad i don't know why the great was
omitted that might be your only or
something yeah so yeah I'll probably end
up getting the cyan but I'm gonna take a
good hard look at yellow and red as well
I do want to you know briefly point out
that I'm windows phone 8 feels really
close the new kernel you know they've
got a whole new basis they're going to
be able to get much better apps and
hopefully more quickly and there's going
to be where be talking a lot more about
that you know after the work that Tom
did all at this bill developers
conference so you know stay tuned to the
verge for that but you know I've got a
few niggles I've got a few complaints
i'm still driven crazy by the lack of a
notification center but think so the
email app doesn't drive you nuts too i'm
ok with the email app it drives you nuts
because it breaks the threads when i
reply but I mean don't forget I mean I
feel like with as a gmail user and you
know we're all gmail users that were
sort of holding it to a artificially
high standard you know if you compare
the email app on windows phone 8 to the
non gmail email app on Android or if you
compare it to the email app on iOS you
know it's in that it's way better than
Android it's maybe not quite as good for
me as iOS but it's really close and part
of that might just be familiarity so I
you know is it's not great for Gmail
but I think that for you know exchange
users and people that aren't deep into
the you know Gmail way of thinking about
email it's totally possible there is one
great thing about the was just thinking
about this this morning because I've
kind of given in on iOS and I'm just
using the mail app now which is really
depressing thought yummy because I
fought the good fight for so many years
and I've just finally thrown at my hands
and said screw it and gone back to mail
but so the one thing that would be
really tough for me is the fact that
windows phone doesn't support it took
years we finally iOS does the delete
archive thing where you can choose
either one on a per email basis you you
press and hold on archive to bring up a
menu can choose the lead instead on
Windows Phone you can hack that on a per
email basis by you know the default
functionality is delete which you can
configure through google sync on how how
you want that behavior to work and then
you can override that to do an archive
by moving the mail into your all mail
folder but and the only thing that sucks
about that is that it's three taps you
know you'd actually you know what a
better solution is stop deleting email
in Gmail why would you delete anything
in gmail ever oh I don't know I get so
many PRS into my email box that yeah I'm
not a man you are Kaiser I might
whatever god of that right I'm not going
to allow junk stick around forever in my
inbox well you don't you get it out of
your inbox you are kind of it but it's
still in my account I don't want it I
want it to permanently be gone you're a
hoarder dieter I'm gonna take you to be
on the hit television disorders that's
probably true I wonder what my um my
gmail archive is up to how much space i
mean i love i love having my gmail
account i'm using all five gigs of her
gmail right now yes i love i love going
back to like my personal gmail account
and I've got 16 gigs of 2004 as not a 16
16 gig ative of email in my personal
account that's insane 16 that's right
what's up i'm using 3.7 gig of my verge
account so i'm definitely more efficient
know at why I'm harder with the delete
button than you are let's put it that
way yeah so yeah okay um I actually I do
want to point out one of the things we
did a report already out of build Tom
went to a session and so he from
Microsoft admitted that they were trying
to get notification center some kind of
no centralized notification center into
Windows Phone 8 and they just ran out of
time it blows my mind that Microsoft
actually admitted that and like that was
the reason that they gave it I mean this
happens all the time with software
development you run out of time and
you're not able to add all the things
that you want before your deadline that
you need to ship but you don't say that
publicly like so it just is like we're
gonna dieter go Gators just gone of
areas that was a little weird uh oh we
lost dan dan just quit this is falling
apart rapidly oh my god best laid plans
hey this is our very first hangout for
the Virgin Mobile show were allowed a
few flubs and allows you mistakes
problems will get will get Dan back
hopefully that's amazing windows phone
will be a lot nicer with the
Notification Center because you still
have this feeling like you're a little
bit not as like jacked in as I like to
feel on a phone because there's not a
single place you can go to see alerts
unless you add all those live tiles to
your home screen and remembering that
you added the live tiles and you know if
you miss a toast you know a little
notification from the top like oh what
was that I don't remember well my home
screen somewhere I don't know that's
exactly the thing I I'm countless
occasions while I was using the 8x i
would get presumably a text message but
maybe something else and you know that
they're all configured to make the same
sound and then by the time i look down
the toast is gone I don't know where to
go I don't know where to look so it's a
pretty big problem for them I think
yeah well and hopefully they'll fix it
and actually hopefully they'll be able
to fix it relatively quickly because
they're on this new kernel you know they
should be able to get stuff in there
more quickly click right quickly um so
okay so I mean you guys when I dropped
you talked about the pricing which
bonkers right yeah yeah I mean 450 off
contract for the 920's is out of control
and 100 bucks on contract I mean if you
look at so at a hundred dollars on
contract that the 920 is essentially
going head-to-head with the 4s on AT&amp;amp;T
and that's you know I always think you
know whenever nokia prices have fun
really aggressively my instinct is think
wow that's a really great deal until i
remember that there's an iphone at that
same price point then it becomes an
entirely different ball game and i'm not
i'm definitely not saying that that
people should just universally get the
forest instead of the 920 but you do
need to think long and hard about how
important app selection and up-to-date
apps are to you in your phone selection
process because i don't care what anyone
says microsoft will will swear up and
down just as they have since 75 that
they don't have an appt problem but they
still do they still do i can name uh at
the time I had at least five we talked
about this last week I can name out that
my head at least five apps that i like
to use on a daily or at least weekly
basis on my phone that are not available
on windows phone right now and are
significantly impacting my decision on
whether to use a windows phone is my
daily driver yeah well i mean yeah i
agree with all those points Chris but I
was just wanted to say with regard
surprising what's even more insane is
how the 8x is priced on AT&amp;amp;T because
it's a 199 for the 16 gig model and
that's yeah that's like kind of blow in
my mind that it be priced at that point
at that high I mean I think to both very
very good phones and if like I said in
the review if you're if you want to buy
into the windows phone ecosystem
I don't think either one's going to do
you wrong I think I slightly prefer the
920 but i think they tax is great
especially if you like 10 phones
although I mean we'll have to see what
it looks like in six months i mean the
the power button is still a huge hassle
for me right on the x yeah I'm 8x yeah
yeah yeah no they the 8x is is yeah I I
feel like I feel like they could have
made I feel like that the design team
could have literally spent Scott Croyle
at HTC is probably never going to speak
to you but but I feel like like his team
literally could have spent another like
week just you know tooling around with
the design of this phone and they would
have had like a a slam dunk / home run
depending on which sports metaphor you
prefer button instead it feels like
there it feels like the phone is eighty
percent of the way to where it needs to
be but in all aspects of the hardware
design and I mean that you know the
software is an entirely different story
but just speaking about the hardware
specifically it's it's you know it's
like they they started with the concept
that is a very solid concept and a good
concept particularly for conveying what
Microsoft is the message that Microsoft
is trying to convey with Windows Phone
in general which is the metro-style UI
and and you know they've talked about
the fact that the hardware really
mirrors then that's great but the the
detail bowls of that front of the 8x are
just not all there David David Pierce
our reviewer extraordinaire was just
talking about this as well he is not in
love with the 8x so finally I found my a
tech soulmate everyone else is telling
me that it's an awesome phone but David
and I are like this man he agrees with
me I guess the other sort of Windows
Phone related stuff that we should
mention on this was since our last
podcast right The Wall Street Journal
said that Microsoft is testing a
Microsoft built surface phone with Asian
suppliers already and we had heard that
they were considering making their own
windows phone but our sources tell us
than the Sam wrote that it would be
deployed as a plan B so basically if the
round of devices that are coming out now
flop and everybody kind of says peace
out Microsoft's then you know Microsoft
would have to go to loan and what's
planned see that's the next question
because because there is no guarantee at
this point that that the surface is
going to be the smash hit that Microsoft
well I mean I'm surprised doesn't need
to be a smash bag the surface right yeah
yeah note that as going to say the
surface I mean like it it feels like
Microsoft wants it to be a hit but when
you look at their their model for
selling it it can't be by definition
they're controlling the retail
experience very tightly on that device
so they're kind of limiting how broadly
it can it can reach evil in that first
place with the phone that couldn't be
the case I people are complaining about
hangouts look from now you guys in like
and we use skype you don't like movies
hang ups I think the next thing is we're
going to just individually go to each of
your homes yeah I know just to talk to
you face-to-face will fly out we'll just
do it listener by listener every week
and we'll just show up and you're like
it yeah I may have to I'm in give us
think think about all the miles will get
Chris you'll be a united premier member
or whatever with no no problem is at all
oh my god someone is ruined it we use
gotomeeting no no no no I just want to
say that we use gotomeeting for like
some internal stuff uh and and we all
hate it every single time we do and we
want to just you know not have such not
have a meeting what we're using
gotomeeting yeah every single person on
the verge team has at least one
gotomeeting Horror Story um yeah I don't
know so maybe this there's a huge
untapped market here you know somebody
needs to come up with the ultimate video
live video but a proud podcasting
solution and there's millions of dollars
just waiting to be made
oh man oh sorry it's just my Microsoft
that meeting Lotus live we could totally
okay all right I feel like we've spent
so much time like having this 920 sort
of be part of the discussion you know
now we know the price we know what's
coming out we know that it makes a tiny
little noise when you shake it because
of the camera and springs you know we've
got it here like is there anything else
that that we should say about it because
I feel like it's been such a big deal
now I feel like we've been we were
waiting holding our breath for so long
waiting for it to to get a release date
and you get a price and to come out and
then when it finally everything came
down aside from the crazy price it's
kind of like a actually can I just say
this this was announced was it it was
yesterday right the price and release
date yes yeah election day the like yep
why what like you make us wait and wait
and wait and wait and then you do
whatever you can to bury the news so
that like regular humans won't see it
classy move AT&amp;amp;T super classy spring
anything on being suggested it's now
hold on it's now being suggested that we
all get green screens and use the magic
with CGI to appear as though we're in
the same room together yeah you like
that that's well we do have all these
effects that we could apply but I'm
nervous to try any of them right now
because it'll be a mess well if you if
you apply any effects I think it's
you're going to lose your lower third
just just btdubs knows what you really
below a thorough I am we won't know who
you are where you are yeah right oh I
don't have my city in my lower third
anymore dang it where are you dieter oh
um alright so something else that like
needs explanation happen
today and this was 18 PS plan they're
gonna end landline phone service is that
the plan Chris you can you walk us
through this without letting anybody
freaked out that ATT is trying to murder
farmers or whatever well actually murder
farmers no um so the long and short of
this plan which they're calling what is
it called victory I p plus it has some
ridiculous name I can't even remember a
velocity IP something other project
velocity IP that's project velocity it
sounds like it's act like your
installment of the fast the furious
that's actually not a bad name or for a
film what they want to do here is a
decommission over the next few years the
legacy telephone network which still
traces its roots to the various I'm the
very same telephone network that's been
in use for the past hundred years more
or less they want to completely
decommission that so that they can go to
an all IP infrastructure in other words
they want every single thing that's
being transmitted over their network to
be a data packet which believe it or not
is not how it works right now when you
at the end of the at the terminus of the
connection in your home if you're using
a what they call a pots line plain old
telephone service it is usually the case
that that voice is transmitted to some
node as just voice and and they're
they're trying to you know there's
maintenance involving involved in in
keeping this network alive and it really
serves the only function that it serves
in the year 2012 is to be to is to act
as a fallback in times of emergency it's
self powered it has some other good
attributes it's been designed to sort of
stay up 99.999 percent of the time which
it has more or less done over the past
hundred years but it's time to go we did
this with amps and last decade and look
sells service which is obviously a much
smaller scale project and bringing down
pots which is the you know still remains
the single most ubiquitous network that
we have but it is time to go they need
to start diverting money and investment
into next-generation networks and what
really and so this this project velocity
IP is laying out their game plan for
doing this in combination with making an
appeal to the FCC for changing uh
basically 75 years of regulations that
prevent them from decommissioning the
legacy pots network starting with the
Communications Act of 1934 up through
the most recent major rewrite of that
policy to the Telecommunications Act of
1996 so what they need to do what the
process the process that they've started
today with an FCC filing is basically
appealing to them hey this is what we
want to do this is why we want to do it
but in order to do that we need your
help bypassing certain parts of these
really old laws meteorol rewriting their
parts of these laws and although it's
very very very easy to hate on AT&amp;amp;T I'll
be the first to admit this is a
surprisingly broadly supported
initiative public knowledge which is a
public interest group based in
Washington DC that often speaks out
against moves by AT&amp;amp;T and is a very
consumer friendly think tank uh actually
had some very warm words about this
initiative and I think that so that the
conclusion that we sort of reached in
our report that we put up on this today
is that through a combination of fairly
heavy handed FCC regulation and eighties
initiatives through this project there
is a way to dis Mart Lee and there's a
way to do it that won't negatively
impact uh folks in the most rural areas
who are normally the most ill served by
these like AT&amp;amp;T because it's not
profitable you're sending all this
infrastructure to extremely low density
areas where you just can't make any
money
and so historically those areas have
been subsidized by something called the
universal service fund which used to be
used and still is used to some degree to
subsidize pots and it's been updated
over the past few months over the past
year or so to cover broadband and so
that regulation which is due to the FCC
going to help cover parts of this
transition 18 key is saying right now
that when all is said and done
ninety-nine percent of their current
wireline footprint will be updated with
an all IP network that leaves the other
one percent in this nebulous gray area
what that is going to happen to them the
only thing AT&amp;amp;T will say on the record
right now is that they're not going to
leave any customers hanging whether
they're not angrily what that means it
doesn't matter too much though because
the FCC should theoretically have them
covered through the National Broadband
Plan and through what they call to
connect America fund and all this other
Simon there are plans in place and
projects in place there's money that's
already being diverted to cover these
folks this is something that needs to
happen and it's going to be you know the
analogy that I used in the piece is that
it's like ripping a band-aid off you
know we've been relying on this network
this pasta network for so long now that
it feels really weird to get rid of it
and there are still you know tens of
thousands advices that rely on it fax
machines modems uh you know lots of
different gateways and serves you no
burglar alarms that that don't work very
well over an IP network like if you
connect into like a vonage box or
something sometimes they don't work and
you know we'll need to get over that
hump but we could meet you know we can't
continue to pump money into maintaining
this ancient decrepit copper based
network this doesn't make any sense so I
think this is in the this is the right
step yeah so in the larger context like
a used to be when 18t have monopoly over
all of the telecommunications network
that part of the kind of contract they
made with America in order to get a
monopoly was that if they're going they
have to provide universal service
everybody has to they have to give
everybody a phone line
if they're going to get to keep their
monopoly well that monopoly is
theoretically gone it's gone uh it's not
a monopoly anymore anyway so that sort
of contract is now I guess null and void
but we still need to make sure those
people are covered and this you know
National Broadband Plan the the
iteration of the Universal Service Fund
is in theory the the solution for that
to cover that last one percent and so it
seems like there's no reason to panic
everybody's on the same page that
they're going to continue to get to the
gold universal service they're just you
know taking the step in that direction
we don't have the full picture yet is
that a fair way to think of this it is
yeah I think that if you look on paper
if all you do is look at what eighteen t
is proposing today and then you look at
the laws that are on the books right now
you say well wait a second what eighteen
t is proposing is violating dozens of
rules and that's true but the reason
that's true is because these rules are
ancient and they were written in a in a
pots world so the next year to two to
three years is going to be about taking
a very close look at the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 and
rewriting very large portions of it in a
way that makes sense for broadband you
know and that's how it has to happen
that that's something by the way that
has to happen regardless of whether 18
T's project is ultimately approved and
signed out by the FCC the act is in
desperate need of an update and and
chairman Genachowski has said before
that that's you know that's on his task
list that's honest to-do list so so
things are going to happen but we're
going to see some big big rules change
here over the next few years I guess the
speaking of a AT&amp;amp;T talk about the
wireless side they have a noun sir
they're gonna have a goal of hitting was
300 and 300 million cost about customers
with LTE by the end of 2013 it's yeah by
the end of 2014 oh yeah the prior
projection was 250 by the end of 2013
and they plan to add another fifty
million by the end of 2014 which is like
you know virtually the entire population
of the
States yeah so uh in 1880's release they
mentioned though there they've acquired
a whole bunch of spectrum through
various deals i think they mentioned
over 40 deals this year that they've
acquired spectrum from and they've got
the rights to an access to about 118
megahertz spectrum um in order to do
this rollout but the the whole thing
just is kind of like you know AT&amp;amp;T
pretty much said it couldn't do this
when it was trying to buy t-mobile um
but you know now it is so I mean III
guess yeah there's you know the the talk
to try and get their their interest push
through with regards to tmobile but you
know I'm glad to see that it's at least
going to happen even though ATT said
that it wouldn't be able to do it a year
ago the other thing that is a note here
is how far behind AT&amp;amp;T is from Verizon
Verizon Scott you know over 400 markets
already covered with LTE over 260
million residents by the end of this
year so Verizon's already a full year
ahead of AT&amp;amp;T LTE rollout yeah and by
the way it should be mentioned that the
LTE that 300 million number was was
mentioned part and parcel with the
project velocity IP it's it's all part
of a tts big picture of saying you know
we're gonna we're going to expand
u-verse to cover a bunch more people
we're going to connect a million
businesses to directly to fiber and by
the way we're also going to expend LTE
to cover three hundred million pops the
idea being that between those three
initiatives they're going to end up
reaching ninety-nine percent of their
wireline footprint with some form of
broadband data you know and once once
you have access broadband data you can
you can obviously do whatever you need
to with it you can turn that into you
know a virtual landline phone like you
know any number of web services bondage
whatever in fact 18-team mentions in its
FCC filing that they're planning for
customers that would be affected by the
loss of one line service they have
some product at and what they call it
where they just you know it basically
connects LTE and gives you you know
Leslie plug in a wireline phone right uh
what else what else happened this week
Oh HTC and Verizon have an event on what
November 13th annex Tuesday yeah we're
pretty much expecting it to be the droid
DNA from HTC this 5 inch monster of a
phone which we've seen we've seen
pictures leaked from evleaks we've got
you know we had hands-on with the j
butterfly which is the japanese version
presumably of the same phone it looks
pretty much like a lock yeah no it's
definitely going to be that I I still
don't I'm not a believer in this in this
phone as everyone here knows but I'm
anxious I'm excited for HTC and Verizon
it proved me wrong make me a believer
HTC tell me why I should want a 5-inch
1080p yeah I'm just like I don't get
like ok they're taking this giant phone
but like they refuse to put the One X on
their network to go head-to-head with
the galaxy s3 like Verizon is being so
aggressive about putting phones and
different slots and making sure you know
like they've got the razr HD and HD Maxx
and they've got the galaxy s3 another
putting this way up the high end now see
I don't even know if that story makes
sense though because they've got there
they did verizon take the note 2 yep
yeah it's got the note 2 so if this
makes HTC's like latest phones available
on verizon more quickly than that that
makes me happy but in terms of like
myself being interested in a phone this
big I mean I probably I don't know if I
don't know if Verizon so I think that
Verizon I don't know this personally but
I get the sense that Verizon likes to
throw its weight around with oh yawns
more than any other American carrier
including AT&amp;amp;T absalom and and what and
and so what that means is that you have
things like the droid brand which of
course is done by Verizon and it also
means that fries and I think
has a very heavy hand in designing
virtually every phone that comes onto
its network the only two companies that
it has capitulated to on that are of
course Samsung and Apple HTC has nowhere
near the weight that either those
companies have so I you know I think
that that verizon is still a little too
proud to just release a stock 1x on its
network even even Samsung's power is
limited because with the like didim
entered the note 2 for verizon's making
samsung etch its logo into the home
button which is just like one of the
most insane carrier customizations I've
ever seen so yeah I think you know what
you were saying is you know that is
that's a that's a that's a verizon tramp
stamp is what it's exactly what it is is
it is really inappropriate and I'm know
that the verizon is doing it sounded
like a good idea at the time after a few
drinks and after partying all night and
then you know the next morning yeah
exactly what happened yeah a damn need
Dan need and education we're out getting
drinks and then you know they had one
too many drinks and you know they woke
up the next morning in some strange you
know city and they're like what did we
do last night and JK Shin pulls his
phone out of his pocket but the verizon
logo ash to the body's like oh my god
what what did we do down exactly what
happened why Dan and Dan is just like I
don't know but we have the contract here
that stipulates that it's staying that
way yeah okay so so I'm pretty excited
to see this phone in person III really
want to see what a screen with you know
a pixel density of 440 PPI or something
insane like that I can't say that I
really want to I'm excited to use this
phone as a daily device just because it
is so large and I'm really nervous about
the power button actually being usable
with all
we've had with the a Texas power button
and this is even bigger and it's still
on the top of the phone so now the way
that you turn it on with it with the
phone that bag is you don't you don't
reach up with your finger to hit it you
just like bang it on your forehead like
you ought to use your phone and oh my
god that works like that totally network
but the problem that you can't even do
that with the a Texas power button even
a push first of all first of all it
would it would crack your skull because
of the shape second of all it's flush
with the edge yeah Wow um we want to
pour one out for verizon's App Store and
android and blackberry because it's
going away you know I think the three
people that use it are going to be very
upset the rest of us will be happy that
the stupid app is no longer on our phone
and it can actually like disappear at
verizon's actually removing the app
through a software update in the future
so that's that's pretty cool bit but it
was it was one of those apps that like
you couldn't remove in Android and you
know I can't remember if you could
remove it on a blackberry device but uh
it's just like one of those stubborn
carrier things that you know and
verizon's not alone because ett has its
own store and t-mobile is ridiculous and
even sprint as well as their own stores
and it's just like you know you're these
curated app stores are of no benefit to
to the actual end user they're just
there to sully serve the carrier's needs
so I'm more than happy to see you go
yeah agreed I'm not going to waste a
perfectly good battle of king cobra
pouring one out that's absurd Wow um
yeah you know what I'll save it i was i
was gonna talk tell a little story but
i'm not i will say that it was always I
think that these stores were confusing
or are confusing to some users and so
it's good that they're gone I mean it's
confusing to users and like if you buy a
nap through that store and say a like
say you're an Android user and you buy
an app through verizon store and then
you want to use it on your Nexus 7
tablet
you can so it's like you know it's
you're not doing anybody any any paper
purse with these steps or these app
stores I think the last thing before we
wrap up is we do have do with you we do
we sure do got them that they are
reviewed of Nexus 4 it's up on the side
it went up on November second Josh
Kowalski reviewed it do we do review
that we got that thing there during from
you I don't know what's happening right
now but it's really concerning me i
don't know if i can continue to podcast
with you guys if you're gonna sound like
that so look before before i go
completely off the rails on one of my
trademark grants why don't you guys talk
sensibly and logically about this phone
so actually i do want to say something
this phone has elicited a complete and
total existential crisis amongst i want
to say like seventy percent of the verge
staff at least and okay and we talked
about this I want to say last week when
you know Neil and I put up the editorial
about the lack of LTE and how it it we
you know it seemed to some people like
we're trying to apologize for Google
which was not at all I wanted to do it
is completely on google for peacing out
on this yet we talked about this last
week but you know this is a really good
phone that everybody wants to buy and
just like can't or won't because they
feel like they need LTE and like I would
say in our little you know internal chat
i would say twenty-five percent of the
stuff that we talk about now is every
day a different persons like okay guys
help me pick out a phone okay go oh yeah
the phone and Chris you did a forum post
like this is this is not my next about
it again yeah I way it was mainly in
responding was intended to be a direct
response to vlad's this is my next on
the 8x because theta X is most
definitely not my next but it kind of
turned into a dual purpose 8x and NASA's
for hate session I just felt I mean
looking at this phone and again you know
I mentioned this
the comments on my forum post I totally
reserve the right to just buy this phone
on a whim in a couple weeks and use it
maybe love it but from everything I've
seen up to including our review of this
device it is just not it is it is the
first Nexus device that has been
incremental enough to not really tempt
me at all well hang out yeah yeah I want
to set you back up it is is incremental
when compared to the other flagship
Android hardware that has come out in
the past you know three four months but
and the Galaxy Nexus no it's compared to
the audience it's way better discreet
way better the camera way better the
overall assessor the bass desire every
battery life the overall feel the build
quality right like the glass back is
like that gives me pause but like I
there is not a single thing that isn't
like oh yeah totally better except sir
like I'm LTE there there was likenesses
if you compare it to the GSM Galaxy
Nexus from last year there was like
three major complaints that people had
with it one the camera to the screen and
three the build quality and all three of
those were addressed through the nexus 4
so I mean it's it's like uh it's
definitely an upgrade um you know and
and it's frustrating that it doesn't
have LTE and i think that's that's
probably the more reason why you don't
want to upgrade to it or don't want to
purchase it Chris but to say it's it's
it's a it's a mediocre upgrade or an
incremental upgrade I think it's more of
an upgrade to the Galaxy Nexus then the
4s was to the iphone for the woman and i
was about to say that i think that the
four to the forest is a very good
analogy it has the same to me as the
same feel to it there you know it's it's
a it's a warmed-over Gallic the way I
described it was it's a galaxy nexus one
point one in feel it has helped us no no
no not not to feel I don't mean like
physically feel good is not sorry that
was a term no you're right you
definitely have me in the field
department look and and like I said I
serve the right to completely do a 180
on this oh you're going she will because
he just said earlier that four hundred
and fifty dollars was like you know
automatic buy it now territory for the
Lumia 920 but you know but then there's
mine funny that's a night morning which
by the way is LTE which gets me to the
real core of my argument which and and
somebody I can't remember who somebody
can warn me not to rant about LTE on the
Nexus 4 in this show but I'm throwing
caution to the wind here the fact is you
know I always hear people say well you
know most people aren't an LTE Marcus
blah blah blah that is a complete load
of yet okay we are now at at last count
verizon has over 400 LTE markets can you
name 400 cities in the u.s. any name 400
metro areas in the US now you can't so
the fact is the odds at right now uh if
you live in the United States odds are
statistically speaking that you live in
a verizon LTE mark and over the course
of the next a year to odds going to
become very good that you're in an 18
TLT market as well in fact odds are
already pretty good but they they will
be enormously in your favor over the
next few months to a year to year and a
half so LTE is a very relevant thing um
it has a a market effect on the data
experience on the device and in markets
with saturated ages HSPA which as you
all know i am in LTE is not just nice to
have it is a requirement so for me it is
a true deal breaker in the sense that i
want to be able to access data on my
phone and i cannot on an HSPA device so
and maybe that'll that'll start to
become less of an issue as more people
get on the gs3 is my iphone 5s and HP
start in fact in you talked about this
in your post this morning ATT is going
to start rolling out small cells in
dense areas for HSPA and q1 of 2013 and
theoretically that should help to
alleviate a lot of this stuff but in the
in the very short term this phone
is simply not an option for me so I'm
imagining what's going to happen is I'm
just gonna break down a buy one at some
point and like I will use it a lot but
when I really need tape data when I
really need LTE I'll have to swap up to
something else and I'm really lucky that
I get to be able to do that but that's
what's going to happen because I don't
need LTE just for data on the phone
although i really need LTE for date on
the phone because the apts HSPA network
is ATT HSPA network but it's my second
tethering solution I need you know I
need to be able to tether with it for
this job yeah yeah I use tethering all
the time as well but you know the thing
is that I don't live in an area that has
ATT LTE coverage I do have verizon LTE
where I live so you know using the nexus
4 for me uh will be akin to using my
iphone 5 at least you know in my my home
area as soon as i go into like you know
the city then yeah it's it's a no
contest but i don't know i'm still I
still really kind of want one I mean
we're all like HD about it we're all
like ah it is only 300 bucks unlocked is
that eight or 16 at 300 a date yeah it's
got a 350 to 16 yeah yeah I kind I kind
of just want to buy this to have like a
relatively inexpensive unlocked phone
that i can use when i'm not in the US
yeah and I could have like you know it's
a cutting-edge unlocked phone I'm not
dealing with you know if I were to buy a
different phone for three hundred
dollars unlocked I'd be dealing with you
know a galaxy s1 or something like that
I don't know dan dan i'll tell you what
i will sell you a nokia c7 fits under
five bucks I don't I don't I don't think
I you'd have to like pay me seventy-five
bucks and I still would be would be
wondering if I should take that deal you
know whatever right now 1x running
cyanogenmod 10 it's still around still
not quite there but it's gotten way
better in the past couple of weeks and
I'm pretty pleased what's the
is the rogers hack still usable on the
18 t1x Oh unlocking the bootloader yeah
I don't know what the state of that is
minds with my bootloader is unlocked and
once I got that done I like peace down
i'm paying attention to that whole
situation cuz i'm a jerk that's fair
yeah so what's missing on that wrong
that's not only in battery life oh
that's you know minor issues no idea
life has gotten way better and it's it's
pretty stable there there's some way
clocks which are things that like apps
opening up in the background it sucked
down the battery life but like I'm not
seeing any real showstoppers right now
on rom from the six but like if they're
moving along quickly that the hassle is
you know the colonel needs work because
HTC went with a crazy colonel so they're
working on actively so yeah when one is
when is HTC going to make a nexus phone
again and you know when nexus one came
out it was like the best phone the HTC
could may get it ran stock Android and
it was like why can't do that again we
have developer phones from motorola and
HTC who else is making developer edition
phones is Sony doing it now I can't exam
samsung goes samsung definitely is um
you know if you're unlocking the
bootloader on your developer edition
phone just offer a stock Android ROM and
see what happens you know it's already a
developer phone it's already you know
not available subsidized with carriers
so you're not gonna sell a ton of them I
mean see what happens man just try it go
crazy put it on your developer website
for develop cups throw caution to the
wind and just throw it up there I mean
would if there were an Android LTE phone
that had a developer edition that
offered a you know stock jelly bean
experience tell me you wouldn't buy that
uh i wanna i would pay not knowledge for
that yeah i mean chris paid like eight
hundred and fifty dollars to import a
gsm galaxy nexus last year so yeah but
who who didn't I mean like I feel
like I mean the Galaxy Nexus was the
Galaxy Nexus was such a like a a
watershed moment for android there was
so much kind of demand among Android
nerds such as ourselves for the Galaxy
Nexus that I think that many of us were
extremely desperate to get on get in on
the first shipment of devices myself
solely a cute our chat says it has
dropped a link to XDA forums that are
xda-developers that will show you how to
root and unlock them 1x the most recent
oh I kind of want to get a 1 X on my
hands now well there's one x+ though man
I don't know it's tough one it's got a
bigger battery but yeah what what
doesn't the one x+ have can you can you
tell me android 4.2 ah LTE well yeah no
no the one x+ is got out to eat yeah
that's the whole like the UK one does oh
no not the UK one I thought you meant
the 31 all right yeah the ATV is getting
that I totally spaced on it my bad how
about a Dan how about a nokia nokia n79
i'll say a 99 for fifty bucks you know
what I know what I got I got a I got a
phone have a headache about an HPV HPV r
man dude i have an HP here oh if you
have an NA Chris I would actually like
consider that but I have a cyan and
eight not ten feet away from me oh well
I know you may not happen I will take
that phone to the grave with me
gentlemen I have a thing I need to be at
in like 15 minutes so I need to go so
I'm gonna wrap this show up sorry it's a
little shorter than usual but that's
okay because it's short and sweet it
doesn't mean we don't love you and we
want you to watch next week just like
you watch this week really appreciate
everybody stop and buy if you want to
follow us on twitter you can we are at
