technology aimed toward older people you
know America's aging rapidly where the
boomers are aging and so these are
issues that we're going to have to deal
with this gadget at least it's a plated
version it looks a little silly but
Falls really are a huge issue but when
it's not inflated it's essentially a
belt that goes around your waist and
there are motion sensors in there the
idea is that if you're a senior
recovering from surgery or you're just
you know not so steady on your feet
you're walking around it senses that
you're moving and then once you fall it
inflates immediately into these air bags
that you see here really good what am I
about to do I'm about to fall and
hopefully not kill myself probably think
things that might not get there how does
it actually work how does it work what
activates it we have a rare
I'm assuming Dexter
okay my hip is not broken
punch me man
couple years ago the CDC said that Falls
were one of the biggest causes of death
for people who are old and that's a poem
that's been solved so if you're walking
around and you fall immediately the
sides the airbags inflate and absorbs
the impact and it'll spare your body
some of the trauma that will happen when
you fall and you're older and you're
more brittle bones hip protectors
already exist it might not be as
high-tech but you know there are you
know types of underwear and belt you can
wear that essentially do the same thing
they work but people don't really want
to wear them a lot of people may be in
denial that they need them a lot who
might find them embarrassing or
uncomfortable and no matter how good the
technological gadget is it's people
don't want to wear it that that's a huge
obstacle the second obstacle is just
cost right now this is going to be
available for pre-order in France in
about three months it's about eight
hundred dollars though and they're not
working with insurance yet and with the
price tag there's gonna be some
questions about how accessible and how
practical solution this really is thanks
