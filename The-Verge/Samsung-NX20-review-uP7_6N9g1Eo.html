this is the Samsung nx20 it's the
company's flagship mirrorless camera but
it really has just as much in common
with the DSLR as with a smaller camera
like a Micro Four Thirds shooter take
the body for instance it's considerably
larger and heavier than a camera like
the Sony NEX f3 but in the DSLR category
is really small it weighs just under a
pound and a half with the kit lens on
and it's definitely not a camera you're
ever going to put in your pocket but it
goes nicely into a bag or a backpack and
certainly isn't as big as most DSLRs
we've seen there's a grip on the front
for your right hand but it's a little
small and angled kind of oddly so it's
not quite as comfortable to hold in one
hand as it could be there's also a
pop-up flash on the camera but it's not
very versatile and kind of just blasts
light at your subject fortunately
there's a hot shoe above it so you can
add another flash if you need one there
are buttons and dials all over the
camera again more like a DSLR in this
case but it's still kind of a hybrid
there are some controls for basic things
like shutter speed and aperture and
there's the scroll wheels and buttons
for a lot of things but you'll still do
some digging into menus if you want to
change bracketing settings and like
things like that in addition to the
standard controls wheels and buttons and
all that Samsung has a clever I function
control system which lets you press the
AFN button on the lens and then use the
focusing ring to change a couple of the
most important settings for whatever
mode you're in
overall the menu interface is fine it's
basically the same as every other camera
you scroll right and left to get through
different lists and scroll up and down
through them there are a couple of quick
settings menus that let you jump in and
change a few things really quickly which
make it easier but for the most part
it's just a similar menu to what you've
seen before it all happens on a really
nice-looking six hundred and fourteen
thousand dot AMOLED display on the back
the display is really nice
we've seen some with sharper displays
but this one is perfectly sharp and it's
totally viewable outdoors and it also
articulates which is nice it moves
around and so you can point the screen
at almost any angle so if you're
shooting above your head or even facing
the camera at yourself you can still see
the screen of course if you don't want
to use the LCD you can use the NX 20s
electronic viewfinder they're a bunch of
advantages to an electronic viewfinder
but I'm always partial to optical
viewfinders just because they give you a
more accurate view of what you're
actually shooting there's standard
shooting features and filters lots of
scene modes and a few funky things you
can do to your pictures but some of
Samsung's wildest ones like a picture in
picture mode or something that lets you
put your head into an interesting
Sene are all left off one feature that
does make it over is the nx20 s Wi-Fi
sharing functionality there's a remote
viewfinder app for iOS and Android which
lets you use your phone as a viewfinder
and even take pictures or control the
flash so you can just put the camera
down and then walk away with your phone
and focus and take pictures and then
save them to your phone another feature
called mobile link gives you a really
easy way to get pictures off your camera
and onto your phone so you can easily
share them it's again it's a companion
app for iOS and Android unfortunately it
doesn't work as you shoot like an eye-fi
card does you take pictures and then
select a bunch to share to your phone
later in general the nx20 takes great
pictures that's not surprising it has a
twenty point three megapixel aps-c
sensor that's equal to or better than a
lot of DSLRs and it definitely shows
photos are really sharp you get really
accurate colors though they're
occasionally a bit dull but not always
it's kind of odd the 18 to 55 millimeter
kit lens that the nx20 ships with isn't
the sharpest lens we've seen but we've
tested some of Samsung's other glass
like an 85 millimeter F one point for
prime and some of its lenses are really
really sharp dynamic range is okay but
if you're shooting shadowed buildings
with bright sky you're definitely still
gonna run into some trouble low-light
performance is pretty impressive too I
shot up to about ISO 3200 without any
real problem oddly the ISO auto setting
is set to only go up to 800 which can
cause some problems with shutter speed
and aperture especially since the kit
lens is only an F 3.5 you can change the
auto ISO level though and you should iso
levels do go up to twelve thousand eight
hundred but shots add a couple of the
higher levels are really really noisy
and you should probably avoid them if at
all possible autofocus is okay but not
great it frequently racks past the focus
point before coming back but usually and
as long as you're in good light it's
pretty fast and typically focuses on the
right thing you can also shoot 1080p
video at 30 frames per second and it
looks great just like the still images
you get continuous autofocus while
recording and it focuses really smoothly
so you get almost a cinematic feel which
is pretty cool image stabilization is
also really good it's built into
Samsung's lenses and just works really
well the camera is pretty fast too it
can turn on and capture shot about two
and a half seconds which is fast without
being overly impressive and in single
shot mode can take a picture about every
second and a half in continuous shooting
it can take about eight shots per second
but only up to about 13 shots at
basically freezes for about 15 seconds
while it processes all the images that's
not good and might actually mean you
miss more shots than you'd think there
are very few things wrong with the nx20
it's a great camera but the problem is
it's just too expensive at $1,099 it's
or expensive than a lot of Micro Four
Thirds cameras it's also a lot more
expensive than a number of entry-level
DSLRs the nx20 is a really good camera
but I'm not sure who I'd recommend it to</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
