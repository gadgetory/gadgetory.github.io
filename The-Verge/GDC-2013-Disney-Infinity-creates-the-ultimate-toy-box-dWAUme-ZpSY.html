here at the game developers conference
taking a look at disney infinity it's a
new platform from disney it's part game
it sparked toy sounds an awful lot like
Skylanders disney infinity features a
line of physical toys that you can bring
into the digital world via these
collectible interactive game pieces
these figures actually store because
they have memory on them all of your
experiences inside the game so one of
the things is that we wanted to make
sure that we were always writing to the
memory of the toy and that actually adds
value to consumers that consumer can go
and then take that toy to different
platforms in the world where consumers
have so many different choices of
consoles and mobile devices what we
wanted to do is make it so that players
could take any character that they
purchased from infinity and bring it to
another platform it's the first time
ever that we're bringing all of the
disney characters together under one
roof and so probably one of the most
interesting challenges that we had was
coming up with an art style that all the
characters could live in when you look
at a character like Sully and his
fiction and monsters University he's an
11 foot tall monster and when you put
him next to you know Lightning McQueen
he's a car so we had to come up with
this really unique art style where it
felt like all the characters could live
inside of the same universe together so
the game is divided in two parts there's
a sort of standard action game where you
play through worlds starting the
monsters inc and the incredibles but
more interestingly there's a creation
element that has sort of a minecraft by
the toy box is really where we allow
players to just be as creative as they
want to be we equip them with a number
of different items and things that they
can use to you know build anything from
you know castle in the sky to a villains
cave and everything in between we start
teaching kids right off the bat about
you know how does driving work and how
do melee mechanics work and how to sword
combat work and how does range the tax
work so we we teach those through a
series of what we call master emissions
and then as time progresses we actually
layer on more and more advanced
techniques the hope is that with some of
the you know game design techniques and
tools that we've actually put inside of
infinity at some of the same tools we
use to create the game that were
actually
get you know consumers thinking more
about game design and thinking more
about building their own skill set what
they could do there's tutorials to teach
you how to build within the toy box
because it essentially is you know kind
of like a level editor or some basic
programming so the trick there is to do
it in the right degree in each step the
other thing is that what we're planning
on doing is running a series of contests
those contests will come at launch and
then also post launch there are going to
ask players and encourage players to
submit content to Disney to be ranked
and curated by us and then push back
down to the community so we're talking
about having contests like build the
coolest version of Disneyland that you
can or build the most ultimate roller
coaster that you can or build your
favorite 80s arcade game are there also
these neat little chips that add new
game elements into the world like
objects based on other Disney properties
or new abilities for your characters or
you can reskin the entire world plus
more importantly there's Tron the other
day I actually went through and created
the stadium actually I put down the the
sky and the ground to theme the entire
toy box to be the grid then I took
Stadium pieces and actually recreated
that scene the battle scene inside of
the stadium on the grid you know
greetings programs right when clue is up
addressing and when we see Sam for the
first time I think I've got kind of a
reputation for making elaborate roller
coasters around the office I sometimes
get a little carried away I've got three
kids of my own and I'm really excited to
be working on a game that I just want to
you know end up playing with them you
know just so much they want to play</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
