internet for really real and this
episode is 48 and we're presumably going
to last more than the 50 seconds our
last attempt uh managed to get so here
we are welcome to the virtual show i am
your host a very discombobulated dieter
bohn i'm glad some i'm dan seifert and
for the second time on chris sigler and
i don't even know if you ever want to
throw dieter off his game make him do to
intros to two different mobile shows
within five minutes make me do to intros
and tell me I'm live on air when I don't
know if I'm live on air and I think I'm
going on air in the midst of me going on
air that's okay we're we're very
grateful to our podcast video podcast
producers they're the best and I have no
complaints so here we are and we've got
a week's worth of mobile news and you
know I kind of went on a giant webos
rant today on Twitter you really did you
guys let's go down this I think I'm over
it think it's no we should fire back up
right here now yeah I mean what do you
want me to think is about the fact that
I want to know what what what what led
you to pull out of ear over the weekend
and use it so oh you know mortal day
weekend and I don't have much for life
so we spent the weekend like putting
together deck furniture and like
cleaning out the apartment and my bike
which I had left on the balcony had
rusted out and so I took that the
goodwill just cleaning stuff out and
we've got like four viewers in the
closet it's like oh hey this viewer is
really cool I is so small it's so cute I
mean look at look at this thing it's so
little and cute and amazing anyway um my
voice is like high-pitched like when you
see a puppy for the first time which is
how the viewer makes me feel it's like a
cute little puppy um that died in its
sleep it was it was murdered in its
sleep anyway it's such a small phone in
my head I'm like oh well this obviously
takes a
microsim so I'm going to put us in this
card to activate it because you can't
activate a webos device out of the box
without a sim unless it's the touch pad
so I'm like okay cool stick the sim
minute oh wait no it takes a full size
sim this tiny itty-bitty little phone
takes a full size SIM card or whatever
what's what's a calmness it has an HP
logo in many senses so it's exactly what
I maybe send the quote unquote full size
anyway so my sim card got completely
stuck in it so obviously the thing to do
is take it apart and see if I get the
sim out and I fix it does not have a
tear down for this but webos internals
does so i went there and took the phone
of heart and was not able to get the sim
card out without completely destroying
the veer which made me sad but now i'm
on a kick of activating all my web OS
devices and try them again remembering
how awesome certain parts of it is like
the fact that you can have multiple
cards per app so i can have a twitter
app with a list card open for my list of
verge editors and my main timeline i can
have an IRC app open that works better
than the IRC up and any other mobile
device period and have cards for each
room you know you root it by typing in
the konami code there's just so much
that was good about it and um a lot of
the good news mean the Gator the good
news reader is that LG is gonna keep the
dream alive for you yeah these guys
really want to see think about how many
cards you can have on a TV so many cars
you could have a card for each Channel
yeah that's actually not a bad idea I
like that I'm sure that's exactly what
they're doing card for each channel
they'll be able to stack them together
swipe them away at all you have two
giant gestures yeah use your robotic to
automate the gestures look at it I don't
know I could go on but I'm your kind of
inspired either because I want to go
home and turn my fear on and actually
activate it but you know the whole sim
card issue is going to be a problem for
me just like it was well as long as
you've got an adapter it's fine
mostly ed I still don't own a pre three
which really breaks my heart yeah you
mean the pre three like the one that's
sitting on a touchstone on my desk right
now with the exposition mode enabled you
know two years before came to Android
and it's still not available on iOS
where it displays ambient information
while it's just sitting there in a
discharging you mean that kind of pre
three that is exactly the kind of pre
three that I'm talking about and I'd be
careful what you say Peter because I
know where you live oh I'm not afraid
afraid to uh to burgle you two here 33
man I'm gonna I'm gonna find a way to
pair up my pre three with my folio I'm
just gonna happen this is such a
wonderfully dressing way to stater you
need to pair up your p3 with a folio and
then figure out some how to link up a
touchpad go to it and it would just be
like this trifecta of like rare palm
devices yeah and then you could control
the the whole thing with the the IR port
on some late model s60 device or the
aisle part on a treo 650 but yes even
better mark it in a way that mattered
this is very true okay okay how about an
N and n 9 50 oh there you go that is a
good call see now you're crossing the
streams this is not right now you're
looking to control some palm devices
with this nokia like that's just you
should use another palm devices as an IR
port there was plenty of them yeah but
they all got the point isn't it anyway
the point is to pick phones that were
made but not released their devices we
should move on to the news that actually
matters has everybody seen six fastest
racers time x unfortunate well is it out
yet in the UK plaid I know it is but I
don't care about it that much hey char
get off hang up how do we how do we kick
him from the hanger and what's the
command well damn and Sheamus plug for
Chris he does have a an entire podcast
dedicate
this topic so yes not need to dig into
it but it is happy yeah it it's called
the past cast you can you can find it on
my my personal blog blog that Ziggler
c.net and yeah if you would like to
really dive deep into the lure of the
Fast and Furious universe I highly
recommend that you check it out I gotta
say I have a scene 2 through 5 and I
felt like I missed nothing well that's
because you didn't see 2 through 5 if
you have seen two through five you would
know exactly what you were missing by
not seeing 235 was I missing the fact
that the quote unquote plot twist with
the thing I can't know it can we spoil
it yeah there's my that's violet we
better not there's a twist about
eighty-five percent of the way through
the movie and I was just like that this
plot twist means nothing if they hadn't
like told us and so shown us a couple of
things which they did a lot in this
movie um then I would have liked it
would have mattered at all as it was it
was just like why why do I care about
this this plot twist I really just don't
because you didn't see 45 okay I got two
points to make here the first is that
the assumption that you've missed
something in 235 is an assumption that
is some substance to this movie series
where there is no substance to it really
all it is it's a manifestation of the
demise of Anglo American culture the
fact that he just he just called nothing
serious the downfall of Western
civilization okay listen as you know all
heard that Vlad has called The Fast and
the Furious the downfall of Western
civilization I came onto the show hat in
hand literally i'm holding a hat in my
hand to apologize to chris for having
made so much fun of fast and furious
over the years because I did thoroughly
enjoy myself during the movie and I I
mean despite their the glaring pot holes
through which you could drive a giant
Russian uh you know cargo jet and they
did dr ajay impression cargo jet through
those potholes and then they drove a car
through
the check the pulse it was a the fast
the furious represents everything that's
great about seeing a movie in a theater
it's got lots of big explosions really
fast cars and like all the stuff that
give you a good reason to go get out of
your house and go to a movie theater to
see it it's not an art film that's gonna
make you think it's not pushing the
limit on cinematography but you know
it's thoroughly enjoyable and it's just
fun I mean I agree with everything you
just said Dan except i would challenge
you on it not being an art film i will
challenge you on it not pushing the
limits of cinematography other than that
i totally agree with everything that you
just said okay second point I I did have
a second point to make which is that
chris is somebody who's watched a movie
and within the first five minutes of
today's podcast he was threatening
detail with burglary I mean how that's
true impact it it's it's unmistakable i
knowi chicago you see chicago bled is
just a complete you know overturned cars
everywhere I've just completely laid the
slyest and fires and short one smashed
into I'm sure Chris boham on his way
back from to me that was Howie he would
have resented I've assembled a team of
miscreants to do you perform high-value
heists I have many many things have
changed in my life since seeing this
movie but a team of former street racers
who can no be right current maybe razor
courage Teresa's who can make fast
getaways mm-hmm and also just me just
point out there is a subtle influence to
the things that we watch and thoroughly
enjoys you guys you try to make are you
trying to make a segue because I've been
thinking of how to pull it off and
there's no way that we can at this point
well the segue is I've got a point to
make so let me make it a good example is
Jamie Oliver he's a celebrity chef here
in the UK and he went over to the United
States as well when he's trying to
introduce better school meals in the UK
and he did an experiment to the US and
stuff like that so I watch those
documentaries i wish a few of them in a
row and the guys where's quite a bit
right so one day I watched few of those
documentaries in the next day
I started randomly swearing and if you
watch enough sports people interviews
you find yourself a couple of hours
later saying you know a lot so every
sentence is you know at the end of the
day you know it's the Veer so you know I
mean we tried to give 110% you know Vlad
so my favorite TV shows are like madmen
Game of Thrones and then movies like The
Fast and the Furious and the last I
checked I'm I'm not Don Draper I'm not
beheading people and i wish i had a
faster car never see you wish so well
that really means is that you're not
acting it out you're just repressed
which is another problem with Anglo
American culture but seriously let's do
the segue where we completely openly
admit that with segwaying to something
mobile technology related which is these
are speaking of things that are
completely American because it's only
available on verizon the Lumia 928 boom
done yes I smell way ever well done that
was a very fast very furious segue and i
preciate that dieter um so I've been
playing with the 928 it's in alamo if
you concede my camera view I'm not
looking at myself right now but um I've
been playing with the 928 for a while
you'll see the review up shortly um it's
you know I mean I think that the the
news of the phone and the specs of the
phone very much tell the story of this
phone which is that it's warmed over 924
verizon and it's you know that's a phone
that Verizon needs the problem is that
they needed it at the same time in the
921 what would hang us let's let's
rephrase that does for rise and need
this phone or does nokia need for risin
to need this phone I think that Verizon
I mean look if it's both I think that
verizon has a vested interest in being
in lockstep with AT&amp;amp;T in terms of
platform support and exclusives
um and the cdma carriers in general in
the US have been pretty weak on Windows
Phone and I think that that's not a good
even though windows phone is not a
particularly popular platform it's not a
good look for them they need to be they
need to be right there alongside
t-mobile need you know if AT&amp;amp;T has this
sweet looking bright blue Lumia verizon
even if it thinks is only going to sell
five of them still needs one on on its
you know in its portfolio and they had
that but verizon doesn't have a sweet
looking bright blue Lumia well exactly
I'm getting to that which is that
they've kind in the process of taking
this phone on they've kind of D
beautified it it's and I don't know if
that's nokia is doing or verizon's I
suspect it's a combination of both and
it might be specifically around the fact
that they needed to skirt the
exclusivity deal with ATT I'm just
speculating I could be completely
off-base with that but the phone is a
lot more square than the 920 and it's
only available in black and white much
like they 22 which I think I mean if
Verizon is doing that if reisen is
saying look you know we don't want these
crazy colors just give us white and
black I mean screw those guys well I
don't I don't know her eyes it is saying
that because if you look at the 8x
didn't verizon have all the funky colors
ahead blue and red and yeah that's not
just that the neon yellow just so they
verizon introduced a blue I mean it is
pretty much turquoise razr HD and razr m
so it's absolutely no color shyness
horizon yeah and and they've you know
historically they've done a lot of black
and red phones or black wood trimmed
with red in the droid range so yeah the
question becomes why is this phone so
boring looking and why is only available
in black and white and and just like
they 22 and I don't have a good answer
for that vm it looks good to me do you
ever feel like certain phone carriers
like intentionally kind of break phones
too from the start like like they know
so yeah like like like it like they
nerfed it exactly like they took what
was a very hot looking cool 920 and the
like you know let's just make this a
little more boring
want to take attention away from the
razor I absolutely think that's not a
crazy theory and I've heard from several
sources over the past couple years that
there's still some residual heartburn
from the Ken debacle which Wow urn which
burned verizon for millions and millions
of dollars burn Microsoft for more than
that but but that you know verizon
definitely got caught high and dry in
that and I think it's strained their
relationship with Microsoft and that
might have a lot to do that that might
explain to some degree why Windows
Phones cdma support in general since the
launch of windows phone 7 has been
pretty weak because right you know
verizon is you know that China excluded
verizon is I think probably the biggest
cdma carrier in the world in a very very
large market for any OEM to target and
so yeah we're just now getting this
phone that's basically a warmed-over 920
except it doesn't look quite as good has
a couple minor new features it has in my
opinion reminder has a xenon flash which
I used to think was a big deal but now
I'm realizing that flashes are stupid
and if you really don't like you know
here in a in a perfect world you want a
sensor that's good enough so that you
never need to be in a situation where
using a flash like a flash is like a
last-gasp effort to capture something
that absolutely needs to be captured and
you're willing to accept the fact that
the outcome isn't going to be very good
I know it doesn't on a flash HP there no
flash so true so I mean I'm 22 pointless
when when Nokia introduced xenon flashes
years ago on its Symbian phones the
sensors that they were paired with were
much less sensitive than they are today
so it made much more I mean there's a
lot of situations where you had to use a
flash and if you have to use a flash
xenon flash makes a lot more sense but I
guess what you're saying today is
there's a lot of situations where you
can get away with not using a flash
right right and and you know just
thinking back to even the 1920 where
Nokia was really trumpeting the
low-light capabilities of that phone
this this one is the same sensor 8.7
megapixels if not if I'm not mistaken
it's branded as a pure view and it does
well in low light granite
kind of like waves its hands a little
bit to be good and low-light it very
very obviously is using a slow shutter
speed and it has very high noise
reduction so you end up with a really
soft shot even when something is
perfectly in focus because it's trying
to blur out all the noise that you're
accumulating so if you you take a
picture in low light with the 928 uh
right next to the iphone 5 you'll get a
photo that's as bright out of the iphone
5 but it'll be much noisier because the
noise reduction is and as aggressive so
so that's that's one thing via the Xenon
flash the other difference which I just
could not care less about is that the
928 apparently can can capture audio up
to 140 decibels with that distortion
semi 140 like a jet engine is what a
hundred decibels or something like that
so I don't know what you could possibly
be capturing at a hundred decibels
exploding cars dude come on yeah
obviously domain you obviously you were
not bootlegging fast &amp;amp; furious 6 with
your Lumia 928 as you should have been
when you were watching it well it see if
Nokia of smart they would go to justin
lin the director / producer of fast fix
who I don't think will be directing fast
7 but I think we'll still be involved in
some capacity they should go to Justin
land and say hey look if you agree to
film fast 7 on the 928 we will pay you a
bazillion dollars or at least claim to
film it and will fake it and then burn
burn my dress just to play devil's
advocate for the audio recording
wouldn't it be better performing say it
like a concert maybe a lot of people are
recording yeah audio concert doing video
clips and maybe it'll be a little
clearer there rather that's fair 808
PureView had the same kind of technology
and it was pretty impressive on that at
least yeah the coated rich recording
right yeah I mean I don't know if you
use it but with the 808 PureView in mind
I think that is a device that really has
the hardware capabilities because it has
a really amazed
in camera means the best camera attached
to phone who've yet seen that has
capabilities where you can really use it
for more serious purposes whereas the
928 like chris says it has its issues
with the camera with the shutter speed I
don't perceive it as this awesome
videographers device you know that you
can take out and do something not
professional but more serious than just
the conventional pull it out of your
pocket and we call something which you
know diese can do with this via if it
actually worked I you can go ahead and
troll the Vienna hey do u 4 i'm tempted
to try and schmooze one out of one of
those out of you because I've never
handled one of the views and i'll send
you the one that i was working on last
night how about that the my favorite
thing to do with the Veer is to hold my
hand out like this and then put the
phone like right here and it doesn't
reach the extremities of my palm yeah
exactly like that yeah the beer is a
very probable device very trouble bit so
is it no actually the the headphone the
microphone thing is like a classic nokia
feature in that it's actually pretty
awesome and it's something that what you
have you're like oh this is really great
i'm really glad this works so well but
when you go to buy your next phone it
doesn't even occur to you like I must
have another phone like like Nokia makes
phones that don't break that have got
really good build quality and great
reception and like other than you know
for a few people that are really focused
on that kind of stuff like nobody goes
into the stores like give me the phone
with the best microphone that yeah
that's exactly right it's not a
differentiator for anybody right I mean
years ago with with feature phones or in
flip phones and whatever dumb phones it
certainly was a differentiator people
would go in and they want the best sound
quality because all you could do is make
phone calls of the thing but nowadays
obviously other features are much higher
priority well so i should point out
there's one other spec difference with
the 928 which is that it has an AMOLED
display instead of a the 920's IPS panel
which is you know it is what it is that
no get claims that the
they use some term I think it's superior
outdoor viewability or like this they
have some specific like but vague
enhancements to improve outdoor
viewability of this display which of
course is amyloids weak point and to be
fair i took this outside and i can see
it very well so you know it made no
practical difference in the usability
the phone and I I think that they
probably did that the phone the 920 is
only very slightly thinner than the 920
but i think that they still needed to
swap that out to accommodate the Xenon
flash is my guess hmm yeah like they
needed the additional interior room yeah
because the 925 which is the one to go
introduced in London a couple of weeks
back is much thinner than below let's
talk about the night 25 because Chris
and I actually both got her a chance to
touch one and handle it last week uh and
and dieter did you as well yeah brief
yeah so so we've all touch it and
frankly when we did our hands on with
with Tom I believe did it in in London
he said is the best-looking Windows
Phone I was Morgan and Vlad was there of
course best-looking windows phone in the
market and I totally agree like it seems
like you know the execution of Nokia's
designer idea for a long time I've said
the N 9 has kind of been the pinnacle of
that but i think that the 925 really
modernizes that design and and does a
great job of blending the polycarbonate
back with the aluminum rim at it's nice
and thin and it feels you know great to
hold and and you know frankly i think
it's a it's a beautiful design yeah the
matte finish on the poly car back on the
925 is super deluxe like I I would
definitely not hesitate to own this
phone if I had one compelled to
complaints one the seams are little
thick and out of place maybe that was my
problem as the seams are a bit much but
I mean other than that again lights yet
my other complaint is the and Danny and
I talked about this the snap-on back for
Chi compatibility nobody is going to use
that yeah just don't you know don't even
do it I take that back everybody is
going to use it because whenever I'm in
public it strikes me how 99.5 percent of
the population uses a giant clunky case
on their phone so actually everybody
will have that
faq attached to the 925 what's funny is
it's the same concept that's used on the
720 but the 720 s case actually like
kind of covers the whole phone it looks
like it's part of the phone it just
makes it thicker whereas the 925 s just
grabbed the corners and it just looks so
bolted on and it just it just ruins the
design of the entire thing right right
yeah there's no reason to be use is
their micro yes there must be a micro
USB port right yeah yeah so there's no
reason I mean I just I would just treat
the phone is not having Chi basically no
it doesn't right now it does asleep so I
the other phone the other no key that we
got a chance to see there was Dan it was
the 620 right yeah the double shot model
yeah I I want them so badly to make a
high-end double shot phone and it that
feeling was only reinforced for me after
I saw the 620 in the flesh because it is
so freaking cool to have these two
completely different bright colors of
plastic laminated against one another it
just looks awesome yeah I think the one
that we saw was for the new prepaid
company a oh hey I 00 or whatever like
it's custom-built for them and it was
purple on the outside and then that the
double shot interior color was like this
this neon pink and it just looked really
really sweet yeah so that Alliant one of
our analysis is really just how sweet
does it look hey that's a you know first
impressions man like that's all we can
give those phone let's yes and say they
don't get to customize that's about as
far as you can go sometimes well oh yeah
go ahead I mean I was gonna say the 925
at least the units that I had had a the
double tap to wake up and which is not
my favorite feature from the n9 you
could just tap on the screen twice and
it wakes the phone up is well aren't
they also doing the with the screen off
the that shows the time without taking
up much power have they brought that
back I don't think so continued AMOLED
display because yeah yeah this doesn't
want to facilitate it with your older
models but they haven't done it yet yeah
great it seems to be the case that Nokia
I mean the other thing is that the Asha
510 also has the
double tap to wake right okay seems to
seems to find it easier to port things
over to its Asha platform the windows
phone every time it brings an old
symbian hormiga feature over the windows
phone it's like a massive achievements
like yes finally brush the sweat of you
off your brow is like we've got
something on a windows phone yeah but
but yeah I mean double tap to wake is a
really awesome awesome feature we have
been fawning about it for so long but I
mean it's just kind of like putting a
cherry on top of a non-existent cake
with Windows poker well here's one
question that I didn't think to ask
nokia and maybe one of you guys has the
answer to this with double tap to wake
if you have if you have the screen set
to high sensitivity mode and you keep
the phone in your pocket is going to
brush up against like you're like the
lining of your pocket and then detect
your you're like lake and turn on I I
didn't ask this very good question
asking I I didn't ask but when I was
using the phone to do activate that you
had to give it a good solid tap like
repeated tap yeah but keep in mind that
I think all nokia phones including this
928 they come they ship in non high
sensitivity mode so the 925 might just
have been in the default mode which you
know doesn't detect it isn't glove mode
so we'll see uh the other thing oh one
other thing about the 925 I'll just read
this into a nokia podcast I don't know I
don't want to talk about anything else
one of the thing that that is
interesting with a 925 you know both the
920 of the 928 are are really trumpeted
as imaging phones with really good
cameras like I said that the PureView
branding and the 920 of course has xenon
flash which is a pretty rare feature but
turns out the 925 actually has the
better camera because it has a it has a
sixth element lens lens yeah whereas the
nine 29-28 have five elements yeah which
again just says nokia has the same old
story going on lots of little hardware
additions and
good things it's just a software never
catches up right but but since you're
talking about how things look let's
quickly switch over to LG which just
announced a nexus 4 in white yea it's
going on by early tomorrow but only in
Hong Kong and then become a weeks for
the rest of the world it is actually
pretty sexy pretty good this thing leak
like back in January right yes something
like a long time ago it would have been
relevant before I oh now I could not
possibly care less like seriously like
who who's gonna buy this over a google
edition one or gs4 let's be real right
well I don't know have we talked about
the rumors at the I mean they they were
it was first on a geek calm and then
cnet has confirmed that the one is also
going to get a google edition stock
device in addition to this for yeah I
don't care about the white Nexus 4 at
this point at all yeah I want to i would
have three months ago but not now even
then i don't know i don't think it looks
like great i'm a sucker for white phones
and i really am NOT fan I haven't seen
this in person yet so you know reserve
final judgement but from the pictures
I've seen a bunch of people have gone
hands-on with them and things like that
that I around the web and you know yeah
I know I saw it I Oh Taylor Taylor
Wimberly from android me had it and I
took a look at it and it you know it's a
white Nexus 4 yo it's got like the the
the plastic rail around the edges is
kind of I don't know like pearlescent
it's got a little bit of depth to it and
then you know it's got a pattern back
and it's it's a white Nexus 4 we really
should not be ever having to use the
word pearlescent when describing
foulness particular phones the men are
expected to use and this is just a
specialist playa del G yeah i mean i
don'ti assassin getting gifts Marlenus
yeah I mean it's too bad but I take I
take issue with your sexist comment i
will say that i am in the in the process
of ordering a pink casio g-shock to add
to my might watch collection and and i
am not the least bit insecure about it
and you should not feel insecure about
using a pearlescent phone not now not
ever I'm putting my foot down
didn't out he make some great
pearlescent paint finishes like
pearlescent white I believe they did
yeah yeah for sure but nice Jeep okay
sorry but my sister just cheap yeah I'm
not arguing yeah yeah I'm not gonna buy
one that's for sure look so go ahead
dieter I'm sorry I wasn't say so real
talk we have got rumors that we feel
pretty confident about of the HTC One
coming in stock and we've got the galaxy
s4 coming in stock for sure it was
announced at i/o um what are you guys
gonna do we saw her last week dieter you
are a terrible human being and i'll tell
you why why because I I was one hundred
percent convinced that I wanted the one
and then you were like well no the
weight and then you listen off like 10
really good reasons why why it's the
decision is not clear-cut and now I
don't know what no we definitely talked
about this last week because I I
mentioned I was putting my one up on
eBay I mean all right look if if the one
has the same ultrapixel camera module in
the stock I doubt that the stock camera
software can do what it needs to do to
take a great picture relative to what
HTC's Sense imagemagick chip blah blah
can do and you know battery life just
isn't that great so I'm leaning us for
right now I'd also really love to know
how they handle the button issue with
stock Android do they do the menu button
on screen do they repurpose one of the
capacitive buttons do they turn on the
HTC logo which happens the for all
intents purposes has a capacitive panel
below it you know how is that going to
be sorted out these are all really good
questions and also like on the gs4 is
the is the eye tracking sensor just can
be completely disabled like you know
it's install the hardware that is that a
special sensor on the forum yeah we're
gonna say I thought that was just using
the camera camera ya know there's
there's if you look at the front of the
gs4 there's an additional sensor that
isn't present on the gs3 that is hype
the life in your eyes like this
he wouldn't be able to use it yeah it
automatically calls 911 if it detects
that you're dead no no I tracking for
Dracula sorry there is it's either the
the extra sensor we could get this
answer for from Samsung graciously but
the extra sensors I either eye tracking
or it's a it's a sensor for like the
hand wave which is also possible but
they're doing something maybe it's a 3d
thing like a kinect type of thing but
they're doing something more than just
using the front camera for that stuff
speaking of extra senses is anybody yet
figured out a way a useful way to
exploit the barometer in the galaxy s4
uh yeah there's actually this weather
app hang on let me win against all don't
see I got to talk about webos Chris got
to talk about fast and furious dan is
now secure apps Vlad you'd only need to
take like 20 minutes about some personal
versus there's this weather app called
weather signal which is like a really um
it's a crowdsource weather app that
takes the sensors on your phone and
determines your current weather
conditions based on temperature
barometer whatever sensors your phone
has it can access them and then it kind
of crowdsources them so if a lot of
people use it they gather the data and
then they can give a weather report for
a certain area so yes that's one way to
use the barometer on your Galaxy s4 ok
do you think what this just brings back
to Dita's question earlier where he was
saying what are you guys going to do
between the gs4 and the one my answer
would be one of two mean one might be
I'm not going to be buying an android
phone is one right or alternatively if
forced into it I will buy first which
also has stock Android it's like a
little boy boy yeah but you can't do
that in the UK right now yes but I can't
do it in the UK because HTC is
determined to complete the suicide
mission that it's on right now just
decided no we have made this phone which
people have been begging for for so long
and I we're just not gonna sell it in
the UK for I mean apparent eats
books phone but honestly I mean here's
the thing with HTC David bundling a lot
of things and I know it's really easy to
bash young people when they're down but
let's just remember when the HTC One was
introduced and how they tried to do two
simultaneous launch events and how the
New York HTC One presentation where we
had people was about 20 minutes ahead of
the London one and we were trying to
live blog this in some sort of
coordinated fashion it's like this guy
is talking about the ultrapixel camera
and then this guy is talking about the
aluminum finish and yada yada yada it
was a mess and and it seems like these
things just bubble up to the surface and
then combine to make things miserable
for companies i think it's like a
compound issue but i was already driving
at haiti on HTC here i just feel like
android phones in general need to give
me something more compelling because of
the moment i agree with the sentiment a
lot of people who express actually which
is that android is an OS is probably the
best of us but the apps as soon as
polished as iOS and a great example for
myself was the british airways app right
so on iOS it works it's a decent it's an
easy application it's a you know its
corporate piece of work it's as good as
you get from a big company it's fine but
on Android it just feels like a clean up
the garbage it feels like a web browser
from 1997 if you're on I I flew virgin
america recently for ctia virtual
America doesn't even have an Android app
and they're the way they handle with iOS
is you can check in on their mobile
website and then you click a button to
send a passbook and boom you're your
mobile boarding pass is sent to your
passbook and you don't ever have to load
the mobile website again right and
people like easyJet's and Qantas
recently got involved with passbook so
it's not that completely deprived as
usual but it's just you know I kind of
feel like I want to say we're stagnating
in terms of software but the development
and the progress isn't as fast as it
used to be I think we can definitely say
that and just justice core nice and
quick segue here we can talk about the
next iOS which is supposedly a massive
redesign flat we've been hearing this
flat thing forever and ever now we've
got a new report that he's going to get
rid of heavy textures for a flat black
and white design has coordinated 925 I
mean at this point if we don't see it
seems to me like like up you know last
year with iOS 6 they all they had time
for was maps this year we know they
can't do everything so like I want to
see a redesign of the core launching
experience the core apps and some
improvements Notification Center and
that's that's enough if they do that for
iOS 7 i'll be very happy I'm not
expecting I'm not but but that you make
it sound like a small you may you make
that some all deal and it like what you
just described is like basically
completely flipping the platform on its
end and I get you know I mean apples the
big company and I I don't know but I'm
not saying that I need to like redesign
their they're like standard button stuff
that all the developers use and get for
free right like I'm I'm saying just you
know take take half of your core apps
and clean them up and especially game
setting yeah well right and like that
fine cool that's enough not well I mean
it is the this also a suggestion that
it's going to be moving to a more black
and white color scheme which brings to
mind the prada phone that LG did for God
to so monochromatic and stylish it is I
that I don't know that that's
necessarily a good thing I mean I liked
it personally I like the quadratic look
but I'm with you DJ I think if I was
improves just to the point where
Notification Center in game centers
thought to become things that people
actually use as opposed to I try and tap
something at the top of an application
and then suddenly drop down Notification
Center you reminded oh this wing exists
ah it's that's the utility of it on an
iphone at the moment
if I broken just an escrow says that's
not an easy task but if I can just get
those basics up to speed and you know
feeding truly modern again it's going to
be kind of an easy choice again some
assuming this summer is when the next
iPhone comes up don't you think i could
see fall I mean I we're assuming it'll
be a 5s you know it'll be some sort of
minor bump on the fives basic design so
I guess summer is totally feasible but
man wwc is coming up fast we're like two
weeks away right yeah a week and a half
for just under two weeks oh yeah I'm not
ready at all we're gonna see I what I'm
not ready for financially is for them to
show a retina MacBook Air I am NOT my
wallet is not ready for that I pretty
sure that will put half the verge stuff
in the poor house like instantaneously I
think the current rumors out of that
analysts that's always right is that
they're good probably not going to go
retina on the macbook air I'm just
hoping for haswell the new processor
awareness again I was talking I was yeah
well but I'm hoping that they was
talking to shot about this about like
the possibilities and like they could go
for speed and come up battery life they
could go for retina and not care about
battery life or they could like go just
like we've got this new processor to
Bruce battery life here the new here the
new macbook airs that's the one I want
so yeah I'm really not unhappy with my
macbook airs performance I have a 2012
model I really have no issues as far as
you know it does the things I needed to
do it even runs photoshop and lightroom
without really any issues it's plenty
fast for me so if they could just you
know double my battery life that would
be a complete with that's all just
double a batteries yeah it's nothing
deal no big deal because right now i get
free showing two and five hours which
kind of sucks see guys when i was
talking about the psychological effects
of watching fast &amp;amp; furious 6 here it is
now like your expectations are so
perfectly reasonable just dab a better
life take iOS and just make everything
better right tick tick yeah we're done
so yeah make it so it's easy actually
I'm to date this point there is a very
good way that
you can do this the differentiates
between the end pro models of the
macbook which is to say okay you can get
a macbook pro which is really thin and
all those good things that has a Retina
display and power but can get a macbook
air which is the most amazing better
life you know so you can differentiate
on the basis of the as battery life yeah
but I was actually thinking about this
the flat just the way that Windows 8 has
become kind of a hybrid device OS
nowadays so nobody really sells laptops
just laptops any whatever these cells
just tablets everybody's trying to do a
tablet with a keyboard and sliding thing
and a flipping thing and at something
and I thought well I've always the one
company that isn't doing this like the
particular hybrid device doesn't exist
in Apple's portfolio it has laptops
clearly delineated from the iPads but
then I thought about it and I realized
that when you go out and see people
using devices they aren't surfaces I
mean I always get confused I see
something and I think Oh somebody's
using actually using the surface tablet
and it turns out to be an ipad with
third by Keebler right and another thing
that void in apple's portfolio is being
filled by third parties people you know
is she not the accessories somehow that
and I wonder I don't have the statistics
on this but I really wonder if the
third-party keyboard manufacturers that
make the keyboards for iPads have sold
more units than Microsoft has sold at
the surface I would guess your question
I wonder what the numbers are like it's
good bad man we were just burning
through topics um we're very efficient
this okay you know one more thing and
then maybe we can wrap up and I know
that somebody probably dan wants to go
on a screaming rampage about this let's
talk about this administrative fee that
ATT is Adam somebody explained this to
me uh sure I'll take a stab so AT&amp;amp;T
announced or it became it became news or
became known that 18t was adding this
61 sent I believe it is a fee to their
monthly bills for every single user on
every line that they have start I think
it started in May first so so every
month from here on out if you have a
line with ATT or more than one line you
have to pay another sixty one cent per
line fee on top of your rate plan and on
top of your regular taxes and government
surcharges and all that stuff so 61
cents it's like okay whatever it's like
78 it's eight bucks a year I'm like mad
at the point okay yeah get me worked up
enough so it's someone please go for it
Chris cuz you look like you're about to
look look okay the point is that a
carrier I mean I take the take the
number out of the equation the issues
that a carrier has arbitrarily chosen
without you know invalidating etfs
without really anything just arbitrarily
decided okay we're going to charge all
of our customers another 61 cents a
month and also there wasn't a like oh
you can this is this is one of those
things where we change your contract and
there's a backdoor way I'll get out of
your early termination right right then
it doesn't apply here from my
understanding because this does not
change your your advertised monthly rate
plan which say is like thirty nine
ninety-nine a month because it's a fee
that's added after the fact it does not
materially adversely or adversely change
that to a material thing whatever the
wording is that lets you get out of your
project without an ETF does not apply
here um so it's not one of those things
where you can get on the horn with
customer service for six hours to try
and get out of your contract if you're
looking to leave ATT if FTC was doing
his job they would say no ATT you are
not selling a 59 99 rate plan your cell
you're selling a sixty dollars and sixty
cents rate plan like yes that's what
should be on the sign like I don't
understand why this is okay no wait by
the way we shouldn't single out 18 right
here yeah that's what other carriers
have been doing this for years it's just
it's been brought to light because ATT
just add
this it's it's it just before DITA
bursts out laughing at whatever he's
looking at know I was sneezing I was
sneezing oh he's in your hand you sneeze
in your sleeve it's more sanitary he
could oh that's a thing I believe I'm
with you dieter dieter just heads up
your hands are washable so it's my
sweater hi okay no I mean I was outraged
about this from across the ocean about
the 18th ministry taffy I mean I just
thought it was completely arbitrary and
random and annoying but Chris's point is
a very good one you guys have already
signed the contract you agreed a deal
you've set out the terms of that and now
AT&amp;amp;T is just completely I mean it's
subtly changing it it's changing it by
sense I guess part of the consolation to
you when dining you are the kind of
telling AT&amp;amp;T yeah go ahead and change it
whenever we don't care so that the thing
is like you know we said it don't forget
about the dollar sign because it's the
principle but when you think about the
dollars it's very minimal right now for
a person with one or two lines if you
have five lines it starts to becoming a
noticeable cost maybe but it is adding a
significant amount to a tease bottom
line at the end of the year I think it's
between 500 and 600 or even more million
dollars a year that ATT can bring it and
then the other concern is if they're
able to add this fee without really any
recourse without you know letting people
get out of their contract or without
having a huge backlash or without a
complaint from the government who's to
say that next time they're like oh these
administrative costs have gone up to
five dollars per line per month or
they've gone up to ten dollars per line
per month and now you guys a significant
change in your monthly costs and you
know it's there if this sets the
precedent where it doesn't matter who's
to say that doesn't happen then that
that's not I mean I am to say I'm
telling right now it's not going to
happen well you know the apocryphal tale
about how you stick a frog in cold water
and gently warm it up and you won't jump
out right
I think people actually done the
research and found that if you gently
warm it up the Frog eventually realizes
boiling and leap out but besides that
that's exactly what these carriers in
what these corporations with too much
power and this is important thing if
there was competition wouldn't be having
this conversation right because if 18
teachers decides will be more expensive
it automatically makes itself less
competitive and the next round of people
upgrading is just going to see them lose
customers so ultimately ATT shooting
yourself in the foot but being a duopoly
with verizon is like here I go with
these douchebags over with those
douchebags so it's like you're stuck
it's it's interesting you don't talk
about verizon because verizon has an
administrative fee as well I believe
it's 99 cents per line per month for
verizon but they've had it for a long
time so we're not talking about that i'm
just adding it but what they did try to
do recently uh within the past year is
add a two dollar per month fee if you
tried to pay your phone with a credit
card um which they added and then
quickly retracted when you know everyone
through a stink about it so you know if
enough people are going to complain
about it you know it eventually becomes
bad enough press where it's not worth
the 61 cents per month um but you know
it I don't I don't know if we're quite
at that point for me that's I don't
think I don't think we should we being
the American people which I'm joining in
with in a case of international
solidarity right now and the thing that
people should have to organize
themselves in bunches and millions in
you know occupy AT&amp;amp;T just to get 61
you're totally they're morally right and
that's the Christmas point earlier
because if the FTC was doing its job
then we wouldn't have to but you know
she seems like these companies can just
roll over or steamroll over and do
whatever they want without really any
recourse from the FTC say I mean no
that's jiz lee anti-consumer the rate
yeah exactly and the really annoying
thing about it is that this massively
unequal bargaining power as I say as
somebody who wants to have reliable
connectivity and wants to have a LTE
universe to have the latest forms and
all that stuff you really stuck with
just a couple of choices where
ATT is the company that gives you terms
and conditions they've got their own on
to like a dozen pages and things like
that so when the bargaining power is so
an equal you can't let the person or the
party that is in the ascendancy in that
relationship just spring some extra
costs into it and particularly when all
of us know that ATT and Verizon have
been rolling in profits and raising
their arpu average revenue per user up
regularly so it's not like these guys
are struggling it's not likely going
Boston we need to help them out and how
about the American economy in that way
no not not in the least here it's
interesting to see that the only options
that you have if you want these things
of like reliable service and LTE and
things like that are really for most
people ATT and Verizon because when 18
teams trying to buy t-mobile one of its
main arguments was that we're not a do
it's not going to be a duopoly because
most markets have you know five
different carriers available to the
consumer but in reality and in practical
terms they don't because those three
other carriers either don't have the
same level service don't have the same
speed of service don't have coverage
don't have you know current generation
4G wireless networks um so yeah you are
stuck between for most people you are
stuck between the two largest carriers
in the country here's how this is going
to play out like five or seven or ten
years down the road you're going to get
a little postcard in the mail that says
congratulations you're part of a class
action lawsuit and and the class action
will win and your prize will be a like a
calling card with five minutes I like it
that's how this is gonna play out
meanwhile you're still paying 61 cents
per line per month for the end of time
right great the this is really
depressing I'm gonna hand the moma
shopping I know the depressing is if
you're stuck in some like two year long
contract me like a pre three or whatever
and then they spring this on you and
you're like why does the world hate me
wait are is there
such thing as somebody on a two-year
contract with the pre three right now
yeah well uh it never retailed at 88
Jimmy sold in Germany I don't know if
they'd ever sold on contract it must
they're definitely still human beings
with pre Tucson contract I bet oh yeah
oh that's said ma'am well guys ready
chipper thank you very much for watching
the original show apologies for the
technical difficulties at the beginning
if you follow with you from her if you
want to follow us on twitter you can and
should i am back lawn Vlad is Vlad Saba

is up now and you can also post in the
forums be like gifts or gifs and we'll
be back soon on that's plain we have one
less my headline picture for our posts
yes yes how do we not talk about that oh
my god okay I'm finally a real person
you are welcome to the head image then
congratulations there's a couple and
will be will be switching between them
