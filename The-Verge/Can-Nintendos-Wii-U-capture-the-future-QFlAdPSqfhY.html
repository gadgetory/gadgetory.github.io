in New York where Nintendo's just
announced the pricing and availability
of its Wii U console and it's also
making its largest for a yet into the
battle for the living room by adding
Nintendo TV it's also trying to showcase
a wider range of games than before while
still incorporating its gamepad which is
a touchscreen that also includes
integrated controls a stylist and a
video recorder you know with Nintendo
technically were an entertainment
company so what we really need to do is
create compelling entertainment options
for consumers because what we want them
to do obviously is go out and get away
you and experience what those games are
so from our perspective we really feel
like our competition is really any other
form of entertainment but when it comes
down to gaming specifically Wii U is the
new console out there and what it's
doing is it's bringing entirely new ways
to play you can't have this experience
on any other system so the question is
whether Nintendo is going to be able to
build a solid gaming experience while
still incorporating all of these new
features all the titles we try to
integrated the gamepad somehow and some
of the ones like zombie you or the
Metroid level of Nintendo land do it
really well they've managed to make it a
separate game inside the gamepad without
taking away from what you're seeing on
the larger screen unfortunately on some
of the major triple-a titles like
Assassin's Creed 3 it really feels like
an afterthought they might put a map in
but you're never going to have to
actually look at it Nintendo put a lot
of work into its second screen and some
of the features like being able to play
on one screen and watch TV on another
are genuinely interesting however since
the graphics aren't great it might be
difficult to lure gamers away from other
consoles we'll find out on November
eighteenth when it releases in North
America
