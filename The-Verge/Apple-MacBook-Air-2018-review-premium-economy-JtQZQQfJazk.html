MacBook Air here it is
at long last Apple has finally finally
redesigned the MacBook Air with a more
modern design and yes a Retina display
it starts at 1199 and it looks like a
MacBook Air should look it has this
tapered design it's super thin it's
pretty light it's a MacBook Air if
you're thinking about this new MacBook
Air you probably have been hanging on to
your old MacBook Air it was the king of
laptops for a long time it changed the
entire laptop world when it came out but
a lot has changed with laptops and
especially Apple laptops since that
first air so I want to talk about what's
different now about laptops and how
Apple has taken all of that stuff and
applied it to this new MacBook Air first
ports this technically has three of them
a headphone jack thank God and two
Thunderbolt 3 USB C ports that's right
MagSafe is gone so be careful not to
trip on the power cord there's also no
SD card slot sorry the trade-off is that
USB C is used to charge lots of things
now and you can even power up off a
battery pack if you want to and if you
have the right hub you can plug just one
cable into your laptop when you sit down
on your desk to connect to display power
and a bunch of other accessories but
that means you're also gonna have to
deal with dongles when you plug in stuff
like your iPhone sorry again 2nd is
screen the MacBook Air has a Retina
display it's 2560 by 1600 pixels which
means everything is much sharper and
better though you should know that the
screen is glossy now and it's not quite
as nice as what you get on the pro
laptops still it's a huge upgrade over
the old air the bezels are way smaller
now and they're black but the screen
doesn't go quite edge to edge like other
Windows laptops to know the last thing I
should mention about the screen is it
doesn't quite get as bright as I'd like
it to it's been fine even in pretty
bright and rooms and doors but I found
myself cranking up the brightness to
almost the max level way more often than
I usually do third is the keyboard Apple
has been trying to get this new keyboard
design
for a few years now now what you need to
know is that the keys they don't travel
very far and it sounds kind of wacky and
loud this third-generation butterfly
keyboard it is a little bit quieter than
it used to be but more importantly it
should also be a little bit more dust
resistant than before because that's
been a problem with MacBook Pros and
hopefully it's solved now overall I'm
basically fine with it but you should
know it does take a little while to get
used to oh one more thing
there's no silly touch bar touch screen
thing on the keyboard
it's just function keys that do what you
want them to do when you want them to do
it fourth is touch ID you can login with
your fingerprint and it's fast and easy
to use it's a thousand times better than
typing in your password now it's not as
convenient as what a lot of Windows
laptops have they let you unlock with
your face sort of like an iPhone does
but it's still a big upgrade and inside
touch ID is powered by this super secure
t2 chip that also handles a few other
security functions v trackpad it's huge
now
but don't worry about accidentally
tapping it it's really good at avoiding
that it's also a force touch trackpad
which means that you can click on it
anywhere even on the top and it just
works
now this trackpad isn't quite as big as
the ones that come on the pro models but
it is really accurate six speakers
they're better and louder their bladder
I don't know they have better stereo
separation and they're also powered by
that t2 chip but whatever the important
thing is they're much nicer than what
you had on the old err seventh is just
overall build quality this thing feels a
lot tighter and nicer than the old
MacBook Air it weighs 2.75 pounds which
honestly isn't that much lighter but
it's smaller overall than the old air
it's just a really good solid laptop
viii is the computer stuff processor and
RAM and storage and all of that now this
one gets a little bit complicated but
bear with me because I need to tell you
a story about Intel
Oh Intel if you haven't been following
laptops you just need to know that Intel
has had not a great few years compared
to how processors have advanced on
phones Intel's progress on laptop and
desktop chips has been of slower so the
processor on this new heir is a
dual-core 8th gen Core i5 but it's
something called a Y Series version of
that chip which means that it's lower
power and not as fast as the desktop
class used series that you can find on
some other laptops bottom line is this
faster than your old err yes but it's
not that much faster and in some ways it
lags behind other Windows laptops you
can do all the same stuff that you can
do in your current error so I've been
running a half dozen apps at a time
along with more than a dozen tabs in
Chrome and everything is pretty ok I
think for what most people will do with
this laptop it's fine so if you're
hoping your to be able to step up and
get way faster video editing no not so
much the fans are gonna spin up and
you're gonna have a very long wait for
your export and the same goes to
something like processing RAW photos or
doing anything that relies heavily on
multi-core processing because again this
err only has two cores those kinds of
tasks are going to bring this thing to a
chug way easier than will happen on a
macbook pro as for battery life well I
have to say that I haven't had quite
enough testing time to give you like a
number and hours that I could be really
confident in by the time we shot this
video I've used it for a couple of days
and I got about seven hours on each of
those days with a mix of web browsing
and email and some photo editing and
listening to Spotify and actually a
little bit of fairly intense testing so
that's pretty good but I don't think
you're gonna get apples claim to twelve
hours of web browsing time it's not a
battery life champ basically but I am
very confident in saying it's gonna last
longer than your decrepit old battery on
your old MacBook Air
when I first started testing this laptop
I spent a lot of time thinking about
what I should compare it to is it like a
12-inch MacBook just blown up to a
slightly bigger size is it more like a
13-inch MacBook Pro but just with
cheaper parts I mean you can barely tell
the two of them apart when you set them
side-by-side so which is it actually I
think it's both of those things it's a
really nice laptop do I wish that Apple
had found a way to maybe make a slightly
less expensive laptop well yeah I kind
of do you can get an iPad or a Windows
laptop or even a Chromebook for a lot
less that does almost everything this
does except for one thing and that one
thing is running Mac OS look here's the
deal people like the Mac it's great to
have a computer that does all the
computer stuff you want in a way that
you are familiar with and Apple has
taken way too long to update its
mass-market consumer laptop now the wait
is over but if you are hoping that
Lightning would strike twice and this
new MacBook Air would be as
revolutionary as the old MacBook Air
well it's not it basically is a MacBook
that finally includes all the stuff that
has been happening with laptops for the
past few years a lot of people just want
a good modern reliable Mac nothing fancy
really they just deserve something
that's up to par and for those people
everybody that's been hanging on to that
old MacBook Air and this is a nice
upgrade its par for the course but you
know what that's probably enough
everybody thank you so much for watching
and let me know in the comments do you
think that Apple did enough to update
the MacBook Air this go-round I think
the answer is probably yes but I'm
curious to know what you think and if
you're interested in the iPad pro we've
just reviewed that thing yesterday and
in some ways it's vastly more powerful
on this laptop so you should check that
video out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
