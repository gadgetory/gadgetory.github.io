years now and it all started with the
release of the t-mobile g1 back on
September 23rd 2008 but here's a
question why did Google bother making
Android in the first place when you
think about smart phone battles today
you pretty much think of it as Android
vs. iPhone and that's how it is but back
before the iPhone heck even right after
the iPhone came out the world looks a
whole lot different phones were actually
relatively small they fit in the palm of
your hand and most of them didn't have
touch displays if you did have a smart
phone chances are you were either NIT
you worked on Wall Street or you were a
huge nerd like me anyway here's how
things look back in 2007 blackberry was
kind of the king because its devices
were simple they were fast and they had
super long battery life palm was running
out the clock on Palm OS and trying to
figure out what I was gonna do next
Nokia was doing some Symbian stuff and
basically everybody else was making
Windows Mobile devices which went from
Pocket PC to Windows Mobile when
Microsoft started focusing more on
phones but this was before Windows Phone
existed anyway the point is Microsoft
was trying to replicate the Windows PC
business model but with phones so it
partnered with Samsung and Motorola and
HP and HTC and a bunch of other smaller
manufacturers and a lot of these
smartphones felt like overgrown PDAs
with antennas tech out of them but that
was starting to change by the time the
iPhone rolled around this right here
this is the Moto Q the original it ran
Windows Mobile and it came out in 2006
now I'm not saying that this was the
best smartphone back then but it was
actually in the running and there are
some really cool things about it it's
got this backlit QWERTY keyboard here
it's got this dope jog dial and it was
one of the phones that made people
realize that something nerdy like a
smart phone could actually be accessible
to more people anyway this thing this
kind of gadget II dorky-looking phone
right here or more specifically phones
that are just like it
they were the thing that made Google
think that it needed to do
Android okay so why do we know that well
let's start with some I don't know
circumstantial evidence take a look at
this thing this is the sooner it was the
very first prototype of an Android phone
it looks kind of familiar doesn't it it
looks kind of like the Moto QA or kind
of like this other phone which came out
a little bit later it's the trio pro fun
fact I heard that one palm was in really
bad places it went to HTC and basically
took something HTC had already been
developing and had them turned it into
this Windows Mobile trio for them it's
possible that this Windows Mobile trio
device right here is what the sooner
sort of maybe eventually turned into
maybe
anyway it was phones like this and the
Samsung Black Jack and the Moto Q that
showed that Microsoft was may be getting
closer to actually kind of knowing what
it was doing in mobile and so Google saw
these phones and it decided it needed a
gun from Microsoft not Apple at the time
so it bought Andy Reubens Android
company and it got to work maybe you've
read this famous story about how Andy
Rubin reacted to the launch of the first
iPhone according to an article in the
Atlantic he was in a car watching the
keynote and when he saw the iPhone he
said holy crap I guess we're not gonna
ship that phone except he didn't say it
like strong bad because he's not strong
bad anyway when he said we're not gonna
ship that phone he meant the sooner
because compared to the iPhone it looked
instantly dated it looked like these
windows mobile phones now according to
Dianne Hackborn a Google engineer at the
time she said that the decision to drop
sooner was well before the iPhone
announcement though we continued to use
it for quite a while internally for
development since it was the only semi
stable hardware platform that we had
which our version of the story is true
the end result was this the HTC g1 which
was codenamed dream it was the first
commercially available phone that ran
Android and it was unveiled a year and
some change after the iPhone now
compared to the sooner this is much more
advanced it has a touchscreen for
example and compared to Windows mobile
phones it also feels pretty advanced
it has a landscape keyboard that you can
type on and this cool sidekick looking
flip up thing and it's got a scroll ball
and you can also you know put SD card in
it this is a super gadgety gadget and
using it looking at it you can really
tell that they were more
focused on getting business users and
taking on Windows Mobile than they were
just trying to take on the iPhone so I
admit this is all circumstantial
evidence and you probably want actual
evidence and you know what makes really
good evidence actual evidence
Google's former CEO said that Android
was about taking on Windows Mobile one
of the bigger tech trials of the past
decade was Google versus Oracle tech
trials are great because you get
testimony you get executives on the
witness stand and they have to answer
questions and Oracle really needed to
talk about the early days of Android to
prove its case so here's the transcript
of the jury trial proceedings of Oracle
V Google from April 24th 2012 Oracle's
lawyers are questioning Eric Schmidt
about the origins of Android and Eric
Schmidt answers we were quite concerned
about Microsoft's products it's hard to
relate to that now but at the time we
were very concerned that Microsoft's
mobile strategy would be successful this
was before the iPhone was announced and
before the whole iPhone revolution
occurred so honestly there you have it
the whole structure of how Android works
was designed to undercut Windows Mobile
Samsung and LG and HTC basically most of
the companies that were making phones
back then we're making windows mobile
phones and Google got them to make
Android phones too and then make them
basically exclusively that was the trick
that's why you have an entire ecosystem
of Android phone partners Google knew
all these companies would want to make
phones so it knew it had to make the
operating system those phones would run
Google wanted four phones what Microsoft
had on the desktop scale they wanted
Android on every phone because more
Android customers meant more searches
which means more money for Google
because Google makes all its money off
of people using search that's how they
paid for Android giving Android away for
free actually made Google more money
because more people were using it and it
undercut Microsoft which was making
companies pay a license fee for Windows
the bottom line is if you have
wondered why Android works the way it
does why even today there's still weird
quirks like menus and back buttons in
whatever don't look at the iPhone you
should actually take a look back way
back at the Moto Q because this is what
they were trying to compete with hey
everybody thanks for watching we're
probably to do some more of these
history videos so let me know what
moments in Androids history you're
interested in or let me know what your
nostalgic for cuz god damn I love this
little phone it's just it's so nerdy
it's got a trackball
it also doesn't have a headphone jack so
take that every phone made right now I
guess anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
