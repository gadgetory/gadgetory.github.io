surface almost four years ago companies
have been trying to make a tablet that
can also work as a laptop or
productivity device Microsoft has four
generations in on its attempt and Apple
is now in the game with the iPad pro one
of the best executions on this idea is
coming from an unlikely place
it's Samsung's Galaxy Tab pro s size up
the Tab pro s against the service pro 4
or the iPad pro and you find a lot of
similarities twelve inch screen check
thin and light design check detachable
keyboard chat pen support check big
battery check but what really sets the
tab pro ass apart is how all these parts
are put together for starters the 800
and $99 price includes a sleek keyboard
case which isn't included with the
surface or iPad pro the keyboard case is
better than both Microsoft's and Apple's
it feels a bit cheap and flimsy but it's
surprisingly easy to type up and while
the trackpad is small its smooth and
easy to scroll with fold it all up and
it's thinner and more spout than the
iPad pro or the Microsoft Surface makes
it really better than the surface though
is that when you're using on a desk or
an airplane seat tray it doesn't take up
nearly as much space there's a flat
bottom so you can easily type on it when
it's on my lap and it doesn't have such
a short typing area that it feels like
the tablet is going to tip over like the
iPad pro does the Tab pro s does other
things well too it has a display that's
really bright and vibrant giant Super
AMOLED panel just like what Samsung uses
on its phones and has a two to three
aspect ratio that's ideal for browsing
the web or working in Word or Excel
Samsung quotes a really long ten and a
half hour battery life based on looping
video but in my experience with
real-world usage using Chrome with 10 to
12 tabs open multitasking between apps
etc I got closer to 6 hours of battery
life that's enough to get from New York
to California but it's not quite as long
as an iPad can muster performance on the
tab pro glass is pretty good it never
gets sluggish or bogged down when you're
doing basic tasks you can't really game
on it and it's not ideal for heavy photo
or video editing but for web browsing
and using apps it works fine the biggest
limitation with it is that it only has 4
gigabytes of RAM often time chrome tabs
would have to reload after just a few
minutes away which is really annoying
when I'm trying to multitask and like
any other Windows 10 tablet the Tab pro
s really isn't that great when you
disconnect it from the keyboard case
it's size is too unwieldy for casual
reading and while there are lots of
great productivity apps for Windows 10
there aren't nearly as many for casual
entertainment so with the Tab pro s
is a great travel computer for someone
who has a luxury of having a more
powerful machine at their desk unless
you're a really light user it's not an
ideal primary computer it's got a single
USBC for 4 gigabytes of RAM and it's
fairly small size it's pretty limiting
Windows 10 just needs a bit more oomph
to spread its wings so if you're looking
for a travel computer that can pretty
much go anywhere and get almost anything
you need done the galaxy tabpro s is
worth a serious look</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
