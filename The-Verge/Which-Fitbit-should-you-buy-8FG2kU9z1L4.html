it inevitable your next question is
going to be which Fitbit should I buy
because the company has put out four new
fit fits this year and still sells three
older fits it on top of that I mean
deciding which Fitbit to get is gone as
complicated is figuring out which TV
model to buy or what headphones to buy
but fortunately for you I have all of
them here with me
literally all the fitbit's and we're
going to help you decide the entry-level
category if it fits are the super simple
clip-on fit bits first there's the zip
then there's one they both track your
steps your calories burned and your
sleep and they both have a display the
biggest difference between them is going
to be battery life the zip has a six
month battery life while the one has a
two week battery life also the one will
track your stairs climbed but the zip
won't but for some people these
glorified pedometers just aren't going
to cut it and they're easy to lose or
accidentally throw in the wash and
sometimes you're looking for something
that you can just look down and see
really easily which brings us to risk
based activity trackers here's where
Fitbit designed a couple of their
activity trackers to look more like
bracelets and less like activity
trackers that are going to ensure you'll
never have a date again the first and
less expensive one is the new flex 2
which tracks again steps calories burn
and sleep activity as well as active
minutes and how long you've been sitting
for it's biggest upside is that it's v
its first swim proof activity tracker
you can wear it in the pool the biggest
downside it doesn't have a display so
you either have to read the tea leaves
and the tiny little LED lights on the
band or you have to open up the Fitbit
mobile app to see your data that's why I
like the new Fitbit Alta more even
though it's more expensive this one
tracks all the same stuff that the Flex
2 does but it has a tap sensitive
display that lets you actually see all
of that step data plus it's not as cheap
looking as the Flex 2 although the Alta
isn't swim proof oh and neither of these
have optical heart rate sensors which
brings us to the Fitbit charge the
charge is in a category all of its own
not just because it's the best-selling
Fitbit but because it really
hit the sweet spot for a lot of people
it's aimed at people who are a little
bit more active maybe they work out
sometimes and they want something that's
going to record that in addition to
tracking stuff like steps and sweets
last year's charge HR did all the basic
activity tracking you could want it to
do but also added optical heart rate
sensors and automatically recognized
when you started a workout
now there's the brand new charge too
which replaces the charge HR honestly
Fitbit changed the look of its
bestseller without really changing the
tech inside of it too much it has a
bigger display and multiple sport modes
and it does pull GPS data from your
smartphone during workouts but otherwise
it's not a huge step up from last year's
charge HR then finally there are the
Sport fitbit's the workout watches I'll
start with the older one first the surge
I call this one the mother if it fits
when it came out not only because it
looks like a giant Fitbit but because it
has built-in GPS and tracks a bunch of
different sports in addition to everyday
activity tracking it's also the most
expensive Fitbit available but the surge
was Fitbit being like hey Garmin were
here and also it's still the only Fitbit
with built-in GPS if you're into that
sort of thing then there's the blaze oh
the blaze Fitbit rolled out this
connected modular watch earlier this
year and resisted comparisons to a
SmartWatch even though it looks like a
SmartWatch and kind of acts like a
SmartWatch instead it's supposed to be a
smart fitness tracker but again it has a
lot of the same technology inside of it
as some of the other fit bits including
optical heart rate sensors and the auto
exercise tracking but it doesn't have
built-in GPS like the surge it's an odd
kind of in between activity tracker and
in right
not super attractive and then there's
the eighth and final option which
shouldn't necessarily be your last
option which is don't get a Fitbit at
all why not you ask well if you're
looking for a reason here are a few for
one a lot of people buy activity
trackers and then end up tossing them
into a drawer after a couple months I
mean you could end up spending a hundred
dollars or more on something that just
isn't that compelling for you to that
that might not always be the most
accurate I mean I've had some issues
around distance tracking with the new
charge - and Fitbit has even come under
fire for what some consumers allege is
inaccurate heart rate tracking during
intense workouts lastly there are plenty
of other activity trackers out there now
I need tons of them ranging from the
super cheap and casual to high-end
fitness trackers so if you aren't
totally sold in the idea of a Fitbit I
suggest doing a little research first
and see if there's something else out
there that might work better for you
and where else do that research but on
the verge so for some reason you're you
are you it ah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
