concern you know I'm not so old that I
have a death wish but I'm not going to
back away from trying to do it with the
record being 155 what I have to do is
beat 155 but what I want to do is to hit
170 miles an hour that means that I have
at a minimum not only broken the record
for a street electric car
I've also potentially broken the
legendary record for that body of
Mustang ever that puts you in the world
of at least in your own mind as a record
holder
make no bones about it this was a gamble
and is a gambler I hate to say this
reference because it's in business so
many people make jokes about if you
build it they will come in this kind of
a case you got to prove it and they will
come
I'd always tinkered on anything with a
motor like lawn mowers mini bikes when I
was a little bitty kid I just grew up in
an environment where if you weren't rich
and spoiled you basically had to work on
your own cars and learn to use tools and
I just always loved you know fixing
things and make things work and go
faster trying to outrun my friends down
the back side of the river you know
there were some kids whose dads were
professional mechanics they had a little
bit of an edge on some of us but frankly
I tried to make up for it by being a
little bit crazier than any other guy so
I'd hold the pedal down a little bit
longer before I got to the hardcore but
then stand on the brakes a little bit
more so it's just it was just seeped
into my whole childhood you know I
didn't have much of a choice
I was just surrounded by it
I had a vision and a passion and
sometimes that just doesn't make sense
sometimes it's not always the easiest
path to walk sometimes not the most
affordable path of the easiest way to
make money how do you explain something
when it gets in your head and it won't
get out of your head and it has to be
done I'm watching a company like Tesla
cause a disruption in the automotive
industry I see a niche market in that
disruption that appeals to everything in
my whole life and I've been blessed
enough to have a shot at bootstrapping
to get going at it man that's it that's
the American dream in a nutshell and
that's what we've got going on here
this is the bloodshed which is the
birthplace of the zombie to-to-to that's
the first high performance Eevee
converted supercar muscle car that we've
been working on the zombie coming down
ready to hunt its prey it into the
brains of Ferraris Lamborghinis
Maseratis anything that sounds like a
pasta dish from Italy this car is the
most exciting thing I've ever driven in
my we have one point two megawatts
potential of our battery pack that could
give us 1,500 horsepower if we dialed it
in right and had the motors the
drivetrain that could handle them it is
literally like crack cocaine
this car does 0-60 in two point four
seconds it's right there with the
Bugatti the only thing that's quicker
right now is the Porsche 918 Spyder I
mean that's that's insane and I'm doing
in the 68 full body full interior all
glass Mustang come on when I step on
that pedal instantly each motor is fed
over 2,000 amps at 185 to 200 bulbs of
power so that's over 4,000 amps of
energy at like 380 volts hitting that
drivetrain instantaneously with the
electric car everything is immediate the
highest torque is at zero our pins and
so you get that immediate thrust back
into the sea
it's an experience that until you feel
it you really don't understand it I
believe there's a disruption I believe
there's a niche market wide open I want
to name it and claim it I started
researching high performance electric
and that's when I stumbled across a car
called the White Zombie the more I
started looking into that car more
fascinated I got with the fact that this
was something done to a 72 dots the
power and the numbers and performance
that car was put down will just that
were almost unimaginable and so I wrote
John Waylan an email and outlined this
whole vision for vintage muscle cars was
going to be this beautiful marriage of
sick electric performance beautiful
iconic cars vintage cars it was the it
was the dream you know that ultimately
led to John throwing the Y zombie on a
trailer took a road trip to Austin and
got really excited about what we were
doing with the car we just had to get
that car up running we got it ready got
it running took it to San Antonio drag
track John punched it card jerked front
wheels a foot in the air the fans in the
audience were just freaked out because
no one even understood this was an
electric car that was like in I guess
November
you ready no it's gonna shake you okay
go ahead
so giving it what I'm doing is a little
bit controversial you know some people
don't like the idea of taking a muscle
car or vintage muscle car desecrating it
I convert it to electric but you know
here in Austin it keep it weird if you
think's fair game
his famous man up from out of town and
this guy at a construction site says you
know a man sometimes this car here comes
by on Fridays and it's all electric I
just happened to see them like there it
is it's getting to be you're quite a
celebrity right now
zombi the motor is all electric really
that is amazing and some of the guys in
the club probably get sick of hearing me
it's not even a race 3,000 amps it is
zero to sixty two point four second
battery cut $35,000 at car shows I end
up doing this over and over and over for
hours on end which I love it I mean I
love it cuz it's all about marketing I
make no bones about it this was a gamble
and is a gamble my wife's been very
patient you know she hasn't handed me
saying where's the orders where's your
orders I keep telling her I'm not
worrying about orders right now I'm not
even focused on orders right now I'm
focused on proving this car is insane
this technology's not cheap and the cars
are not cheap so by necessity I knew
that I had limited the section on the
market to the guys that go to the big
auctions and write checks for six-figure
deals
I wanted the guy that likes that guilty
pleasure of having the car that nobody
else has and frankly Tesla's aren't rare
anymore I was reading about the Texas
mile it's kind of new to me this will be
the first time I've ever done it it is a
one-mile strip where it's private
property as there's no speed limit and
twice a year they open it for
registration where you can bring your
car of any kind down there you don't
race other people you race your own top
speed so it's all about setting top
speeds when I found out somebody else
had gone to this event with an
all-electric car and tried to see how
fast it can go I had to go I mean I had
to with the record being 155 what I have
to do is beat 155 but what I want to do
is to hit 170 miles an hour I wouldn't
be lying to you if I didn't tell you
that's part of the 170 magic number
right
I like that legend that there that the
67 Mustang once kissed 170 miles an hour
at the hands of the legendary Carroll
Shelby and so that's a good goal to
shoot for to get to that goal net number
we have a lot of work ahead of us
and if we're going to focus on building
a brand you know we got to really prove
it is it horrible like I'm not gonna
like it that's pretty bad
it's not as irritating as a vacuum pump
there goes the silent but deadly yeah
yeah just keep saying just for the mile
I have moments where I think about it
and I get all excited like a kid at
Christmas you know I'm gonna see cars
that you only see in magazines cars that
run over 250 60 70 miles an hour on gas
I'm not really not if the one thing that
worries me is there a ton a mix of the
car that's I'm I'm worried that that
could stop us from getting to our goal
since you guys were here last we have
lowered this car at least this much that
makes all the world a difference the
lower you get it closer to the ground
the better off you are all right I'm not
a big wing lover in general for just for
looks and aesthetics but what we'll do
is we'll get high pressure above it and
low pressure below it which causes to
push down as opposed if you turn it over
and you'll be like an airplane you get
lift so we're getting reverse lift
pushing the car down the problem is wind
resistance when you hit that wind it has
to go somewhere over under through
and so the wing helps with the back the
chin spoiler the lowering of the car the
changing the tires all that helps a lot
with the front we're going to pop the
back of the hood and let air out of the
engine bay area that'll also help a lot
and that's what we're doing I mean I'm
not living in a bubble of idealism to
think that a 1968 fastback Mustang was
ever intended to go well over 120 miles
an hour I'm not going to go out there
and do everything I've got and go forth
the first run and get killed trying to
do that I'm going to work my way up
until every time I feel unsafe that I'm
gonna come back and change something I
know this team I know what it's capable
of I know what the power systems are
capable of and I know it can be done and
we will do it
the Texas mile is a pretty rare event
it's a two mile runway and you get to go
as fast as you can as fast as you can go
period no rules in one mile excited man
excited we've done everything we need to
do this morning we install the new
driveshaft at six o'clock in the morning
as you can see I've gone over the car
taped seams things that might catch air
under them and blow hard and so now I
think that's time you'll get in line mmm
be careful no no this week some happened
you have to remarry uglier than me
uglier than me
our card unity one five four point nine
one four point nine miles an hour
regardless 154 he almost broke Patrick's
record he's go
what are you looking at right there
110 okay one fucking second damn
miniscule tenth of a second is so how do
you feel about the 171 it's gonna be
tough I don't I'm gonna keep making
changes and see I just don't know but
I've still got what's left I met 185
volts I will go to 200 I might even
because my car number is 2 to 2 I'm
gonna take it to 222 volts it's just
motors but I couldn't be any happier
with the performance of the batteries
the motors the controllers the cooling
system is working man it's all coming
together see I need 15 more miles an
hour
I got squeezed out 15 miles an hour let
me get busy dude it performed
wonderfully
so as I got off of it I knew I knew that
it was gonna be a better run it felt
stronger from the second I pushed the
pedal I just need to squeeze out for
more and then all the naysayers I'll be
saying a prayer but lord I don't ask for
much
I only asked for four or little miles an
hour
awesome
I love ya
Carroll Shelby would be proud man all
right hi dudes come on man give it to me
baby all I can say is yes damn it feels
good man awesome
where's my wife don't I get a hug I'm
not hugging this video in here it's all
courage nothing new detect tech support
engineering project management no that
is just my courage it's a whole thing
I'm actually just shocked I mean I can't
even believe I'm holding this dick again
I mean if this doesn't sell the vision
of ultra high performance vintage cars
that are all electric what will but this
isn't the ultimate muscle in a muscle
car what is this is awesome this is
electric miss of the future I felt like
a kid again I mean right now I'm 50
coming on 54 years old and then I tell
you if you didn't see my body you'd
swear to God you were talking Mitch
remember 17 years old with this Impala
superstore racing on the back side of
the river against anybody and everybody
we put it up or shut up I'm telling you
this is awesome
everybody should do something like this
in their lives it makes you yelling
