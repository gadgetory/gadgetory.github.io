the iPad Mini with Retina display this
is the tablet we've known was coming for
12 months since Apple released the first
iPad Mini last year but when Apple
announced it this fall the new 7.9 inch
iPad came as a bit of a surprise its
spec 4 spec almost identical as the iPad
air with the same processor the same
screen resolution the same storage
options and the price went up the iPad
Mini with Retina display starts at $399
for 16 gigabytes of storage and goes all
the way up to a crazy 829 dollars for
128 gigs of storage and LTE the word
mini used to mean something pejorative
as if it was the weaker little brother
of the standard larger iPad but this
year Mini doesn't mean less it just
means well smaller unlike the new iPad
air the iPad Mini didn't get a big
visual overhaul this year the air
actually looks a lot like the mini now
and the mini hasn't changed much
it comes in Apple's new trademark silver
and Space Gray and it's every bit as
impressive as it was a year ago it's so
solid so sturdy so compact it feels much
colder and more machine-like than the
Nexus 7 and it's a little harder to hold
in one hand just because it's so thin
and so wide but it's still totally
unmatched in its build quality the Mini
with Retina Display weighs about
three-quarters of a pound and it's 7.5
millimeters thick
thinner but slightly heavier than the
Nexus 7 and actually imperceptibly
heavier and thicker than last year's
I've had many I can't say and notice the
difference though it feels fantastic in
two hands though in mine it's still too
big to use comfortably in one with the
same metal housing the same smooth back
in the same tiny bezels the mini looks
the same as it always did and then you
turn it on the minis new 7.9 inch 2048
by 1536 display is just ridiculously
gorgeous it's the same resolution as the
iPad air but smaller obviously and it's
324 pixels per inch is incredibly high
incidentally it's pixel density is
almost identical to the Nexus 7 which
has an also beautiful seven-inch 1920 by
1200 display the screen is beautiful and
accurate it makes reading more fun games
more immersive and watching videos all
the better even if the 4:3 aspect ratio
does lead to some pretty serious
letterboxing together with the new super
powerful a7 processor the new screen
really changes the way I think about the
iPad Mini I could read for hours on the
Mini or watch movies without ever really
remembering I was looking at a small
screen this doesn't feel like a weaker
cheaper version of the nine points
I pet anymore just a smaller lighter one
the a7 processor is crucial to because
powering high res display like that is
hard particularly heavy games do cause
the iPad Mini to stutter but for the
most part its really smooth and really
fast the m7 motion coprocessor is here
as well along with a FaceTime HD camera
on the front a five megapixel camera on
the back and the same dual microphones
in stereo speakers as last year's model
the new a7 is really the point and it
makes a huge huge difference but it
can't completely solve some of the
problems iOS 7 still creates for all its
power the iPad Mini with Retina display
still stutters when you close an app
using the five finger gesture iOS 7 just
doesn't feel like it's done for the iPad
I've had no huge earth-shattering
problems but just too many tiny ones
that said though iOS has one thing the
Nexus 7 KitKat and Google can't touch
the AppStore 475,000 tablet optimized
apps Tim Cook told us and from paper and
GarageBand all the way down to Twitter
and Facebook the simple reality is that
even as Android catches up to the iPhone
it's in a distant second to the iPad
when it comes to apps gaming might be
the biggest discrepancy and it's one of
the most fun things to do on the minis
new Retina display I play ridiculous
fishing the room and dozens of other
games and too many of the best ones
simply don't exist for Android tablets
there's one downside to getting the mini
such a high res screen some things can
seem really ridiculously small some
icons are navigational elements can be a
little harder to press on the smaller
screen they look great but they're not
quite as roomy as on the iPad air for
all the extra power and all the extra
pixels the iPad minis battery life is
still impressively good the 10 hours
Apple claims is pretty close to correct
though that's constant heavy use with
more normal usage I'd expect to charge
at every three or four days and the iPad
minis battery life is mostly something
you'll never have to worry about the
iPad Mini with Retina display is in a
weird spot on one hand it's competing
with the Nexus 7 itself a beautifully
crafted high-res tablet that starts at
170 dollars cheaper than Apple's tablet
if all you want to do is watch Netflix
or read books it's not an easy call
between the two
I like the iPad minis Hardware more and
loved the 4:3 aspect ratio for reading
and playing games but the Nexus 7 is
really a spectacular tablet of course if
you want to do more with your tablet
it's no competition the iOS App Store is
more than worth the price difference on
the other side the $399 iPad Mini is far
more similar to the $499 iPad air than
the two models ever were before
it's every bit the iPad Air's equal in
every important way both tablets are
portable beautiful and powerful do you
want the big one or the small one no
matter who you are or what you do with a
tablet you can't really pick wrong and
that might be the best thing about the
iPad Mini there's not a single
compromise anywhere I think that's worth
paying a little more for</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
