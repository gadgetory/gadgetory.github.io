verge and you are taking a look at the
successor to last year's Amazon echo
speaker this is the new Amazon tap the
first thing you'll notice it is that it
is smaller than the original Amazon echo
speaker and it's portable one of the
biggest differences aside from its
portability is the fact that you have to
actually tap it in order to queue up
Alexa the virtual assistant that lives
inside the speaker so with the original
one you could be across the room or in
some cases even in a different room and
just shout out Alexa in this case
there's just this directional microphone
at the top here and you actually have to
tap it and say Alexa and it works that
way I pronounce Alexa Alexa the stress
is on the middle syllable oh okay so I
mispronounced her name apparently you
can also see that there are these
physical controls at the top if you feel
then they just they're raised ever so
slightly so it's not entirely smooth but
that's so you can control your music so
you can either press those buttons or if
you're playing music on your phone via
bluetooth you can control your music
that way in terms of battery life amazon
says you'll get about nine hours of
active use and three weeks and standby
mode the tap ships with this charging
pod so this would be tethered and then
when it needs to charge you just pop it
on so it is pretty cool the idea that
you'd be able to take Alexa with you
let's say you're taking on a road trip
you could tether it to your phone get
Wi-Fi that way and have access to all
the fun Alexis stuff on the downside I
guess you would have to get used to just
pressing this in order to communicate
with the speaker so it is a different
experience than you would get from the
standalone Ecco Amazon tap goes on sale
today it's going to cost one hundred and
twenty-nine ninety-nine Prime users are
not getting a deal this time around like
they did on the original Ecco and Amazon
says it will ship by the end of the
month</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
