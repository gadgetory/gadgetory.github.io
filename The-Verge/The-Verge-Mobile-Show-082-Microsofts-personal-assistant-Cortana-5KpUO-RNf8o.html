this is episode 82 I think it is March
for 2014 uh we are back from over old
Congress at least those of us that went
and we're back where we where we live my
name is dan seifert um flat Sabbath I am
actually where I lived the other guys
are in the office hopefully you guys
don't live there I am having Rogers no
Evan i'm chris sigler by the way next
I'm going to pop my can of soda right
now oh my goodness just FYI levels but
when Evan I have to ask you is this your
first time actually being introduced as
part of the regular hosting staff is
that did that just happen I think that
just happens Wow how does it feel you
know what it feels like it on feels like
an honor and a privilege hobbies like
closet you're jammed into right now I
mean you know you're do you do what you
can Evan and I are both in kill rooms
just for our listeners and viewers so
you're aware we are we are both in in
specially designed kill rooms at verge
headquarters here in beautiful midtown
Manhattan so if we if we do suddenly
disappear or the screen goes dark it is
because we have been we have been
murdered this is true yeah so as you can
obviously tell dieter bohn is not with
us this week he lost his voice but you
know I've learned that since he lost his
voice he's remarkably good at shouting
over email so uh he still is he's still
drilling fear into us just yeah you know
why you know why he lost his voice it's
because he thinks he's a vapor he's a
serial vapor he is a serial vapor I
think there's a relationship there like
I understand it's not supposed to be as
bad as cigarettes but something about
vaping that that I think might be
affecting the voice box it's my theory
that's my medical opinion
hmm before it went to provide yeah
you're a special doctor right I'm not
but I play one on this podcast okay okay
as long as your character I mean that's
totally cool mm-hmm okay so Jan what are
we what are we talking about this week
ah so you know what happened in past
week so I guess the biggest thing that's
happened since the last time we we spoke
uh was apple finally launched its iOS
and the car thing which they're calling
car play which I find hysterical um but
you know it looks like we're finally
getting a decent in car entertainment to
navigation and management system which
is really highly ironic because cars are
like packed with technology right but
they've had these terrible awful user
experiences for a decade or more now and
and we're finally seeing someone fix it
though I'm not sure this is really gonna
be that great I would just like to get a
consult from dr. Zynga right now because
Dan is suffering from a weird bout of
optimism yeah this is completely
uncharacteristic of the first bubble
show this is why we need dita back we're
lacking the big presence from detail and
I won't you know if you really want me
to go negative Vlad uh it turns out that
iOS and the car is powered by Q and X
which is owned by blackberry which means
eternally doomed well so thank ya whole
hold the phone so first of all q necks
connect severance pronounced is the
shining star in the black hole I don't
know if that's even astrological is
possible but if it is possible it is the
shining star inside the black hole that
is blackberry they they are super
important in the auto industry they
count I want to say majority of the
world's global automakers as as
customers there were rumors recently I
believe they were confirmed that they
are kinases replacing Microsoft's
software stack
in in their cars so they're a super big
deal and they have their software is
running in just all sorts of keep up big
name out of Appeals so when you hear
that the Q Nix is the backbone of car
play that shouldn't be surprising or B
be concerning because regardless of what
happens to blackberry tunics will
survive it's a it's a profitable and
very important unit inside the companies
absolutely and just take a more serious
note the reason I'm jumping vision
optimism and pessimism is that we don't
really know that this is necessarily
going to be a solution to the problems
of dan set up like we have this
conversation european team this morning
and the thing that came to me is that
technology integration not not just the
knowledge in general but integration and
making things fit together and be
seamless is very much and it's
rudimentary stage just both in the car
and in the home like you take your phone
you're at home and ok now you have
airplane and airplane works there plays
great and i guess that's the thing that
gives people like their and optimism is
airplay works where Apple is implemented
as well now has car play it kind of
completely breaks the metaphor because
you're not transmitting by a car it was
meeting by a lightning cable whereas
airplay transmits by idea but anyhow I
mean in what we see we've seen a few
demos from the geneva motor show of
apple carplay and the thing is it
integrates with your dashboard so all of
your knobs and dials and touchscreen and
is even a specific button to activate
Siri and to activate voice commands on
the steering wheel so that's really the
only multiplication that the car
manufacturers are making it integrates
with what you already have there but
that's not a good thing in my book or at
least it doesn't really advanced things
because the touch screen responsiveness
and the quickness of the UI is exactly
as you would get from an infotainment
system it's not iOS 7
quickness it's car infotainment
quickness which isn't quick at all yeah
it's actually surprising to me that I
mean considering how strict for lack of
a better word Apple is about those kinds
of UX parameters it's actually
surprising to me that they're going
through with this and I've to be honest
I think that that is probably a large
reason why we saw such a delay between
the launch of iOS 7 and the roll up roll
out of iOS in the car which is now car
play um but it's weird I I don't
understand for the life of me I don't
understand why it is that automakers
have such a hard time producing
responsive a hardware and software
stacks in their instrument clusters and
in their dashboards it doesn't make any
sense to me my first question is a witch
whose engineers are working on this is
it exclusively apples engineers or is it
Volvo's engineers well so okay so let's
just say you know the announcements that
they've made they've they're partying
with new Mercedes new Volvo's and new
Ferraris um which are and and you know
if you look at the cars that they've
have been showing off it at Geneva
Geneva a Mercedes in Bastion
entertainment system uses different
components and different things than
Volvo's and they both use different than
Ferraris so it seems to me like to
answer your question Evan it seems to me
that it's the car manufacturers
engineers that are producing the
hardware that goes into this and stuff
like that and then they kind of just
like art it seems to be interfacing with
an API uh to the iphone through the
lightning cable so that you know it's
it's like a UH whatever use a projected
image of whatever's on your phone gotcha
ah well like I don't know the question
of like why our car manufacturers using
qnx like our cue necks i'm okay how you
describe it but it is it's a real-time
operating system and like they're just
not that many real-time operating
systems out there that can be bought and
adapted for like any kind of product but
usually they're used in
automated like cnc milling machines and
that sort of stuff and ah correct me if
I'm wrong but I think that a lot of
these automakers are you also using
Tegra 4 chipsets I won't say a lot but
taker for is definitely becoming it's
not just called take before like they
have a specific you know they have
certain part numbers that they're using
in cars how do you make it made a big
deal out of it at CES but it's certainly
not all about you I I don't think that a
lot of the processing side of things is
happening in the car I think a lot of it
is happening on the phone that seeped
into the car here's here's where I
disagree material like the in terms of
the actual like infotainment and like
the data like the phone is serum serving
as like a data source but um in terms of
like the hardware layer I just think
it's a combination of tegra chip sets
and a real-time OS is really interesting
because tegra chip sets are one of the
few chips that's like I said before I'm
previous shows that actually support
like true OpenGL and they have lots of
like transistors to support hardware
acceleration so the question of like why
aren't car manufacturers building a like
responsive stacks of software like I
think they're definitely trying that's
why they're adopting like this kind of
either in this kind of song but but but
at the same time they're throwing in
like these really crappy resistive
touchscreen displays that you get on
like a Walmart android tablet in your
you know 150 thousand dollar Ferrari
know that they're moving toward
capacitive systems like Cadillac cue and
but the ones but the ones that they're
showing off in Geneva are like resistive
touchscreens really are you sure yeah
that's what everyone's been complaining
about that's a that's really bizarre and
inexplicable well yeah I mean the car
the auto industry has historically been
anywhere from you know two to seven
years behind the consumer electronics
industry in terms of Technology and just
you know mindshare but what's important
the kinds of technologies and apps that
are important and I think that a big
reason for that and this is something
that they've acknowledged I talked with
with executives at Ford at sea
they're just very open about the fact
that yes they know that they're way
behind one of the reasons for that is
the insane regulatory environment that
the car companies have to deal with that
is fraud John huh that's an excuse I
mean these guys are behaving like emo
was just invented lost here no no this
no you're right but they you know it's
kind of a moving target nitsa and other
regulatory bodies like Nitza are smack
in the middle of determining like all
sorts of very specific parameters around
like how long the driver should be
allowed to look at center stack what
kinds of things they should be able to
do when their hand is is on the screen
and they're driving things like that and
and so they're they're less moving parts
and you're right that's not an excuse
for the system to be unresponsive at all
but I do think that they have their
intent divided then say the attention of
like just a smartphone maker who's just
trying to pump out a smartphone so I
like I believe that for like
manufacturers like Ford which are
producing these mainstream vehicles
they've got to produce however many
hundreds of thousands a year and they
have you know cost is obviously a major
factor in what their every decision that
they're making but when you talk about
like Ferrari where everything is
hand-built and cost is really not a
factor they'll just raise the price of
the thing if people still buy it uh you
know it's like inexplicable that they're
just so stubborn well so the reason for
that is that Ferrari in particular I
mean all of these these high-end
automate auto makers but for in
particular uses you know all of the the
electronic components are outsourced to
one of these major like auto
electronics' conglomerates like denso or
Delphi or you know visteon and so and
those are the same companies that are
supplying like Ford and GM so it ends up
getting all up at that level anyway and
then they just get they basically get
the same crap that everyone else is
giving it is getting it might be
packaged a little differently but like
the underlying operating system and the
display and all that are basically the
same thing I mean like look
if I'm driving a four hundred fifty
thousand dollar Ferrari from driving an
f12 berlinetta odds are i have a virtue
anyway so like this whole I a car play
discussion your Ferraris a little
ridiculous in the first place in my face
so so this is what I want so to bring
this back to mobile like can I just ask
what actually happens when you don't
have the iphone well you just you just
have your regular in their system the
the whole point here is just
connectivity with the iphone and
improving the interplay between the
stuff we have on your iPhone and the
dash system but I just wanted to make
kind of a silent building on what Chris
has said I do feel like there is some
super advanced technology in causing
particularly CES we saw those Laser
headlights and whatever else the Elder
was doing I mean there's some really
in-depth advanced intelligent stuff I
know Volvo they have they have these
amazing breaks in trucks that are
demonstrated where you break in like I
don't know inches on brain I they have
these really intricate awesome systems
which showed that they have engineered
they have technological advances and
knowledge and all of that stuff and that
just really reminds me of cameras
particularly DSLRs so these guys will
get everything right they will do these
amazing autofocus systems really
intricate systems and then they were
just kind of screw it up by just not
bothering to do human usable you I you
know it just seems like there's this is
hurdle that they're not overcoming it's
addressing the user and addressing the
users needs as opposed to just being
pretty good at engineering and the
technical side effects yeah so this is
what I want in my next car I don't want
whatever four-door Mercedes or or
whoever whatever I buy I don't want
their stupid hardware in my way and I
don't want their entertainment system I
want a doc that I can put my iPad in and
launch an app and have my uh stuff that
I want to use in the car like that's
that's all I want like I know Sony
announced
thing at CES which is like an in-dash
car unit that you can like Doc an
android phone in and and it will
interface with that and stuff like that
I want that that's what I want that's
where we should be going with cars take
it out of the hands of the car
manufacturers entirely they obviously
don't know how to do this stuff and just
like let me use the thing that I already
know how to use yeah I have mixed
feelings about that I think it's a very
complicated subject what when car
companies the road they were starting to
go down and I think they pull back from
this so GM certainly was doing it was
they were saying okay well on the low
end we will just have you bring your own
phone and you'll plug it into our system
and you'll use your phone through pull
link our play and and so they launched
that on the Chevy spark and a few other
like ultra low end models but then they
said on the high end we want to control
the experience and make it like a really
integral part of the car so you end up
with something like Cadillac you which
is just pervasive throughout the entire
car where I think you get into trouble
there are two places where I think you
get into trouble what is with physical
controls I still think and don't get me
wrong like I have a lot of respect for
how usable Tesla made the Model S is
giant touchscreen but still the end of
the day I think physical controls are a
better idea for cars and so integrating
those in a smart way with something like
an iPad that you dock in the center
stack is is a challenge right and then
to car companies are starting to move
away from the center stack and and
they're doing really cool intelligent
things with the instrument cluster which
is a different story altogether you're
not going to dock and iPad at this myth
buster um can you manage that yeah okay
fair enough miss Govinda three torturous
I I see where you're going with the
instrument cluster and yeah that's
that's a fair point but to address it
like that the physical controls I I mean
if you give me a doctor my iPad I can
still have physical knobs sliders and
buttons for my AC HVAC system and then
all it needs to do is give me a valium
knob which it can interface through the
Lightning port or something like that
and like that's the extent of physical
controls that I really need when I'm
driving uh you know and the rest can be
done through the touchscreen or voice or
whatever it is
right so let me actually pull us back to
copley because we discussed it for quite
a few minutes but we haven't actually
discussed the specifics of it and the
core of it really boils down to Siri
voice commands and Cirie reading
information out to you and apples Maps
and this is the reason why I personally
am not too psyched about this apples
Maps is probably the weakest part of
this of the portfolio and Cirie just
doesn't have the same sort of high
quality voice recognition the groove
with us so honestly like the two
strengths that Apple supposed to bring
with carplay other strengths that Google
has an apple is if he owned well I will
say that you know Apple maps is uh
definitely not as good as google maps
but it's a lot better than it was two
years ago when a day you had all these
problems I mean they've been iterating
on it a lot I've used it a few times is
really didn't have a noticeable
difference between that and Google Maps
ah still no integration transit
directions which I find very nose yeah
that's just total especially employee
they bought a whole bunch of companies
that do transit but yeah whatever and as
far as Siri goes actually you know it
for my own personal experience I have
this little dock set up in my car uh
where I put my phone in uh and a I can
see it there easily tailed like right
for my face and I was using Siri just
last night to like send text messages to
my wife and it was great it worked just
as good as the Moto X as which I've done
that before and like it doesn't have as
it's definitely not as good for like
doing web searches and things like that
but the things that you need to do in
the car navigate home send a message
home call so and so Siri works just fine
for that provided you have a good
wireless connection i was on LTE as fast
it was reliable things like that if you
have a a sketchy cellular connection
then you know it's a different story
right yeah i just a very different story
if you don't have a card so just who she
is actually my case so are you mine are
you suggesting that you won't buy it for
our a just so they can use carplay totem
hearings and that's correct sir mostly
also because i will probably buy
a 102 of free Android phones before
aikido an iphone I'm just so broken up
with iOS until they fix the GMO software
oh my goodness I could not be in the
most opposite position right now that's
terrible I just got the i just got a z1
compact and showed off okay okay it's
just not good ever meet Evan this is
this is for a lot of people this is a
one do podcast or just saying I'm in the
opposite position and sign doesn't
really make your poi okay so I'm holding
them saying I'm holding up a a sony
xperia z1 compact model d f-stops red5
503 16 gigabyte model black BK you know
Morgan um now I I wanted this phone so
bad so bad and as soon as it arrived on
shores I went down to my local importer
I got it I was so excited I've had as
many of you know I have been using a z1
for a very long time um but when but
I've been wrapped up in this like
terrible return process the screen her
I'm sorry the rear glass just cracked in
my pocket I sent it back they send it
back to me with a completely defective
camera and so in that time period I have
gone back to the iphone um and when this
you know like the the compact I was
super jazzed about last year at CES it's
got everything I could possibly need
like it's fast small thumb has an SD
card port the screen is way better the
camera is just as good as the z1 um but
getting back into Android like oh god
it's gross it's the worst ever
everything is everything is choppy it's
just well that's that's pretty that's
pretty harsh but okay no okay so no the
thing is like it's really that it's it's
the quality of apps it is the quality of
that so like the the pervasive jerkiness
is not in the OS like Sony's done
everything they can from an OS
standpoint to make the actual operating
system like very smooth um well once you
get into those apps like the experience
is not as good
um for for many of them there are apps
that I love like the transit app for
example bring it back to actual slip you
know complete lack of integrated transit
directions like the transit app on
Android is gorgeous it look works really
fluidly it's really made for that
interface but you know like Evernote for
example like that is a completely this /
if experience after coming to iOS
version and I mean this is a super super
blade I think topic but I think you were
you were you were very frustrated this
weekend and you had a really poignant
tweet about uh you know that people
complain that the Android app experience
isn't as good as iOS but a lot of the
things come down to the fact that there
are these these companies like Evernote
and whoever it might be just are putting
the resources into the Android app
development that they are on the iOS
side so you're you're going to get a
lower quality app and you're going to
get people not interested in buying
these apps are paying for these services
on Android because the experience kind
of sucks so let me ask you this like
where are the like where are the
barriers to entry because you know
google google has an in-app purchasing
system right so developers can't use
that as an excuse anymore um and you
know the SDK has evolved a lot you know
I know people still complain about
programming in Java um but you know
objective-c then Xcode is not like AB is
not necessarily beginners language you
don't just walk into that either yeah I
know I don't think it's that is so I
think there are two things one its
uncertainty over form factor in and
resolution and two it is and this this
might be a complete myth at this point
but there is definitely a stigma around
a conversion on paid apps right like
then there's there's a perception that
iOS is the more premium platform where
users are more likely to spend money and
that the there you know two and a half
three years ago there was definitely
evidence to suggest that was the case i
don't know if it's still true it may not
be but
was that stigma i think is still there
yeah this i mean like when you're making
long-term business decisions it does
make sense to look I mean like the
resources you have available are two to
three year old studies on who's spending
one house right but the thing is is like
two to three years ago look at what
Android would look at both what Android
is a platform and android phones as
hardware platform we're capable of and
think and everything has changed
completely like um also let's see here
I've just said everything has changed
completely but at the same time you're
describing Android is pretty much the
same as it was three years ago nice to
know you can do it I'm good enough
android at it's like essays as an
operating system has improved
significantly why i'm saying is the
investment by these companies in android
is something that that has not changed
and that is a problem can we get back to
the z1 compact for a second and just
note that it is like the hardware is
just not good on that phone I could not
disagree more it is I think this is
Cyrus I have three specific comments
about the hardware one it is like
shockingly heavy for its size like you
pick it up expecting it to wait a
certain amount of ways like twice is
that twice that much for some bizarre
reason to its thick like I don't know
what the dimensions are but is it feels
and looks really thick three has a
ridiculous bezel on for no apparent
reason like that screen should go to the
edges especially like we live in a moto
x world like it is not acceptable for
that for there to be that much des alana
phone of that size okay i will give you
the best but i will not give you
anything it's the kickoff of the the
hardware is phenomenal like the aluminum
ring or the aluminum chassis this is
made out of his gorgeous I don't know
what I can do for you in terms of the
week why is it like 14 inches pic I mean
like okay honestly because that's the
side of the camera the camera is that
thick what's the problem it is from the
problem also there's just there's one
thing there's like a I'm looking at the
questions right here in the side panel
for Google Hangouts and let's see here
there is one question that I would like
to address and that is
choppy and uh I guys like I have them
both like right here uh I can notice the
difference in and what you would call
back um like they're one of these five
miles ahead of the other one that's a
bag oh goodness anyway yes so I mean
like lag and Android is it's been like
it comes down to it comes down to
hardware compositing um okay well I'm
just I'm just gonna do something unusual
because sometimes i agree with two
people disagree with each other this
time who's going to disagree with poor
you because you're both wrong like you
you you just jumped to both extremes
like everything does that one compact
hardware is enough little but i also
don't think it's trash so quick visit
chris is chris is right if so far as
there is the industrial design just has
it lacks refinement to e so the size of
it can be quite rough the edges or the
corners rather are just too sharp those
are things that Sony could have you know
softened up a bit that a bit more of a
curve on them it is a thick and heavy
phone but also you know I would say if
you can use your nexus 5 which is really
really light for its size that that can
kind of realign your expectations like
honestly if you compare deserve our
compact to like an older phone one of
the nokias from the early 2000s in which
is perfectly fine nothing wrong with it
I'm sure the thickness would have been
problem because again by the standards
it's not particularly thick I just have
already considered those major problems
but as I said I don't really think that
it's amazing and yeah I agree in the
bezel Chris but at the same time let's
not forget how much stuff sonia's jams
inside it and the biggest trick we
deserve on copper from you is the better
life and in order to fit that size of a
battery you pretty much need that size
of the case so maybe we could've that a
bigger screen perhaps but the case is
fill to the brim which the way to
testify see yeah that's fair that's fair
also it's waterproof which did you know
factors in a little bit to the era does
that is the bomb that is what what are
you people doing to your phones like I
have never had a waterproof phone in my
life and there's never been a situation
I was like gee I really wish this phone
was waterproof like I nobody else in my
phone wait wait wait what you can have
when you can have your phone in the hot
tub with you it's pretty good you're a
hot tub and you're just thinking about
using a phone your priorities are all
screwed up I mean sometimes you do need
to use the pool but in Flint what's your
answer hey the answer is very simple and
it's something that I realized again
while I was reading Zevon compact and a
freezing miserable london weather is
things like glove friendly tell sweets I
think the waterproofing is exactly the
same insofar as it's an absolute gimmick
until the first time you really need to
use and then you're like dude I feel so
good about the fact that i can use this
phone with gloves on you know i feel so
good that i can use this bone near the
pool for example you know not not in
London not in the UK you never get poor
worthy weather but in a nice country
like Bulgaria people go to the pool and
using your phone next to the pool
without need to wrap it up in the tower
things of that is fine it's a good thing
it's an advantage and like I say it's a
gimmick to most people until you come to
use it and then you just start to feel
smug because everybody else is either
freezing their fingers off or just not
using their iPhones it's the wake up
well to be fair there are quite a few
phones now that have glove compatible
screens right the uh no i mean so many
did an event at them i'm just saying as
a feature is yeah anybody can make a
waterproof only panasonic made one and
then they quit swap phones for whatever
reason i really like those two looga
phones and i think more people should be
doing I mean Samsung to brad is doing a
little bit of that with splash-proof
galaxy s5 so I just think they got the
galaxy well the galaxy s5 is just as
water professors z1 compact
no that's not true isn't it no now do
these guys IP is I think it's IP 67 all
right but the Sony is there a to-do ip57
if I'm a mistake and they get to call
themselves waterproof whereas the galaxy
s5 is water resistant either way I pee
on my phone and it would be okay that's
the important takeaway here so moving on
to things that actually happened in the
past week uh HCC's uh next generation
one kind of kind of got got the full
tour ah before its announcement Bailey
some kid out in the horrible state of
Illinois I got his hands on this very
slick tan bracelet he got his hands on
what very apparently beer to be his
parents his parents version are his
parents a copy of this that the m8 as
it's known or the the negation see quad
and gave it a really really really
really really rough to watch video tour
and showing it and comparing it to the
current version of the HTC One ah and
you know assuming that this is final
hardware this is what we're expect to
see when it's being announced in like
two three weeks it looks very similar to
last year's model which kind of lines up
with the renders that we've seen leaked
and stuff like right right but Miss
evidence is a few set of differences one
thing actually one of our commenters
when we come to the video was just
really gonna be psyched he's like wait
the headphone jacks to the bottom of the
phone take my money you have I mean no
way the lie like that's a big deal that
is a huge deal like going back to my
guys you know I have nine to me so I'll
do it right now going back to how I was
saying how i have this dock in my car so
I have this dog my car that I put my
phone and then there's a wire that comes
down to charge my phone which shows in
the bottom obviously and then I also
plug into an auxiliary jack in my stereo
because bluetooth is an awful experience
uh and so on the iphone i can have both
wires coming down from the bottom it's
really nice out of the way
on something like the Moto X to the
nexus 5 or whatever I've got these like
I've got one wire on top and one wire a
bottom and I've got that's like messy
nastiness all over the place so I like
having you be a headphone jack on the
bottoms if I'm also just the gist of the
pants experience the pants experience is
totally different like the drawing it
out of your pocket think about how I
guess you have to turn it over yeah it
just makes more sense I hadn't thought
about the pants experience they have to
confess always be thinking about pants
experience flat like that to me that's
okay I'm just gonna keep this guy
seriously about the phone so I mean
that's one of the small tweaks headphone
jack move from the top to the bottom
there's a looks like plastic black panel
at the very top of the phone which
action to me looks really slick it's
like a really slick design element that
goalie in a press picture earlier and
now basically this video seems confirm
it and the sides exactly the thing that
I was saying that Sony could have
improved with these z1 compact making
the sides just that extra bit curvier
extra bit softer that's what seems to
have happened with this new HTC One so I
mean the cut the company is pretty proud
of the one design already and grow it a
lot of people are just a lot nice and
see the need to go and change it too
much I I agree with you there the one
was you know it's a great design phone
there's don't really need to to fix
what's not broken but what kills me
about this new one is it uses on-screen
keys um like a nexus 5 or Moto X will
but it still has that stupid plastic bar
or glass bar below the on-screen keys
that serves its only purpose to show
HTC's logo and so like they could have
like made the screen bigger or shrunk
the bezel or whatever uh because the
screen is now before the the bus now
been moved on screen so that that kind
of noisy obviously I have can't say that
I've touched it in person I haven't used
it I don't really know how well that
works in usability but
from anaesthetics point but uh point uh
it kind of bothers me uh and then you
know on the back of the phone it's got
this new camera sensor are a wonderful
leaker apparently had no idea what that
camera was censored for or how it
functioned unfortunately so we can't say
what it actually does but it's been
rumored that that is going to provide
some sort of light row like
functionality I think so maybe some sort
of refocusing abilities uh and and not
3d photos to the dismay of many what I
mean that it's obvious that the sensors
are asymmetrical right so that would
certainly lend credence to the notion
that it is in a 3d camera no TC is going
to so heartbroken about this fact they
won't be able to buy another HTC 3d
phone was Prince and so I we've made fun
of TC one of our news editors here for a
long time because of how much he loved
the evo 3d but you know he he said
something to me today when I was teasing
him about it yet once again uh and he's
like the reason I loved that phone was
because it had that awesome shutter key
for the camera like he didn't care about
the 3d stuff it was that killer shutter
key it was like you know yeah you're
right Cesar sue me for me what made that
that was so awesome was the fact that it
had of the Green Hornet built-in that
really was a killer feature so here's
here's what's tragic about about both
the 3d and any potential like lytro
functionality that might come in with
this camera or electro asked
functionality is like you know there
were who knows how many of those they
sold but like they all took 3d pictures
and where are those pictures now like do
they still exist can you still view them
in 3d if that's the case like if that's
the case what is it like light row where
you have to have some kind of like Flash
plugin to view them in three um like
yeah that's not like availability like
I've got pictures view them on your evo
3d oh yeah once that cameras gone though
or once that phone is gone like what are
you going to do with that like I thank
you bye
now you buy another evo 3d that's the
that's terrible like I have I have
iphone pictures from a billion years ago
that I that are still in my counts in my
galleries that i really like but you
know how can you refer back to them if
like HTC drops the support for their
flash plugin or flash goes extinct all
together etc etc like these novelties
like sure maybe it's another maybe it's
another line item but it's at the end of
the day like a really high quality
pictures and it's going to ask you
there's a couple ways they can go with
this and yet you're right the 3d
pictures are real pain to view outside
of a 3d camera or whatever that I mean
if this thing comes past that it has a
refocusing ability it could be used to
like you know you take your picture you
have your the app on the phone that can
do the whole refocusing thing and then
you refocus where you want it you save
it as another file and you can share
that file and then you can go back and
save again so like maybe it's not like
the the the interactive ability to
change your focus all the time isn't
preserved across devices and things like
that but you still have a a photo
captured that you can view anywhere let
me do I just really know that they put
in a great game that would make sense at
least that seems likely then and also
it's something that we saw with an LG G
pro two I think it's going to part of OG
software in general for smartphones
which is that it takes a burst of L&amp;amp;O
six photos or whatever and it's again
it's very much like Nokia's refocus its
software based around the hardware so it
takes them at various distances and you
can actually notice that if there's any
motion in your picture so that the thing
that's focused furthest away from you is
like half a second after the thing
that's to focus closest to you and a lot
of companies of doing these things I
mean I think exactly is then saying when
you're able to refocus photos that might
be something that it's an option at the
phone and then you can just pump out the
general JPEGs standard JPEGs is we don't
rest of the photos but I mean I just I
just need to have a moment to
with the evil 3d and like you guys were
saying the fact that you could take
pictures with it and and you then pretty
much explicitly on that device and and I
had such a struggle you know looking at
the lenticular like display and trying
to convince myself there's a 3d effect
going I mean that was such a train wreck
I don't sweat it just be sad yeah so I
mean the HTC has already told us are
going to announce this thing on a march
25th which is just about three weeks
away so I'm sure we'll have plenty of uh
more leaks to see until then but we'll
have a a better idea of what how this
actually works when when it's actually
announced um but moving on so today was
actually revealed that this company is
planning to release the first dual
booting windows phone and Android
smartphone this year which it begs the
question of why well you know why ask
why so in one good eye is just say like
you know I can definitely see a
situation for myself and maybe for
others only power user certainly where
android is the you know windows one is
the operating system you want to use but
Android is that rating system you have
to use because just because of you know
there's some Esther gap that you need or
really not so esoteric I have to say you
don't have that is not Vanessa or you
know you have a google services
situation of course the support for
Google services is pretty weak on with
this phone right now but I only I can
see that I get it but the use case is so
narrow that three people will buy one of
these and I will be one of them so do
you think okay so do you guys think this
will be a in actual dual boot situation
where you can dual boot from one to the
other and maybe share data which seems
hard but or it is it going to be
something like you start up the phone
for the first time and you can choose
which operating system
monday let it make sense that you'll be
able to switch between the two mean that
that's a doable device is opposed to
like make a choice once and you stuck
with it I don't know I just don't know
how they'd be able to share data
especially like Windows Phone is very
much like iOS and that it's silos things
pretty hard ah and and you know at least
how it used to work with SD cards East
especially format them and things like
that I have no idea how would be able to
share data between that environment and
Android unless unless they talking about
like a virtualization or something like
that which sounds horrific Lee
nightmares honestly I'm with Kristin
this one there's just nothing for us to
talk about here I mean as much you kind
of have to imagine yourself in a
situation that ninety-nine percent of
the global population just aren't in
okay you need to feel some compelling
reason to want Windows Phone ahead of
Android at least in some circumstances
alright which were most people just
isn't the case like my biggest the best
the mostest your consumer advice is if
you have a choice go with Android I mean
we can have the discussions we can have
the debates whatever would I osm over
there but android vs windows phone it's
like then what what is woman's phone
have the android doesn't bring I mean
that there really isn't anything like
maybe responsiveness of the UI but you
can you know dance around the UI and
then you end up with crummy apps that
aren't serving your needs I mean this
was that was my experience with the
Lumia 1020 like the hardware and
software look beautiful and since the
the whole experience is really fluid in
like pretty gorgeous like I can see
myself in an alternate reality where you
know everybody had adopted windows phone
but the apps right now not there
although I will say it like maybe this
dual booting thing is totally outside
the spectrum of North normal user I
think what's more interesting is that
Microsoft relaxed their licensing
requirements to allow this
well at the same time I accept I mean
okay microsoft hasn't taken over
knocking okay so you want independent
and it ends to yadi yadi up but at least
behind the scenes you have to say that
Microsoft's allowed to not get X to
happen as well so it's kind of facing up
to the fact that it needs to play
forward Android in some respects hey so
you guys think yeah and also keep in
mind that at least in theory if if this
OEM is playing by the rules this device
will effectively be paying double to
Microsoft since Microsoft makes a
significant royalty off of every Android
device soul so so there is actually a
you know there's a good monetary reason
for myself to be okay with this there's
also little incentive to stop it because
it's such a niche product that like you
know it's a good way we have a mission a
company name yet because we don't
remember okay we're not we're not
talking about Samsung here we're not
talking about LG or HTC or any of that
we're not even talking about Huawei or
CTE this is a company called carbon it
looks like they're based out of India so
they apparently are appealing to a very
specific probably very narrow market for
this I wonder if you're also dual sim
that'd be cool that'd be like having
just two independent funds that would be
awesome no the amusing and you will be
kind of a cool thing to tell your
friends about but functionally and in
terms of usability and it get it just I
don't know it's it's me I don't know how
to describe I don't know if it's a train
crash or whatever but it just doesn't
make any sense it doesn't really add to
your life like I'll at the moment i'll
tell you what it asked your life and
everything any moment I'm deal booting
to bleaching I'm bootcamping windows on
my mac there is one reason why I'm doing
it and that is to play dota 2 so gaming
it's kind of the classic reason to want
the other OS everything else Mac OS X
now not mac OS takes care of I mean for
the most part
you do come to okay what I'm trying to
say is you have the best OS for your
needs and if you try and dance around a
switch between OSS to do a variety of
different things what really ends up
happening is you spend too much time
managing and jumping between operating
systems of whatever i'm only bootcamping
for one extra reason and it's a
compelling enough reason for me to do
but if I need to use windows for
something and then the linux for
something else in OS x squared thing
then the best advice is actually to try
and consolidate things and just use 10 s
the one that gets most of your things
done that's we need to create to do so
speaking of getting things done uh since
we're still the topic kind of Windows
Phone this week lose we saw the first
look at microsoft's apparent answer to
Siri and Google now which is being
called Cortana and it's a voice-based
personal assistant it supposedly has a
personality just like Siri does and
apparently it's named after something
from halo is that right dude Wow am I
wrong is indeed from a low I believe you
spud up but it's just the ignorance flag
is so cute so I also believe it is
pronounced Cortana but whatever you know
assume it's a noble they bring it to
market with that name it's terrible
listen it has a female voice that
doesn't mean it has a personality well
Syria's a personality I mean Siri you
know we'll talk back and you know Siri
will sasu yeah Siri will sense you well
crotalus any okay yeah actually that's
fair enough because I'm looking at one
of the screenshots that we've procured
and it says I'm absorbing the entire
internet won't take long so called
Cortana is you know by the way else as
well I by the way this is tangentially
related I need to get out there cuz I
don't think I've complained about this
yet and it really bothers me so Cirie uh
this first came up for me it's yes this
year um I i was using my my iphone
my alarm in the morning and I would say
you know whenever I use my iPhone alarm
I said I using Siri and I I say you know
set alarm for 530am or you know 515 a.m.
or whatever and if you if you set an
alarm time for before 6am sometimes
randomly it will say don't wake me up
like it will respond don't wake me up
and it like it's supposed to be a joke
but it like I read it as like well are
you refusing to set the alarm or like
are you making a jump in and then like I
don't know how to be woken up in the
morning or not now it turns out that it
is just a joke but still like you need
to set boundaries for when Siri will
sassy and those boundaries are not set
yet so I mean voice voice recognition
it's like a major part of every OS now
like it's definitely a requirement um
well I want to be I want to be clear the
windows phone 8 does have a voice
recognition already you can dictate to
hear things like that is what's
significant about this new thing that's
coming with it 8.1 apparently is uh the
this is going to be a personal assistant
in the same way of google now in Syria
and you know a Microsoft is pulling in
all this date you're supposed to give
Microsoft this data it's supposed to
scan your your inbox for calendar
appointments and passyunk owe you
something called notebook right yes so
it's got this component called notebook
which adds all your data they're
partnering with Foursquare for location
stuff uh but you know I think they're
the same problem that essentially Siri
has with Apple Microsoft or Apple has a
Serie Microsoft's going to have with
this is that you know for most people
the company that has this data already
is google and google has you know most
of your online activity already and it
makes it Google now that much more
powerful it makes it smarter and more
predictive and things like that whereas
Siri just has you know maybe your
calendar that you've stored on the phone
and you know that it's able to send text
messages and make phone calls and things
like that but it's not predictive in the
same way that Google now is and I think
you know microsoft's probably going to
run into the that it's same kind of
issue
with this service you know except for
the people that are fully invested in
Microsoft seco system but just just to
say I think from Microsoft's perspective
this is a a university a good move what
I'm reading again from tom warren is he
stood since they just have a copy of
microbrew map and he tells us that this
is going to replace the Bing search and
one of my favorite jokes is something to
do with the fact that okay the joke I
don't remember but it was about the fact
that being is like the most underused
physical or capacitive button on a phone
ever like nobody ever reaches for it
nobody ever uses the Bing search and a
windows phone so you know overhauling
that sticking this personal assistant on
there and brat branding it with Cortana
which you know for guys other than Dan
who again is super adorable who with the
fact that he's not familiar with halo
it's gonna be really cool thing and you
can set you can set a nickname for
yourself so your phone can she start
calling you messaging I think you know
that with Microsoft if Microsoft's
really wants to harness the good world
that he has from all of these halo
gamers and from its you know it has a
treasure trove of fan loyalty with Xbox
so it can do a lot it you know to to
just give you a phone where you're like
this is like my xbox and you have tried
bring some synergy between them and talk
to your phone and it's like the
character that like your sidekick your
assistant or whatever in the halo story
and it calls you master chief and you
can kind of live a little fancy their
blood and wasn't oh yeah but at what
point during the podcast did you start
smoking tremendous amounts breath oh I
will tell you when I don't exactly when
when it was when Evan took us into the
weeds with opengl i was like i was 64
discussing if it is OpenGL performance
with respect to in dash entertainment
system that's fair so look
there isn't a single human being on the
planet who is like oh I played xbox oh
I've heard of Cortana I'm going to buy a
windows phone now like that so that's
that's our national pet Chris that is
absolutely not it you what we do to
understand the mentality I'm not talking
about people who have heard about it i'm
talking about people who are like deeply
invested into it ok because but you're
talking about the failed children yes
and they exist in a real and I'm one of
them not a low though okay because I am
that way to dota 2 like if you made a
phone where my favorite dota 2 hero
could be like a really fundamental part
of it and i click on it erect with it
and stuff I mean I wouldn't tell my
friends about it I probably wouldn't
tell me who bet on this podcast but I
was use it and I'm probably smile I
think this is the same strategy that you
know HTC has with its hello kitty phone
right like there's these diehard hello
to my fans and they're gonna buy the
same strategy as Tom Tom had when it did
the Darth Vader voiceover for
turn-by-turn navigation it is actually
cool that's the distinction hello kitty
is not cool Darth Vader giving you to
know I turn navigator large large people
hello kitty is cool though I mean that
it's just like when you do things like
that you obviously with like the the HTC
that I mentioned it's not a flagship
device that they're trying to sell
everybody there's a market for that like
when you're when you're targeting
something like that you were targeting
like segments and you if that's the
strategy then that's like a very small
strategy right that's not a not a way to
take your your platform mainstream that
is actually very good point any reminds
me of something I've been thinking about
recently and that is specifically the
fact that we can't find a perfect phone
a perfect user experience precisely
because everyone is trying to do
something that's just universal like
they'll wanna mass produced an ex I for
the owner that's pretty something that
will sell in the millions and millions
and millions any all looks the same and
and the thing is that's hard to do with
hardware I think it's even harder to do
with software by the software that
really delights people is one that is
the alesis some way customized
in some way altered from this standard
cloth that everybody gets and as a thing
that bothers me is the fact that
particularly with wearables everyone
says the world wearables but everyone is
really thinking about a sparta
wristwatch everyone is thinking about a
wristwatch with an ARM processor in it
and in some smartphone like
functionality in it because that's what
everyone thinks will sell the most and
the thing that I'm thinking is if you do
more niche things with wearables you
have the technology to make them pretty
excellent again it will maybe we want to
sell to everybody but you know it will
be useful to humanity which is
completely not a capitalist or but data
I mean I mean I think you're absolutely
right but like if there's if if there
was one thing that like but the thing
about Google now and the thing about uh
Cortana's like it's you know you can
only feed it like Chris said you can
only feed it the information that's
available on the phone but you know glad
I think that if you if we're ever going
to get to products like the cons that
you're talking about like you need
pervasive like data awareness from
someone's life and like the unfortunate
reality is that really google is the
only one who's who not only has access
to that kind of data but has had the
foresight to kind of like organize it
and deliver it ways they can capitalize
on their apps gladly just once Vlad
wants Samantha from her I mean I also
wants me I haven't seen the moon Io
symphonies don't spoil it okay um but
you know I think this is actually very
telling of what Microsoft is now
realizing which is that you know they
have a chicken and egg problem which is
like they don't have they don't have
users and they don't have apps you can
oh the only way to get apps is to have
users so I can parent in order to drive
the investment you have to have user
base Nintendo is like dealing with the
same problem right now could we you um
but where Microsoft is really not like
has historically not been very talented
is in terms of like vendor and service
locket and Google is so talented that an
apple is so talented that but Microsoft
is kind of like played the sidelines but
it's really interesting to see the
motors are the nokia X come out and
focus completely on services and I think
this is Microsoft realizing that if
they're going to establish long-term
vendor lock-in they have to hook people
on these services get them using them
for a long long time and you know once
you're in those kind of like loops then
not only can you derive like data out of
those services that you're offering but
you know you can you know if people will
stick to your platform longer the
unfortunate thing is is that they bring
the whole scroogled campaign so if they
ever do trying mine information out of
your email that it kind of looks as a
bent look it's a bad look indeed ah so
on that note I think that wraps up the
Virgin Mobile show for this week this is
then episode 82 again today is we're
recording this on march forth perhaps
you're listening to it tomorrow or
another day or whatever we thank you for
