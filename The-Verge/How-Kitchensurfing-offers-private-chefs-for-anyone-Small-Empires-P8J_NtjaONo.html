invested in them and met amazing people
using the internet to change the world
our generation has an opportunity unlike
any other we can create small empires
without anyone's permission plenty of
tech startups use software to reduce
human interaction in the name of
efficiency that has always have to be
the case in fact kitchen surfing comm is
doing the exact opposite and they're
doing it from a nondescript townhouse in
gowanus brooklyn hello it's Alexis from
small empires hello say it with more
confidence and oh I am it's Alexis from
small empires okay oh thank you
oh yeah that's so a competitions are
catchin surfing is a marketplace for
amazing chefs all over the world and
people that love food
it's a place on the internet we can find
chests that come to your home and cook
for you and your friends the notion of a
private chef is something that used to
be perceived as and I think from a cost
standpoint probably also just limited to
like fairly wealthy individuals right
you're in a lot of ways democratizing
making this at least more accessible by
making that market more efficient you
you make the opportunity of getting you
know having an amazing dinner party at
your home actually something that people
can perceive of is like doable in a way
that you know you know sort of uber with
private car service but it was different
right it's like more like a utility it's
like you want to get from a usable
experience it's not an experience and
and and I think it's about the
experience and it's about really
creating like lacking the people with
the key that I created for you
with kitchen surfing I mean I think that
one of the things that I'd seen is just
like with the pay scale for chefs was
really really awful you know it's like
in New York City you go and you work as
a line cook at a really fancy restaurant
like a per se or boule or whatever you
know you're often making home $15 an
hour everybody knows that the
restaurants are bad businesses because
you have this high fixed cost to high
rent and you've got a little margin and
all these all these things right and
that cooks kind of get the raw end of
that deal I think in many ways when when
I got the domain kitchen surfing com
I thought about my mom who's like you
know was driving a lot I was I stayed I
lived in Melbourne for a while member
then constant and every time she's like
really missing the food of my mom okay
it was something about like there was
like something like really homestyle you
can really get anywhere else and I
really really like this idea about like
you know I'm finding more people that
like like really good in cooking and you
know especially mother's like hey man
there's so many amazing people really
good in cooking I went to culinary
school but like my mom just like hey I
just cook you like the best food at home
I've been thinking a lot about what
would it mean for chefs to get paid more
often and I recently had to do like some
parties I had hired people that I knew
were like chefs that were looking for
work and you're like crushed it and it
was relatively cheap I was like this is
interesting
help me just understand what you were
thinking when you got an email
introduction from a friend of yours who
said me and creating from wrong he was
basically like listen just sold a domain
name to a random guy on the internet you
gotta meet him so yes I have a crazy
friend and he had this done meaning that
he was sitting on and this German guy's
like hey I want to buy this from you and
he says okay but you have to pay me in
Bitcoin this is probably in like 2011 or
something like that maybe 2012 like
nobody knows what bitcoins are and
though it's like yeah
Bitcoin like what's this so the guy who
saw the domain to me in bitcoins
50 bitcoins
she introduced me to Chris and Sykes
like hey just this crazy guy like
technology kind of thing rest on that's
like all right okay
I'm is like okay well you should go to
New York cuz in New York's awesome true
and I here's a bunch of people you
should meet and if you want to talk
about food stuff you should talk to
Chris so I went to New York and just
like from just for fun on vacation and
microfiche so we were hanging out
getting done it a lot bow comes in to
visit and he's just kind of like in
hangout mode right like he's not really
working on anything he's just like an
hangout mary ii hey nice to meet you and
whatever and i'm kind of sitting there
like i'm like heads down working on
something I'm like okay cool like who
are you what do you want okay what can I
do for you and then proceeded to kind of
like give him a little bit of a hard
time and we what are we give him over
time I just trying to act like a figure
out what it was that he was doing with
himself I feel like like what do you do
with your life yeah like what are you
doing with your life like why are you
here what kind of thing are you trying
to work on what's interesting to you
like it's like like all those things
that should unfold over a three-hour
conversation over like a couple of beers
just sit down yeah yeah so you like
let's just sit down and like get this
done in 15 minutes I went back to put in
and I was like I worked on a different
projects and came back then and yet
generally last year and we were just
hanging out again and it's okay let's
Sue's together on say your own okay I'm
staying in for a couple month and and
then we just pulled it off
it's hard to take him seriously those
googly eyes but uh he still makes a good
point so that happened as a joke so we
call our support team salt which is
support and logistics team and so Evan
decided to riff on that and called the
Devon product team pepper kind of a
stretch though to make that an acronym
yeah he pulled it off with such panache
when he said it but it just work no and
why Jules uh I can get it's like gun or
thermal ejection so uh we're in your
living room living room yes so this this
is actually the last floor that we
annexed in the building we didn't have
this floor until about a month ago and
this is the product dev team in kitchen
surfing we were originally gonna like
build out almost like a Test Kitchen
kind of environment down here and you
might see some plans for that a little
bit later and then we kind of grew too
fast and had too many people and decided
that we needed a space for other things
this room was the divan where it gets
done all of it except for I post in
Poland Wow all right so this is where
everyone spends their days just reading
reddit and hacker news don't plug reddit
I'm sorry what were you doing before
kitchen surfing um I was working good
night
all right so have you been doing
startups pretty much since college uh
yeah entirely
so you're spoiled we're saying there's
no way you're going but I mean I go to a
big place why kitchen surfing you could
work you know right now obviously
everyone's hiring for developer toner
why did you choose kitchen surfing so
kitchen surfing has this really
interesting crossover between you're
actually paying chefs to do what they
want with their lives you know I mean
that's that's not like a lot of
opportunities you get to doing a lot of
things
so it's this new market that you're
building out of which really most people
just weren't aware existed even chefs
themselves weren't aware that they could
have like this lycra market and you're
actually paying them to do it they want
with their lives it's an amazing thing
like that's what I found like super
interesting about it that's a problem I
like to see small and like I'd like to
see that happen for you know painters
artists musicians everything else but
like green ass chefs step one
yes all right and how how does it feel
to get up in the morning and look
forward to the work you do dude it's
great I wouldn't have it any other way
like if that stops happening I'll stop
you okay there you go you make it seem
really effortless how you met but at the
time you said you were living in Berlin
right yeah I am and and he was living in
New York right and you were in town
visiting you were eating or getting
drunk together having a good time right
so I started to start a company together
Yeah right I mean I didn't know anything
about him and I just liked him and we
only had one beer together too and like
and I was really confused I was like why
would we start a company together I
don't even know you but um we both like
came like fun with reaction we were like
in an arrive mindset of like doing
something together and it's basically
like okay come you know January of 2013
we're basically going to clear our decks
from like everything and just like work
it turned out that we ended up with like
an amazing working relationship um which
is weird ranks it's like who's this guy
who's sort of you met through the
internet but it ends up being like an
amazing colleague give me end up being
really good friends and everything just
kind of like felt like I had a little
bit of pixie dust on I always thought
like this would be crazy to build a
marketplace where we can find and engage
with chefs anywhere as you travel and
it's a great idea but I don't even know
how to pull it off how do you get
started you're in January 2013 what's
the first thing you guys do we build a
sign-up page for chefs like we're
talking it's just really basic HTML CSS
you're just it's just a web form yep
really like it's not even connected to
our database to start really like I just
like you just like a little anything
like that like dumps into a CSV file
type of situation
okay all right and we started asking
people to sign up for two months was
like really like hey let's set up a
homepage a signup form do wireframes and
all this kind of stuff and and then you
figure out how you create more how do
you find chefs and how do you Ventures
um through this website where restaurant
chefs were looking for jobs this is like
a Craigslist guy sort of yeah yeah yeah
it's Arizona general like for Peter I
want to like find a place where we can
work like in right in the food world and
we just set up of sign up like a like an
ad and saying hey um if you want to cook
here sign up basically and and that's
where not only people New York Philly
from anywhere in the world like sign up
and and I think this is something that
made us realize like what kitchen
stuffing can become marketplaces are
only as valuable as the people who
contribute to them Chris Lynch has been
cooking since he was a little kid and he
knows this new world presents some
challenges but also a lot of
opportunities the thing that always you
know comes into my mind immediately is
the fact that I think that they've
created a need for something that people
didn't know they had before I feel like
that's what it's about it's like you
don't know you need this but then I'm
going to present it to you in such a way
that now you can't live without it and I
feel like Kitchen surfing is doing that
not just for private chefs because
before I met kitchen surfing outside of
word of mouth I had a very hard time
finding new clients somebody who wants
to throw a dinner party on a Friday
night or something you know what were
your choices before catering from the
local restaurant catering from a
catering place which sort of really
doesn't have a lot of appeal you know
maybe your Italian restaurant down the
street does but again they're cooking it
they're the bringing the dropping it off
and that's it you know this is you know
we're coming into your home and we're
cooking it's much more personalized
though we have set menus on our profile
that's more to give I think to give the
client sort of an idea frame of
reference how we cook where we come from
okay this guy cooks Italian this guy
cooks French so with narrow you know it
narrows it down for you but
then it becomes a one-on-one and you
basically design your own dinner with
the chef all right so we're in a Test
Kitchen which is just the kitchen of the
kitchen surfing offices so right behind
us you can't smell it we don't know that
technology but it smells amazing and all
these people are trying to work we are
not a regular office so we're a home
right this is a home and so there's a
home kitchen and this is what a chef on
kitchens has been usually walks into the
home kitchen they've never been in so
part of the chef's coming with the
kitchen surfing is them being able to
see what it's like cooking another home
so first of all these three ladies there
are chefs today there's Malaika Isabel I
only carry we have never met these three
chefs applause and they have never met
us so this is an opportunity for them to
come in and start cooking and sharing
their story and their food with the
kitchen center team so they're given a
prompt they have 45 minutes to cook prep
and plate two dishes they thing
represent their culinary staff and what
their food represents about himself this
is wow this feels vaguely like our
competition reality TV show it's not a
competition
are we allowed to talk tune in a little
I mean if you're in a client's home and
you have a toddler who's nagging at your
feet or legs you're comparing me to a
nagging no I I'm the thing that there
are a lot of situations so you should
talk to all of it
I'm Malika I'm originally from muscle
Rock Arkansas
so I'm a southern belle so to speak and
I've been in New York a couple years and
literally the second week I was here I
have friends here so they were like oh
we're doing a party can you come cater
it and after that it was like continuous
how did you hear about kitchen surfing I
was um it was a random opportunity I saw
online I believe I was just kind of
looking at different private chef
opportunities and I love like the
startup culture and that's another I
love life is digital stuff I just kind
of came across it which is great for
sigma-star because I've been cook that
the name is out there people about so I
started reading and I was just like oh a
lot of New Yorkers don't have a ton of
space you know every home in New York
dozen have a sous vide in it so how do
chefs adapt to that so I've got two
chefs or punk rock like you give them a
hit they give them a heat source and
they're good yeah so you just have a
Bunsen burner or like a hot tub totally
totally like that's actually I creative
like constraint for a chef when you
pitch somebody on a menu you're assuming
they have the basic things to cook a
little with you know what I mean
anything extra is always exciting to
have but you've already sort of shown up
with a planned menu so you're not gonna
start doing you know a sous vide dish
when you know the stakes are going on
the grill like you might mess around I
don't know it just seems a little it is
nice to have challenges thrown your way
because when you have to get dinner on
the table at 8:00 if something
unexpected happens you still have to
figure out a way to feed those people
because they really don't care what the
problem is done like some
man's my catering spaces just about a
couple months ago I went into a place
where I thought I was gonna have a
kitchen and I didn't so you just have to
wing it
wait I'm sorry you were asked to cook
somewhere where there was literally no
kitchen no it was there a hot plate or
there was supposed to be a hot plate
unfortunately there was it but they may
be a fire I had some sternal than some
pants going and that's what we got so
it's a challenge it's almost like okay
well I met that challenge I can kind of
move on to the next scene yeah happen
just like your acid II do you believe
that anyone can cook do you really think
because I'm telling you sometimes I look
at myself and I see these ogre hands
trying to manipulate even the most basic
things and it's easy to get to feel
defeated is there is there hope
can I get beyond just making egg
sandwiches which I am great at I think
anyone can cook with the right
ingredients and just patience without
patience you probably can't yeah a lot
of cooking and it will be egg sandwiches
yeah so I know that's a blowtorch I know
that much and I've never done this
before and I'm just I'm a little jealous
that like you get to play with
blowtorches um and I'd like to try all
right so what is the proper blowtorching
technique all right so this is like the
small little kitchen when I do for like
probably about this one so this is a
safety we all need that so you pull that
down and then if you want to continue
with um fire I do push this button to
hold it and then climb on oh wait
wait for it flame on everyone I get
close in the real slow you know I'm I'm
considering this as my application video
for touch okay this is exciting and a
little terrifying I can't tell you this
is actually really hot hey uh this is no
joke what you're done
you don't want to over brulee don't
don't that's a classic rookie mistake
over brulee so alright it's a little
darker than yours but the new ally phone
in theory you know five years from now
if kitchen surfing keeps growing there
are gonna be chefs who built their
brands from kitchen surfing who have a
following
you know what's to say the next big
celebrity chef isn't grown entirely from
the internet and entirely from something
like I think it's surfing I think it's
totally positive yeah at the end of the
day you have to be a good cook I think
some people know exactly who they are I
think some people are still figuring
that out I know that my cooking has
changed you know I thought I did mostly
Italian but now I realize you know it's
more Italians Mediterranean but it's
really New York inspired because I don't
if there's a good ingredient I want to
use it and figure out a way to
incorporate it into my own style but the
only way you develop that is by doing it
over and over and over again one of the
things that's the most gratifying about
kitchen surfing is seeing that it can be
so many different things to so many
different people it might be like a
woman who like just wants to teach
people like maybe she's from you know
India and she wants to teach people how
to make parathas and that's like all she
wants to do and that she loves doing
that like once a month and that's
awesome what is the best lesson you
would give to someone who is struggling
or thinking about getting into a similar
kind of sort of market system don't
think about the technology for me it's
really all about people and also always
about people what I actually think that
we're doing with kitchen surfing is that
we're giving context for people to like
enjoy more time with people they care
about and that the food needs to be
really good because people like great
food but that it's almost like a
background I don't know all the fancy
restaurants in New York I am I just like
to go to the same places all the time
I like to book Asian chefs and like
always Asian cuisine korean chef and
just something that's i don't need a lot
more
and so it's like chris it's like really
let's find the most human most simple
thing we can have and this meal every
day startups
a lot like life can't really be planned
for there's going to be serendipity and
it may involve a domain name purchase
and Bitcoin transaction you don't know
so the founders of kitchen surfing were
looking at a market that most chefs who
were in it didn't even realize existed
they still need to work on it they still
need to grow it and the most important
part is that they just started
