this keynote started I think we are in
the middle of one of the most pivotal
moments these are two pictures in the
same location when you look at the one
on the right a sea of phones capturing
that moment 900 million we could have
gotten there without the help of a lot
of you in the audience and people around
the world developers around the world
but you have to remember there are over
7 billion people on this planet so we
have a long way to go and we think the
journey is just getting started we
recently launched a redesigned version
of the Google Play Store you know in the
run through we didn't put a picture of a
more handsome man behind me up on the
screen but I guess that's why we set out
to build a music service that didn't
just give you access to a world of music
but also helped guide you through it
what if we gave you access to millions
of tracks from our store your personal
library blended with ours that's all
access we talked about 900 million
androids 48 billion app installs a bunch
of new tools and developer services that
help you build awesome apps this is a
samsung galaxy s4 running Android 4.2
jelly bean with the same software
experience that we ship on our Nexus
devices it's google's take on android
this version of the samsung galaxy s4 it
works on both AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile with LTE
support it is bootloader unlocked will
be on sale starting on jun 26 on google
play for six hundred and forty-nine
dollars we're going to give each and
every one of you a brand-new pixel I've
been asked to say it's not ready till
2pm so please don't leave in the middle
of the keynote today I'm really excited
to announce a new initiative which will
make it easy and affordable for schools
to put android tablets in the hands of
all their kids you've already been doing
this with Chromebooks Chromebooks are
really ideally suited for education
because this literally no setup no
administration you open the device
you're good to go you have the power of
web within you we're going to switch now
and talk about what we are doing on
Google today we're
reducing 41 new features across three
major areas of Google+ first a new newly
designed stream a new hangouts
application and a fundamentally new
photos experience we have a point of
view about software and technology
namely that it should get out of the way
and allow people to do what they do best
let's live learn and love frankly even
Google's own services have been
fragmented and and confused at times so
we're introducing today a new
application hangouts group video at no
charge isn't that fantastic now this is
really hot we just took it off the press
this morning and I've actually never
tried hot wording in a room with so much
ambient noise show me things to do in
Santa Cruz you are popular attractions
in Santa Cruz
absolutely amazing you know use tablets
phones laptops and you know eight on the
Google glass all those things were using
I'm tremendously excited about all the
innovation that you're bringing to life
technology should do the hard work so
that people can get out of doing of
things to make them the happiest in life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
