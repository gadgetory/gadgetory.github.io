hamburger a hamburger hamburger
hamburger this is 90 seconds on the
verge it's the dawn of a new era in
coca-cola is no longer king Interbrand
has just released its influential annual
report and named Apple as the most
valuable brand in the world with Google
following in second place coca-cola
which has clinched the top spot for the
last 13 years dropped down the
third-place Interbrand says that tech
companies are quote underscoring the
fundamental and invaluable role they
play in consumers lives Google and Apple
have both grown over 25% in brand
recognition since last year while Coke
has grown only 2% in the same time
period talking over each other is
usually pretty rude to do it but it
won't be a problem for Xbox one owners
thanks to its improved Kinect sensor
Microsoft's next-gen system will be able
to hear and understand two people
talking simultaneously this is just one
of the Xbox ones many new features
including the connects ability to detect
up to six people and read heart rates by
scanning their faces so now you and a
friend can scream socially unacceptable
obscenities while you kill people online
and finally you're ready to fire up that
wood chipper a new miniseries based on
the Coen brothers critically acclaimed
film Fargo now has its two main stars
martin freeman known for his work in the
hobbit and sherlock will be joining
Billy Bob Thornton for the 10 part
miniseries set to premiere next spring
on FX the show will be executive
produced by the Coen brothers themselves
it's difficult to make a snide comment
when I am legitimately so excited about
this and that's it for today's top
hamburgers but coming up - hamburger
hamburger hamburger hamburger hamburger
