of the future has never been easier
there are a smart versions of just about
every household item smart lights smart
speakers even a smart refrigerator but
connecting them all together to make a
truly smarter home can be a nightmare so
how do we connect the home of the future
well you need a serious brain like this
thing and to integrate it requires some
serious brain power Pete Sanford is the
owner of smarter homes a company that
helps to customize and maintain home
automation systems he's what's known as
an integrator and his role is to bring
all the smart devices of the home
together which is essential for the home
of the future we're building here in
Austin Texas because we got a truckload
of cutting-edge technology to install
this is probably 25% of what's gonna
come and make the home of the future
you're kiddin me
no but the future has a lot of stuff in
it takes a lot of parts and pieces and
everything's got to speak the same
language wow that's a lot of languages
oh yeah someday these devices might be
fluent right out of the box but for now
we need an integrator like Pete to give
the different dialects universal
language and even a tech-savvy guy like
me who's more than capable installing
his own smart devices
what I have is hands full trying to
unify everything
over the next month or so Pete and his
team will work to wire the home to
handle all the smart technology were
packing into it now maybe you're
thinking wires shouldn't our future be
more Wireless while there are some
promising developments in wireless power
we're still years away from having
anything reliably enough to even
consider installing in our home so
instead for Pete and his team their goal
is to make these wires invisible so
Peter this is the moment of truth I mean
last time I was here this was just a
whole wall with a bunch of wires coming
out of it and now we have the super
computer brain of our house I mean when
I think of a supercomputer I think of
war games and the Whopper computer that
but this is gorgeous what's inside here
everything this is as good as it gets
when we're talking smart home technology
so here we've got our two Sonos players
for feeding the indoor and outdoor audio
our wat box which is acting as a cutoff
for power to each individual piece of
equipment we've got our luck so switch
which is feeding network to all the
individual pieces of of components we've
also got our AT&amp;amp;T modem that's feeding
the internet from the street into our
system here and then out throughout the
house our Denon surround sound receiver
which is handling all of the surround
sound in this room and the video and
audio in the next room we've got our
Lutron communicator which is wirelessly
communicating with all the light
switches our to Roku players for both
this room and the bedroom our amplifier
here which is powering all of the
landscape speakers and subterranean
subwoofer we've got our PlayStation 4
for gaming and finally probably the most
important part in here is the brain
which is the RTI XP a processor and this
really helps us bring all of these
individual items together and integrate
them onto one easy-to-use interface you
don't have a million remote yeah or a
million apps
that RT Isis and the peat mentioned you
can think of it as the operating system
for the entire house and it's highly
customizable based on the user's needs
so this is the whole interface for
everything that's in that rack yep this
is remote Technologies Inc sitting with
us as Matt he is our wizard or RTI
programmer and he's the one who makes
the system easy to use and function
organically with a family so through
this interface you're controlling
everything in the house of the future
pretty much everything some devices
don't connect into automation systems
they or they might have a closed or a
partially closed API API or application
programming interface is the key part of
how you integrate products and for the
home devices with very open ap is allow
us to integrate their controls in a deep
way with the home system whereas devices
with closed api's block our ability to
link their features with the rest of the
home for example our anest security
camera on the front door has a closed
API so we couldn't get that camera feed
into the RTI system in contrast the IP
cameras around the home are completely
able to be integrated with RTI which
allows us to pull up a feed of what's
going on around the home directly from
the RTI system
so this is the dashboard for the entire
home got our controls and activities for
the living room our patio audio our nest
climate control for the whole house
normally in most systems you'll just see
it'll say Apple TV here we've dialed it
into specific apps so I know I've
watched Netflix i watch hulu everything
that needs to happen to watch netflix
then happens at the push of that one
button without navigating anything okay
so let's say I got a new gaming system I
guess you got a ps4 what if I got an
Xbox we could just grab an Xbox icon and
then program it to where it'll switch to
that that gaming input for the Xbox just
at the single push of a button RTI is
also able to plug into a LexA which
opens up the entire system to voice
control however it introduces an extra
step instead of saying Alexa turn on
Netflix I'll say Alexa tell a home
Butler to turn on Netflix it's a little
more awkward and frustrating if you
forget but soon we're told that the
system will be upgraded to avoid having
to do this additional step but that's
kind of the easy side of the programming
Matt gets into more of the advanced side
where you'll have shortcuts you know for
things that you do everyday so like good
morning or good night or welcome home or
away so show me what welcome home does
so to come in here open up that function
you'll see right now we've got that
program to set living R into Netflix
playing some music in the landscape
we're altering the thermostat
temperature to 70 then we've turn on
some lights in the kitchen living room
but only if it's dark so if you're
coming home in the day the rest of the
functions will still happen but the lots
will stay off to conserve energy and
that level of house what control of our
devices is really the strength of a
system like RTI the ability to string
together so many devices to function as
one home is the goal of the home future
the downside to the smart integration
well besides the upfront fees there's a
$30 monthly service charge for tech
support and a twice a year visit from a
programmer to make any changes so Matt
I'm look
I'm getting really excited because I'm
an engineer is this something that I
could take this software and run with it
myself
no the end-user doesn't actually
typically program this system we do that
just for the sake that we can make sure
we get everything in the right order
you're saying now to prevent me from
being a danger to myself correct and
what would take a lot of work to attempt
this kind of high level integration
ourselves a low-cost workaround is to
use only smart devices that already
speak the same language for example if
you got Google home chromecast and hue
lights you could probably get most the
features that we have in our home for
under 200 bucks but for the home of the
future having a bunch of smart devices
alone isn't good enough all this
technology needs to function together
seamlessly my job as the integrators to
take all of these things and make them
all communicate together on one system
that's easy to use we might not be all
the way there yet
but we're closer than ever for now our
home of the future is as unified as it
gets
making life more convenient and
enjoyable with the push of a button
thank you so much for watching now that
you know what it takes to connect the
devices inside of our home of the future
how do you integrate the devices inside
of your home let us know in the comments
below and we'll see you next week with a
new episode</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
