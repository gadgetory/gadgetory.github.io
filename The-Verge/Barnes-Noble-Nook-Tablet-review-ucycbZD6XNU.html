this is the Nook Tablet which is Barnes
and Nobles new update to the Nook Color
and their competitor to the Amazon fire
and as you can see immediately from
looking at the design it looks exactly
like the color but that's not really a
bad thing the design is really nice in
hand I actually really do like the the
silver finish which has replaced the
black edges on the color
they've also kept the hook in the left
hand corner which is a nice design
element but not really all that useful
it's actually different from the color
in two ways though it is now lighter it
only weighs 0.88 pounds which makes it
really nice in hand and actually on par
with the Kindle in terms of weight and
the second change is on the internal
specs and since it's now a tablet it has
a dual-core TI OMAP processor 1 gigabyte
of RAM and 16 gigabytes of storage which
all around is better than the Kindle the
Kindle only has half a gigabyte of RAM
and also eight gigabytes of storage on
top of that there's a micro SD card slot
right underneath the hook so you can add
some more storage with the Nook Tablet
you'll be spending most of your time
touching the beautiful 7 inch IPS
display I've actually found it to be a
little bit brighter than the Kindle
Fires and the viewing angles to be a bit
better Barnes &amp;amp; Noble hasn't actually
changed too much when it comes to the
software it still looks a lot like the
new color and it is a heavily skinned
version of Android 2.3 but there are
some things I really like about it the
first is the fact that they have a
physical home button
unlike the Kindle Fire and you can
select that and it brings up a list of
commonly used apps and shortcuts when
you're on the home screen itself you can
customize it with apps and books and you
can also resize the icons of course
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble has a big book selection
and they've also added some new features
including a read and play and read and
record function mostly for children's
books that allows you to record your
voice and read back some of the text
well Barnes &amp;amp; Noble does have a good
ecosystem of newspapers and magazines in
its newsstand app they don't have a
great ecosystem when it comes to movies
and videos and music unlike Amazon they
don't have a place to buy music on the
device so you've got a side loaded or
you've got to rely on third-party
applications like Netflix and Hulu Plus
to stream video the app selection also
isn't that great there's Angry Birds and
some other typical apps you may want but
unfortunately the selection in the store
just isn't as good as Amazon
fire the Nook Tablet cost 250 dollars
which is $50 more than Amazon's Kindle
Fire and why you might get nicer
hardware and better specs and double the
memory a Kindle Fire definitely provides
a better ecosystem for downloading music
video and apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
