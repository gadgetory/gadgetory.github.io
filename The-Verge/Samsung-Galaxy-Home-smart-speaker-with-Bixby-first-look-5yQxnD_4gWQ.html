here at Samsung's Unpacked Event
in Brooklyn, New York,
where we just saw a lot of stuff.
We saw the Note 9, the new Galaxy Watch,
and we got our first look
at the long rumored Bixby speaker,
which we now know is called Galaxy Home.
So the speaker itself,
the design is interesting.
It's much bigger than
any of its competitors.
There are several speakers inside,
really premium components, upscale sound.
And there's fabric running around it.
You've got rubberized
touch buttons on top,
a single power wire running into it.
No Aux input, which is
kind of disappointing
to see from Samsung, the
headphone jack company.
So Samsung brought out Spotify CEO
Daniel Ek on stage, and that's
a long term partnership with the company.
Apple has Apple Music for it's home pod.
Amazon has a music service.
But Samsung is gonna ride on Spotify
for its speakers, its phones, its watches.
It's even gonna put Spotify
on Samsung's refrigerator.
So Spotify is gonna be everywhere,
it's gonna take awhile,
but they're making this
sound like a big deal.
It's gonna last a long time.
So just like Apple's homepod
and the other speakers
you can start listening
to the music on your phone
and send it over to the Galaxy Home
and keep listening there.
So Samsung spent a lot of time talking
about Bixby, which has a
bad rap compared to Siri
and Google Assistant.
The company is really trying to
make it smarter, more capable.
It's a hard hill to overcome,
because by now Bixby's reputation
might be pretty tarnished.
We couldn't actually try or
test out the speakers ourselves,
but they brought out 160 Galaxy Home's
and played them all at once,
and that sounded pretty awesome.
Hear it for yourself.
- [Female Narrator] Hi Bixby.
(dramatic music)
- Besides that, we don't know many details
or a price, or when
this thing's coming out.
Samsung just kinda brought it out,
big ol' stage show, and said &quot;It's here,
this is our speaker, coming soon.&quot;
and kinda left it at that.
Thanks for watching, stay
tuned for our full review
of the Galaxy Note 9, coming very soon
and subscribe to The Verge on YouTube.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
