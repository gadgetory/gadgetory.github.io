but between all the social media
networks notifications but a sense that
they're starting to take over our lives
now I have an iPhone 6 and it's a pretty
good phone the problem is I spend a lot
of time on it going through Twitter
Instagram and whatever else so to help
me deal with my iPhone addiction I
decided to play around some more
minimalist phones that includes the unit
Hertz jelly the Nokia 3310 the punk'd
MPO one and the light phone I'm gonna
head to brokens Prospect Park to see how
disconnected I can get this is the jelly
a tiny little Android smartphone unit
Hertz the creators call it impossibly
small amazingly cute and totally
functional only two of those things are
true but I'm kind of getting ahead of
myself first thing you'll notice about
the jelly is just how small it is at
three-and-a-half inches in length it
fits into the palm of my hand it cost
$125 runs on android 7 has a 1.1
gigahertz processor and has front and
rear facing cameras that are 8 and 2
megapixels which isn't that great the
phone runs on 4G network and has dual
SIM clients now because of the thickness
a lot of people thought it had two
slide-out keyboard which it doesn't but
it does have a two and a half inch
touchscreen that's fully functional and
back to those two truths in the line now
the jelly is impossibly small and
amazingly cute and there's just
something cool about having the full
functionality of a smartphone in such a
small package scrolling through an
Instagram live video on such a tiny
screen is just kind of fun and if you
want to disconnect there's a purpose for
the smallness with the screen so small
it adds a level of friction that we're
not typically used to so I found myself
reading less and actually just pulling
my phone out less entirely but the
jelly's small size actually threatens
its functionality using the jelly's
thimble sized keyboard was almost
impossible and i kept making tons of
mistakes in the end I started texting
less because I wanted to make less typos
the jelly's other big drawback is
battery life downloading just a few apps
made my phone hot and I lost almost 20%
of my battery at 83% it told me I only
had four hours of life left which meant
that I had to carry on this huge battery
pack all day long just to make it
through the day and if you want to use
the phone less maybe that's not such a
bad thing
but if you really want to disconnect you
might want to ditch your smartphone for
a feature phone nokia 3310 is one of the
most iconic and popular phones of all
time and in 2017 the company re-released
it as part of its nostalgia driven
marketing push now the new phone
benefits from a larger color screen and
a more bubbly design than its break like
predecessor has a 2 megapixel camera in
the back and runs on no key is
proprietary OS it comes with the classic
2002 erik skeleton Krew apps like a
calculator a calendar and obviously
snake unlike the jelly it has pretty
good battery life about 6 and a half
hours of talktime and 650 hours of
standby time and it's cheap you can get
one for 60 bucks you'll notice the home
screen has a couple of new additions
including a Facebook and Twitter button
but open them up and you get stuck in a
Kia's weird web client that you have to
navigate with the clunky directional pad
it's so hard to use that eventually I
just gave up and maybe free trying to
disconnect that's not really a problem
moving order the Nokia also comes with
another big shift and that's going from
a full keyboard to t9 and if you're like
me you haven't used t9 in a while and
take some getting used to it can
definitely be clunky but if you're
trying to text less it works
t9 nning is too slow to text bomb and
eventually might just stop texting all
together
if you really want to get intentional
about minimalist phones you might want
to check out punked MPO one phone Punk
means period or stop in German and it's
a swiss company that makes minimalist
products a lot of times when people see
that MPL one for the first time they
think it looks like a calculator but I
kind of actually liked the design it
comes in three colors brown black and
white it's four and a half inches tall
it has Gorilla Glass and a fiberglass
reinforced body so it feels sturdy in
the hand navigating the phone is
actually pretty easy because it only
does two things and it has buttons to
navigate towards them and that's texting
and calling the only hitch is that it
costs two hundred thirty dollars which
is a lot for a phone that only does two
things and of those two things it
doesn't do one of them very well and
that's texting so most phones when you
text they create a thread but the MPO
one actually breaks it up like email ins
an inbox sent draft etc which is really
confusing and kind of a pain in the ass
and the phone did a pretty bad job of
capitalizing my sentences when I text
which is really pretty basic stuff it
kind of feels like the perfect phone for
somebody who can afford to hire someone
else to take care of the rest of their
lives oh and did I mention that it only
runs on the 2g network and t-mobile is
one of the few carriers that still
supports 2g in the US and they're gonna
phase it out by 2020 all which makes MPO
once claimed that the Punk'd is a
timeless device feel kind of empty
if there's one phone that really
represents the minimalist phone movement
it's the light phone a business card
sized device that you can either
tethered to your phone or use
independently it cost $150 and literally
only does one thing and that's make
phone calls new phones try to dazzle you
with big bright displays and bezel
design but not the light phone the light
phone really doesn't want any of your
attention it's a beautiful device and a
lot of people I showed it to didn't even
believe that worked
but it works exactly as advertised and
there was something freeing knowing that
I could leave the house just with this
and reach somebody if I'd really need it
to at least I hope I could because if
I'm being honest people don't really
pick up their phones anymore I mean I
make one phone call a day maybe but I'm
texting all the time either through
messenger or slack or Twitter and that
makes the light phone feel like an
experiment more than a viable product an
effort to gauge whether people would
really be interested in such a minimal
device and apparently they are and 2018
the company announced light phone - a 4G
version that would have ink display a
full keyboard and possibly even some
features like maps and music but loading
smartphone features onto such a minimal
device is probably going to have
problems of its own
I spent a lot of time with these phones
over the last couple weeks and what I've
realized is that I don't really want a
phone that limits my communication or
one that makes me make more phone calls
and 20:18 a lot of our communication
happens over text and I don't really
think that's such a bad thing but I
don't really need as all the social
media networks all the notifications a
short battery life and the bezel is
screened that's what kind of makes
phones overwhelming not a text from my
mom or a friend what I really want is a
smart phone functionality stripped of
all the gizmos unfortunately a lot of
these minimalist phones throughout the
texting baby with the social media
bathwater so until they figure that out
I'm just going to delete my social media
apps and keep my iPhone voxcom has a
video that explains how addictive
smartphones could be click here to watch
it and find out how necessary a
minimalist phone could be for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
