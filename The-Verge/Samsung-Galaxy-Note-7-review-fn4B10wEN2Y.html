always has since the idea of a phone
with a big screen was born in that
terrible portmanteau phablet was coined
and with a new note 7 this is the best
big phone that Samsung's ever made it's
a result of years of refinement design
improvements into performance
enhancements if you're looking for the
best phablet you can buy I can tell you
to stop watching right now and just go
place your order because the new note 7
is the best phablet yet earlier notes
stood out not only because they were big
but also because they were powerful is
essentially the most specs you could get
for your money but there's a lot of big
powerful phones out now Samsung's
changing its strategy just a little bit
with the note 7 this time around the
note 7 is leaning on its unique features
and improved s-pen the ability to unlock
your phone with your eyes and a design
that puts every other phone including
the iPhone dashain designs not always
the first thing I talk about with big
phones but with the note 7 really should
be because this is really a breathtaking
design
it's a beautiful object that's
comfortable to hold great to look at and
pleasing to use the symmetry between the
front and the back of the phone not only
make it comfortable but they also make
it feel much smaller than it actually is
even though it has a giant 5.7 inch
display next to a nexus 6p or an iPhone
6s plus the note 7 almost looks small
and certainly is nicer to look at this
is a big phone that was designed to be a
big phone from the start not a small
phone that was stretched out to big
dimensions so let's talk about the s-pen
because aside from the big screen it's
almost a finding characteristic of the
note this year it's better it's got a
finer point and more levels of pressure
sensitivity it's really much nicer to
write with oh and you can't put it in
backwards no matter what you do but the
bigger improvements are found in the
s-pen software you can take notes right
on your lock screen and pin them there
for easy access you can use the pen to
multitask or magnify parts of the screen
or even use it to translate text artists
will appreciate the ability to blend
colors in the new drawing app and where
Samsung used to provide three or four
different apps that work with the s-pen
now there's just one actually makes
sense but my favorite new feature is
ability to use the s-pen to make a gift
from any video I might be watching and
share it right away
now Samsung never really convinced me
before that the s-pen
necessary tool with the note stones new
features at Lisa has me thinking about
it I'm less impressed with the notes
Evans iris scanner which lets me unlock
the phone in my eyes instead of using a
fingerprint or pattern pin password it
definitely works but it can be pretty
clumsy I have to hold the phone really
close to my face to make it happen it's
often just easier to use a fast
fingerprint scanner instead between this
and the ability to take notes right on
my lock screen Samsung is attempting to
remove any barriers that slow me down
from what I'm trying to do but the
execution is not quite there yet now
other things that Samsung's done to
improve the node experience is clean up
the software the settings menu is much
easier to navigate for instance and it's
improved some of the features that
debuted on the s7 like the always-on
display but there are two complaints I
have on the note 7 its price and the
carrier bloatware that continues the
dog' Samsung phones down now I've been
using the t-mobile version which is
about $850 other carrier versions are
even more and all of them have apps that
you don't want or need now the price
isn't unheard of it's directly
competitive with the iPhone 6s plus when
you have phones like the oneplus 3 that
cost less than half that it can be hard
to stomach the only way to get around
the bloatware is to wait for the
unlocked version the Samsung hasn't yet
said when that will be available where
those complaints aside the note 7 is the
best execution on the phablet concept
that Samsung pioneered so many years ago
the screen is big and bright and sharp
just like you'd want it to be the
performance is fast the camera is the
best you can get on the market and the
battery life will last you all day and
it charges really quickly whether you do
that wired or wirelessly it has
everything you could want and high-end
phone in 2016 but your decision might
not end there because Samsung has
another really great phone with almost
as big of a screen that came out earlier
this year the Galaxy s7 edge and the
note 7 shares a lot with the s7 edge it
has the same screen resolution that same
specs the same processor the same camera
the same water resistance in the same
expandable storage its screen is even
curved in a similar way to the s7 edges
if you were to choose the edge over the
note 7 I wouldn't blame you it's an
excellent device but if you can spend a
little bit more money and deal with a
slightly bigger screen you're rewarded
with better design better software and
more functionality if you want the best
phablet you can get and you're willing
to pay for it
Samsung Galaxy Note 7 is the king of the
hill so I think if you go phone farther
back and you get the cameras here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
