this thing this is the new iPad pro and
this one is actually the most iPad pro
you can get this is the 12 point 9 inch
version with one terabyte of storage and
LTE with the optional 199 dollar
keyboard cover and 129 dollars of Apple
pencil on top
this is $2,200 of iPad pro it is big in
bad and mean looking it has an 8 core a
12 X processor that is just lightning
fast it has this new Apple pencil that
clips on magnetically and charges
wirelessly and it has a USB C port that
can theoretically let it connect to
basically anything it's more expensive
than my laptop with a processor that
benchmarks faster than Apple's own core
i7 MacBook Pros this iPad pro is a beast
if a muscle car could turn into a tablet
it would turn into this and I should
love this I should love it it should
keep me up at night it should make my
heart flutter every time I see it it it
should be my computer my number one
go-to computer but it's not am I tell
you why so it's no secret that Apple's
lead and tablets is just silly no other
company has a tablet that offers the
same power Absolution ease-of-use and
battery life is the iPad pro last year
when g2 reviewed the 10.5 inch iPad pro
he said it was basically like Apple
showing off and this new iPad pro is
definitely Apple showing off again
especially when it comes to hardware
there are two sizes 11 inches in 12.9
the 11 inch model fits a larger screen
and the same size body is the old 10.5
inch model and the 12.9 shrinks the body
down to fit the screen the 12.9 is
basically the same size as a sheet of
paper now although I'm gonna tell you it
feels a lot bigger than that Apple likes
to say that both models had an edge to
edge displays but I mean
nothing about this vessel is edge to
edge but it is an extremely nice LCD
screen that's 264 points per inch on
both sizes and it has apples fancy new
rounded corner technology that the
company calls liquid retina that's a
little confusing because the iPhone 10 R
also has a liquid retina LCD but the
iPad display is way better than the 10 R
screen with a faster 120 Hertz promotion
variable refresh rate better viewing
angles brightness and wider color
support so I asked Apple and they told
me that liquid retina really just means
rounded corners that's it the new iPad
pro is also the first really really new
Apple hardware design language in a long
time instead of rounded corners and soft
shapes it's all hard corners and flat
size with big exposed antenna lines in
the back and a huge camera bump it kind
of looks like the MacBook Pro but it's
also kind of brutal looking almost like
a reference design most people I showed
it to you thought it was kind of cool
especially in a space gray finish but
it's taking a while to grow up you'll
also notice that there's no home button
just like the iPhone 10 the new iPad pro
has a site it's the same true depth
camera system with a 7 megapixel camera
infrared projector and IR sensor but it
works in any orientation landscape
upside down whatever if your palm is
covering the camera while you're holding
that pad it'll tell you and if you have
it at the bottom it'll tell you to look
down to unlock which is pretty neat you
can also double tap the spacebar if you
have the keyboard cover on to unlock
which is really fast and kind of
reminiscent of Windows hello the lack of
a home button means that you now
navigate the iPad pro using the same
gestures as the iPhone 10 so you can tap
to wake swipe up to go home swipe up a
little bit more to open the app launcher
swipe up just a little bit to open the
dock and swipe between apps along the
bottom here now this will even preserve
your app layout so if you've got two
apps on one screen they'll be right
there when you come back and of course
you can pop over certain apps to get
something done quickly if you need to
these two gestures are all pretty
intuitive to pick up especially if
you've been using
1:10 but there's a lot going on when you
swipe up and getting the doc and not the
app switcher is a lot harder than you
would think you have to take a minute to
really dial it it apart from screen size
both sides of the iPad pro are identical
internally with the new 8 core a 12 X
processor 4 speakers the smart connector
for keyboards on the back instead of the
bottom a 12 megapixel camera with smart
HDR no more headphone jack and a new
USBC port on the bottom to replace the
lightning connector I'd normally keep
going here but that USB C port is really
what you all came to see right so let's
just start plugging stuff in and see
what happens
boop-boo-boo-boop so here's the deal
with one huge exception most everything
you'd want to plug into a USB C port
works if you have an app that supports
it we tried a bunch of hubs an HDMI
adapter a keyboard a camera a microphone
even a VGA adapter and silly USB
accessories like this fan the USB C
ecosystem is not super well developed
but the stupid accessories are
definitely out in force the iPad pro
will charge a phone it'll charge a
Nintendo switch we tried some pro DJ
gear but that didn't work because
there's no app support for it and
neither did this cheap HP printer but
honestly what were you expecting but the
main thing I want to plug into an iPad
simply doesn't work external storage you
can plug as many flash drives or hard
drives as you want into this USB C port
and nothing will happen they won't show
up in your apps
they won't show up in Apple's files app
nothing if you plug a camera into the
iPad or an SD card from your camera into
a card reader iOS 12 will automatically
pop open the camera import screen and
let you import photos into your camera
roll that's it
you can't even import photos directly
into an app like Lightroom cc Apple has
to be in the middle now I asked Apple
about this because I use like your MCC
all over the time and I don't want to
clutter up my camera roll and iCloud
storage with huge RAW files
and apples big solution is that Adobe
wrote a series shortcut the imports
photos into Lightroom and then
automatically deletes them from the
camera which is basically a hack to be
honest a neat hack that works sure but a
hack and this is essentially the story
of the iPad pro and it's why I can't
just use it the way I want to either you
have to completely understand the
limitations of iOS so well you can make
use of these little hacks all over the
place to get things done or you just
deal with it and accept the fact you
have to go back to a real computer from
time to time because it's just easier
and it's the same all over iOS 12 on the
iPad for the most part iOS 12 is super
fast and fun to use but there are
roadblocks everywhere this new iPad pro
is faster than my actual laptop but the
mobile version of Safari just is in a
desktop class browser so it kicks you
out to apps all the time I don't want to
use Apple Mail I don't but I can't set
Outlook or Gmail to be the default so I
kind of end up in Apple Mail all the
time and I hate to tell you this but
since Apple refuses to support Google's
vp9 video codec there is literally no
way to watch YouTube in 4k on this
$2,000 tablet you just can't do it in
the browser or in the app these kinds of
little stumbles just happen when you use
an iPad all day and until now we've been
really forgiving of iPads because we
knew Apple was taking its time building
up the iPad into a real computer it was
supposed to get there but you know what
I'm tired of waiting it's obvious that
Apple has a massive processor
performance lead and I desperately want
to push this a 12 X to the limit and use
the iPad pro is my main computer but
over and over again I can't and I don't
think it's just me being stuck in some
old way of thinking or needing to spend
more time discovering a new workflow or
understanding Siri shortcuts better this
is just basic stuff like plugging in a
flash drive or quickly changing the name
of a file before emailing it off I don't
want to adapt to my computer I want my
computer to adapt to me Apple's keyboard
cover has the same keys as before they
feel exactly the same but the whole
thing has been redesigned and it's
better and worse than the
on the plus side there's no more weird
hump in the middle or origami folding
this is just much simpler and cleaner
but if you open it and just want to use
it as a tablet you have to feel these
keys on the back which is just not very
Apple like and while the Google pixel
slate and the surface pro offered near
infinite adjustments I really just get
the two with the iPad pro you got that
one that's about it I would bet third
parties like Logitech offer much nicer
keyboards in the future just like they
did with the older iPad pro so I would
take a minute and see what they do the
Apple pencil has also been redesigned
but I'll be honest I'm just not that
much of an artist so I gave the iPad pro
2 verge design director William Joel and
also tada Miele verge tech reporter who
also happens to be a published
cartoonist to see what they thought of
the new pencil and what it's like to use
the iPad pro is professional creatives
everyday the second generation Apple
pencil is a huge improvement over the
old no matter which way you look at it
the first Apple pencil was already
pretty great specs wise in terms of
pressure sensitivity and Tom rejection
so there wasn't much to improve upon
there but the new magnetic charging
method just makes so much more sense
it's what the original pencil should
have had instead of this horrible
charging situation that required you to
take off the cap so you can lose it
immediately and plug it into the
Lightning port so you can accidentally
snap your pencil in half apples added a
new feature where you can tap the pencil
to the screen and it will wake it up and
immediately launch the Notes app which
is pretty useful but you can't really
program it to open any other app like
this there's also a new gesture control
feature on the pencil where you can
double tap the sides to switch to an
eraser or the last tool that you use and
the upcoming Photoshop for iPad which
launches next year Apple says you can
customize a gesture to other tools like
zoom but I can't really see myself using
this feature it's hard to get it exactly
right and it's not as natural as just
having a button on the side it's also
kind of unfortunate that the new pencil
despite being $30 more expensive than
the last $99 pencil doesn't work with
any other iPad besides the new iPad pro
and alternatively you can't use your old
Apple pencil with a new iPad pro
which is kind of a bummer considering
Microsoft's newest surface pro six is
compatible with its server Spence three
and up I know some artists who've always
felt that the Apple pencil is too thin
to hold comfortably compared to the
thicker Wacom pens or the surface pens
that hasn't changed with the new pencil
as it's basically the same size and
feels about the same as before
there are silicone grips you can buy for
the first generation Apple pencil but
the new magnetic charging process in the
second pencil means you'd have to take
it off every time you want to charge it
but still I take this new magnetic
charging process over the old one any
day the first thing that I noticed using
the new iPad pro is how crazy fast the
refresh rate is I have a iPad Mini from
early 2018 and it is nowhere like as
beautiful - just like swipe and I could
do this for hours
so we wanted to kind of push it and test
it a little bit and see like well if
it's rated at like a MacBook Pro can't
work like one so we were using Adobe
rush editing 4k footage and surprisingly
it handled working with 4k footage just
fine right at least it did for me we had
no problem making a sequence that is
roughly 10 minutes long and then we
exported it and timed it and it took
about as long as it would take on my
iMac which is kind of crazy so while
this is as powerful or maybe even more
powerful than my macbook pro what it
lacks are the apps and that's really
important to me I like to work within
Adobe's Creative Cloud and the apps that
hasn't here like rush and like the beta
Photoshop are nowhere near as strong or
powerful as they would be on my macbook
and for $2,200 having like the baby
versions of them isn't really what I
want the good news is that this is
definitely powerful enough to use apps
like that and hopefully down the line
maybe we'll get a cinema 4d or something
but until then we're just gonna have to
wait look if you're the sort of person
who might spend over $2,000 on a maxed
out iPad pro you probably know exactly
why you need one what you're gonna use
it for and whether it's worth it to you
that's great and you're gonna find the
switch to USB see super convenient the
new pencil to be much nicer and the a 12
X to be a significant performance boost
but if you're just thinking about
spending $7.99 the cheapest 64 gig 11
inch iPad pro to replace your main
computer
you should really ask yourself what you
use a computer for and whether you can
deal with the limitations of iOS every
single day there isn't a single other
tablet on the market that can compete
with the raw Hardware of the iPad pro
and honestly there aren't many laptops
that can either but apples approach to
iOS is holding that hardware back in
serious in meaningful ways and while you
SPC makes life with this iPad pro
slightly easier it still has the same
basic capabilities and limitations of
last years I've had Pro and so just like
dieter said last year if you know
exactly how to get what you want out of
iOS and you must have the best thing the
iPad pro is definitely the best thing
for me it's all just too frustrating and
while I love using the pencil to edit
photos in Lightroom on this display the
iPad pro is still just an accessory to
my laptop not a replacement for it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
