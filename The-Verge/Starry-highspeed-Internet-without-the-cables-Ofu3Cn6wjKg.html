here at the debut of starry a new
company that is promising to bring you
super high speed internet over the air
so star says that can deliver you
gigabit speed internet we've seen this
before from Google and Comcast and
Verizon but that was delivered through
fibre under the ground star II is
promising to do it over the air no
construction no big wires coming into
your house just beamed to you like it
was Wi-Fi they're using a part of the
spectrum known as millimeter wave up
till now it's been extremely difficult
to broadcast internet signal over that
with distance and accuracy they say
they've come up with some crazy new
technology that can do it and they want
to sell you a very fancy Wi-Fi router to
grab that signal that Wi-Fi router would
work with ordinary Internet to become
your ISP they also have to build out a
network all across the city they're
starting in Boston this March they're
going to put these giant phased array
stations in and they're also going to
sell consumers a two-part system that
sits outside their house to grab the
signal and inside to broadcast into your
station so you had a really ambitious
start up an area taking on big TV now
you have a really ambitious start up in
the broadband internet world and I think
one of the things you talked about was
that there are some real issues with
robbing access in the country maybe talk
to me a little about what was the
motivation here you know globally
there's going to be ever increasing
desire for broadband and right now their
efforts going on from a coverage
perspective but in dense metropolitan
areas
you have to build a broadband system if
you're going to keep up with it so so we
decided that this made a lot of sense I
think in the u.s. there's tremendous
opportunity because of the competitive
dynamics and how difficult it is to do
actually build out a broadband system
right so this is far easier right than
digging up the ground to put in fiber or
flying a fleet of drones overhead that
are beaming down the internet the issue
was like true that's a good idea yeah
what you're welcome to use drones as
well maybe you know redundant technology
but the issue was that for a millimeter
wave which is what you guys are using
nobody had figured out how to make it go
far enough and be able to penetrate
walls those are the kind of the two
problems that you had to solve but far
enough is it is a complex problem
because it's not just you can make
anything go far enough it's a question
of how much power you want to put
through it I mean just to put it in
context right a satellite when it
communicates where they down makes
roughly in the millimeter but not
roughly well it falls in the millimeter
wave bands it's just a ton of power
that's coming down power is expensive
and I don't mean like you know wattage
is expensive the technology to create
our powers
so the challenge is to solve how do you
do
far enough with low-cost which is
commercially viable gosh it's a very
ambitious kind of wild plan to take on
big broadband they don't actually own
the spectrum they want to use yet
they're just testing it from the suc
you're hoping to either win it in the
upcoming auction or license it from the
person who does this is a company that
tried to take on and revolutionize the
way we watch TV they ended up losing but
it went all the way to the Supreme Court
now they're trying to radically rethink
the way we get Internet high-speed
Internet a lot to see how it turns out
