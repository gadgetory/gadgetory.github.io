SmartWatch but for Samsung it's actually
a year two and it's best SmartWatch
effort yet is the gear to a refinement
of last year's ill-fated Galaxy gear
Samsung is fine-tuned almost everything
in the $299 gear to its slimmer lighter
more comfortable to wear quicker to use
and longer-lasting between charges it's
also more attractive to look at but it
doesn't quite shake off the I'm wearing
a computer on my wrist and everyone
knows it appearance last year's model is
clunky uncomfortable and frankly pretty
ugly the gear 2 is a great improvement
in those respects I've worn it for a
week straight without finding too much
of a burden on my wrist the main
attraction here is still the 1.6 3 inch
square Super AMOLED display that's
bright colorful has great viewing angles
and is easy to read outdoors it's a
touchscreen and it remains your main
point of interaction with the gear 2 but
below it samsung has put a convenient
home button so you don't have to rely on
swipe gestures quite as much as before
the display is not always on but the
gear 2 is much better at waking up when
you lift your arm up to check the time
making it much less annoying to do so
the other big changes Samsung did to the
hardware was move the camera off of the
strap and integrate it into the watch
housing itself as a result the design is
much sleeker the camera is less of an
eyesore and crucially it lets you swap
the strap for a different one it took me
less than five minutes to put on a more
comfortable leather strap to replace the
included plastic II rubber one on the
gear 2 Samsung did add a couple of new
hardware features of the gear 2 this
time around there's an integrated IR
blaster which can be programmed to
control an entertainment system and like
the fitness focus gear fit the gear 2
can measure your heart rate and track
your steps or sleep activity step
counting is significantly more accurate
than the gear fit and it's a welcome
addition to the gear 2 but the heart
rate monitor remains slow and difficult
to use
fortunately samsung's s health app that
pairs with the gear 2 and gear fit has
been updated to display sleep tracking
information but I'm still not convinced
that how useful that information
actually is the gear 2 also has the same
fitness coaching features as the gear
fit but it's bigger size and heavier
weight make it less comfortable to wear
when you're working out you can now load
music on the gear 2 itself so you don't
need to carry around your phone when
you're doing a workout but the interface
to do so is pretty clunky and it doesn't
do anything for you if you Spotify or
another streaming service Samsung says
the gear 2 is more responsive and faster
to use than last year's model and for
the most part that's the truth the
interface hasn't changed at all visually
but under the hood
swap the Android software for a platform
based on Tizen you can't tell the
difference between the two but the
chances that the gear 2 will ever work
with a non Samsung smartphone are pretty
slim now swipes and gestures are more
responsive and it makes the whole
experience much less frustrating than
before but notifications especially from
third-party apps are still not very
useful and you have to use Samsung's own
messaging and mail apps to take
advantage of the quick message replies
and other conveniences
it also requires way too many tabs to
clear notification with the new platform
Samsung is supporting third-party apps
which can be downloaded via the gear
companion app on a Samsung smartphone at
this point the app choices are pretty
limited with most of them consisting of
calculators or custom watch faces one of
the big features of the original Galaxy
gear was the ability to make and receive
phone calls from your wrist dick tracy
style the gear 2 still does this but it
doesn't improve the experience much I
still have to project my voice quite a
bit for the other party to hear me and
when they speak the audio quality is
pretty low it's still a parlor trick
more than a useful feature you could do
other things with your voice too such as
set timers call contacts and so forth
but you still have to touch the screen
at some point to confirm your command
which feels unnecessary when you just
want to start a timer while cooking in
the kitchen battery life was a big
problem with last year's Galaxy gear
requiring you to charge it every day
just like your smartphone the gear 2
does better but not by much I still had
to charge it every two and a half days
and it requires a clunky clip-on adapter
that's easy to lose a smaller watcher
can be charged on the weekend and lasts
through to the next weekend would be
ideal but this gear 2 is not there yet
overall the gear 2 is a marked
improvement over last year's model but
to be honest that wasn't a very high bar
to me Samsung improved a number of
things from the design of the hardware
to the responsiveness of the software to
the battery life between charges but a
number of nagging issues remain and if
you're not using a Samsung smartphone
you can't get in on the fun at all the
gear 2 is definitely the best SmartWatch
Samsung has created and it's a better
option than the Galaxy gear or the
fitness focus gear fit for pretty much
everything but this is the year the
SmartWatch and there are certainly
better things on the horizon you might
just want to wait for one of those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
