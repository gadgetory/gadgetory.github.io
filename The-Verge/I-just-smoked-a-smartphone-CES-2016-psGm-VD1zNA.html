they said disruption was dead five out
of ten they said this show well I just
smoked a smartphone so they like them
apples
so this is the Jupiter vapor phone from
vapor cave I saw this thing earlier in
the year I called it the ultimate vapor
where I don't know anybody who actually
needs this but I can imagine a lot of
people would have some fun using it it's
basically a generic Android phone that's
been reskin as vapor Kade and then on
the top here it's got a cartridge full
of liquid and a little attachment for
you to smoke through the phone is what
provides the power and they say you can
get 800 puffs or about four packs of
cigarettes in here now this phone
doesn't have a sim card in it so we
can't test calls or go on the internet
but again this is just a prototype
they're promising to send us a full
review unit later it's run in KitKat 4.4
and from what I can tell it's a generic
Android phone with a very special ma
so the 3G version of this is already out
that's 300 bucks the 4G version is
coming soon that'll be 500 bucks and the
idea is that you if you're one of those
people who carries around a large you
know custom vape and a big phone you
might want to combine those two things
into one and save some pocket space the
company buy on this is really crazy
apparently one of the guys involved says
he holds the first patent on
e-cigarettes from 1963 they also make
electronic cigarettes to go along with
the phone and a special brand of coffee
that tastes really good with their
e-cigarette liquid the whole thing seems
kind of ridiculous but I'm enjoying
smoking this phone I'm going to look
like a total baller in the club tonight
and when we get the review unit we'll
take things more seriously for now this
is CES 2016 I'm Ben popper with The
Verge be sure to subscribe to the
YouTube channel and kids invincible
hey ya know I was that guy from the club
last night remember me
with the glasses and no hair to do with
the crazy phone yeah exactly
hang on a sec hello she hung up on me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
