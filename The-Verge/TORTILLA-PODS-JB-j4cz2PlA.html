gadget called the flat Bev which is
basically like a cross between an
easy-bake oven in a Keurig and how it
works is you get a bunch of pods with
dough and you put them inside the
Machine and it creates a tortilla for
you you're going to take this pod we're
going to put it in here now the thing to
know is that this is a prototype but it
should work when it gets to your
apartment you're going to slide a Chuck
choose whether you have a flour or corn
tortilla decide how crispy you like it
and then within one to two minutes it
should come out into this drawer so the
plots up is going to start at $400 if
you don't get it for a Kickstarter
pre-order and also the pods are going to
cost 70 cents each and that's just a
starting level I mean it's going to go
up depending on the flavors as far as
the taste test I mean they're definitely
tasty they're fresh they're warm what's
not to like but at the end of the day
it's a $400 machine I'm really not sure
who's going to be buying this and also
tortillas are inherently cheap to make
it's literally corn flour and water
mixed together put in a pan it is
convenient though so maybe there's
someone out there who wants it for me I
think I'm going to stick to my three
dollar taco truck tacos thanks for
watching make sure you subscribe to our
YouTube channel youtube.com slash The
Verge and thanks for tuning in bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
