and this is an emotional sweater no
really think of it as a mood ring but on
a much larger softer scale this is tech
and motions wearable fashion show an
offshoot of the New York Fashion Show
where designers show off what the future
of fashion is going to be until now
we've only heard about how tech
companies can make more fashionable
products is the pebble Steel's design
the best first SmartWatch can Nike make
its fuel band even sporty-er will Google
glass ever look normal but while
everyone has been focusing on the
consumer electronics world the fashion
industry has been playing we saw jackets
and bags outfitted with tracking sensors
that would alert you if you forgot
something these come from the
up-and-coming designer Asher Levine
who's worked for the likes of Beyonce
and Lady gaga I collaborate with
different technology companies and
integrate their technology into you know
various products that we make here I'm
inspired by biology in nature and as you
can see like the inspiration is like you
know grenade meets reptile and then it
integrates a phone halo tracker device
and what it is it's a chip that tethers
to your phone via bluetooth if you walk
away from your bag or your bag gets
stolen your phone will beep and if you
can't find your phone then you just use
the chip to beep through your phone to
find your phone in addition to mood
enhancing garb we saw 3d printed shoes
that yes you can actually walk in some
designs are rather extravagant with the
fluidity only possible from 3d printing
while others just look like your basic
department store shoe but many of the
best designs are the most subtle leg
ministry of supplies classic business
where it's special fabric acts like a
battery absorbing and releasing you need
depending on the environment but it
looks and feels just like your favorite
dress shirt some of the biggest ways
that fashion can use technology won't be
so obvious or outward-facing its
integrated sensors and 3d printing
detailed patterns it's technology not as
the final product but
the toolbox from which ideas can come
from and designers can now experiment
and produce these faster and cheaper
I don't downtown shop we like create
different types of materials and you
know as you can see in many of the
things that you know we make out the
shop it looks like it could be a skin
from an alien or a skin from a
prehistoric creature that's what I kind
of wanted you I I wish I could get that
prehistoric crocodile skin right now but
unfortunately that was 30 million years
ago so we do is we use different
material innovative processes to create
the skins that I actually want to use
some of the ideas we've only seen in
science fiction are now starting to
become a reality it may be a ways away
before we see these things in our
shopping malls but the fashion industry
is already working towards that the line
dividing tech and fashion is rapidly
blurring and traditionally designers
have been plagued with the age-old
question of form versus function but the
next generation of designers will be
asking an entirely new question why not
