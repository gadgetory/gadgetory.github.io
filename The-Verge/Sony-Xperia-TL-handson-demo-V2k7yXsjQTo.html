a look at the Sony Xperia ZL for AT&amp;amp;T
it's a very similar device to the Xperia
T that we saw back at efit last month it
is a android 4.0 handset that has a four
point six inch 720p display and it's
running ICS unfortunately with a Sony
skin on it the hardware itself is
basically unchanged from what we saw
PACA deepa on the international
experience here of the TX as a curved
back and it's a smooth matte finish
there's a 13 megapixel camera on the
back that 18teen Sonia talking a lot
about and otherwise it has on-screen
buttons that we've seen on more than new
Sony Xperia devices and AT&amp;amp;T has put its
globe logo right on the front there when
you're using the device it's driving the
wrong spot it feels like we could
imagine some consumers would want to
click the floor logo instead of the
right button but that's the decision
that they made otherwise performance is
pretty good as you can see here it's all
very fast with the 1.5 gigahertz Paul
concrete processor 204 and it has a 1
gigabyte of ram and 16 gigabytes of
storage
one other complaint that we are about
the device on the side if you can see
here the power buttons in the middle of
the device and it is the volume rocker
and then the camera a two-stage camera
button the power buttons in a spot where
it's a little hard to use in our opinion
but we're sure some people will get used
to it it's a quick look at the Xperia T
