in the driver's seat of a BMW i3 today
this is the company's first
mass-produced practical all electric
sedan part of BMWs new I range of
vehicles the other being d i8 which is a
hybrid supercar so you have the full
spectrum on one end d FD exotic supercar
on this end you have the practical
family college let's see what this thing
can do so the i3 doesn't really have the
pickup of $100,000 Tesla Model S but
then again this car starts around
$40,000 so all things considered it's
pretty quick as a lot of EVs are the
interior is really unique if you've ever
been in a BMW don't expect this to feel
familiar they have this really cool
natural looking bamboo in the dash and
then you have these these sort of
exposed fiber accents that kind of
indicate that the car is like very
ecologically friendly and if you open
the the the door the frame of the car
itself is all carbon fiber BMWs been
working for a long time and sort of
figuring out how to mass-produce carbon
fiber which is typically a really
expensive material they've done it and
this car is all carbon fiber which
reduces the weight of it quite a bit is
that extensive range the car is equipped
with I Drive as most BMWs are these days
and it works pretty well here you have
the knob in this in the
in the center console with a touchpad on
top of it that you can use to spell
letters the car has a few different
modes depending on how much rains you
want to try to squeeze out of it there's
a comfort mode in Eco Pro Mode and Eco
Pro Plus in order of lease efficient the
most efficient the car is available in
two different versions there's an
all-electric which is what we're driving
and then there's also an electric with a
range extender engine in it and it's
just a little tiny 2 cylinder engine and
it's only job is to keep the battery
charged enough to allow the electric
motors to run any time that you need to
go you can just put des in the tank we
have about a hundred miles even if you
have nothing in the battery whereas with
the all-electric version is just like
any other easy you've got to charge it
up with this particular charger you can
get up to 80% in about 45 minutes to an
hour which is not bad all things
considered remember back to our Tesla
shoot from last year where we almost got
stuck out on the road we plugged in to a
standard charger EB charger that we
found in murrow Bay California and it
took all night to get to about the same
level shark so really not that at all
this car is not on sale yet it's going
on presale this week this is actually
the launch the grand launch here at CES
I'll be available in spring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
