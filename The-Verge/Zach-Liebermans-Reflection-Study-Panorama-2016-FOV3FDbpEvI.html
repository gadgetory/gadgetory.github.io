inaugural panorama music festival in New
York City and we're going to be hosting
the lab an incredible interactive art
space running all weekend long we spoke
to Zack Lieberman an artist with work in
this year's space his piece is called
reflection studies as an artist I'm
really interested in exploring how
people communicate there's so many
interesting properties of light when you
think about reflection or refraction the
way light looks like when it's moving
through a glass of water for me that
those aren't really beautiful so I
started to experiment with those and
invite other people to try it so we have
a light table which is illuminated from
below and then there's these cut pieces
of plexiglass and then we have a camera
above that sort of watching the scene
and I've written software that analyzes
the data from the camera and uses that
geometry with this light simulation
really interested in very primitive
geometry so taking things like circles
and squares and rectangles and arcs and
also typography and then in a lot of
ways there's this joy even this magic of
likes they put their hands down and the
light comes into their hands and it
feels like they're holding lights and
you can see people's eyes light up when
they're using it how many times have you
been to a museum and it says do not
touch but I always want to just have
signs that say please touch and I'm
really interested in just this notion of
using code to make poetry for this kind
of projects I really love having them in
a festival having them in a place where
there's a lot of people it where it's
unexpected to encounter art you know you
go to a museum you know you're going to
see our work but if you go to a music
festival you've seen a band or you like
waiting you know for some set to come on
and like you turn the corner and there's
an artwork when i'm doing this animation
when I'm creating these software studies
for me it's a form of music I just hope
that people have fun and perform with it
you know part of it is that you're a bit
when you use it you're lit up and so
it's like you're on stage and you're
kind of performing and jamming the most
exciting thing about this medium is to
build these systems and then I'm
constantly surprised by what the
audience does I'm constantly surprised
by what the participants do when they're
using these things</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
