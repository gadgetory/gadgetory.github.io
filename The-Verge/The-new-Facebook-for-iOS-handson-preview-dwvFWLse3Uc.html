this is the new facebook app for iphone
and ipad facebook has obviously been
giving Android a ton of attention lately
with facebook home and its new messenger
app but now it's time for iOS to get a
little bit of attention to the biggest
addition is chat heads these little
floating friend bubbles that you can use
to have immediate text conversations
since iOS is more locked down than
Android Facebook can't make them appear
anywhere and it can't integrate them
with your SMS messages but they do
appear inside the Facebook app itself
and within that app they do work exactly
the same you can drag them around and
use them to quickly switch between
conversations Facebook is also adding a
few other messaging features on iOS like
stickers this is something borrowed from
other private messaging apps and you can
think of them like giant emoji they're
big cute pictures you can send up the
single tab stickers come in groups and
Facebook will offer some for free and
probably charge for others they're fun
in a silly way but I doubt they'll
convince anybody to switch to facebook
Messenger you can also only send them
from an iphone for now though you can
receive them anywhere last but not least
Facebook has finally given some real
thought to how its app should look on an
iPad back in 2010 Mark Zuckerberg
famously said that the iPad isn't mobile
but since then the company has seen the
light and now it's trying to make the
ipad app feel a little bit less like a
giant iphone app the main changes come
in news feed which is now a little bit
thinner and your friends avatars are
broken out on the left it's not a
radical change from how it looked before
but it does make your newsfeed much
easier to read small design changes like
making fonts bigger and more consistent
no longer cropping images to an
arbitrary aspect ratio and adding more
details and Link posts all work together
to make it a somewhat simpler nicer
experience so that's Facebook six point
0 an iPhone an iPad it's a bunch of
messaging features and a little design
cleanup but it's not the radical
rethinking a facebook on mobile that the
company is proposing on Android if it
ain't broke don't fix it but maybe slap
some fun stickers on there to try and
keep things feeling fresh
