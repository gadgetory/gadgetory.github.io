CES 2017
you know I'm surrounded by technology
here and it's putting out Wi-Fi
Bluetooth cell phone radiation
some people say all those invisible rays
can be bad for your body which is why
I'm wearing an interesting new gadget
the future of boxers smart underwear
Spartan that can protect my most
important gadget from all that harmful
radiation so the Spartan underwear were
created by a to french entrepreneurs
from Paris what they did is they figured
out a way to weave silver the metal into
the cotton of these underwear now I got
to say these things feel really
comfortable
pretty much like normal on to it but
they're also creating an electromagnetic
shield around my junk or at least that's
what the guys said
Spartan underwear launched here at CES
you can order them online they're $45 a
pair or cheaper if you go for the six
pack right now they're shipping from
France but pretty soon they'll be
shipping from the US and of course
they're made in China
now I'm not here to testify for the
scientific validity of these Spartans
and they're definitely not FDA approved
but when it comes to CES - all about the
meeting of technology and the real world
this is the tech at its finest
same gun whoops</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
