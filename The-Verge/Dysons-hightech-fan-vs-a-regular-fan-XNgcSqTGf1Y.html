because I have here the insanely
futuristic Dyson pure cooling fan it is
so hot it's not the first thing off of
Amazon's that H why I don't know it's a
Honeywell fan you really expect to get
by with a simple fan like that it's a
fan
your funeral bliss this is no ordinary
fan I can see that it is the Ferrari of
fan that doesn't make sense it has Wi-Fi
air filtration and this amazing
bladeless design none of that is
necessary there but it is incredible I'm
able to turn this on have my air
filtered for allergens and dirt get nice
cool air flowing through my own stay a
little bit cooler myself and receive
stats via connected ass mine can turn
side to side so can mine I also have 10
air speed settings and the ability to
schedule my fan turns on and off every
day ok my only has 5 air speed settings
but look I felt yours it's not that fast
it's exactly as fast as it needs to be -
why lightly cool the home through extra
airflow ok fine it's look it works it's
great but you're eating something out
hardly really what's the price of what
the price art looks like but not that
five five five five five hundred dollars
ok yeah this is $50 and does the exact
same thing I wouldn't expect you to
understand this thing looks like it came
off of a spaceship use technology that I
can only assume is derived from the
Roswell crash you know back in forty
seven to push air out like magic no
blades there aren't like blades in the
base maybe I wouldn't know okay because
I've heard that thing and it still feel
out just turn the speed down my man ten
settings but that's the whole point it's
summer I'm hot I bought a fan it's
summer and I bought a fan to cool down I
sent out like yours is any quieter well
I'll use the extra money buy some
headphones by the way related fans are
also very dangerous minor covered and
hideous your design is not
that cool oh really okay it's pretty
cool if you're sensible human being with
five hundred dollars is there there is
no simpler decision than buying the
Dyson pure cooling fan for the summer
and it works great in the winter as an
air purifier you know how bad the
allergens get yeah what look I'll admit
being able to filter out dirt is pretty
cool
most fan surges below that tough
everywhere which is disgusting but I
could buy an air purifier separately if
I want one and it'll still be much
cheaper at the end of the day this gets
me just as cool physically cool not
truly cool I'm going outside okay
looking really good you might better
looking super lame</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
