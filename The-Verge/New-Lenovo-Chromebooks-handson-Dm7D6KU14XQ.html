and in front of me is a stack of new
Chromebooks from Lenovo first of all
there's the Lenovo 100 a Chromebook
which is $219
then there's the Lenovo 300 a Chromebook
which is $279 and finally there's a novo
500 e Chromebook which is $349 so these
are super affordable and just looking at
them they're big and chunky and kind of
hard to distinguish just from the
outside but there are pretty cool
features on the inside which made them
stand out and actually make me excited I
did anticipate that I'd be getting
excited about Chromebooks here at MWC
which is traditionally a phone show so
the 100 e is the entry-level model and
it has the basic features across this
entire series which is that it's
designed to be used and abused in
schools it has a spill proof keyboard it
has a pre-poo of keyboards you can tear
it open as a drop resistant design up to
30 inches which I'm European I don't
know exactly what that means but it
makes a really rugged in solid laptops
one thing I really enjoyed about all
three of these laptops is also the
keyboard it's an 11 point 6 inch screen
on the inside and there's just a really
beautiful keyboard in there weird lots
of key travel so all of these things are
great but the 100 has a really terrible
screen it has really awful viewing
angles so I wouldn't recommend it I will
step up to 300 a for the better display
B for the fact that also flips out in
yoga style hinge which is kind of a
Lenovo signature and see you can take
notes with a pencil and I literally mean
a HB pencil it's been designed to be
used with a regular pencil it doesn't
leave any marks on the screen it's
really cool really convenient and again
with the application the intended
application for schools it fits in
really nicely you'll be using this
that's cool another difference between
180 and the 308 is they have mediatek
processor in the 300 intel celeron
in 100 and the 300 also has a full SD
card slot whereas the 100 and 500 makes
you with a micro SD so the 508 just like
the 300 e is designed to take notes only
with a pen but it comes with its own
stylus and the experience of actually
you
is significantly better so the
difference is you can't use a regular
pencil signals in this laptop but it is
pretty much lag free so it tracks you
perfectly as you go along
there is almost no delays it was some
delay but it's almost no delay between
the line showing up on the screen and
the stylus and the gesture on the screen
there's plenty of leg room 300 and 300
also does have palm rejection which is
fine it does so I've been playing around
with it here at MWC and I've loved it
like doodling taking notes and
everything else and I don't really love
the screens on any of these laptops but
it's perfectly fine to do that kind of
note taking and just messing around with
which you know given the price is really
nice I do also want to return to the
keyboard which is just so much key
travel and it's just such a pleasure to
type on and say mmm obviously is usually
a function we're not used to looking at
a whole bunch of laptops and especially
not Chromebooks of this size and design
I mean these are really chunky and not
the most attractive things in world but
I think that lenovo has gotten the
basics and the fundamentals down really
well with these devices and given their
affordable prices they're just super
attractive lenovo has got USB C charging
course all of these so we standardized
it's compatible with most of your other
devices you got expansion of storage
you've got regular USB ports all of the
ports of reinforce the design is
reinforced the 300 and 500 have this
flipping hinge which is also reinforced
so you get plenty for your money now in
terms of availability the 100 e will be
available in march and the 300 e and 500
e are going to available pretty much
straightaway directly from the Nova
