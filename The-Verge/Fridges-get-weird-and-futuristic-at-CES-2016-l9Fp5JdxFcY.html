some people come for powerful laptops
other people come for mind-blowing
virtual reality headsets me I come for
the six mark bridges and here we have a
Samson family hub refrigerator which is
the Apocalypse Now of fridges
it has a gigantic 21.5 inch screen it
runs Tizen OS and it does a whole bunch
of stuff here you can sign up for
groceries by MasterCard which is a
grocery shopping service you can see
recipes on the screen there are virtual
sticky notes it videos weather weather
on your fridge there's this morning
brief thing which is pretty slow to load
but when it does you can see more
weather you can see your calendar and
it's pretty much like an Android phone
from 2012 with gigantic and on your
fridge there is a Pandora Control
there's a kitchen TV mode which seems to
do nothing on this particular demo unit
and you can do a food reminder to assign
objects and its expiry dates so you
don't leave things in the fridge too
long unfortunately this is only a demo
model so I can't actually look inside
the fridge to see how well it stores
food but I can tell you it's a pretty
good touchscreen for a fridge as for
touch screens curve meanwhile Samsung's
big local rival LG isn't sticking any
touch screens on its fridges but they do
have some cool features this is the door
indoor model it lets you turn on the
lights and see what's inside just by
knocking on the door and you can also
open it by tapping your foot
and this model uses LG's smart grid
feature it connects your Wi-Fi and since
your phone's notifications if you left
the door open or if you need to change
the filter and so on so these have been
the fridges of CES please do subscribe
to us on YouTube for more videos from
Vegas and of course keep it locked to
the verge calm your primary source for
news on the Korean riches</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
