of stylus is out there claim to be the
best for writing drawing and sketching
on tablets the company 53 whose founders
worked on Microsoft's near-mythical
courier prototype has long been known
for its iPad drawing at paper but this
is the first Hardware device the company
is made and it's aptly called pencil the
stylus comes in two colors walnut and
graphite and starts at 49.95
the walnut model is the only device with
magnets to stick it to your iPad however
and it has some rather novel
functionality thanks to Bluetooth Low
Energy pairing is easy and done within
the paper app itself unlike with most
Alice's which ask you to screw around in
the settings menu in terms of features
here's what makes it stand out
imperative pencil of the paper app can
now do actual palm rejection knowing to
ignore your hand as you lean on it
there's also blending capabilities you
can smudge color with your fingers and
perhaps shading at some point in the
future pencils flashiest feature you can
flip it over to erase pencil lasts about
a month on a full charge 53 says and
takes about 90 minutes to juice up
completely using any conventional USB
port pencil is expensive for a passive
stylus but cheap for a Bluetooth stylus
it inhabits an interesting space between
the two categories that could feel just
right for some people pencils up for
pre-order today and ships in early
December alongside an update to the
paper app with its first Hardware
product 53 is set a pretty high bar now
that the company controls both the
hardware input and software and paper
I'm excited to see what functionality
they come up with next
