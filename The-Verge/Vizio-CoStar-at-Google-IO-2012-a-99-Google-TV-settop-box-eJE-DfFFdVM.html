and i'm here with vizio just showing off
their new co-star box it's a google TV
device you can see it there in the
corner and we've got the new controller
here as well we saw these previously at
CES but for the first time we're going
to walk through the user interface here
and show off the Google TV take it away
right now he's going to press the vizio
button here in the center of the remote
and that brings up a panel on the side
which is using per pixel alpha blending
you can see there to blend into the
video opening behind it and give you
kind of a transparency effect so it's
not interfering with your view of
content and you can go through some of
the apps here and show us what this
interface is all about
and I love the movies and TV app here
which is google's app i'll show you
what's currently playing on your
attached dish box if you're using dish
and you can get information about all of
these things and switch to them and
generally have a more intelligent
television experience sends a command of
the dish box here and we'll watch x-men
first class but there's a lot more
Google TV if we want to we like
something we're seeing here we can press
the button again and pull up Chrome
browser and do a search right from the
google TV interface the remote here has
a qwerty keyboard on the back so you can
flip it over there's a gyroscope inside
that'll turn the bottom of it off so you
aren't accidentally doing TV commands
while you're typing something in and you
can type in something you'd like to
search for and bring it up on the
browser I perhaps looking for something
related to x-men first class
find out more about me people go to IMDB
or Wikipedia or the like and one of the
other things that's here in the vizio
co-star google TV box is online they've
got a partnership with on live here to
bring streaming games to the TV set-top
box so you can have your your streaming
game console basically for a $99 out by
the same as the onlive micro console
except you don't get the controller here
controllers an extra purchase but you
get google TV no for that price
you can play a few games right on the
remote itself which companies Matt
McCray told us to spent months working
with onlive to get the latency just
right but there's also the onlive
universal controller here which is a
fifty dollar ad on peripheral that comes
with a USB dongle for load latency and
also does bluetooth if you want to
connect it to the television that way
and jump right into a game here from the
interface and or into the arena here
which lets you aspect eight and watch
other people playing games on on live in
real time we got to try out the onlive
patroller for ourself a moment ago and
it's really hard to tell with whole
hidden see here at the show given the
given the Wireless interference but we
are told that improvements are being
made all the one
thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
