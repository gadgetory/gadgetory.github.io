chroming in some ways and when you know
there was just this kind of little
hubbub Steven Sinofsky posted some some
of the you know Explorer and you guys
were talking about getting around
through files and folders and searching
and this is exposing all of these pieces
of chrome that would allow you to write
you know ostensibly do that better but
it looks very daunting to an average
user right because you just want to get
it the things you need to get at right
quickly so there is this battle at
Microsoft because if you look at Windows
Phone right chromeless experience
everything goes away you just see Big
Tex big images you're not it's not
information dense that's right how I
mean how do you merge this variant and
it really you've got it's not just that
it's not just that you're trying to
bring that sensibility over but it's a
question of how do you treat that
content of that data I mean does office
need to be as chrome heavy as it was
previously right does does the does the
Eagle Windows Explorer have to be as
chrome heavy as or what you know
previous short actually we don't think
so but it does pose some interesting and
difficult challenges in that we do still
have fundamentals that we have to deal
with in a very dense environment let's
say a view right we still need to
control what you see for a second and
third at least through design principles
so now we don't have a crutch like
chrome to help us yeah push and pull the
visual so composition layout font
scaling contrast ratios all become the
technique that's absolutely required so
we have to up our game so to speak in
solid visual design principles motion
principles etc in order to create the
right level of hierarchy so that users
don't get overwhelmed with too much
information right because chrome did
perform a little bit of that role to
help us manage what you saw for a second
and third so I think it's a fun
challenge and I'm excited to share it
when we're when it's time yeah but you
know we're not done we've got a lot of
work to do but i think it's a it's a
language and a philosophy that is very
extensible into all environment and you
so this is a you think a coming core for
Microsoft as a whole is that yeah you
know let's deke remit I in a way that
obviously is going to make sense
that's right but you really companywide
that's right our owning this concept I
think it's exciting to people because if
anything we've watched windows and you
know for me I'm I'll say this I'm a Mac
user and i really love Windows Phone I
like what I've seen of Windows 8 the
metro piece but then there's the other
piece that's very familiar windows and
I'll admit you know it has not been that
interface has always felt overly
complicated to me yeah and the idea that
you guys are owning the concept of
company-wide scaling that back are kind
of simplifying it to make sense for
obviously for different scenarios that's
right he's exciting and you and you
you're serious about that very serious
about it that's and I tag taught you
your word I know I mean it's yes very
serious about it myself and a bunch of
others many others in the design
community as nearest even last week had
a day where we went off site and we
actually talked about all the levels and
details of what we just described and
reinforce this commitment that it's
important that we we practice and learn
from each other so that it really does
is something that sticks ultimately it's
the right thing for the business gives
us the right thing for users right and
we want this is the this is a challenge
we have we strip out the extraneous
details the risk is that we look boring
right and how do you manage motion and
gradients so you don't see a gray day
but you feel it well when there's a
motion non-existent because you'd even
know it happened but it reinforced
function this is where we're going and
this is the level of craft that we have
to up our game to now because stripping
all that out comes at a risk if we don't
execute it really well right but
ultimately it's your content right and
content and information is getting
denser and denser and we believe the way
only way to scale in the future is to
prepare ourselves to strip out things
strip ourselves out of the equation so
that what you're feeling and seeing and
using is all about you it's not about us
and that's that's the long pole if we
went down a path of being too concerned
about surfacing ourselves in that
equation there's no room for you and
there's already too much noise Enoch
vision right so I I and the design
community and Microsoft are committed to
this we still again have a challenge of
how to scale into different environments
different different interaction models
but philosophically no one's batting an
eye is this it is this a different
Microsoft and it was ten years ago and
you've been here 20 years I think you
know it's it's a in many ways it's
certainly different in in the I think
the confidence of design design as a
collective level and it's because it's
not no longer just about designers or
researchers I think the organizations
are becoming more design oriented so
there's a collective confidence that we
can talk about aesthetics like this and
it's not a foreign language that we have
to box up and only use with in special
crowds we can have this kind of
conversation at the executive level
where there were more receptive and
understanding of what we're talking
about and in fact very much ways in many
ways supporting and pushing us to do
more right and the other side is there
is a even in the 20 years this is still
the same Microsoft the good parts of it
right it's it's a it's a super it can be
an intense but you're working with super
smart people right that all want to do
the right thing we just have to funnel
ourselves and really focus on
communications and doing the right thing
and take the noise out of the system and
really deliver the way that Metro is
trying to deliver it by filtering out
again things that are not necessary and
only things that matter and that happens
at a larger scale and I think those two
things in combination maybe make for a
little different Microsoft but it feels
I think design is confident very
empowered and it feels very
collaborative right now so what's the
next thing for you what's the what's
that your next challenge you know the
next challenge I think is what we're
right in the middle of we still have a
productivity experience and our set of
experiences that the company has yet to
release that is still in design with we
have more work to do at a corporate
level to bring the things that we're
discussing into a into a plan that
scales where it's no longer starting
just as a grassroots level and we have a
lot of goodwill but we need to organize
this or organize it so that it sticks it
becomes operationalized right and the
artist in me also doesn't want to over
define it because will kill the darn
thing right you know darn thing meaning
this this notion of the qualitative
aspects of subjective maximus of design
yeah that comes from experimentation you
know a sense of humor and all those
other things that keep us light right
that's really because we could go the
other direction where we take this thing
too seriously</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
