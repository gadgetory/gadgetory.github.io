paleontologist have really been confined
to working with the shapes with the
morphology of bones and with skeletons
as you see behind me here and our
hypotheses about how these ancient
animals lived and moved was based on how
we could put those bones together in the
physical world and now for the first
time in the history of paleontology
we're able to move beyond those methods
and into this virtual landscape where we
can test our biomechanical hypotheses in
in rigorous ways that were we're never
possible before my first foray and the
3d scanning was actually working with a
Drexel student in our College of media
art and design and he wanted to do he
wanted to do a master's thesis that was
steeped in both science and digital art
and so we used an early generation of
scanner to scan a 65 million year old
crocodile and he put it back together
put the muscles and the tendons on
taught it to walk taught it to swim and
to hunt and that was his master's thesis
and that master's thesis actually took
it into his interview with DreamWorks
and he's a DreamWorks animator now we
scanned the fossil we clean it up a
little and then we translate that into
an STL file you can take the STL file
put in another laptop connect it to a 3d
printer essentially set a few parameters
push a button and 10 or 12 hours later
kind of like the replicator in Star Trek
out pops the object scanners like this
have gotten better in recent years more
portable and much less expensive in the
past if you wanted to create a one-tenth
scale copy of a dinosaur bone it was
strictly in the work within the realm of
art so you had to get an artist to look
at the bone to draw it and then to
sculpt a one-tenth scale piece and then
to
mold that and then to make a casts from
the mold and so it was a arduous process
and it you know it didn't necessarily
have the the kind of fidelity that you
want in science and so scaling specimens
was a huge deal that was you know in
most cases cost prohibitive in the past
now it's very easy to get a you know
one-tenth scale copy of a dinosaur with
this 3d scanning and printing technology
it's really important and its really a
positive development that a high-tech
instrumentation like this is getting
down to affordable prices because not
all areas of science are funded equally
well these kinds of scanning systems now
like the next engine scanner base price
is about three thousand dollars that
plugs into any laptop but for a modest
price anybody can get into this field
and you know it's to the point where you
can have one of these in your house if
you're interested in scanning you know
Civil War artifacts or whatever it is
that interests you being a
paleontologist I work with scientists in
a lot of developing countries and now
you know cutting-edge technology is
becoming accessible to them as it
proliferate
there's a move with intellectual
property today to to make things
open-source right to open access to
democratize it science has always been
that way science can't be any other way
if other scientists don't have access to
my original data where they can
reanalyze it in their way
re-examine my hypotheses and potentially
falsify my hypotheses it's not science
so you there's no way to keep science
data locked up and so this digital
technology is really just a way to
amplify the best and essential aspect of
science which is that it's essentially
open source so now instead of Italian
colleges having to fly from Spain to New
Jersey to look at the sea turtle and to
tell me how wrong I am I can send him
the file and he can correct me that way
and that's you know in science we never
really say that we prove anything the
best you can do in science is to be able
to falsify your hypothesis and you're
not going to do that if the data is an
open source</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
