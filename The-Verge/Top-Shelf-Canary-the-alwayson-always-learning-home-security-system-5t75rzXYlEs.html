your house but how do you make sure that
you know it doesn't burn down or that
nobody steals it all from you so this
man doesn't answer that question Adam
say gar the founder and CEO of canary so
tell me what is what is canary so canary
is the easiest way to connect to a
physical place and do security and have
security at home whether you're
homeowner you're a renter you just want
to have information live video recorded
information on what's going on in your
physical environment so what does
security mean like what are you what are
you telling me so this is this is canary
this is the thing this what is this what
is this telling so security is really
about two things is about information
and communication and right now the
security systems that are out there
aren't really good at either of those
things and and so we were devising with
the easiest way to both pull information
so canary is jam-packed with sensors
video audio temperature humidity air
quality a cell rahmanir and more and
it's designed to constantly stream that
data to the cloud where we analyze it
look at pattern detection and we geo
look at your cell phone know if you're
home or not we're really trying to find
the easiest way to know if everything's
ok in your environment and if it's not
send all that information directly to
you at your mobile phone notify you so
you can take action immediately Anand so
you'll tell me things like you know
somebody opened my front door on my
sites unless it's me which you can tell
by my phone or you know there's carbon
monoxide or I don't even know what else
there's a fire somebody that's told your
thing from you so it's you know you said
some of the other systems out there are
bad at the information and the
communication is it just this is just
that it hasn't been out there before
like you mentioned before you you know
this started you sort of went into Home
Depot and there just wasn't anything
it's like what's what's been out there
what's it yeah so security today is
really about they are the big installers
like ADT's in the world and there's some
new entrants to the field like AT&amp;amp;T and
Comcast and then there are the DIY and
they're a bunch of those and some new
ones which are great but the to both the
DIY and the installers have one thing in
common in that
they're both very complicated right
there sensors all around they're
expensive generally and for a renter
like myself they're just terrible I mean
so I'm not I'm not going to put sensors
all around my home to do security and so
most people don't have any security so
90 million homes in the US have nothing
no connectivity no security even if
their house or apartment burnt down and
they are away from it they won't know
about it right which to us is way crazy
because it burns down you're like well I
was just renting it any absolutely true
yes but you don't want to lose your
stuff right but so you have all these
tools and then you have sort of a
communications back-end to the whole
system - exactly so we we've both
created the easiest way to connect
because canary you literally you buy it
on boxes put it on your table we have a
30 second set of process and then you're
done you have home security the device
itself constantly is sending data to the
cloud and you can access it whenever you
want it's user option if they want to
store that data or not we're analyzing
it always to know well if it's normal
for on Tuesday 3:00 p.m. for someone to
come in your house and have activities
whether it's a babysitter or a someone
cleaning your house or fan of yours at
visits or is it normal if you have a dog
or cat in the home we're gonna learn
that over the first few weeks you you
own the device and get better at sending
you informed alerts so if we know you
have a dog and the dog walks in front of
the device we're not going to alert you
we're gonna alert you when something
wrong happens somebody else's dog when
so Nielsen died exact a really big dog
yeah you have this little dog we're like
what's this big dog yeah this is
definitely problematic
yeah so let me see I want to see the
actual you made this you can take it
apart
yeah we can take take apart on purpose
so we put it again it's and here's a one
of our prototypes we have here basically
the video
infrared both night-vision and motion
detection number of sensors both on the
front and back boards this here is for
our testing purposes and it will include
a speaker a siren and others it's all in
this really in this country it's like
it's it's also an alarm - it's not just
sending you the information but it's
it's you absolutely it's also an alarm
that that will go off at certain times
or you can activate it yourself so if
you see something's going on you can
activate the siren from your phone I'm
interested as a deterrent to get rid of
some of those in your environment cool
yeah and so it's like is it just knew
that all of this stuff is so small that
you can put it all in one sort of little
package like this yeah well what we have
today is we have ubiquitous wireless
broadband in homes everyone has wireless
connection you have the actual video
technology is so amazing today even a
couple years ago it was very different
especially IP video third you have state
data storage so to both stream and store
data in the cloud a couple years ago was
so expensive to do that no one was
really doing it right and it was like
there were old systems where there was
like a video camera but it was like
$49.99 a month to access a video that
was in the closed room yeah and you have
a lot of systems like they're like
that's a day right it doesn't need to be
like that yeah it doesn't need to be and
so with with canary we're actually
providing alerts backups you can use
your friends and families backups you
can have live video or both incidents
that have happened all for free when you
buy the device on the phone and so it's
just it's complete GameChanger it's
taking a model that's a few thousand
dollars yeah like security or even DIY
systems that will cost you thousands of
dollars are complicated the average
person won't set one of those up right
we're getting rid of all that and we're
saying you can simplify by having one
device if you're in a larger environment
larger home you get a more than one they
all work together but most apartments
would literally need just one device and
right and then you can have security
yeah where do you where do you put it
like is there if I you know I have this
like tiny little New York apartment
should I put it somewhere where it's
like facing the front door I guess it's
sort of a different device depending
yeah well yeah we tested this in about a
hundred apartments in New York and other
cities in the best place to put it is if
you can see the front door in the living
room or the main hallway at the same
time what happens is in apartments if
something goes wrong the likelihood that
they'll pass by a central area of that
apartment is over 95% so if if they're
you know you'll see you don't need
window
sensors on you know your bathroom window
like what how is that useful to know
when someone's open your bathroom window
you want to know what's going on in your
environment you want to be able to see
it immediately on your phone you'll be
able to take action so I mean if it's
nothing
hey maybe it's some you know you're
you're at work and you have a child as
your child's first steps that you happen
to capture and that's great I mean it
allows you to be there to be present
environment and in a very unobtrusive
way cool and so there's there's apps to
control all this yeah right can I can
you show me the door how the apps work
yeah so it's all of course prototypes
now but all working prototypes so you
have basic app which you can connect any
time it's giving you immediately if
there's an alert the immediate last
alert so now that alert is like you know
somebody opened the door or somebody you
know they're fine yeah when there's not
supposed to be there's a rapid rise in
temperature totally so this was two
minutes ago actually we have one this
one to set up in our office so you can
see my co-founders here here in the in
the video you can get historical data or
events coming from it so you can know
what happened over time and this is all
gonna get so much more personalized as
as we continued to develop because we're
launching now the product and the
crowdfunding but the actual product will
come out towards the end of the video
next year and so the app and everything
will be just so so much improved by that
time and available in the iPhone we're
planning for the Android as well cool
and it's it'll there's their stuff of
coming for the iPad too because that's
kind of sitting just like be mr.
security guard and just monitor my world
exactly so our roadmap is iPhone then
iPad Android and of course it'll be web
enabled so you can access to the web at
any time in that our plans get all
through all that before launch and then
and from there just keep developing cool
and so where where do you you know you
mentioned the app will be there better
and different by the time it comes out
what do you guys thinking about now cuz
like once you put all the sensors in
this thing and stick it on the table
there's like a lot of stuff it can do
right so what else you guys sort of well
they what's really going into this and
the heart and soul are the
the computer vision and the algorithms
we're developing for to learn about your
behaviors and and those because it's all
done in the cloud it'll keep getting
smarter and smarter over time so even if
you have the device day one it's getting
smarter both by learning about you over
the first few weeks to learn your
patterns but it's also getting smarter
because we're learning about everyone
how people operate in general and so
learning about the community and how
people operate we can make our algorithm
smarter to to know what's normal what's
not and to be able to send you better
and better alerts because eighty TVA DT
or another security system their false
alarm rate is 99% because they just go
like oh crap the alarm went off we have
no idea why but no idea why
so like less than seven percent of
people that have alarm systems actually
a video in them so yeah if you're a DT
alarm goes off what they're gonna call
you you're not home what are you gonna
do right I mean are you gonna send your
neighbor are you gonna go home or you
probably the son the police yeah the
piece will drive by if they don't see
anything suspicious outside then they'll
leave I mean that's what they do so
here's here's my question is do people
care about security like they should
yeah but do they like what have you you
know done any research looked in all
this stuff we've done research there
there's public publicly available
research that show a number of the
surveys show that up to eighty five
percent of people want some kind of
security at homes absolutely horrific
in fact what a new survey was just
released showed that 40% of people
wanted security video in their home it's
such a new thing so few people have
video in terms of security so it was
great for us to see that but for all
security is not just about you know
keeping bad guys out rights about giving
you information from your environment
and that information might be you know
learning about the air quality and the
temperature and how it acts during the
day it might be about making sure that
someone you're looking after is
comfortable so my father is in
California can help look after his
father who's 96 and lives in Florida it
can be about looking after a child and
making sure that the child is safe and
their both their environment the the
temperature the humidity in their
environment and also you know if you
have a babies that are like how they're
doing appropriate things like checking
on at work so safety and security for us
is not
just about one thing about putting
sensors around right on the house it's
about being more connected to that
physical place in a very easy and an
almost fun way and this is something you
could you know convince your 96 year old
grandfather actually plug in and
absolutely butter my 96 rural
grandfather is on Facebook and he could
probably solve it somehow yeah
your grandfather's on Facebook he was on
Facebook before me
that is totally I'm very impressed yes
man yeah so this is coming out for
crowdfunding this week this is coming
out for crowdfunding and on IndieGoGo
yeah and how much is it gonna cost skin
exam it's gonna cost a b-tree 149 199
pending on how quickly people jump on
there and is that so that the price
you're going for for the retail yep the
retail price would be $1.99 and as I
said the apps free the basis service is
free connectivity alerts everything
backups and this kind of thing has never
been done before and so we're what
excites us the most is the ability to
give people access and security that
haven't had it like if you think about
it people in the largest homes they're
the ones that have security they're the
ones that need the lease like large
single-family homes are the ones that
are least likely to be burgled least
likely for there to be a problem least
likely to have a fire lease like it for
any problem because they can afford the
best construction and the best equipment
and the app security apartments which
are specially rentals the most likely to
have a problem and they're the ones that
are least likely to have security and
it's crazy for us I mean that's unfair
so we want to democratize security make
it available for anyone and just and say
you know tell the big company is that
their way of doing things is not needed
their way of doing things doesn't work
and this is a new approach cool and I
don't have to you know convince my
landlord to let me drill into the wall
to make something I've seen nothing to
install you take it you buy me a you put
it on the table you can move it from
room to room if you want or you can take
it obviously take it with you if you
move from one house to one apartment
together yeah that's awesome
well Adam thank you so much thanks so
much for having me really appreciate ya
I got a I got to get one of these and
absolutely
my parents have two cats and mortix just
are constantly petrified that the
you're dead because you know there might
be and I was near old what do you
probably are and yeah and so like this
is you know it's peace of mind yeah I
mean they could you know talking to New
Yorkers probably more than anywhere else
the first thing people think about other
catch of the dog yeah and and what the
ability to like wow I can see what's
happening all day long just check in on
them like you know brings pleasure to
their lives so this you can do that
maybe get like a like a live webcam
totally your pet and just live video
anytime you want exactly
awesome all right well thank you so much
thank you he's great a beer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
