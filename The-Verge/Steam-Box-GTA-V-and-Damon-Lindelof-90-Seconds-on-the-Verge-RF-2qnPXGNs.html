rooms are prepping to be catapulted into
the future the wait is finally over
grand theft auto 5 is here in the game

to not just be a worthy addition to the
series but also a step forward offering
up a compelling storyline in addition to
all the open-world antics between games
like this watch dogs and titanfall our
living rooms are prepping to be
catapulted into the future and finally
prepared to get lost in the world of

creator is returning to the small screen
with a new HBO show called the leftovers
based on Tom piratas novel of the same
name it focuses on the lives of those
left on earth after the rapture between
shows like this game of thrones and
Breaking Bad our living rooms are
prepping to be catapulted into the
future and that's it for today's top
