we're looking at the ZTE PF 100 this is
their 10.1 inch tablet running Nvidia's
quad-core processor the Tegra 3 it has
1.5 gigahertz for the clock speed i
believe yep it's got hspa+ for
connectivity on the back there's a
5-megapixel camera and there's also a
little 2 megapixel shooter on the front
gig of ram 16 gigs of storage and of
course ice cream sandwich android 4.0
the tablet is actually very very thick
and we've got the dock connector on the
bottom really not the greatest build
quality although I'm sure this is a
prototype it's definitely not the Galaxy
Tab quality here now it's interesting is
they also have another tablet called the
T 98 which actually has virtually
identical specs it also has a quad-core
processor it's a 7-inch screen but the
screen resolution is the same as the EPF
100 it's a wxga screen again 1 gig of
ram 16gb of storage and ice cream
sandwich before the OS we don't have
release dates for either of these yet
but does etv has promised to bring
tablets to the US this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
