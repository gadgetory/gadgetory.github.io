an iphone launch you wait for you wait
for it you're so excited and then it
finally comes and it's pretty much what
you expected but you know maybe that's
not so bad because it's also everything
that you hoped for stay tuned for the
Virgin Mobile show hi I'm dieter bohn
i'm dan seifert I'm pretty sigler and
this is episode 17 for the week of
September 17 2012 of the Virgin Mobile
show it's our golden virgin mobile show
golden yeah what makes it golden isn't
that then that like your golden birthday
is like when the birthday falls on the
day of your age I thought golden would
be like that if you show or something I
think oh it's like a littler 30th 50th
is diamond and Adam i'm looking it up
now hold on everybody hang on ya know 50
is is golden 50 is gold okay there's a
pun this is a hold on I'm gonna rage
this is our this is our crystal know our
15th show was our crystal show and our
20th show will be our China show nice
yeah 25th will be our silver show anyway
so if you notice Vlad savov is not with
us today unfortunately is at photokina
uh taking amazing pictures of cameras
that also take amazing pictures yes very
meta at photokina very very jealous to
be honest with you I am they've actually
done a really excellent you haven't seen
the coverage there's a there's a stream
explaining all the stuff that's happened
at photokina and you know I'm not a
camera nerd but they've done a really
good job of making all this camera news
accessible and understandable so like I
can actually read through the stream
read our stories and not feel like I'm
an idiot which is what most camera
coverage makes me feel like like when I
gotta be Peter view it just makes me
thumb can I just say
I am in the process of e being both my
kidneys and selling a large amount of
cocaine for a Leica M I will do a wide
variety of legal things for like em I I
had the opportunity to use an m9 for a
couple weeks a couple years ago and was
just like it's it's a really hard thing
to explain in specs because it is not it
doesn't compare very favorably to
anything but it's there's something
about the experience of using a leica
that is just extremely appealing and it
is it is hard to describe you just got
to use it and then you understand what
people pay upwards of ten or fifteen
thousand dollars for leica bodies and
lenses indeed I'm that has nothing to do
with phones though so so uh here's the
thing uh there was a big iphone event
last week and um it's dominated the
mobile news and we're gonna talk about
the iphone 4 I think it's fair to say a
very long time we have a lot of thoughts
and feelings and things to say about the
iphone there's a lot of details to dig
into and just a lot of stuff to say and
so if you're here looking for us to talk
about the fact that there's an orange
version of the Lumia 820 but not of the
920 and how angry that makes me um that
rant is gonna have to wait until next
week is that a direct shot at me deters
I felt like like you were aiming that at
me no I'm they're making an orange vs 8
20 but not of the 920 and it drives me
crazy I guess we should also mention
that like Nokia showed we gotta get into
the iphone stuff anyway that Nokia
showed like literally a like a quarter
of a second blip of a cyan Lumia 920
who's won very much from Oh video that
was one frame yeah like so I'm sorry
about this I theory about I'm sorry to
derail the conversation already but
actually it's not my theory this is
going around on Twitter apparently a
previous version of the video that had
been uploaded by Nokia showed more of
that cyan phone and so I think what
happened was they they realized their
mistake and attempted to trim it out and
miss that one for
name was handsome middle of a shot
that's ridiculous I don't know I don't
know who knows what sort of weird
editing tools they're using but I think
that's what happened I love that we're
like we're not gonna talk about anything
but the iphone and we immediately start
talking about the Lumia i would i would
personally be game I would be totally
fine with a 90-minute show about nokia
phone colors i could do that everybody
ad nauseam but a real question is eat
what color phone would Paul Walker use
if he had a Lumia phone oh that that is
then that is a supernova of all my
favorite things that you're I've
literally about to pass out just
thinking about let's talk all right is
exact let's get let's first things last
did you guys pre-order I did I did not
what really this this blew my mind when
Chris told me that he did not this is
what happens i was i was telling dandus
uh i think last week what i do and this
happens every single year and has since
the first at well since the second I've
iphone 3g what happens to me is I swear
up and down that I'm not going to get an
iphone I don't pre-order and then the
morning of the event comes and I wake up
like at four a.m. and i'm like yeah
shucks I'm gonna go get in line and then
I go get in line at x 1 happened with
the 4s happened with the four it's gonna
happen again with the 5s so we'll see
what happens on Friday but there's a
very real chance that I will be standing
in line at four in the morning well are
you so with the 4s I rolled in for us
and the the ipad 3 sorry the new ipad i
rolled into an AT&amp;amp;T store for the 4s and
a verizon store for the ipad at like
eleven o'clock in the morning just like
Walston 0 line bought the phone on the
ipad and waltzed out no problem well I
kind of think that that's going to
happen this time around I don't think
that there'll be no lines at the carrier
stores I think it's a bigger I mean we
know it's you know they pre sold twice
as many is the story they broke all of
their sales records
well yeah and this time around you've
got all the people with the iphone four
coming off contract or have been off
contract waiting for the five where you
didn't have quite as many for the 4s so
I have a feeling there's going to be
some selling out and some lines oh yeah
yeah yeah I know i pre-ordered a 32 gig
black on AT&amp;amp;T I think the black copy and
restyle hey man I think that the the
fact that they they painted or they
brushed over they darken the metal rail
around it I think it looks awesome yeah
I'm actually super excited for this
hardware which I didn't think I would be
but I really am I think it looks great I
think we'll see how i feel about the the
larger screen you know I've been using a
1x or a galaxy s3 for Indiana Galaxy
Nexus and all these other big screen
phones for so long that I think it's
going to actually feel a little bit
cramped but you know I think having a
super thin phone and a reliable LTE
phone I'm actually pretty excited about
that I'm pretty excited about being able
to tether off of this thing because
being tethering off of Android works for
the most part but USB tethering
especially seems to be hit or miss
especially after android 4.0 driver
model a little bit and so it's often the
case that like I'll plug in an android
phone and it won't show up as a USB
modem on my mac and it's a big hassle
and dad phone 5 i'm excited to go back
to like totally reliable USB tethering
yeah I feel pretty strongly going back
to the your color selection dieter and
an I feel pretty strongly that with this
generation white and black have
flip-flopped and black is like the chic
color and light is the ways like the
standard like normal color do you guys
agree so I totally agree like the last
generation I was all about the white
model i think the white model looks
great it's the one I owned and etc but I
usually go for the white phone but this
time around just that you know haiti's
this the murdered-out phrase but that
that black really just kind of like
grabbed me and that matte finish and I
don't know I went black yeah yeah well
let's let's stick with like talk about
hardware specs here of course we know
what the larger display we know about
LTE
and LTE bands like this is actually
justing so with the 4s they had
basically a single model with single
radio set up for CDMA and GSM and it was
basically the same thing worldwide with
this one there's how many different
there's because the verizon and the AT&amp;amp;T
are different and the sprint one also I
don't know how that ties in I believe
there are three models in total so
there's three there's three skews but
I'm I'm of the feeling and I know a lot
of other people in the industry are as
well that there's really only two models
and you know the extra skew is just kind
of like with certain things disabled and
certain things enabled on the same
hardware as the other model so you've
got your you're eighteen t LTE model
which is the a14 28 I believe and so
that supports your standard hspa+ on all
of 80's bands standard GSM of course and
then it supports 18t LTE bands and that
model will be sold in Canada it works on
the Canadian LT carriers and then after
that you've got the a149 cdma version
which is going to be offered by verizon
and sprint and that has compatible LTE
bands for both verizon and sprint as
well as you're necessarily cdma cover
band support and it also has hspa+
support on the same bands as the ett
model so you can use it globally and
just like you could with the 4s and then
the third model is the a149 gsm model
which has all the same things except it
doesn't have the same things as a
verizon and sprint model but it doesn't
have the CDMA support which i feel is
just it just turned off because the LTE
bands support is pretty much the same
and the other things are pretty much the
same so you got three to choose from the
gia the GSMA 149 is the unlocked model I
guess you could say that that's probably
going to be offered in various parts of
europe etc and of course the other
global markets that support LTE yet this
is the first time in a really long time
that I was
to switch to verizon just for the global
are roaming but I realized like I don't
actually globally Rome all that often so
I decided to take a risk on still they
say so here's the thing you'll still be
able to globally room with AT&amp;amp;T model
you just won't be able to do it on LTE
so right for you had gone with a verizon
model you could roam LTE on the when
when ee launches its LTE network you'll
be able to roam on there and you can
roam on the I think it's t-mobile's
running the LG network in Germany but
you won't be able to do that with the LT
model or with AT&amp;amp;T model but you will be
able to roam on hspa+ with the AT&amp;amp;T
model so I'm sure that it killed Apple
to have to roll multiple physical
hardware devices for this launch because
they you know that they went from two
iphone 4s down to one for the 4s and I
think that was a very purposeful move
for them and that the LTE that you know
the completely disjoint horrible mess of
a global LTE brant a band structure has
destroyed any hope in the near term of
launching a global device with a single
set of skews so until RF engineers do
some amazing things that they obviously
haven't done yet yeah it's it's it's
kind of crazy like just I think this we
saw it with the iPad the new iPad how
there was separate models for eighteen t
and verizon LTE but I think it just the
iphone 5 really just speaks to the mess
of the LTE bands at our global and our
worldwide and how in not interoperable
they are right running down some of the
other specs the camera like what's
different they'd still an 8 megapixel
camera I guess they've got a sapphire
thing so it's less likely to get
scratched but they didn't really talk up
other than the panorama mode they didn't
really talk up the camera a whole lot
and that panaroma panorama mode thing
like I hope it's way better than what
the third party apps are that are out
there because if it's basically the same
thing that you could have done before
like don't get me wrong the camera on
the iPhone 4
is best of class I think it only a bit
only wasn't until the 1x and the galaxy
s3 that any other phone even came close
so it's not like they needed to sprint
ahead there but it's not like you know
if you're not going to want to upgrade
to the five just for the camera right
yeah I think that I think that all of
these guys Apple included are running up
against some physical limits about or
over what they can do with cameras with
the optic you know that the size of the
optics that their that they're using and
that's something that you're seeing
devices like the 808 overcome by just
including massive optics which isn't
really isn't apples bag and I don't
think that you're going to see them do
that in the future right yeah I mean it
at this point until the same thing with
LTE until engineers create this you know
crazy breakthrough that you know defies
the laws of physics as we know them
right now there is kind of like this
this diminishing returns so we get with
these with the phone cameras now as far
as the differences between the 4s and
the five camera that sapphire crystal
makes it a little bit smaller so then
that leads to the thinner design which I
think we're going to speak to in a
minute but it's also the cameras a bit
faster and I think that's leaning on the
new processor so the shot to chop time
is faster the focusing all that fun
stuff should be faster and I hope that
the panoramic thing is is I expect it to
be pretty simple and pretty easy but
yeah like you said dieter I hope it's
better than the third party apps yeah
okay so you brought thinnest I mean we
mean it's thinner right at seven point
six millimeters Apple kept saying it's
the thinnest smartphone on the planet
which is not true right there like an
aeros phone in Japan that's the this
thin yeah there's yum like sharp models
that are like under seven millimeters
yeah yeah and there's that oppo and then
depending on how you measure it of
course the droid razr is 7.1 but it has
the hump at the top right right so it
doesn't come I'm just saying I flat out
uh I don't know I'm excited for it to be
thinner um it's it's weird I never
thought of the iphone 4 and the for us
as being like a chunk um I the other
thing go ahead I I am NOT excited for it
to be thinner I'm gonna let you finish
but let me just say that what they
should have done is kept it the same
rate they should have pulled the razr
maxx trick they should have kept it the
you wanna iphone best no I don't want to
know max I want there to be one model
and I want them to say it's the same
thickness as the 4s we didn't have to
make it any thicker and but oh by the
way you now have to freakin days of
battery life that's more impressive than
saying it's seven point six millimeters
or whatever yeah I'm really curious to
see the battery life is gonna be because
they when they were talking about
battery life specs they basically I
think they only pointed out standby time
but everything else is basically the
same and I mean I have problems with a
battery life on the LTE phones I've been
using so far like it's it's a real
struggle to get a full day and if you
know with this new form factor and the
new dock connector which we got to get
to if I can't get a full day out of this
thing it's gonna really suck to be
constantly looking for a charger for the
iphone right also I would love to see
Apple release something called with 2
x's in it the iphone max like that would
life-changing would be life-changing but
I mean it's seriously like you know
that's a trade-off that I'm definitely
willing to make it I'm really fearful
that all OEM zaple included are still
pick up playing this this this pissing
contest where they're trying to make the
phones thinner and thinner and thinner
with blatant disregard for the fact that
a phone that can make it from say seven
in the morning until five or six pm is
not full day battery life and it is not
acceptable i would say that at least
once a week possibly twice on any phone
that i use really right now i'm on the
Galaxy Nexus but any phone I'm in a
situation where I'm out and my phone
dies and there's nothing I can do about
it right yeah I totally agree with you
Chris I think I think when the iphone 4
design came out a couple of years ago it
kind of like mind blowing thin at the
time and and you know I don't I've never
in the two years since then or almost
two and a half years since then I've
never felt like that design was thick or
cumbersome right or unwieldy or anything
like that so if they could have had kept
that same millimeter and added however
much battery capacity that would afford
yeah that would been pretty great now
the other side okay so if they had added
that battery capacity it would have
added a ton of weight in this thing
weighs what what is it so it's lighter
yeah so it's significantly lighter i
think the iphone 4s was like 141 grams
so if they had just kept it the same
weight I i would have been thrilled I
never I mean the iphone 4s doesn't feel
like a heavy phone it's not like 200
grams so i would much rather had the
extended battery life and then i won't
be using a silly like external battery
case that I end up doing from time to
time with my 4s because the battery
doesn't get me through the day yeah I
don't want to give Apple credit for
bringing back the aluminum back I think
that looks awesome and I'm not sad to
see the glass back go um yeah I was
never happy when they switched a plastic
and then you know moving to glass was a
nice fix but I feel like you know their
original vision with the original iphone
was aluminum now they finally gotten
back to that I'm pretty pretty excited
about that I hope it feels like that's
one of my problems with the the HTC One
S like it's got that that sweet micro
are oxidized aluminum thing but I don't
like the way it feels good feels like a
chalkboard so I just hope this feels
like just straight up good aluminum well
there's one problem with the aluminum on
the original iphone and and maybe
they've kind of gotten around it with
this one we don't know yet but with the
original iphone you still see it
occasionally today if you know everyone
smell you see someone that's using an
original iphone for god knows what
reason but they they're they're
scratched to hell and they're dented
there physically dented yeah which is a
phenomenon that's unique in the phone
world because 99% of phones are plastic
and which doesnt dent right yeah i mean
you still see that unlike the ipod touch
the most up
up to the new ones that were just
announced but the the other ipod touches
from last year etc they get scratched
extremely quickly and you frequently see
them dented too so yeah be interesting
to see the papal salt that nano SIM
whatever it's a little tiny sim I've
already ordered wait there's some sure
that's gonna be the worst ya know I was
going to ask you about that you you
ordered you you took the plunge are you
are you fearful for what your experience
is going to be like with that adapter on
Friday I am I now I think was seen at
Asia put up a story where they they took
a micro sim and like shaved it down to
what they think that the size of the
nano SIM is and it will it still worked
and they were able to get it to continue
to work on a HTC One X and so I'm
assuming it'll be okay I hope it will I
still want to be able to switch phones
it's one of the main reasons I stuck
with AT&amp;amp;T but if it's not I mean you
know there's worse things in the world
than being stuck on an iPhone 5 yeah
I've always had problems with I mean you
know that the problem with these
adapters is that there's no way to lock
a sim into the adapter right so like um
you know I use I use an adapter on a
micro sim in the galaxy nexus for
instance and it's it's it's a sliding
tray type and when you're when you're
pulling it back out what happens
sometimes is that the micro sim will
kind of start to fall below the adapter
a little bit and then it'll catch on
either a pen or the indentation where
the actual contacts are and then it gets
stuck and then you you're sitting there
trying to hold out and it takes ten
minutes and i'm assuming those kinds of
problems are only going to get worse
with the nano sims because it's a
physically smaller thing you basically
need kearney hands to uh these things so
what we'll see I'm uh I'm hopeful that
this is going to be manageable but I
suspect you're gonna hear a lot of four
stories over the next few weeks of
people trimming their micro sims or
their standard sims down to nano SIM
sighs and you know breaking the sim or
doing something to the context where it
shorts them or you know because you're
you're
your physic if I'm not mistaken you're
physically cutting into the contact pat
in order to get it down to nano nano sim
sighs oh I don't gotta gotta Sam that's
that's cruel you are I'm just right I'm
gonna activate the phone and then
hopefully I'll be able to put it in an
adapter in size up from there I would
write I have zero desire to tell anybody
that it's a good idea to try and file
down the sim to nano sim sighs I think
that is a recipe for pain yeah
especially since you eat with the iphone
5 it's going to have the tray you're
gonna have to get it to to match in that
tray perfectly and and and like Chris is
saying the contacts footprint on a micro
sim is like the whole size of the nano
SIM itself so you're definitely cutting
it close I guess you could say with the
cops wah womp womp womp okay we got to
talk about the hardware the lightning
dock connector a all new connector it
works you know it's reversible it's all
digital and so that's why the adapter to
the old dock adapter is so expensive
because I actually have to have a
digital to audio converter in there the
feature that you lose is some of these
ipod out features which to be clear is
just like mirroring display on like a
BMW car or something but it'll still
work with audio docks with this big
giant adapter and look why does Apple
think it's too good for us be I don't
know and it drives me absolutely nuts
like I mean people complain about the
micro USB connector but really it's not
a bad connector it's it's hard to damage
it's ubiquitous it's pretty
straightforward to use like you have to
really be trying too hard in order to
put in an upside down I'll tell you
exactly what what Apple's problem is
with micro USB it's the fact that made
for ipod is an extraordinary i phone is
an extraordinarily lucrative a seal of
approval for Apple that it charges
accessory makers extraordinary amounts
of money to use and if they switch to
micro USB that only incentivizes
companies to skirt the made for
ipad or excuse me made for iphone seal
and go rogue and as it stands these
companies are gonna have to license to
the Lightning port the the connector
which is you know I mean that all adds
up to dollar signs for Apple that's
exactly what's going on it's still we
are gonna have new features that that
are capable that unless you do something
crazy to extend the micro USB standard
like you know audio out and video out
and I mean whatever else I suppose but
you know whatever I don't know I'm
pretty bitter about this I just you know
it's like there's apple exceptionalism
for making money and you if you can make
the case that this connector is better
for consumers I haven't seen it that
this does not seem like it's better for
consumers and just going to micro USB
right i mean i think you could have made
that argument with the 30 pin connector
nine years ago because micro you wasn't
around mini USB might not have even
really been around all that much so
there wasn't a lot of great connectivity
options and that kind of gave a standard
connector that did a whole heck of a lot
for the ipod at the time but today it's
it's a different story and they're
making a connector that to the layperson
looks like a micro USB connector i think
the average person will look at the port
on an iphone 5 and be like oh it's the
same plug as my galaxy s3 or whatever it
is just because it looks almost the same
it's almost the same size physically so
you know it's it's a little little I
mean chris has probably nailed it right
on the head for the reason why but it's
just like you said dieter not exactly
consumer friendly and now I wonder how
many how many stories you're gonna hear
of a iphone 5 owners coming into genius
bars with micro USB cables jammed into
the Lightning port hahahaha that it's
got to be just a little bit bigger than
the micro USB plug so it just both
crammed in there just fall out you ain't
you would have it or lose that smart I
don't know like and are they selling the
micro USB 2 9 pin dock connector adapter
in the US or is it still only the UK
I believe it's only the UK I haven't
heard that it's in the US that's good
because like the only reason they're
selling it in the UK or in the EU is to
meet with regulations that require the
compatibility right and that doesn't
exist here in the US so apples not not
offering it um so and I mean those
relations are good they should have you
know about anyway but to the other thing
clear I available go ahead I was just
gonna say to be clear they aren't they
aren't laws they are a number of olean
was agreed to these principles several
years ago and Apple is just adhering to
them but I don't think that there are
any actual you laws that would prevent
prevent them from selling the iphone in
you countries if they weren't adhering
to them I think that they're just
they're doing it voluntarily I don't
know why because they're really
half-assing it but so the other thing
that really bothers me with lightning
and we were kind of talking about this
in our chat room yesterday is the fact
that it doesn't support USB 3 point of
the box it's supports USB 2.0 even
though all of apple's you know 2012
laptops have USB 3.0 ports plenty of
Windows laptops have USB 3.0 ports and
USB 3.0 is fully backwards compatible
with USB 2.4 Singh us to use a cable to
do a lot of heavy sinking and and
interface with iTunes why can it be USB
3.1 it tries my there's no good answer
that question not one that I'm happy
with so sean hollister put up a really
good report about the new connector and
what it means for accessory makers and
just accessories in general my personal
complaint is like the doesn't i ordered
an extra cable and it's not ready to
ship right away so i'm gonna be down to
just one cable to charge my phone and
I'm not comfortable with that I carry
literally like for micro USB cables in
my bag all the time because I know I'm
going to lose
um dieter I'm really neater this is very
easy just buy two iphone 5s take the
cable on one and put the put the phone
away um but no like this is article a
really good point like that the big
accessory makers they're excited about
this right you know as long as you know
apple lets them make new accessories
they get to crank out new accessories
and sell more stuff that's really
exciting what but it it's a problem for
this trend of you know smaller companies
and guys launching products on
kickstarter where like they had gone
through this whole plan with the
original dock connector and now they're
there they just don't have the the
resources to you know go back from
scratch quickly and easily but you know
the belkin's of the world they're super
pumped about this they're going to be
able to sell you all new stuff right
yeah right it is interesting though if
you go in and read Shawn's report it's
interesting to hear basically all the
big guys jawbone belkin and there was
another logitech maybe that he talked to
and all them sort of hinted at the fact
that that you know the dock connectors
days are numbered like eventually
everything is just gonna be Wireless
whether you like it or not and so that I
mean yes they do in the short term they
do get to profit by turning around all
these new dock devices with lightning
connectors but in a long term they think
that it's just got all going to be you
know this Wireless ecosystem of course
you'll still need one of the advantages
of these dock devices that they charge
your phone while you're playing music or
whatnot and you'll lose that advantage
once you go completely wireless but
maybe by then we'll have wireless
charging to like over you know
over-the-air wireless charging which has
long been a dream of via of the industry
how horrendously ugly and bulky are the
first generation of battery packs going
to be for this thing you remember like
in the early days of the iphone battery
packs they were super thick on the
bottom because people hadn't figured out
how to like minimize the amount of extra
plastic they had to have next to the
dock connector like they're going to
start that whole process over again
they're going to have to leave space for
the headphone jack in addition to the
microphone and the speakers I mean
they're just going to be the worst
they're gonna be terrible yep
oh yeah I mean not to belabor this
because I'm not really surprised but you
know Apple chose not to go with wireless
charging and they also chose not to put
NFC on there and it's funny like I kind
of I don't want the wireless charging
because I do find that really convenient
but the NFC thing I'm kind of on their
side I feel like you know if it's not
there it's not there and apples not
going to try and force it and I'm
totally okay with that decision I'm
going to challenge you on the wireless
charging thing because it wireless
charging to me is one of those features
that sounds really cool and you really
think that you want it but then once you
have your like well it only works on
this one pad which I would be running a
micro USB cable to anyway so what is
actually the advantage of having it so I
wrote a little three seconds of my life
every day when I just go and set my
phone down on the charger instead of
reaching for a cable and plugging it in
so I ve convenience of getting in my car
and just setting it on you know at least
with the you know webos days the the
magnetic charger you just set it on your
dash and you're done like it sounds
really stupid but it is really
convenient it's really nice it's an if
they had if they had enabled wireless
charging then and they had stuck to you
know the cheese standard like like Nokia
did then I wouldn't be looking at this a
hellstorm of having only one cable for
the next however long and you know
losing it and not being able to charge
my phone at all I'd at least be able to
use the wireless charging fair enough
yeah I think you brought up all the
points that I intended just because I
remember with my you know like my pre I
had a I stuck one of the touchstone
things to the dash of my car at the time
and I just would like get in my car and
plot my pre right on there and it was
like the most convenient thing ever and
if like a notification came in I could
see it quickly and easily and it was
charging up it is fantastic I don't
think wireless charging is the answer
for everything because if you want to
use your phone while it's charging it's
really inconvenient while it's sitting
on a wireless charging dock but just
having the option there would be nice
also does anyone know what the maximum
current is for Chi ooh that I don't know
and that's not because things i'm
curious about about what the current is
gonna be on this connector if it'll be
2.1 or whatever you know the different
the different amp urges are ya I the
problem i mean i have this problem with
basically every modern smartphone now
where the the phone just in an idle
state or certainly when you're using it
is drawing enough power so that plugging
it into a micro USB cable just barely
keeps up with it like it doesn't really
charge it just keeps the battery level
stable right maybe a third hour if
you're tethering you're just watching it
slowly die or if you're using my PS
services in your car and it just can't
get out with it right and that problems
only going to get worse and we've heard
in fact i think we talked about it on
the show before there's a there is an
addendum to the USB 3 specification that
increases the maximum current but that's
still I don't even think it's approved
yet so uh I don't have anything else to
say about the hardware now that I've
gotten my little rants out I despite
everything I've complained about this
connector I I'd still am actually pretty
excited for the hardware I think it's
gonna be impressive and I'm gonna feel
really good that in my pocket and like
I'm even excited about the the what's
the phrase the chamfered edges the
bezels that they made that angled
instead of straight across I think
that'll feel nicer today of the sandwich
look is gone so it's it's a yeah it's
smoother look I guess you could say um
so we talked a little bit about AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon because you put together a
report about you know our LTE networks
gonna suddenly start sucking now that
we're gonna have all these iphones on
them and tell us that I screw up by
staying with ATT uh well we'll find out
right there's only one way to know for
sure and that's that's to see what
happens over the course of the next few
weeks yeah so I mean I i think i've
talked about it before i I've noticed
that the that a TNT's network has gotten
noticeably slower since the galaxy s3
launched and I don't think it's any
coincidence that I see galaxy s3's on
the street non-stop I think that it's
been an enormous
lee successful phone for AT&amp;amp;T and
verizon and all the carriers that it's
launched on so you take that level of
success multiply it by two or three or
four and and do it all over again and
that that begs the obvious question are
the LTE networks going to be able to
survive in their current configurations
what we we talked to an ATT spokesman
about it and he emphasized the fact that
you know they've learned lessons since
since the HSPA days and they're
implementing new technologies like small
cells and self optimizing networks that
that kind of account for that sort of
heavy usage but at the end of the day
your physical limit your ultimate limit
is that the fact that you have a certain
amount of spectrum available and if you
run out of spectrum and if everybody's
trying to tweet at the same time you're
gonna run into problem so we generally
don't we need to be the problem 24 bring
LTE networks to their knees oh my point
really saying though I that you know uh
it will actually have to sleep the
Twitter new twitter app is really
inefficient that's actually it's not
just limited to 140 characters every
single one of those characters is a
megabyte and so when you send a tweet
out takes up a huge chunk every
character is an emoji icon and yeah I
would not doubt it I would not doubt it
the way twitter is going um so yeah I
mean we'll have to see what happens but
but if it does bring the network's to
their knees that that's but I mean that
is a very very damning conclusion and a
damning statement about that the state
of wireless in the US so we have to hope
we all have to collect if we hope that
that these networks stay operational and
that there's fast enough to actually use
so Chris I gotta ask you which of the
networks do you think is going to be the
less of the least hit by the iphone i
have my own theory i know the answer i
know the answer i got it in the US you
want the answer is sprint team old
sprint t-mobile yeah yeah I mean yeah I
mean you have to look at what to answer
that question you need to look at what
carriers are you know shouting from the
highest hill tops that they're still
offering unlimited data and the reason
there
doing that is because their networks are
underutilized nover engineered and and
so yeah those are t-mobile and Sprint I
that also means of course that if those
networks rapidly load up for whatever
reason then they're probably at greater
risk of ultimate failure that's just and
I'm not I'm not saying that out of any
knowledge that I have I just have to
assume that would be the case so uh but
yeah I I do agree it's gonna be other
t-mobile or sprint that's that's at you
know in the best position also that that
that question is you have to take it on
a market by market basis maybe a prime
example AT&amp;amp;T only has five megahertz up
and down for its LTE network in Chicago
whereas in most markets it has 10 by 10
so that Chicago is more likely to have
major LTE proms on 18t brought about by
the launch of the iphone 5 then say uh
Dallas you know Chris we need to move
you to like Atlanta or Memphis or
Seattle to any other city other than
Chicago because you and your your the
depth of knowledge that you have about
80 epic failures in Chicago second to
none we really really spread that
knowledge around we need to embed you in
other cities so that you can complain
about their wireless just like you do
about Chicago well Seattle uh you know
Seattle has still does not have AT&amp;amp;T LTE
they're supposed to launch soon but I
think that they are you know if you look
at at the major cities in the u.s. that
haven't launched with AT&amp;amp;T LTE at
seattle's probably the biggest at this
point and I do get into complaints
almost weekly from people saying why the
heck don't we have LTE yet and it's a
great question because you know AT&amp;amp;T has
a bit a smartphone office in Seattle
course you know Microsoft is there you
would you would just think that it would
behoove AT&amp;amp;T to launch LTE there as
quickly as possible right well okay we
gotta we gotta start talking about other
stuff by other stuff I mean other
iphones stuff let's talk about iOS
I guess I mean there's a bunch of a
bunch of little things but they showed
off everything and it was all the same
stuff that we'd seen before I mean
genuinely the only new feature that we
hadn't already seen from WWDC that I can
think of is that it has you know a
different aspect ratio and we have
another great report from Ellis right
yeah about what what app developers
think and what kills me about this okay
they're gonna letterbox apps that's fine
but you know most of the developers that
he spoke to were like yeah we figured
this was coming and yeah you know it's
not like the end of the world and what
it blows my mind is we have spent the
past five years hearing this cuddle
about fragmentation based on screen size
and what a huge profit is for Android
developers have to target all these
different screen sizes and my feeling
has always been that the screen size
difference wasn't the real problem here
it was other fragmentation issues and
sort of the fact that most of these
developers have responded to this with
kind of a collective shrug like it
doesn't surprise me and it shouldn't
surprise anybody it's just so funny that
we've spent so much like so much of our
collective psychic angst about the
screen size was wasted when really I
think at the end of the day it's not
that big of a deal that was a lot of
preamble for me to stay shrug but there
you go well so follow I have a few i
have a few thoughts on this first off i
think that the letter boxing is a
correct me if i'm wrong i think that the
apps appear in the middle is that right
yeah yeah you're going to get black bars
on the top and bottom if you're holding
in portrait or left and right if you're
holding it lands yeah this so the app
should appear at the bottom not in the
middle and that's so that you're
maintaining the the relationship between
the thumb of the user's dominant hand
and the bottom of the application and
that is that is the most you I
everything that I think I've ever said
if the software keyboard like on a
litter box tap if the software keyboard
pops up above the letterbox and not from
the bottom of the screen like that will
drive me completely insane yeah
Nani notes because like this is one of
the things that really bothered me about
the original implementation of Android 4
on the HTC One X with that big black
menu bar I mean I was I wasn't that
angry about losing those pixels but what
I was angry about was that the keyboard
wouldn't be in the exact same spot on
the screen every time you'd open it up
it sometimes in beauty up above the menu
and sometimes we you know flush to the
bottom of the screen and so I really
hope that when you pop open the keyboard
on these letterbox taps that it'll be
flush the bottom of the screen right
right but but I also think that that
that Apple's expectation is that and is
I think it's very fair expectation is
that that the developers event of any
apps that matter in the App Store are
going to be updated to support the new
resolution very quickly in fact that the
major guys have probably spent the past
yeah we've already seen some updates to
be honest with you that I yeah I was ya
6 and iphone 5 compatible I think trite
not just updated today actually right
yep and that's just going to continue
and it's going to happen very fast so
you'll just have this you know you'll
have the long tail of apps that are
abandoned where and and think that are
sort of longer cycle apps that I'm sure
will be a problem for the next year but
those aren't really apples concern it's
that it you know it's the the major apps
and those are just going to get
refreshed very very fast right so the
rest is six I mean it's coming out on
the 19th for other phones which is
tomorrow if you're listening to this
live or today if you're listening to it
today it's released or last week if
you're just catching up on virgin mobile
show podcast which really you should be
listening to these the moment are out I
mean I don't know I so the this story
went around the day of the event and I
put up a piece day after this idea that
iOS 6 is boring and I mean the truth is
it's a little boring all right there's
there's not anything here other than
maps which we got to talk about maps oh
my god um that like is completely wildly
different than iOS
right and you know apple always iterates
small bits you know os/2 OS on these
updates but there's usually one big
tentpole feature that you'd be like this
is the thing that changes the way you
use your phone and the thing that
changes the way you use your phone in
iOS 6 is like a nap and as great as iOS
is and I think it's great i really i
really do it's it's not like it's not a
location OS like its it has it does a
better job of providing location
services to third-party developers but
for most consumers mapping and
navigation is an app it's not a core OS
experience and so i mean that's that's
why you know we went with this angle
that you know it's always a 73 degrees
and sunny on the iPhones home screen
because like it hasn't changed and
that's okay for a lot of people but on
the other hand like there's a sense of
like forward-moving innovation and
thinking about the future of computing
that like Apple hasn't changed their
vision for years and years on it and you
know that seems a little bit I don't I'm
not like freaking out about trouble but
you know I don't know I feel like I say
it every year they like man next next
version they got to really shake it up
because this is the same and like we're
just saying it again with iOS 6 like we
said with iOS 5 you know Neela I said
something very interesting the other day
and and I think that I agree with them
which is that iOS 6 feels like lion it's
it's sort of this weird hodgepodge of
features that nobody necessarily asked
for and their note there is no single
compelling uh you know there's there's
no must have feature that sets it apart
and I I do think it like looking at the
holistic picture of the iphone 5 I do
think that the story is about the
hardware on unbalanced not not about iOS
6 and but but here you you know to your
point dieter I i think that we might be
in for a long haul here like if you look
at you look at OS X you go back over the
the past decade
how much has the platform really changed
go back and look at screenshots from you
know 10 dot 0 10 dot 1 it we you know
this might just be the the UX that Apple
has settled on and they're going to
continue to to put chrome on it until
it's impossibly stale and I don't even
know a family as has a game plan for OS
X much less iOS at this point yeah I
mean if you were to dump into like a you
know OS X 10.8 whatever you wouldn't
feel terribly uh in you wouldn't feel
like you're in a different world even if
you've been using mountain lion for the
past few months whereas right you know
other other platforms if you were to
jump back 10 years it definitely feels
like a different operating system right
and and windows 8 is the perfect example
of that right like Windows 8 is like a
is is a clean oh I mean you still have
the desktop mode right but if you look
at the the the UX that Microsoft is
pushing for Windows 8 it is a clean
break from everything you know about
windows and that's something that I mean
Apple is eventually going to have to
cross that that you know that very scary
gap and i think that the probably was
this on Twitter the other day I think
the problem for companies like Apple and
Nokia and rim and Microsoft they have
they've all had this problem where they
at some point even in the face of
overwhelming success they need to feel
this invisible inflection point where
they need to make a clean break and find
the next big thing and and it's it's it
becomes almost impossible difficult to
do that when you're experiencing this
massive overwhelming success like like
apples yeah well the way I put this is
the faster you go the harder it is to
turn their going real fast right now
they're selling a ton of phones right
right so I don't think any of us can
reasonably say when that point is going
to come for that what you know when do
they need to make that clean break I
don't think anybody really knows are
they planning for that clean break at
this point I don't think anybody knows
but but yeah in the meantime they're
selling just bucket loads of iphones
yeah okay so let's I mean so I mean you
know face time works over 3g or 4g
that's great except unless you're an
AT&amp;amp;T and no one to switch plans series
got sports scores male has this thing
called VIP where you can have you know
emails from certain people give you
different notifications a feature that
was introduced on Windows Mobile you can
reply to a text from a missed phone call
the feature that was introduced on
Windows Mobile um there's I'm just
saying man they're shared photo streams
that's like I'm interesting but it's
like this weird like not quite a social
network kind of I don't know it's weird
but a the thing I'm working up to you
like the big change is maps maps all
Apple it's all new they've kicked Google
to the curb and for everything that I've
seen like it looks very pretty and it
seems run pretty well and they're
flyover feature it's you know not as
useful to me a street view but it is
pretty cool and there is turn-by-turn
navigation which is really important and
you know you don't have to keep hunting
for third party apps that have weird
subscription models and blah blah blah
the third party navigation apps on iOS
I've never been fond of it all
especially compared to android so you
get all that and all the third party
apps should still work fine and
everything should be great unless you
live in a city and you need to use
public transit right yeah that seems to
be the big divide between iOS 6 we'll
have to see how kind of how it plays out
or maps i should say in iOS 6 we'll have
to see how it plays out but like there's
a lot of features that say someone who
lives in a rural or suburban area would
really appreciate like that turn-by-turn
navigation that a lot of i think a lot
of users have been wanting on iOS since
android introduced it a few years ago
but at the flip side there's the you
know urban user who might rely on those
transit directions that are going to be
no longer available directly and you'll
have to go to a third party app option
yeah yeah this feels like change that
was driven solely on political and and
you know a snap political
decisions between Apple and Google and
not any desire to actually improve the
user experience because I you know I
don't think there's any there's anything
when you can make some arguments about
the flyover mode but there is nothing
with actual material benefit to the user
in iOS 6 maps not to say that the that
Google or excuse me that that apple's
version of google maps was very good
either right bed dead essentially google
maps had a sense remain unchanged in iOS
since the start and you know a google
maps on android has lapped that product
several times over so i think that you
know if you're upgrading from iOS 5 to 6
that jump is probably less of a of a
shock to the system than if you're
moving from an android device to iOS 6
unless you need transit directions price
unless you pick which I'm totally
dependent on by the way the other do all
the other thing is that you know that
these new map features that are the
headline features apple says won't be
coming to the older devices so if you
are on an iphone 4 or an older ipod
touch or an older ipad you won't get the
turn-by-turn navigation and you won't
get the 3d flyover so in it for
especially for iphone 4 users this
really feels like they're losing
features more than they're gaining
anything you know we'll have to see how
the final product is and and and once we
run some tests on it and see how how
well it performs but at least if you're
an iphone 4s or an iphone 5 user you
gain that turn-by-turn feature if you're
losing the transit directions you're
gaining the turn-by-turn features so it
can be kind of like a net zero whereas
on the iphone 4 you lose the transit
directions and you don't get in the
turn-by-turn feature all right you guys
think that Google is going to go all out
and release a new app for iOS Maps app
they don't they I think they did a
really good job at the YouTube app and
the Google+ app is good like they've
figured out how to code decent native
iOS apps except for the gmail app yeah
every other one is great except for the
gmail app so I hope that there they do
release a Maps app a Google
maps app but I hope that the team that
built the YouTube app and the Google+
app work on it and not the team that
built the gmail app see I really like
I'm a big fan of conspiracy theories and
I really like the notion that Google
goes out of its way to either a make iOS
apps crappy or be nerf them in some
tragic way and of course to your point
Dan the gmail app is absolutely terrible
the chrome app for iOS of course is
still bit you know built on Safari it's
not actually using well that's but the
important chrome features are there you
get the sinking you get the omnibox you
get the cool tab management so that's
like the only thing that's really
different when you jump from iOS to
Android and chrome is the rendering
engine behind it like that the
experiment reveals a prominent Google
can't put the chrome right on jdate
right scan yeah right yeah no you're
right they can't but but the fact
remains I just a lot you have my fantasy
world where I think it was right it's a
nerve iOS products specifically gmail
yeah well which I mean theoretically
that's what they bought Sparrow for but
that remains to be seen we don't know
how that's gonna play out yet yeah
hopefully it plays out fast well one of
the other nerfed if you will if I can
steal your term Chris the iOS apps from
google recently was the drive app which
was virtually useless when it came out
it was just a viewer and you couldn't
create new files and you couldn't upload
anything but that recently got updated
with the ability to create files and to
upload files and stuff like that so that
yeah that got unnerved I guess so
hopefully you know Google can do the
same with the gmail app and hopefully if
it if Google does decide to release a
Google Maps app it's good from the
beginning yeah we don't talk about the
iphone 5 we could talk about pricing
yeah okay so the iphone 4s is down to 99
bucks on cash back the iphone 4 is free
and the 3gs is finally at long last gone
which took forever yeah so I think stuck
around for so did well I mean nowadays
the iphone 4 is the
same age as e 3gs was when it was moved
to the free price point but I think we
talked about this a little bit last week
and you know having an iphone for class
device at free is is kind of a wild
thing to think about I mean the iphone 4
in 2010 was introduced a crazy display
that we had not seen before you know
great hardware obviously in a really
solid camera and now you can get that
for free on contract and if you compare
it to the other phones that are
available for free on contract it's like
not even a contest yeah yeah even close
even even though it's two and a half
years old it's still not even a contest
right now Apple I have to say Apple has
figured out how to create a range of
products and that's just to take it it's
amazing excellent old products and and
keep them on the market and continue to
lower the prices and i think that the
you know the brand strength of the
iphone name carries all these products
more or less equally as the you don't
have these random names for the low end
products it's a beautiful model and it's
obviously working extremely well for
them however i do think that they would
have been very well served and the world
would have been well served if they had
if they had continued to sell 3gs as a
just a dirty prepaid device both in the
US and abroad you imagine if you could
get the 3gs for say 79 or $99
contract-free it's it would still be a
great product even now as a prepaid
phone right like that would be the go-to
unlocked roaming phone to bring me right
if you traveled your up or whatever
right uh well the march of progress
continues the iphone is coming on friday
uh but tomorrow 19th no day after
tomorrow no tomorrow there's gonna be an
HTC event we're expecting windows phone
8 devices i think from them there's the
zenith the Accord and the Rio there's
also been this 5 inch android phone
that's been floating around and I mean
I hope I mean we've talked about this a
lot that the 1-series in the 1x in
particular hasn't helped revitalize HTC
much and so I'm hoping that whatever
they're bringing to the table here will
be awesome first of all but we'll get
serious support from carriers or
partners either Google or Microsoft
depending on what it is they're
announcing because I would hate to see
HTC just you know fade into you know
irrelevance I don't think that they
deserve that as a company yeah I so you
know we've seen we've we've seen a few
leaks from this pose and windows phone
line up from HTC and they uh I mean it's
hard to get a sense it's really hard to
get a sense without actually seeing the
devices in person and and you know being
at the event or what not to feel out how
they actually compared to what nokia has
on offer for windows phone 8 and so you
know I did I don't feel comfortable
really making any sort of definitive
comment on these things but in general I
do feel more bullish again i know i say
this with every new release of Windows
Phone but I feel more bullish about the
hardware and the software going into
this release than ever before it's just
a question of whether you know they get
that like he said date or would it you
know they need the carrier support they
need they need to get their story
straight with with updates and upgrades
going forward they just need to present
I mean you know I phone just keeps
getting stronger and stronger and am you
know if they want to compete in that and
the market they just need to deliver an
extremely powerful message going into
the holiday season so hopefully I mean I
think that what the current rumors are
tracking for an early November launch
right for for most of these windows
phone 8 devices including the 920 yeah I
don't know I said you know so we've
we've held you know I think that all
three of us have held the 920 and it is
a very beefy and heavy phone that i
think is already for a strike
against it for people for anyone who's
considering but if you walk into a in 18
key store and you want to compare a 922
to an iphone 5 that's already a pretty
powerful strike against it but it does
have the the color range going for it
and and I think that that the windows
phone 8 home screen just looks really
cool I like the fact that you've got
these multiple box sizes going on now
and yeah I mean we'll see i'm definitely
going to there's no question about it
that i'm going to own and use a windows
phone 8 device of some sort for some
period of time I don't that's going to
be one of these htcs or 920 or what but
I said that with the 900 and I did I
used it for several weeks and and and
like I said before the you know the
Achilles heel would ultimately killed it
for me was the lack of any sort of
reasonable gmail support so we'll see if
I mean seriously all Google needs to do
is enable its iOS webview on I on mobile
I eat n that is all they need to do and
my prayers will be answered so we'll see
if they can pull that off earth google
feels the need to pull that off I don't
know that's a pretty junky fix if you
ask me because you still have to go to
the web view to you know deal with you
know you you do yeah so you don't get
you don't get proper notifications but
you kind of do because so here's what I
always do on iOS which is this was
before the sparrow days but well what i
would do is I'd set um I'd set up an
exchange account point in my gmail so I
still get notifications and then i would
i would put i would replace mail in the
the fixed bar of icons at the bottom
with a web icon pointing to the mobile
gmail view so that you know and between
the two I kind of made it work and
that's what I if theoretically if if
mobile gmail work properly on Windows
Phone that's what I would do on windows
phone but you get the the web view which
is completely worthless so we either
need something that is the equivalent of
Sparrow for Windows Phone or we need
Google to fix the way the very least the
minimum effort fix is for Google to fix
the the web view but we need something
because the the mail client I mean I get
that it's great for like pop email or
whatever it does not work well when you
have some
as rich and advances gmail is especially
if you actually put the time and effort
into organizing it the way that you you
can do if you you know if you take
advantage of all the features i use
priority inbox i use labels up the wazoo
and it's just it's completely
unmanageable with a standard email
client yep i agree there's there's the
the standard email client looks really
great and it's fun to use at least on
window 7.5 it was and it was very fast
but it really lacked the robust gmail
support that you'd be looking for yeah
so i think the last thing i want to talk
about today is this insane thing that
happened with acer they were going to
launch a phone based on the alley eun oh
s am I even pronouncing that right and
so they had like reporters going to this
event and they just canceled it and then
like google says we can't do this so
we're not going to do it and like what
the heck happened and so then google
comes out and says yet no we said they
can't do it they can't launch this phone
because it's based on android and then
the guys behind al you are like no it's
not based on android and there's been
this back and forth between 80 Rubin and
the guys behind this is lu NOS about
whether or not it's a fork of android
and whether or not acer is allowed to
launch a phone based on it and if they
do that google would you know kick them
out and stop giving them support of you
know of like google apps and you know
kick all the open handset alone it's a
really weird story yeah so I think the
the damning I think that the the nail in
the coffin of a sarist story here was
when Ruben i think it was Rubin who
pointed out that aliens App Store has
pirated versions google apps in it
google android apps so I mean like come
on like what what what's your defense at
that point I mean theoretically I guess
you could build a platform that that is
binary compatible with Android but first
of all odds are you did and second of
all that doesn't change the fact that
you have
he's pirated apps chillin in your App
Store so right yeah so I mean the story
from out from from alien is that it they
built this thing that they're not using
the dalvik engine which is the engine
that runs you know much android apps
they're using their own custom thing
that like mirrors its functionality
which is ironic because dalvik whole
point was to do the same thing to Java
right yeah anyway Google saying no
that's not true you're actually using
our technology you know somewhere in
here this is technically a fork and as a
member of the open handset alliance azer
has agreed not to launch stuff that is
you know based on android but not
Android compatible what's funny about
that is you know Amazon's totally for
you to do that it's just not part of the
open handset alliance so there's been a
lot of joke running around about oh yeah
so haha Google's not so open anymore
hahaha and I don't know how I feel about
that like part of me wants to like I
don't be sympathetic to this you know
hating on Google for being evil about
this and limiting what other partners
and telling them what they can and can't
do but on the other hand like I guess
I'm kind of happy to see the open
handset alliance finally actually mean
something because today it seemed to me
like it was just this you know PR shell
and it didn't actually like have any
teeth or you know there wasn't actually
real contributions from the other
members but this and even like you know
Sony putting its stuff into this
experimental project to launch a USP
stock Android on Sony's handsets
recently like it's starting to feel a
little bit more like an ecosystem and a
little bit less like just googles bag
which is a totally ironic thing to say
after Google just you know swung the
hammer at a sir I have a different view
I think that you know this this hammer
that Google swung is something that
people have been wanting Google to do
for a long time I think it went the way
it happened was not how everybody wanted
it to happen but people have been
complaining about how you know you pick
up one android device and it doesn't
feel like another
android device and you move to another
android device and it's a totally
different experience and and i know a
lot of people just wanted google this
put its foot down and say like you know
you can conform to these standards where
you don't get gmail and that's kind of
like what happened here you know it
google said that Ali Ali Yoon is is not
you know or acer is not you know
conforming to our standards with the
open handset alliance with this alley
you know s and you know if you could do
that but you're not going to get the
open handset privileges and I think that
would a lot of people have been asking
for Google to do that but it's just kind
of went about the wrong way here so
let's be clear I think that two years
ago good there's no way that Google
would have done this they wouldn't have
cared but I think that that what what
Amazon undid to Android is something
that that Google never anticipated and I
think that they are more anxious than
ever to keep Android keep the spirit of
Android close and we're seeing that bear
out with this I I think that you know
you you you put this exact story two
years ago not Ruben not anybody else
inside Google would have cared that this
was happening but it's a different
google now and they have different
priorities and a different understanding
for what they need to do to advance the
platform in light of how successful
amazon was it forking Android in a
meaningful way and you know went on to
build successful products on top of it i
don't think that Ruben ever anticipated
that happening with with with android
yeah well is it you know the other thing
about this that roses people the wrong
way and I think rightly so is that it
was a sir I mean it feels like picking
on the little guy if Samsung had gotten
to the point where they were launching
an OS that claim to have Android
compatibility do you really think that
Google would have done this to Samsung
answer true yeah yeah the autumn but I
mean you know it's also like I'm sure
that there just wasn't proper
communication between acer and Google in
the first place right you know earlier
on this
right but I take your point about about
Amazon what it's done with the kindle
fire I think Google is finally drawn a
line of this is where you know Android
compatibility asks this past to be and
the question now is are they going to
move that line to try and create more
consistency across different
manufacturers or is this where this line
is going to stay right right I mean we
know there's still that that Wall Street
Journal rumor from several months ago
hanging over our heads that we haven't
heard a peep about ever since about
there being a line of Nexus phones
supposedly announced right about now I'm
expecting this to happen anytime now if
the rumor actually comes to fruition so
you know if Google wants to expand the
meaning of Nexus into something that's
truly useful to consumers than me you
know that that gives them more leeway to
kind of ignore the rest of the noise but
if they don't do that if they continue
with the existing Nexus model which
isn't very commercially successful in
any meaningful way then yeah then they
might need to say okay well we need to
rein in all of our OEM and sort of
create more consistency across entire
Android range which might actually be
the more desirable you know as much as I
would like to have a selection of Nexus
phones to choose from that are you know
true Nexus devices at the end of the day
it might be more meaningful for Android
or exceed me for Google to to put more
you know to exert more control over
their their main OEM partners it's
actually not a bad note to end on now
that the iphone rumors have wrapped up
and we actually know what the iphone 5
looks like definitively it's time for us
to get some sweet sweet brand new nexus
action whether it's these multiple
devices or just a brand new Nexus device
from whoever it's going to be it there's
still no option of me to get stock Nexus
stock Android on ATT with LTE without
hacking and I'm tired of that part of
that situation I'm tired of the flagship
android nexus phone being on boring
crappy hardware at the terrible screen
and even worse camera
I'm ready for ya good Nexus phone yeah
and yeah it's I mean the Galaxy Nexus
wasn't the most cutting-edge phone when
it was released in at this point it's
pretty long in the tooth yeah well
