think it's the question that everybody's
asking you can't deny that Jobs was this
huge driving force he wasn't just a
Salesman he wasn't just a showman he was
intimately involved in the creation of
those products right the question I get
from a lot of people is is is their
design going to go to crap now or is it
going to start slowly going to crap ah
and I don't think that's going to be the
problem for Apple not like an Amy like
industrial design well across the board
UI design industrial design is the
package for the next iPhone not going to
be as nice right I don't think you have
to worry about any of those things I
think I think that's the least up to me
that's the thing i would imagine would
be that would is least likely to happen
because they have designers in replace
and he wasn't even a designer really
writing it was like a director of
disease like it he was like a dream a
dreamer right and is it his job was like
basically to dream up stuff I mean
really and if anything I actually think
the design might even get better without
him in so far is that there's no longer
one guy him who when he's wrong can
insist on having his way do you think
we'll see you less or more stitch
leather I think we'll see less message
sighs I don't think you know my people
laugh but I think that that's Steve Jobs</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
