I've been in love with all these crazy
futuristic keyboards for a few years now
when it first debuted the Seaboard
grande only catches that instrument is
almost $9,000 really kinda limits it's
just a very rich or they're very
talented this is the Roli seaboard rise
it came out late last year it's a little
more in my price range
49 key version here is $1200 there's a
25 key one for $800 again that's still
pretty expensive but it's the kind of
price range that opens it up to
independent musicians series hobbyists
or people who may not be as musically
talented but really liked playing TV
theme songs
think about a traditional piano it has a
set number of sounds it can make and
there's really no variations a pretty
static instrument doesn't really matter
where you hit the seat key it's always
can produce the same C sound now when
digital keyboards and MIDI controls came
out very quickly you start to see pitch
wheels separate dials let you change the
modulation entirely unlike a guitar is
spinning a string rule DC board takes it
idea step further at first blush roll
these instruments look like a keyboard
but all the keys kind of bleed into one
another
you can literally press anywhere on the
silicon pad and produce the sound these
grooves which really calls key waves are
really just guideposts kind of li know
where the traditional notes are
everything otherwise is just a sound
producing sensor so you'll notice as I'm
kind of moving my finger and get kind of
a wiggle sound this is just undulating
if I slide it all up and down you get
every little sound between really calls
this five dimensional touch what it
means is beyond just the note itself
it's tracking how hard you press down
whether or not you continue to press
down are you wiggling left or right up
or down
all these changes matter and it can
change the tone dramatically you don't
have to play it that way you don't have
to like have all the settings you can
change it to a traditional piano you can
just the sensitivity anywhere in between
but my question to you is why would you
ever do that it's like buying a
Lamborghini and just taking it to
grocery store so what I like about using
Game of Thrones theme song is that it
has a very strong and well defined melt
everyone knows it the nuances in playing
it like people actually can identify
certain strange sounds and stop and
stammer a little bit certain sounds have
fluent trying to play it on this versus
like normal piano versus guitar really
shows the potential and also the
potential learning curve using an
instrument like this so for example if
you're doing kind of like the intro
March
you really got a hit just on the middle
if you don't you're gonna get a little
bit of a wavering sound it's gonna sound
off if you keep this finger down and try
to transition it's gonna make you kind
of slide into it other things is like
you really gotta start playing notes
more like a like a violin and extent
like you've got a like know that you're
going to slide a bit so just really kind
of milk it so here I can push down
harder or softer and it's gonna change
the volume a little bit hitting right
down the middle especially on one giant
non-colored pad like it takes time it
takes effort so it's like
like that took me two days to get that
without like kind of screwing up and
flat hang a sharp it is a beautiful
pretty piece and once you kind of get
the hang of it you can do some really
amazing stuff so that's definite too far
up and it changed basically freeze that
I have here a change to have a horn
sound let's see what arrives you should
really think of this not as a keyboard
pan of analog but some kind of a new
instrument that takes the face of the
keyboard and really hits like more of a
stream kind of thing
you really should kind of like just own
into like a shaking the vibrato the
learning curve trying to get more
accurate more precise so once you do
that you can do some great crazy stuff
with it and it's really fun to mess up
on this I can't stress that enough as
painful as this was to listen to for you
guys and for myself and as much time as
I put on this every time I screw up it's
still a fun challenge it is a premium
product this is not for like an everyday
consumer you should not learn this is
your first instrument but if you are a
serious hobbyist or you are looking to
do some kind of new music and get like a
different kind of sound I definitely
recommend giving this thing a shot shot
try
so because Rowley is the Seaboard could
be used for Titian the Seaboard can be
used a tradition the Seaboard can be
used as a tradition so what I like about
you blah English I'll also cuz of
