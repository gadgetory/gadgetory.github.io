after Google's keynote at Google i/o in
San Francisco looking at the Moto 360
this is one of the Android wear
smartwatches it's one of the first ones
we heard about and it's one of probably
the most intriguing and we've seen three
so far the Samsung gear lie to the LG G
watch than this and this is easily the
best-looking so the big thing about it
is that it's not nearly as big as it
looks it actually feels pretty good it's
light and comfortable it's made of
stainless steel and has a leather band
it comes in two different colors but
they're big on the materials for all of
this and it feels really good I wear a
watch that's not that much smaller than
this and it's actually it's early
heavier than this so it works really
well it fits really nicely and it's much
more comfortable than I thought it would
be so it's currently running retail mode
which means it only does about four
different things but you can see some of
what it looks like and we got to see one
running on a motor oil executives wrists
that ran just about this fast and then
you can say things like ok Google and
even in a crowded room it figures out
what you're actually doing and that
you're talking to the displays 320 by
270 and down here is where all the
display drivers are basically they took
all the things you'd normally put in a
bezel and put them all down here so that
they could have the screen go totally
edge-to-edge and it looks really really
nice as a result it's it's definitely
better than its round honestly instead
of square so this is the thing we don't
know that much about the 360 and it's
coming out later this summer we don't
know the price that we're pretty sure
it's gonna be $249 we don't know how
long it's gonna last we don't know the
processors gonna be but one thing we
know for sure is that this is easily the
best-looking SmartWatch we've ever seen
and hopefully it's going to start a lot
more that worth like it and that is the
Moto 3 6</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
