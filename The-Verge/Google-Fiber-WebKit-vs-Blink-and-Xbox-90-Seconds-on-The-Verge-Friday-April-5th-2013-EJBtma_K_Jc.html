company today announced that Chrome will
be leaving behind WebKit in just about
10 weeks on Wednesday Google said it
would be forking the popular rendering
engine for its own version called blink
the company had previously been working
with apple on WebKit which also powers
the Safari browser since WebKit and
blink are so similar web developers

to Twitter this week to express surprise
over the negative reaction to be
specific he likened it to not buying a
vacuum cleaner because the electricity
sometimes goes out the views expressed
by orth are not necessarily indicative
of the company's plans but he might be
in a position to know a thing or two and
