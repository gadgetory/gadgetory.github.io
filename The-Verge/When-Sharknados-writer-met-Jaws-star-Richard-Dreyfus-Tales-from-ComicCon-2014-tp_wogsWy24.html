moment everybody's been waiting for the
big panels from Marvel and DC and so I'd
go to check out the line and it's out of
control there are 12,000 people and
they've been waiting for 36 hours I said
no thank you I'm gonna read about this
news on Twitter like a normal person so
I walk away and it turns out I have a
chance to meet with Thunder Levin the
screenwriter of sharknado 1 into I say
heck yes I'm doing that I said Thunder
tell me about the experience of making
sharknado 2 he said well it was crazy
we had to film it in New York in
February even though the movie's
supposed to take place in July and it
was one of the coldest winters New York
had seen in decades it was so cold that
the actors jaws froze shut they had to
blow hot air on their faces just so they
could speak I said you know there's
something kind of poetic about the fact
that actors in the movie about sharks
have their jaws frozen shut he says
speaking of Jaws I met Richard Dreyfuss
this morning I was like be Richard
Dreyfuss from Jaws he said yeah I walked
right up to him and I said hey I'm the
guy who wrote sharknado and Richard
Dreyfuss turns around and says what's a
sharknado pretty sick burn from Richard
Dreyfuss anyway sharknado do comes out
on Wednesday and I will be watching the
hell out of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
