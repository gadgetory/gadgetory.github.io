to the verge mobile show this is episode
52 a full year if you count by weeks of
the Virgin Mobile show it's the week of
July first 2013 it's the holiday week is
beautiful I'm dieter bohn i'm dan
seifert and i'm chris sigler and we are
sorry we missed last week I don't even
remember what caused us to miss last
week we were just all very busy it's
just it was just life man like I was I
was too busy schmoozing with steve
wozniak is right yeah I just I just
don't care about our listeners and
watcher oh that's a lie I care about you
the most so we've got two full weeks of
news not all of which we're going to
talk about because there's just too much
but I think the biggest thing for us to
talk about well one of the two biggest
things for us to talk about is the
google play editions of the HTC One and
the samsung galaxy s4 and you know
before we get into talking about like
reviews of the phones what we think
about it's like what it's like using
stock what they mean for the Nexus
program all that stuff can I just say
that I really believed that the days of
Android phones having 15 words in their
branding was behind us right the HTC
Thunderbolt LTE 4G with something
something on Sprint's right I thought
that was done but now we've got you know
samsung galaxy s4 Google Play edition
come on yeah but at least they're not
you're not dealing with as many like
codes and acronyms right like Google
Play edition is more straightforward
than 4g LTE yes d3d 4G LTE but just as
just like 4G is this crappy branding
that might not actually apply if the
phone didn't actually have LTE like
Google Play edition that phrase is so
indicative of like
midi that couldn't decide on what these
phones are what they mean and what they
should be called right if they called it
a nexus edition and then that would be
always come straight from google awesome
if they had called it a gue comes with
Google or something that would mean
something else but instead we've got
this thing that sort of is just like it
comes from google play so it means
you're just buying it from them but it
has sort of stock android i know i don't
care what google calls it i'm just gonna
call it my nexus one but now i'm seeing
like gpe like the acronym the HTC One
GPE lower lower case e Oh God yeah
that's the other thing is not edition
caplets or Casey really it's just it's
just style guide headaches for us so
okay these phones they run great I got
actually slightly better battery life on
these phones that I got from the
original skin versions which is crazy to
me I wasn't expecting that at all and I
don't know what else what else do you
guys want to know I mean I really want
to talk about what this means for the
next program we'll come back to that but
like let's just talk about the phones
themselves I don't have them in hand
anymore because I had to ship him off to
New York sovereignty New York play with
them but I do have my developer edition
one that I've loaded the you know Rob
from XDA on it so I'm sort of back on
the stock well so my ultimate level of
excitement for these devices absolutely
hinges on how quickly they get 4.3 after
4.39 out we added never the answer that
yet five-point oh and whatever it is
right following with right right
actually I was like writing that tweet
today earlier after I'd had tweeted
something else snarky about updates and
I couldn't get it under 140 characters
actually couldn't get it under like 200
characters so I ended up giving up but
it was like like that update is going to
be a litmus test for whether or not
these devices matter for the Android
ecosystem and it's also sort of a litmus
test for the Android ecosystem in
general and software updates because
we've seen so many promises at i/o of
you know we're going to fix this update
issue we're going to fix this update
issue so in 2011 it was the 18 month
2012 last year did they even address it
at all I think they may have it may have
been m.i.a pretty sure is m.i.a and then
this year they're addressing it by
saying well we're not going to talk
about updates for all these other phones
but we are going to give you the google
play edition that is going to have
prompt updates but the thing is these
updates don't come directly from Google
these roms you know on these phones the
software these zones is still built by
Samsung and HTC respectively and
presumably Sony's coming fairly soon
there's been rumors about that and
they're putting in just like the
lightest touch of customization so HTC
is making sure it's beats EQ is
compatible and Samsung I think has a
custom lockscreen that's compatible with
their flip cover but if they can't turn
that stuff around quick that means or
they don't care to turn around quick I
think I mean they don't care or it means
that this this is harder than we thought
but I think they can turn around quick
because I'm like I HTC made the decision
to offer google play edition relatively
late in the game because it wasn't
announced I out right it was at dive
into media at all things D which die
votes dive into mobile was just dive
into the 11 yeah tlm just do was just it
was just so I'm hopeful but I'm really
stupid to be hopeful that we'll see fast
updates on these things mm-hmm so I was
I was hopeful uh just like you are and
because I was thinking you know Samsung
and HTC are both pretty responsible with
updating their own devices with their
own skinned versions and things like
that until like today's announcement
from HTC about the HTC One S which is
like totally deflated my confidence uh
in that any that the one google edition
is going to not be ignored by HTC which
I guess we could just talk about that
since it's it's it semi-related that the
HTC announced today that the one s is
not going to be updated past android 4.1
point one it's not going to get sense 5
and the one s being a 15 month old phone
that had you know when it came out it
ran
top-of-the-line processor had loads of
RAM really a very solid device a great
device they're allowed certain to the
One X right had smaller size cooler
hardware I mean the screen wasn't as
high resolution as the 1x but everything
else is exactly the same uh and now it's
orphaned 15 months after its riiii
totally I totally reject your anger dan
hi I push it back into your face look if
if in your 2012 so there are two kinds
of people that bought the 1s right there
are there are the people in its new
liner and those who do their there are
the people who are you know just thought
it was a cool phone and they're the the
Android the people who are savvy about
Android know what they were buying and
if you fall into the latter category you
bought a carrier branded 1s in
particular you had no expectations about
this phone supporting any future version
of Android oh come on so you can say the
same thing enemies yeah you can see the
same thing about the 1x then you could
say the same thing about the s3 and
every single it yes absolutely if you
buy any phone that is why that that is
one of the most broken things about the
Android echoes echoes to spread you
today is that if you buy any phone that
is not a nexus even the google play
edition you buy any phone that is not a
nexus you have zero right to have any
expectations about future android
support and then the screwed up well the
hell that's like no no no you have the
right that's where you're wrong chris
you absolutely have the right you like
like you that is something that you
should demand you have the right uh
whether you're going to get it or not is
another story and and the problem isn't
so much that oh it's like you're not
going to get android 4.3 and its new
camera interface or you're not going to
get whatever new features come out it's
you know you're not going to get
security patches either so it's like
that's you've bought a phone you signed
a contract for more than likely you if
you bought this the day came out that's
15 months into your two-year contract
now and now your phone is not being
supported with any sort of security or
fixes or bugs or anything for the
remaining well i don't know about forty
percent ready fixes they could they
could push that stuff out of things yeah
they don't think they announced that
well if there's a major security fix
maybe not but we've seen to take a long
time
I'm for you know basic bug fixes to get
fixed on Android devices because
carriers drag their feet and the
manufacturers drag the fee or whatever
but like you know you at least have the
expectation that's going to be supported
for the life of your contract right no I
don't you don't do that anymore I mean
the thing that I tweeted that's I'm
sorry two years ago Google promised that
you'd get it you'd get updates for 18
months and now that one s totally failed
like that I promise is dead from 2011
it's gone Ram like so look at the
Android ecosystem as far as updates are
concerned they're getting pantsed right
now by blackberry and windows phone with
Windows Phone 8 maybe not seven that was
a whole fiasco but you look at windows
phone blackberry iOS and Android like
the four you know what else do you there
anything else you want to put in that
list what moves the lowest it just
announcement okay well we'll see ya know
those are the four that you know you can
go out and into a store it was the only
one that isn't that you can't rely on
for updates on your phone android is the
only one where you're like i just have
to assume that the day i buy it that's
what it's going to be like for the rest
of it every other ecosystem has already
proven that they can push out updates
across multiple you know types of
devices and like I this has been a
perennial issue and they're fixed for it
this year is just by a google play
edition which isn't available on verizon
isn't available on sprint has to be
bought off contract and again like fool
me once they have to prove h samsung and
HTC have to prove to me that they'll put
out updates promptly and they have a
chat and so so Chris what are you saying
you're not going to buy a google play
edition until you know for a fact that
they can actually hold that promise i'm
definitely strongly considering waiting
until 4.3 as announced to see what the
leg time is um a you know hey I haven't
ordered one yet I probably would have if
they were shipping same day but the fact
that there was that long shipping delay
kind of like gave me the patience that I
needed to not click on the pre order
button so no I haven't ordered one yet
and of course just like everybody else
I'm having the the s4 vs 1 dilemma so
I'm waiting for
buddy probably at the verge because I'm
having that as far as one dilemma I have
a one developer edition but I really if
the s4 is available in something other
than white I would be decided i would i
would tell somebody to buy the s4 and i
will give them my one on my mode you
like you like the blue better or pebble
or whatev squirt it was like anything
other than white white is played I'm
tired of it it's stupid it also looks
really cheap on a samsung sits
cheap-looking plastic like the red would
be hot any anything honestly it's the
worst but the the battery life on the
one is surprisingly better than I
expected and like better than the AT&amp;amp;T
version even which was slightly better
than the the standard one I believe
because the processor right or no why
was why was the 18t 1lt the AT&amp;amp;T one the
818 t1 actually gave us right around the
same battery life as the International
Version I would've did it on LTE so
right that was what I would not have um
I don't know I mean we're supposed to be
done complaining now we have top of the
line android hardware available with
stock Android and like this is this is
the thing we've been waiting for four
years it's very close it it's very close
but we need what we need is no
compromise Nexus device which i think is
it's more than semantics it is a
different philosophy and I'm sure you
know google has said correct me if I'm
wrong but I think Google said at i/o
that they are not done with the Nexus
program right right the Nexus brand is
going to continue with it what that
means we don't know that could mean more
tablets for the Nexus line it might mean
more smartphones might not it might mean
a cue to you know but the Nexus brand
itself is not gone yeah going to google
so I think firstly I believe God is a
nexus brand being like completely
irrelevant in terms of like scale and
mattering to the Android ecosystem well
that's true that that's probably true
with these google play editions too
though right because it the number of
people who are paying full price for
these funds is probably relatively small
and I think what looking back you know I
was worried leading up to the GPE d-day
so to speak that uh that
Google store was going to go down just
like it did for the nexus 4 but that was
kind of a different ball game because
what really set the nexus 4 apart was
the price it was what 269 for the age to
299 for the gig and 349 for the 16 okay
and the fact that you couldn't buy the
nexus 4 anywhere else like it's not like
you could go into a carrier store and
get a nexus for it i think google play
edition right it's called the google
play edition but you could still go into
a store buy an s4 or a 10 contract and
get the same exact hardware right and
that's a nuance that you probably won't
be able to explain to some people so
yeah it's an open question how many of
these these phones are actually selling
who knows um I know what else you guys
want to say about it i mean i wrote it
big so i should have plenty of thoughts
but I I don't think the new camera
interface I know that there's some
people are really into it and they're
like oh it was this muted running 4.3 no
it's just the new camera interface and I
didn't actually write that much about it
other than I don't really like it I
think that this the idea of like you
hold down your finger on it and radial
menu pops up and then you slide over to
it it's the words theory it's cool but
in practice it's like you lose your
place and like oh I don't mean to do
that and it just it's the problem that i
have with the camera interface the stock
Android camera interface is if my finger
like brushes against the screen suddenly
my camera flips around to the front or
my my flash gets turned on or my white
balance gets thrown off and like no
other camera interface for a mobile
phone that I've ever used has been that
like trigger happy to change settings on
me which I find really annoying
especially for the fact that I don't see
I'm doing it because this the settings
are hidden until my finger touches the
screen um so I if there's one thing that
you know I actually think Samsung and
HTC do far better than Google with is
the camera interface it's on both
Samsung and HTC's customizations are far
better easier to use better access to
settings and things like that so that
that is the one thing i miss on stock
android is i can't stand the camera
interface yeah it was really bad on
stock android until four-point-oh wasn't
it it was like in a very singly bed yeah
but like even then even as simple
ugly as that was it I liked it better
than the current one because the current
one has that thing where like I just
accidentally brush it and all of a
sudden everything's like changed it's
it's infuriating and it's not and
everything is like hidden like it's
there but it's hidden like with iOS it's
just not there except for your Flash
settings are there and you're each dr's
there one of the things that surprised
me is the the quality of the images and
I know that we can get really nitpicky
here in fact we did when I was showing
you guys that the sample pictures from
all four stock and skin versus you know
HTC and Samsung but i would say that by
and large the image quality out of of
both cameras was off by maybe at the
most like five percent from there from
like the the skin counterparts I really
was super close and there are only a few
edge cases like super low light where
you could see a really significant
difference and I don't know how much of
that we put on the samsung and HTC
actually putting their image processing
into this google play edition rom or how
much of it is that like there's their
marketing around how amazing their
camera stuff is really is just kind of
fluff I imagine it's the former well I
the at least on on let's see if I can
articulate won't try say at least with
HTC it's named various components of its
camera like the ultrapixel and image
sense and whatever it's and it's saying
that this is custom or special Hardware
obviously in order to use the camera at
all the google play edition rom has to
work with that hardware and talk to that
hardware so I'm sure it's using very
similar processing as the sense edition
and that's why we're seeing very similar
is I think even with a you know that
five percent difference that you
mentioned i think that's that could
easily be attributed to just varying
circumstances from shot to shot like
that's that's a margin of error in
pictures like you know i tried to like
stand there and hold the camera in the
exact same spot and click click click
yeah i mean it's it's it's like unless
you're in a lab it's it's it's in rien
real-world use that's just that's an
acceptable margin of error so it's
either way can I just say that
walking around uh the not the best
neighborhood not the worst neighborhood
but not the best best neighborhood in
San Francisco with four top of the line
android phones on me plus plus my iphone
i had five phones on me like it didn't
occur to me till I got back you know got
back up out from walking around taking
sample photos like oh I had like three
thousand dollars worth of gear just like
in my pockets that's gonna that's freaky
anyway um what else you guys want to
know about I want to know why I can't
get the google play edition in in red
the red I want I want it in black but I
bought a silver ones i wanted it not
quite oh the one yeah i wanted but she
can't get colors on the HTC One working
like at all like it there they're kind
of unicorny at this point well the black
one you can go to 18 teen by the black
10 is that they have the black one now
at eighteen t finally yeah I took a
while okay alright so the other big news
and this actually kind of broke over the
past couple of days is we've got a look
at Motorola's new logo and they've put a
new ad out I guess it's running an ad
age tomorrow but we've got it today the
adage put it up today about the Moto X
true so what is this logo tell us it's
colorful it's bad the logo tell so
they've made it very clear that the
quote unquote that you know the
so-called batwing isn't going anywhere
the classic like stylized em in the
circle that isn't going anywhere but
what they're doing is they're they're
applying a bunch of different treatments
to it which is something that AOL made a
lot of noise a few years ago like when
they redid their logo like it wasn't
just like a single logo they had like
they oh well text and then like a bunch
of different backgrounds for it and
motorola's doing something similar where
like a tech week fruit for instance they
had a treatment where the the batwing
was above like a circuit board and then
the one that we posted on the site the
original one we saw was purple which
came off of tech week site which is a
conference they were sponsoring last
week in Chicago
but then they also sent us one that was
white with like a rainbow a line around
it and that's the one that we put in the
top of that post so they're going to be
doing a bunch of different things with
it so it's kind of a little more playful
the now going Logan which was just read
which is a very you know hard masculine
logo and I think this is kind of this
kind of softens damage a little bit
makes them a little bit more fun which
is probably the direction they needed to
go and certainly is more aligned with
Google's right vision as I think we're
seeing from this ad to they don't just
look like a verizon company now the
right a and Motorola isn't the same as
the a and a google company but some of
the letter forms look identical and some
are a little bit different and like oh
what's up that's annoying that's
annoying in exactly the same way that
comcast new logos is annoying we're like
like that the letter is rounded on one
end and like squared on the other yeah
and you can never unsee that yeah you
can never unsee it so yeah I don't know
what I they do I mean I think I dunno
why they did that which is that the the
motorola text is a it's like a brand it
is a logo you're not just text where as
a google company is like the font that
they use is the basis for creating the
logo so from you're trying to put my
mind into the mind of a designer I guess
I kind of get it but it's so weird so
let's talk about this this ad it's a big
full page thing there's some beautiful
text / blue and then there's a bunch of
couple of people jumping into the water
yeah we're so excited and they confirmed
Moto X which we knew and the tagline is
designed by you assembled in the USA and
tell me that designed by you isn't a
shot across about Apple because they're
they're all new big push is designed by
Apple in California and this is designed
by you assembled in the USA is that a
thing am I reading too much into that I
think you are reading how much you like
I feel like I see that that I mean
right Apple kind of started that but
that's on every single product in the
world now designed by blah blah blah
manufactured in China like that it was
like thats thats everywhere so i think
that if they wanted to go after Apple
they would probably do it a little
differently than that and I also think
that it's very from from Google's
perspective I think that it's very
important that Motorola and just like
I'll google products motorola plays its
own game it doesn't go on the offensive
with this first round of ads I think
that would be a very weird and bad look
for them so okay what do we know like do
we really know what the first smartphone
that you can design yourself means like
I what is like do we do we do we know I
think that's a very overreaching way of
saying that the phone is response like
personalizes and is responsive to the
the person that's using it which is you
like you can customize the widgets exact
right like like that's exactly what it's
going to be and and it's particularly
confusing because I think there's some
rumors going around then already got
phones with custom back plates you know
we've already got phones that you can
customize the wallpaper you can
customize you know which is all that
crap it isn't Sam already got religious
that that even Motorola's own phones
that you know their little active what's
it called the Smart Actions Smart
Actions right so like are they just sort
of like rejiggering that stuff it's like
Taco Bell and they just take the same
ingredients and rearrangement present
them in a different way this is a
burrito it's always delicious right so
is are they doing something genuinely
new when it comes to customization I
think that I think the short answer is
no they aren't doing anything new with
customization but I so I talked briefly
with iqbal Arshad at Tech Week last week
who's the head of the head of product
engineering at Motorola actually really
can you explain Tech Week don't know if
you did it earlier because I don't
listen so tech week is this it's
basically like a startup it's almost
like I would roughly equate it to like a
techcrunch disrupt uh but in Chicago I
is the closest I can kind of relate it
to it was very strangely run in that I
want to check in at the front I don't
know why I'm relaying this story I'm
sure our listeners don't care and I
apologize to our listeners in advance I
want to hear the amazing story about you
getting your badge I'm sure it's
completely engrossing and compelling no
so so I walk outta line back up I walk
up a black I think uh but I walk up to
the desk and I'm like and I had my
eventbrite ticket that I printed out and
I I gave it to the person at the counter
and said um you know I'm media I'm here
for the motorola keynote and she said uh
what company are you are you doing press
for I'm like Wilton I'm just I'm here to
cover a tech week and she's like right
but like all right like are you with
motorola or like who are you like do you
not know how media like have you not
worked with press before is this a new
concept so once we got so soon as she
was asking if you were a paid shill for
motorola it's basically i think i
couldn't tell for sure but i think so um
but then she she pulls out a droid
xyboard and and proceeds to scan my
eventbrite ticket and then this i just
heard the zai boards not getting a
update actually we heard that last week
anyway continue well it turns out you
don't need the update to scan eventbrite
tickets apparently uh but then after
after she scanned and she's like oh i
don't know like I don't really know to
do with you so then like she wandered
away and then some other guy came up and
went to scan my ticket and he was like
oh you've already checked in yeah with
his I board and he he scanned he's like
oh you someone has already used your
ticket I'm like yeah she just gave my
ticket like two seconds ago so there was
a little bit of a fiasco getting into
this keynote um i have no idea where boy
is going moto drama you're talking about
tech week later dr. yes it's male
something Nick ball Arshad hick well who
who is the head of I believe his his
title is he's an engineer fights
president of global product development
that's a
title and he said kind of the same thing
that dennis woodside said at d11 about
this product which is that he really
drove home the point that this phone is
going to rely very heavily on an array
of of in-house designed and built
sensors and that are like really
customized for this phone and are like
really important to the experience but
wouldn't going to any details I'm like
so does that mean that you're working
like really closely with like TI or
qualcomm or whoever is providing your
your apps processor he says no that
we're doing this all ourselves so I
don't like I have no idea what this
means yet but they are apparently
working on some pretty hardcore
circuitry for this phone so there will
be some differentiator that we haven't
seen I hope as a hardcore battery to go
with a hardcore serger circuitry well
didn't dennis woodside or somebody said
maybe but like there being an extra
processor or something yeah what can put
a companion core maybe it could've been
a medical companion core but also known
as as David no but but somebody said
that like they're they're extremely low
power or something to that effect right
so it's still unclear what these sensors
are and what they do like I don't know
what what can there be like we already
have like in the gs4 there's a
barometric pressure sensor there's a I
mean who knows maybe it has like a maybe
can detect like a pulse or something I
don't know they could do pulse they
could do thing kind of like a um like a
Fitbit style step counter they can have
a breathalyzer like if you if you're
drunk like before you text you've got to
breathe on the microphone and then you
look out and up sorry you couldn't take
bed rest next right now it could detect
bad breath it'd be like a dual function
man my my twitter uh feed would be so
barren if if I had a breathalyzer on my
phone I was not allowed to tweet when
drinking her just me nothing never tweet
one drunk that's where's the live I yeah
I mean it could so yeah it could be a
lot of biometric types of sensors
because in terms of like environmental
sensors existing phones got kind of have
that maximize I think temperature very
much pressure you know 8-way gyroscopes
and accelerometers a you know proximity
sensors what more can you do yeah I
don't know I guess a lot of health stuff
yeah right which-- like the cops call to
bloomberg phone now sorry you don't need
that that soda um so this has got to be
coming pretty soon right i mean they're
starting to ramp up yeah yeah i mean
this ad is going to be in like every
major newspaper New York Times
Washington Post nice day today Wall
Street Journal it tomorrow's newspaper I
mean they're trying to get this message
out there obviously they want people
thinking about and talking about
motorola and uh look God knows if we
know anything from past companies if
people if companies do that and that
don't deliver within at least a couple
weeks that might as well not have done
anything to begin with well I think we
can give them a month or a month yet
will say like three three to six weeks
and that's it it once you go beyond that
like they'd lost their window right now
which actually puts them right in the
timing for back to school and if I
remember correctly motorola did actually
have an event in early September last
year to announce the razr m and the razr
HD s and things like that so yes ya know
I went to that in New York and there was
a band and they were very attractive men
playing the drums and guitar and then
they came into the crowd and tried to
get me to sing along with her hey
remember that yes yeah cuz on the live
stream we could see you everybody in the
crowd was like like like clapping
because they were all working from
Motorola and then like in the front on
the right there's one guy's his head
down and you got good to see steam
coming out of my ears because I'm so no
I'm not playing this game make it stop
um okay so that's motorola i don't know
what else photos i got a samsung galaxy
s4 active its galaxy s4 that you can get
wet I am sure cool a dirty every so
everybody seems pretty impressed with
well it's it's there why it's a galaxy
s4 that you can get wet like that
there's there's one compromise with it
and that's what the camera is 8
megapixels instead of 13 megapixels but
otherwise it's the same screen same
processor it's really thin you know it's
more about just for you can get wet who
was it that said I think Neil I said
that he wishes there was a galaxy s4
active google play edition sure which I
mean more bucks man you know I think I
want the s4 Google Play edition so the
one as soon as you get it you're gonna
wish you got the one I'm if you get the
one you're gonna wish you got that sound
I don't one with like the the logo menu
button hack so I can hit the logo to
bring up the menu button so i don't even
have the problem of missing that extra
button or having to deal with that three
men you like so so just give the s4 also
and then you you have both very unhappy
there's no yeah all I do know is that
I'm gonna buy the hell out of a sony
smartwatch 2 now you're not no you
aren't I am no you're not art and this
is why can I tell you exactly why oh my
god guys it now definitely just to piss
you off you guys wasn't gonna do what I
didn't really mean it but now I do oh
you guys well I mean it's all I have I
have dropping with yeah I want to hear
what you think about this because this
looks like it's a step in the wrong
direction as far as I'm concerned but
good night no you're absolutely right
like why does the front look like a tiny
android phone like liar their water
three capacitive touch buttons on the
front of this thing yeah it's a
comparison or menu button like yes it's
it might as well have a stylist like
that old fossil palm watch yes exactly
exact opposite of buttons on the front I
think the design itself is a step in the
right direction compared to the older
ones I think it looks nice and you know
you could put a nice looking watch face
on it when you're dressed up and then
you can you know when you're not
trusting up you can nerd it up with you
know your emails and
text message notifications but it's it's
metal and thin and I think it looks nice
does it is it a if it works nice yes
like they've already dropped the ball
fits the touchscreen what what version
of Android isn't running it's not
running Android but it's made to it's me
to have you similar user experience to
it just stop right there it's not
running Android fine great good you need
to have an RT run real-time operating
system so that you can have good battery
life and communication and make it fast
and it's not bloated great that is the
right decision and I applaud you for it
but if you're not running Android why on
earth do you have a back home and menu
button because they want it I could tie
I'm gonna play the devil's advocate here
I wanted to you unify their experience
between their Xperia phones and the
SmartWatch 2 it's a similar icon no
matter which tony the mother use axe
really shitty and it's not fun and it's
slow and buggy no matter what we want to
make sure it's consistently terrible
they wanted it to be a sony yeah i
really liked my md discman for what it's
worth yeah i like my my sony phone with
a little flip down microphone i liked my
sony Sony Sigma cassette walkman zoom
that I had in like elementary school um
but the problems that I have with it is
uh you know Sony's problem with the
first smartwatch and the one whatever it
called the the live watch or whatever it
was called before the SmartWatch where
the pairing and the connectivity things
were like totally unreliable super buggy
super frustrating and so many solution
to this is to make this NSC compatible
so you can just tap two pair and that
will allegedly does not solve anything
no exactly comparing experience a good
yeah it doesn't sound bad and then the
other problem is that this is only going
to work with android phones it will work
with more than just sony android phone
so you can use it with other brands I
mean mostly ignoring I off the market
yeah you're going half the market but
like the the hooks aren't there in iOS
to make it a good experience I've used a
pebble with an iphone and it's it's
fun it's not great and so I it makes
sense for Sony not to try and put a
round peg in a square hole until Apple
makes you know public API is that
everybody can use and I don't know if
iOS 7 is that or not I'd like to believe
it is I think it's supposed to be I
think there's some stuff there that
people were excited about yeah I think I
think they've exposed the hooks for
notifications now that were previously
like hockey like they exist they were
happy yeah that's that's good I mean
look at the end of the day I still think
I still maintain and I will go to my
grave saying this nobody will believe me
that this innovation and smart watches
will come not from independent players
like pebble and well is not invent but
from it will not come from technology
players like pebble and Sony it will
come from the watch industry finally
admitting that the only way they can
they can stop their hemorrhaging is by
adopting smartphone receiving SmartWatch
platforms like the citizen proximity
which sucks but it's a great-looking
watch and it actually looks like a watch
and they need to evolve that concept I
mean what's easier an electronics
company designing a good watch or a
watch company learning how to like make
a smartphone it's a hybrid approach they
need they there needs to be a standard
mob module that can be easily adopted to
a variety of different watches that are
made by watch companies okay so i think
i think both both of those kinds of
companies need to come to the table but
sony making I don't trust sony to put
something on my wrist that doesn't make
me look like a complete idiot and and
and the same goes for pebble like I'm
sorry I like god bless bubble for
getting as far as they have and for
getting into bettin I that's awesome but
the watch looks awful and every time I
see someone wearing a pebble I'm like
you realize you're wearing a piece of
plastic at the wrist I don't know the
red one looks kind of cool it looks like
red plastic because it is red plastic
exactly I mean it's not it's not like
they're saying is this is this coming
from a guy wearing beats headphones I
believe it is okay
would ignore that ignore that little
move on character Cariad look all right
there there I don't want to go over and
get my sonís they work for me yeah I'm
wearing the headphones that like came in
the box with a random phone so I have
I'm in no position to judge on quality
of headphones just on how they make you
look which is you know look also they're
not they're not they're not the pros or
whatever they call their their beef DJ's
so the less ostentatious looking right
fair enough do you guys care about the
Xperia Z ultra I've got a six point four
inch display so the only thing I want to
say about that is if you look at our
posts our hands on post at Vlad wrote
and he's got a picture of it next to the
Xperia Z which is already itself a
5-inch phone ah and the Z ultra like
literally Dwarfs it it's so insanely
massive so that's all I have to say
about that the doc can let you put you
can put six icons on the dock it's
pretty sweet so it's like a nexus 7 and
not much smaller than a nexus 7 rankin
you can tell from our hands on pictures
though that sony has not completely
adapted the UI to a screen of this size
because like for instance the like the
clock widget is hilariously small it's
like the size of an icon and then let's
know it's small in relation to like the
size of screen but in real life it's
like three inches across because there's
a realistic own are we I think Sony
selling it as a phone it's got a dialer
it makes phone calls and just so with no
I guess that is that is the down feeling
like a little bluetooth handset thing to
go with it apparent right right but I
think that's the differentiation you
have to make and the way to do that is
what how will it run apps will it run
the tablet version of apps or will it
run the phone version of apps right and
that's that's where you make that
distinction of is this a stupidly large
phone or is this kind of like a sleek
and slightly smaller tablet depending on
how the ass behave if they if you open
up gmail
on you've got the to pain interface
that's you know got your list of labels
on one side and then your inbox on the
other then you know I'm comfortable
calling it a tablet but if you're seeing
the same interface that I see on a three
inch smartphone on this 6.4 inch one
it's just a big stupid phone my god this
bluetooth handset accessory yeah is the
dumbest thing so it looks like it
doesn't look like a like a phone like
you'd hold it looks like a giant
bluetooth earpiece yeah this is getting
Sony what are you doing man so here's my
thing can we get a phone that's
resistant the elements that doesn't have
stupid little flaps over all the ports
does he does a does a galaxy s4 active
have stupid flaps on all the ports it
does on the micro USB port at least I
thought that we were in a place where
like we could cope this stuff with magic
you know nano-polymer guys I think the
Nano polymer technology stuff is okay
for like a splashing like if you if you
if you spill your coke on it you're okay
but if it gets submerged at all you it's
not okay I think that's where that state
is it's less of an issue if the phone
supports Chi I guess right have cheap
ads all right yeah that's true um okay
uh what else what else have we got for
news man we're just blowing through
stuff we could complain about androids
consumer now let's talk about Windows
Phone so they're very proud of
themselves because they're like guys
were solidly in third place and we're
not afraid of blackberry anymore mm-hmm
which is and then well Ram did not have
a great quarter either I'm sorry did not
have a great quarter yeah they got
slammed is I mean did anybody not see
that coming though like I know Wall
Street was very bullish on it and of
course blackberry was very aggressive
and saying you know that you're you're
they were doing great everything but
like anybody that's been watching the
industry with like an actual critical I
not see that coming like they're trying
to sell the vices at the same price
point as current cutting-edge high-end
devices that are running uh on the
as all the running specifications from
last year it's green so last year the
processors from last year or whatever
and then it's a brand new platform with
virtually no compelling apps that's the
issue yeah the the specs are not the
problem with the z10 may make me maybe
but like you know if you compare it if
you go into a store and you compare it
ok so the z10 versus the iphone 5 the
iPhone 5 has much better build quality
its first feel impression is hand south
winds or if you compared to like ps4 or
the one they've got bigger screens
better cameras everything else is better
so it's like yeah and your your cost is
the same to the customer you guys jelly
you jelly I'm trying yeah that is yours
actually I'm bad whatever I gotta keep
down here but but like but like you said
dieter that I mean the real problem is
that you know they don't have the
compelling app support yet even though
they say that they have like tens of
thousands or 100,000 apps or whatever
the latest number is none of those apps
are the ones that are people are looking
for you don't obviously the names like
vine and Instagram don't exist on
blackberry and you know I think I've
said this like a million times already
but you know Starbucks doesn't exist and
are do doesn't exist and Spotify doesn't
exist and all these other apps that
everyone talks about so so it makes the
maps and rants is terrible too yeah it
so basically Jim Balsillie was right
they should have like just gone full
services and given up on hardware so
what you're saying yeah what are we
supposed to see bbm on Android and
iPhone it doesn't this summer it
literally doesn't matter it man I want I
want yet another messaging platform to
defragment the space that's that's my
favorite thing in the world that you
never know what messaging platform
people use three years ago that would
have been the biggest news in the world
okay all right nobody uses BBM and
nobody remembers their stupid a digit
hex code that they use to communicate on
BBM did you guys know that cyanogen mod
is working on a secure android messaging
plan yeah I read that that was kind of
weird yeah and it's like making its
encrypted on both ends right or
something like that yeah is it an assay
proof
uh that i don't know i mean you realize
there's some like lower level NSA agent
right now who's assigned to listen to
the Virgin Mobile show I got a job no
he's actually just paging through our
emails right now yeah yeah he's
scrolling through I feel so bad for that
guy it's just nothing but me complaining
about little stupid crap Oh sprint got
the yeah so we were going to talk about
Windows Phone yes so the HTC 8xt and
they look fine is that terrible that
like I don't have anything else to say
about it other than they look fine well
sprint got up got caught up with the
time yeah I can't picture anyone
actually buying them though I'm not sure
what you mean by why can't I maybe they
look fine no the the 8xt looks pretty
cool and it deleted that dual speaker or
something the 8xt has yeah it's got the
boom sound design speakers on the front
of it but it's also got a WVGA display
and right it's a hundred dollars on a
contract well so that's the thing the xt
despite the fact that the name is
similar to 8x actually resembles the 8's
more right right right it's much closer
to the 8's yeah right it looks like the
8's and which was an entry-level model
in September of last year right and then
the ax t VES me Oh looks like a
first-generation galaxy s I mean so okay
when I say they look fine what I really
mean is it's sprints so we don't really
anyway and so for sprint whatever wee
wee wee pad sprint on the back and say
oh you tried man like good job amen they
turned off i did this weekend yet it
that was true well of course i went out
from where you at so uh Sam sheffer on
the verge team he's a killer dots player
on iOS he plays him some dots and he's
really good and I got a pretty high
score on it uh you know a couple weeks
ago and I said hey Sam anything my high
score and he just is like silent and
ignores me for five minutes I'm like Sam
my high score look and all he replies
with is the important thing is you tried
yeah my knees do using that's lovely
thirty dollars on in-app purchases on
that stupid frickin game so i can try
and attention i'm never going to and i
ought to give up so that's that's what
sprint is like it's even tried yes
that's exactly right uh oh man this neo
actually it does look terrible doesn't
it yeah 150 bucks well i mean so the
samsung is obviously another example of
samsung not giving uh yeah not giving
anything about Windows Phone right like
it's just like oh yeah oh you wanted a
windows phone fine we'll slap this OS on
some leftover hardware will throw your
name on the back and be done I don't
know what HTC using investing in
designing this phone and but so does gap
does nokia and sprint do they just they
have like a blood feud or something uh
when is last time in nokia was sold on
sprint I can't think of one um but so so
with verizon obviously we just got the
928 and I think that was the result of
Nokia doing a heck of a lot of begging
to verizon pleading and begging and and
and just just anything it could to get
his phone on verizon but before that it
was like the nokia twist which was like
a PCD device with a nokia brand which is
like that x square twisting phone oh I
hit I can't think of a sprint I can't
think of a scene look awesome it had
like a loop like its hinge with a circle
oh they have it it twisted out and you
had your keyboard on there you know it
was no key Brenda but Nokia literally
had nothing to do with it did we just
lose your video Dan um did I I don't
know chris is frozen for me but you're
moving or I let your back it's alright
it's good times good times on the Virgin
Mobile show getting excited about sprint
nokia phones that don't exist or ever
will i reduced my bandwidth i would I
reduce my dad can you guys see me now we
are so
this is professional dinner you know he
doesn't know how to get of podcasts I
just oh boy no do not add Google effects
to your face this has to stop you guys
want to talk about Firefox OS not really
a lie yes yeah good yes hey I can't let
you two go ahead Chris our crib because
you're insane uh why would just like to
point out the obvious which is so Sean
did a report went up yesterday I think
right I am a launch and and in it
Mozilla CTO is basically like basically
like champ like sucker-punching Android
it's saying that that Android is unable
to compete on the same specs that
Firefox OS can and the problem is not
that Android can't compete in that
segment it's that Mozilla is going into
the low end of the market guns blazing
and totally willing to accept the fact
that it's going to be a really really
crappy user experience well is so it
felt like to me like that statement was
made by somebody who's never actually
touched a Mozilla phone um okay um I
know any web and what is this is the
word Oh dad so apparently I'm so sick a
creature from another hand I'm so some
so sedentary that the motion detector in
this room that I'm in thought I hadn't
been moving for long enough and shut the
lights out on me and one of our Evan
who's producing assured I had to come in
at wave his hand in front of the motion
saves the day and I've totally lost my
train of thought oh well yeah I was
saying like it it sounds like this was
tilts pokin by somebody who's never
actually touched her using Mozilla phone
because he says that Android can't
compete on this lower end hardware
because it doesn't run well it's like
well neither does your mozilla OS so
what is your point right that's exactly
right yeah I mean the story hasn't
changed since we saw these phones at at
mwc and in terms of higher-end hardware
I think they want to get their sprint
has committed to selling them in 2014
we'll see but right now it's not
anything that is particularly
interesting in the smartphone world
unfortunately good enough man um yeah
this this show is going by really fast
but that's okay because we need to go
and do other things but there is one
last thing Apple apparently they've
signed up with TSMC chip manufacturers
so Samsung might be making fewer iOS
device chips so I haven't we been waitin
hearing about this story 40 three years
now it's finally seems to seems to
finally be happening and then more leaks
so that the 5s leak apparently it's got
a xenon flash have we talked about that
on the show yet I don't think we have
it's got this like these leaked
components show this weird dual LED
flash right on flash excuse me dual LED
flash and it's and it's surmised that
the one normal-looking LED will be like
your typical flash but then it'll have a
special low light LED that'll come on
when you're in really low light
situations and and produce much better
color on your your flash photos I guess
is what the guess is i guess we're guess
it'd be also if that Lola LED was
invisible to the human eye so that you
could not destroy people's retinas when
you're taking their photo yeah I really
I was like that doesn't sound like a
plausible mean who knows it could be
spot on but it just doesn't seem like it
seems like a waste of extremely valuable
real estate in the chassis of the phone
to install a second LED dedicated to
light use well yeah I mean I would
rather do they I would rather see you
know optical image stabilization and
other improvements to the camera for all
I use now that the iPhone 5 is bad at
low light it's just not quite up to what
you can pull off in those crazy edge
situations on the HTC One or the Lumia
925 although I have issues with those
cameras as well so yeah trade-offs and
then we've also I don't think we
actually didn't write about these on the
verge but a bunch of sites macrumors
9to5 mac there's some back plates that
have appeared that look like they're for
a low-cost iPhone different colors they
you know they seem plausible but maybe
not but I mean I'm really not looking
forward to lime green iPhones everywhere
if they do turn out to be legitimate not
if they look like these photos that have
leaked at least the lime green ipod mini
was pretty hot but oh really okay these
photos are pretty ugly however dan did
you buy a google play edition phone are
you high or dUrd i ordered a one I can't
bring myself to use the Samsung like
just as soon as I pick it up I'm unhappy
so it's like I could deal with the other
concessions I have to make with the one
I really really like the hardware and I
really like the speakers on the on the
sense one I spent a lot of time sitting
on my couch watching animal on the
google play edition isn't as good as the
sound on the sense one like I actually
thought it's on a better with beats off
than with on like with beats on it there
was more bass but it got really muddy um
in a way that didn't on the sense
version boom but they're still super
loud so yeah just the fact that they're
super loud in there facing me so like I
don't have to cut my hand around the
phone if I'm watching a video so yeah
all right I'll probably keep mine
probably I'll grumble about it the whole
time this is a serious debate amongst
the verge staff if you guys aren't aware
like this has been an ongoing debate
between not only among us but also josh
is like
super undecided a lot of other editors
are super undecided because they want
one of these and they just talk about
which one of my that ladies and
gentlemen I'm calling it is the end of
the virginal show for this week we
really appreciate you watching or
listening we may or may not be back next
week the only way to know is to follow
us on twitter i am at back lawn dan is
at DC seifert me I chris is at z power

comment on this post right now this is a
very moment and we will read them you
