here with the cooked tablet this is a
tablet designed special pacifically for
the kitchen it has a water resistant
enclosure as well as being heat
resistant along the side we have ports
for SD card slot USB Ethernet and a
headphone jack with this spill resistant
cover as well as a power button and
volume buttons on the other side it's
running a custom-made Linux based OS on
top of a dual core cortex a9 processor
with one that runs at one gigahertz so
the most interesting part of this tablet
is actually the software itself as i
already said it's running a custom-made
linux operating system but cook is
actually curating the content for the
tablet itself so they work with French
French chefs basically to put recipes
into the device and then you can find
how to prepare it step by step you can
find ingredients which it can actually
be toggled and automatically change for
the number of people you want as well
and then exported right into a shopping
list and then there's also videos for
certain recipes so you can actually
watch it be even prepare
other there's also this sort of widget
bar on the side for accessing things
like music videos and quick web sites
but overall it seems like a really
unique product that might be of interest
to people that want to do a lot of
cooking so it'll be available in
September for around three hundred
ninety nine dollars and you can actually
subscribe to receive new recipes each
month</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
