taking like a - new moto phones from
Lenovo moto G 5 and the moto G 5 plus
now over the past couple years the G
series has been Moto's bestseller around
the world and in 2017 they're back with
two really impressive mid-range phones
they've got metal designs and promise
all-day battery life now they look much
less like the Moto phones you've seen in
years past and more like the recent note
of Z that's not a bad thing they've also
got a large fingerprint sensor which you
can swipe on instead of using androids
on-screen controls pretty useful the g5
is the smaller of the two it's got a
5-inch 1080p screen runs Android seven
nougat and inside is a snapdragon 430
processor that's by no means a flagship
level phone but moto says it's great for
the things you do and the apps you use
every day it's got a 2800 milliamp hour
battery inside so when you pair that
with the low-power chipset inside Moto
says the g5 should get you all day
battery life other specs include a 13
megapixel f/2 camera and 32 gigs of
storage with microSD support and it'll
have 2 or 3 gigs of RAM depending on
where you buy it now the g5 + is the
more exciting of the two for me
it's got a bigger but not too big 5.2
inch 1080p display plus a larger 3000
milliamp hour battery and the chip
inside is Qualcomm Snapdragon 625
processor which we loved in the Moto Z
play for its balance of great
performance and long long battery life
this camera is 12 make pickles at F 1.7
in both phones at five megapixel front
cameras this one shoots 4k and the
regular g5 just does 1080p the Moto G 5
plus comes with a 32 or 64 degrees of
built-in storage again with microSD
support and 2 or 4 gigs of RAM now the
one downside to both phones in the u.s.
anyway is that neither one is NFC for
Android pay so you can't do mobile
payments if you buy the g5 + outside the
US you can but even so all in all these
two phones strike me as very nice
mid-range Android options with metal
designs the latest Android software and
Moto's great customizations both come in
gray or a gold and they'll be on sale in
March starting at around
$1.99 - the g5 or 229 for the g5 plus
it's hard to be a metal phone for that
kind of price
