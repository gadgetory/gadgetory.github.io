never been anything as iconic as the
lightsaber so with all the merchandising
tie-ins the Star Wars has to offer you'd
think that'd be the one thing they
really have figured out there's been
everything from cheap plastic toys two
limited edition replicas but nothing has
really captured the feeling of what it
would be like to hold them the items
from the movie that's why over the past
15 years fans have taken matters into
their own hands they've built a
homegrown lightsaber aftermarket where
people make custom machined hilts
designed high-end sound and lighting
electronics
all the name of getting as close to the
film's as possible now it's not cheap
but if you dive down the rabbit hole
nearly anything is possible I personally
started collecting last year and thought
just one would do it not so much so this
is an original design made by a
husband-and-wife team called Vader's
vault this blade can turn any colour you
want and it's sturdy enough for
full-contact dueling and this is an
obi-wan Kenobi made by Romans Empire
props every single piece of this thing
is an exact replica of the part used to
make the original prop back in 1977 I
also have a Luke Return of the Jedi
being installed with electronics
somewhere in Arizona I might have a bit
of a problem but even though I have all
of those what's been haunting me is the
original lightsaber you know the one
with the force awakens' literally ending
with rey handing that lightsaber to Luke
I decided it was time to find the most
authentic accurate Star Wars II
Skywalker saber I could possibly find so
of course I ended up talking the ODA my
name is Michael Murphy I own a website
called epic sabers calm people know me
as Yoda and I specialize in turning the
vintage 3-cell Graflex camera flash
which was the original saber seen on
screen into a functioning lightsaber now
you're probably wondering what a vintage
Graflex camera flash is it might be hard
to remember but back in 1977 the
original Star Wars was kind of a
low-budget flick and everything from the
Death Star to the blasters were made
from fan parts and old model kits the
one thing they couldn't figure out was
the lightsaber
until one day set decorator roger
christian found an old box that vintage
camera flashes from the 1930s the
company that made them reflects
christian added some grips a bubble
strip pulled from an old texas
instrument and that was really it that's
the original lightsaber he apparently
showed it to George Lucas and Lucas
looked at it and just smiled and that
was apparently the biggest compliment
you can get from Lucas at the time and
that's what I feel when I look at a
graphics I just smile when I look at and
say this is you know this is more than
just a camera flash okay so this is
where it's going to get pretty nerdy but
it's also where it's going to get kind
of amazing because according to Star
Wars lore lightsabers were powered by a
tiny crystal inside them and Michael
made a lightsaber with the crystal
chamber that looked like it was working
on the inside as much as it did on the
outside that lightsaber sold on eBay for
$3,900 it was really the first of its
kind thing on eBay as an artist it was
like putting a painting up at Sotheby's
or something for auction and other
people look at it and said oh wow this
is something I can make a bunch of money
I was like oh wow I've got to live up to
this
I've got to make it better and over the
years he's basically become the Graflex
Godfather in the lightsaber world if
you're looking for something that's as
close to Canon as possible Yoda is the
guy how much so his latest design sold
on eBay for over 15
thousand dollars so after getting on
Yoda's waiting list I picked up an old
Graflex flash on eBay and then it was
time to get started
Luke's lightsaber is slightly different
in each of the different movies and in
this case I was going for my personal
favorite The Empire Strikes Back we
selected the exact two crystals I wanted
to use and then Michael drills them by
hand underwater that's to make room for
the fiber optic lighting system but
first the 80 year old flash has to be
disassembled and cleaned this all
happens by hand and once the insides of
the flash are gone that's when Michael
can drill holes for grips and put his
own chassis inside when you get a
lightsaber you swing around and stuff
and to make sure everything didn't break
he took a design cue from RC cars and
built a custom chassis the nice thing
about this is that the combination of
abs and aluminum piping in the way is
hooked together and the plates that I've
created allow it to flex a little bit in
various directions that way when it it
takes a hit all of your electronic
components aren't completely absorbing
that chassis absorbs it for them so
obviously making a lightsaber is super
easy okay so it's been about a month
since we last visited and we are now
heading back to Yoda's to to pick up the
finished lightsaber but this doesn't
look anything like Dagobah
okay this is awesome I kind of don't
want to touch it cuz it's so nice and I
feel like it's like a movie thing that I
I feel like I'm actually at a a prop
show this is this is fucking beautiful
the blade fits just perfectly snug
I want to start doing all kinds of like
crazy shit but I want to hit anything
ever so I'm terrified my seven-year-old
self inside me right now is is like
freaking out and I feel like I've
accomplished like a long life goal that
probably sounds like an exaggeration and
yes there are more important things in
the world than a replica movie prop
but there's something beautiful about
the passion it takes to create something
like this it's a reminder of the power
storytelling has to encourage and
inspire to bring people across the world
together in pursuit of a common goal and
that's a gift that artists like Michael
get to pass along to I like making the
fans happy and I know when I'm able to
put that into someone else's life then
it it makes it worth it for me too
hopefully it will serve your collection
family for years to count this fan is
very happy and you guys like The Goonies
there's this guy in Texas who makes a
really like kick-ass one-eyed Willy map
we should go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
