robertson and i pledge my allegiance to
the red jaguars this is 90 seconds on
the verge super bowl 47 has come and
gone last night the ravens beat the
49ers 34-31 and in between all that
beyonce performed the halftime show with
an army of clones as well as an
all-too-brief Destiny's Child reunion
but the craziest moment of last night
had to beat a black out the entire game
was stalled for 35 minutes as the
Superdome experienced a major power
outage a number of sponsors took to
Twitter to crack wise but Oreo took it a
step further with a very clever image
proclaiming quote you can still dunk in
the dark it was the best out all night
and probably the cheapest but enough
about sports ball let's talk iphone a
jailbreak for the iphone 5 and iPad Mini
is now available the tool dubbed evasion
is the first to support Apple's newest
line of iOS devices as well as older
ones that run iOS 6.1 as always
jailbreaking voids your warranty and in
this case it also screws up Apple's
weather app consider yourself warned
finally over 100 days into windows 8 and
we've barely scratched the surface
Microsoft has thus far revealed over 60
million license sales from the new
operating system the company however
will not reveal any sales figures for
its first surface tablet analysts
estimate sales have been just shy of 1
million for Microsoft's first party
Windows RT device the surface pro with
full windows 8 functionality goes on
sale later this week and that's it for
today's top stories tune in tomorrow for
the legend of rich of the thirds
