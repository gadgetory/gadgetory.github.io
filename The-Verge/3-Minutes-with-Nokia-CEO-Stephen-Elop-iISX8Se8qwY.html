a sequence of launches we're starting in
six European countries adding a few more
countries later this year and then
introducing a portfolio of products into
the US and early 2012 the reason for the
sequencing like that is because this is
a new program for Nokia we have to ramp
up factories supply lines the support
for the products all of the localized
customizations and particular
technologies and services that are
needed by the consumers in those
particular markets there's no deliberate
scheme around buzz or anything like that
the deliberate scheme is around taking
quality devices the first real Windows
Phone is how we like to describe it and
taking that one consumer to the next one
country to the next in a way that
smoothly ramps up so that's really our
focus it's worth saying that in any
market around the world increasingly
operators play an important role in
bringing your products to market that's
been long true in the u.s. it's true in
many other markets like Europe as well
elements of the n9 the things that
really define that that product you'll
see continued on the reason we continued
with the n9 is the Li is because we
believe we could learn a lot about
certain things that actually make the n9
unique in the way that it is when you
look at the Nokia Lumia 800 what you
realize is hmm that's clearly a
refinement of what we learn from the n9
it's a bit different you can tell them
apart there's a few things that are
subtly done differently to improve every
aspect of it but we learn from that what
remains unanswered and will remain
unanswered for today is when I say
elements of the user experience or the
cute environment what does that mean
that's still something you'll see ahead
from Nokia first of all what we
announced in February with Microsoft was
a unique relationship this is not the PC
business it is not a situation where
mark Microsoft has a very large share of
the market and is just essentially
standardizing they're looking for
innovation and the unique relationship
with Nokia as we demonstrated today when
we introduced Nokia Lumia has specific
areas of differentiation now in terms of
it doesn't allow for the Sense UI or
whatever
I would suggest that one of the biggest
challenges facing those other echoes
that particular ecosystem is the fact
that there's more and more of that going
on and when I go into the store and look
at what that brand was supposed to stand
for I'm not quite seeing it it's as if
you know there it's just unclear what
the standard is for the user experience
and I think that's important with the
introduction of Windows 8 as you
recognize that the user experience of
Windows 8 is essentially a superset or
supercharged version of the Nokia Lumia
experience that you saw on stage today
and you see the parallels and the
opportunity for commonality from a user
perspective you say wow this is more
than just smart phones there's a broader
opportunity here and clearly we see that
broader opportunity as well without
specifically commenting on what that may
mean in the future it goes beyond that
though as well because what you could
see at the Microsoft build conference is
this sense that the development
environments also are beginning to head
in a common direction let a few turns of
the crank happen and you can imagine
more and more commonality there
Microsoft placing a bet on html5 is
another big clue about how all of this
may in some way be interrelated over
time so I think it's very interesting
what is the definition of the ecosystem
I think it is safe to say it's more than
just the phones it's also important to
recognize that it's more than developers
and applications although that's
critically important it's also search
advertising unified communications like
Skype business productivity gaming music
it's a whole family that's what people
are buying today they may not call it
that way but that's the experience
they're looking for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
