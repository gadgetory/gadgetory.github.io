wonder why a car company is using the
hoverboard in one of its ads is Lexus
planning to make hoverboards now no
shock it's just another marketing stunt
but the hoverboard you see is very real
it's actually levitating and you can
totally ride it but is it the
transportation of the future
probably not
so for like the last two decades we've
been teased with the existence of
functional hoverboards Back to the
Future Part two gave us a glimpse of
what a hoverboard may look like in the
Year 2015
director Robert Zemeckis further fueled
our imaginations by claiming that they
used real hoverboards in the film and
that the only thing stopping these
things from being mass-produced was
concerned parent groups but that's not
true at all they didn't exist
last year Funny or Die trolled the
internet with Christopher Lloyd Tony
Hawk and random celebrities riding a
fake hoverboard called the hover which
they swore up and down was true and that
was also not real so when Lexus released
its first hoverboard teaser earlier this
summer I along with the rest of the
Internet was super skeptical it looked
so real but Lexus out of all companies
and then we were invited to see the
thing in person the whole thing felt a
little bit weird in a beach town about
45 minutes away from Barcelona Lexus
built an entire skate park or hover Park
if you will that acted as a set for its
commercial and yeah this park was built
just for the hoverboard which does
exactly what you think it hovers off the
ground like a proper hoverboard but as
I'm sure you've guessed there are some
big caveats like the track it needs to
run on which is crucial to how the thing
works at all inside the board are rows
of superconductors a special property of
these type 2 superconductors is that
when they're cooled down to a critical
temperature the exhibit properties that
alter and manipulate any magnetic field
around them therefore the board must be
ridden above a highly engineered track
that's carefully embedded with magnets
strong enough to hold the board and a
rider normally the track is hidden under
the hover pole the board must be resting
upon a portion of that same track when
being cooled with liquid nitrogen which
essentially programs it to levitate at a
certain height after this process is
complete the board can be brought over
to the park and will hover above the
track at roughly the same height about 4
centimeters
this technology isn't actually that new
it's a process called flux pinning and
we've seen people do some fun things
with this on a small scale before but
now that it's been applied to a
hoverboard
what's that actually like to ride it's
hard it's not as easy as riding a
skateboard where all four wheels are on
the ground
the magnetic track in the ground lines
up vertically with the center of the
board so it's kind of like you're on a
tightrope and if your balance isn't
perfectly distributed on this thing you
end up scraping the ground with the
undersides of the board it took me like
15 minutes just to glide a few feet so
yeah no shot I was going to ride around
the park like Marty McFly did and Back
to the Future Part two luckily though I
had the chance to speak with pro skater
Ross McGowan the guy featured in the
commercial so you've been skating for
15-20 years yeah and how long did it
take you to get a master in a sense
where you could ride around the track
without scraping yeah I mean after that
it's been like five six months I've been
trying it so even now I can go down in a
straight line even some corner that
scrapes a bit but you can write yourself
it's quick enough so you don't fall off
you can feel it under your feet feel
that sweet spot yeah yeah just the
feeling of some invisible air rail thing
is what it feels like to me so riding
the hoverboard is very difficult and
besides that another major problem with
this thing is that it needs to be
constantly cooled with liquid nitrogen
and when it was as hot as it was outside
that day in Spain we got 10 or 15
minutes on the board before it had to be
refilled a process itself that takes
another 10 or 15 minutes at this point I
gotta wonder why this thing even exists
the Lexus hoverboard isn't actually a
product it's just a special effect in a
car commercial it's part of a series
Lexus refers to as amazing in motion
which has used lots of flashy props
before large mechanical puppets dancing
through the streets of Madrid light
suits flying through Kuala Lumpur and
even will.i.am and my voice is being
trapped by a laser
the difference is that you would never
expect to own what is essentially a
gigantic Guitar Hero looking level for
your car or an LED light suit you sure
as hell would want a hoverboard though
fortunately there are companies like
Hendo that are actually working on
levitation technology with ambition
beyond marketing but right now Lexus
hasn't brought us any closer to being
marty mcfly maybe that's just as well
considering the insane limitations of
the Lexus hoverboard you need lots of
money to build a track gallons and
gallons of liquid nitrogen on hand and
five months of training just to master
your balance so the next time a car
company promises you a little bit of
back to the future style science fiction
you might want to limit your
expectations and just tell them this why
don't you make like a tree and get out
of here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
