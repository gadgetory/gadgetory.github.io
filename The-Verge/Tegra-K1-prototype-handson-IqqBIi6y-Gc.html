at CES 2014 and we're just being shown
and videos new Tegra k1 it's running on
a customized no 7 tablet from the
company and at the moment i'm being
chased by some freaky alien monsters in
serious am free to decide Emil is a demo
of trying a custom-built trying running
on the table k1 and we just right here
and on the other side there's a demo of
digital iris something that the company
showed up at his press conference here
so what we're looking at here is
switching between the two versions of
opengl with the slider so as we zoom in
we can really see the difference between
digital arrow with the next-generation
technology and previous generation you
just know what gaming with and what we
have to say is that all of this visually
is extremely impressive serious sam
itself when i get rushed by oles
monsters does show quite a bit of lag it
doesn't seem like the GP is quite
capable of handling it but being able to
see Unreal Engine 4 as Rockets start
flying at me a real of thing this game
is particularly fair to be honest and
monsters are able to launch things at me
which again doesn't help but in any case
I'm rear-engine for on the Tegra k1 is
impressive in this particular situation
you're seeing a ton of graphics is the
sort of thing that you would expect from
your actual pc or console game so some
of the lower frame rates are
understandable
and as I say this to our demo in in
particular is one of the most impressive
ones that we've looked at so far so it's
promising and this on the graphic side
which is what you would expect from
Nvidia and particularly with k1 has 192
cuda cores which are actually graphic
schools they're not the same cpu cores
as you get on the regular mobile
processor it's going to have two
versions and a 15 a 13 version and a
denver-based which is Denver is and
videos custom CPU to your core the demo
version beta will max out two and half
gigahertz the arm cortex a15 max hour to
two point three gigahertz of speed and
videos big promise as usual is to bring
next-generation graphics it's time to
the mobile platform any particular to
Android so this is a very first look
