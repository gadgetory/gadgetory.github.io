introduced the world to the check-in a
way to quickly share your location with
friends five years later it has five
billion check-ins and Counting giving it
one of the world's most powerful
databases about where and what to eat or
do in any given neighborhood but users
were confused was Foursquare meant to
replace Yelp or help them find their
friends the company never caught on with
the mainstream struggled to raise
funding and watched his user base
quickly fall behind younger services
like Instagram eventually they came to a
striking conclusion if the company
wanted to survive it needed to make its
riskiest decision yet
killing off the check-in and splitting
its app into over the last couple years
like what what story is the most
important story of coursework is it I
check in two places because you tell
Foursquare great things and then we can
you know kind of give you amazing
personalized open search results or is
it you know come in search and discover
find great places and then check into
those places I think people will always
think Oh Foursquare that's like that's
the check-in out well of course we're
that's the thing where you check in and
get badges and I think I'd your if
that's your perception of what we're
doing like you're missing ninety percent
of like the vision in ninety percent of
like really what the company is here to
do we looked at this and looked at the
session analysis and saw that only one
in 20 sessions had both social and
discovery at the same kind of app open
right so what it says to me is that 19
out of 20 times and someone used
Foursquare that had the business up
front and the party in the back either
went to business or went to a party but
not both we did this exercise where we
brought kind of 10 different people from
around the coming together kind of posed
to them we call like the Lego block
challenge or something like that which
was it was actually a really important
point to make we said all right let's
let's kind of catalog all the LEGO
pieces that we have as a service and as
a company you know obviously we have are
like 40 million plus users we have RP oh
I dated base of 60 million plus places
we have 40 million plus tips 150 million
plus photos I'm just rambling off PR
staff but like these are all the Lego
blocks now how do we take all of those
different like all of those different
LEGO pieces and assemble them in a way
that really makes sense for like the
things that we can do and
you know with phones in 2014 we've been
working on just reimagining enforcement
as if it was created today and what that
would look like and for us that means
two different experiences it means one
that's focused on where your friends are
right now and how to keep up with them
and it's another about where to go next
and how to find a great place to go and
it's totally different from any local
search experience right now by splitting
them into two we give people really
clear messages to again you have swarm
which is your social teeth map look at
what you want to know is where your
friends are you should download swarm
and you'll be able to meet up with them
at fantastic moments when you might not
have seen them otherwise and if what
you're looking for is recommendations
then Foursquare is the app for you and I
think in the past that's been hard for
us because they are two very different
use cases but they've been stuck
together breaking the app and two wasn't
exactly how the company's leadership and
vision or squares future but as teams
started working on the two apps one for
check-ins and one for discovery the
dichotomy felt increasingly obvious the
first app called swarm is a dead simple
location sharing app that is one key
wrinkle unlike people discovery apps of
the past swarm only shares your general
location with friends when you first
open the app you see a list of friends
who are nearby followed by friends who
are in the neighborhood and then in the
same city as you
it's like find my friends but a lot less
creepy and if you want friends to know
exactly where you are you can always
check in just like you used to swarm is
a lot like Facebook's recently launched
nearby friends feature but inside its
own app with its own friends list just
the people you trust it sounds a lot
like some of the friend finding apps
that have launched in the last few years
Google Latitude sonar highlight banjo
social radar none of these apps ever hit
the mainstream and frankly neither did
Foursquare check-ins but Foursquare
thinks it's figured out why being able
to say hey you know what people don't
want to have their face on a map they
don't want to be like precision pointed
a lat/long so someone can like go find
them in the middle of a park like find
my friends on on your iPhone it is great
if you have like a spouse who like is
like total transparency right like you
can track where they are or they're the
gym and the shopping and you maybe do it
with one person the world but they
wanted people to be kind of eminently
aware of where they are so their friends
can now like hey if I go to the
Williamsburg I get a train here my 10
French one Williamsburg like a lot of
the stuff that we were inspired by is
early message like instant messaging
clients you know to be able to look into
like these people are online
these people are offline this person's
active this person's not like what does
that version of a buddy list look like
when it's on your mobile phone and it
has some element of location it makes it
easy to connect with people and it's
kind of easy to know of people's
awareness and availability it remains to
be seen whether people really do want to
know who's around a trend tech investors
and early adopters love to push which
the mainstream has ignored but swarm is
only half the equation for the new
Foursquare at that it's the much smaller
half the most important part of
Foursquare's future is a new version of
its discovery and recommendation service
while the company won't yet divulge how
the new app looks one thing is clear
Foursquare aims to take Yelp head-on and
its hopes to be the undisputed king of
local search people have been telling me
for years like there's no way that's
going to work it's impossible to do if
someone's gonna do what Google would
have done it already and I'm like no I
think we can do this in a different way
it's always been really hard to tease
those experiences out of Foursquare
because like you have to check into the
places and you have to look at the
screen you have to get the tip and
thinking was always like let's just get
a ton of knowledge about the world about
where people go get a ton of these tips
and then when we can tell when someone
just walks into the place we can just
pop up that message and the phone will
buzz and let us look at it now that's
what we wanted to do in 2009 just took
us five years to get to where we are
Yelp can't do what we do like Yelp
doesn't need to be able to personalize
for you because when you search for Pete
on Yelp it shows you the top ten pizza
places it's not tailored to you but when
you're on Foursquare and you search for
pizza we know if you like a greasy slice
or the most artisanal perfect pizza in
New York if people weren't afraid we
would have done this a long time ago
right like and not afraid in an
irrational way afraid and like this is
like a somewhat risky thing to do it is
richer than the current path we're going
down ultimately I think like the winner
in the local search space it's all about
who has the best data and we're not the
point now it's like God the company has
succeeded to the point like we built all
this great stuff the phones have matured
like we have the we have the flexibility
and the freedom to kind of rethink this
entire space and we came up with this
idea of like we should do two apps one
for check-in one for search and we you
know you have to sit on it for like a
week or two weeks you know and during
those two we say this is kind of crazy
right but then it's like no this makes
perfect sense this is what like we
really can do it now because of all the
things that we've done in the past but
it's makes a lot of sense
