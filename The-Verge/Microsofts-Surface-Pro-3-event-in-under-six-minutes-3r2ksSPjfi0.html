that can replace your laptop surface pro
3 the question that needs to be Austin
answered is why hardware we clearly are
not interested in building refrigerators
or toasters we are not building hardware
for hardware sake we want to build
experiences that bring together all the
capabilities of our company our goal is
to create new categories and spark new
demand for our entire ecosystem it does
not matter what store you walk into the
conflict exists and you walk up to the
salesperson and you can stand between
two very clear tables and ask a question
what is it that I'm supposed to buy the
response is this what is it that you
want to do I don't know I'm about to
spend a thousand dollars I thought I
needed to do everything today we take
the conflict away and I'm absolutely
sure that I'd like to introduce you to
surface pro 3 look at how thin it is
this product by definition is faster
than the surface pro 2 it's an
absolutely beautiful screen we've grown
it to a 12 inch diagonal pushing it to
12 inches was critical sitting right in
between the tablet and the laptop and
getting to the point where you can
replace your laptop this is a critical
critical element it's a three by two
aspect ratio it's something that hasn't
really been done before in this size
it's a 2160 by 1440 display it's
optically bonded it has the highest
contrast ratios in the industry
I can talk specs all day and quite
frankly it doesn't bore me but it
probably bores you you have a perfectly
equal distribution of weight through the
product I'll put the surface here you're
gonna grab this macbook here now we have
a 12 inch screen I want to compare it to
the 13 inch for a reason we have
optimized to the scaling of Windows
perfectly on this 12 inch screen you get
six percent more content than on this 13
inch screen we want you to take both
those devices out of your bag so you
have to think about all the weight that
happens with these devices
we've partners super close with Intel it
has been the closest thing to a
technical love affair that I could
possibly think of we spend tireless
hours together to put the core i7 in the
new surface pro 3 then we reinvented the
fan we were able to make it 30% more
efficient than any fan in any product
today then we reinvented the fin on the
fan so you never feel it you don't hear
it you don't even see it
we built the thinnest optical stack ever
built on a device's size at 0.75
millimeters over 2015 there's a number
in there percent more battery life in
this product than any product surfaces
ship before it's the same unbelievably
strong chassis that I'm about to drop
and it doesn't break and we don't worry
you don't worry at all let me introduce
you to the surface pro 3 docking station
this docking station lets you display
out to 4k monitor very important right
4k super hot buzzword right now people
pay attention 4k is cool so I want to
show you the new kicks and first I'm
gonna show you a different mode and it's
called canvas mode and it's a new one
this hinge has taken every single detail
the amount of custom parts to bring to
you full friction so you can say it
bring it all the way down at any
position you want to land it at 150
degrees is intense
we landed a hundred and fifty degrees
and with an amazing palm block
technology you now can do the drawing
you want to do if you were an artist we
know that to really build a tablet that
can replace the laptop it has to work in
your lap I want to introduce you to the
surface pro type cover it's got a lot of
accolades from thinness and we've made
it even thinner we put a ton of energy
into the trackpad this time around this
trackpad 68 percent larger than the
previous trackpad before it if we've
reduced friction by 78 percent I'm going
to show you one simple move here that's
important watch how it clicks in this
now magnetically seals itself to the
screen when you start to change
positions I can change them in any way
and I don't lose any stability I can
then change the friction hinge and drop
it down just like this I have the
ability to pick any position I want
and any angle I need this is an
important posture a piece of paper and a
pen and the pen looks familiar because
it is the size of a pen that you'd
normally hold it's not a stylus it's not
meant to be thin it's not meant to be
cheap it's meant to be pronounced as a
pen
it feels weighty it feels good it's
meant to be the weight that it is and
the seamless event that you are a
student in class and you needed to
capture that thought you need to pick up
your device and you need to click your
pen because you know you can write and
when you click it even if your device is
off you have to know you could write
immediately you can write your notes and
the minute you click your pen they go
right into the cloud folks we are super
super proud of surface pro 3 it goes on
sale tomorrow you can pre-order it
starting at $7.99 it comes in three
configs Core i3 Core i5 and core i7 I
could talk all day and it feels like I
have I think I might be done talking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
