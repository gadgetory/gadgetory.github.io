decade and do the other things not
because they are easy but because they
are hard so congratulations on launch of
the sharone it's the car of the show I
think what I'm wondering is that if you
go back to 50 years President Kennedy
said that we would go to the moon
because it was hard it was an
engineering challenge and also to beat
the Soviets but it's something that we
did and it was an amazing engineering
achievement do you think of this car the
same way when the first astronauts were
putting their foot down it was
unbelievable and I am absolutely
confident that this car deserves to be
star of the show because it is the best
many people might say that that the
Veyron was the best what drove you guys
to to beat the best well I think this is
what we owe ourselves if you put this
all together if you have the smart guys
that add into the concept into the
powertrain into the aerodynamic and
chassis technology this is the outcome
would have been possible to build this
car 15 years ago no definitely no you
know every four years in the Olympics we
want to find out who can run the 100
meters the fastest and I know they work
on the transmission of listening when
the gun fires and your brain tells you
now run and if you do this in an
optimized way I think they will be able
sometimes to run the one
that meters a little bit above eight
seconds and this is how we approach
these projects no stone will be unturned
and everything gets optimized to the
edge
were there any compromises in building
it no this is the lucky thing in Bugatti
we follow the slogan of Ettore Bugatti
who at the former time said nothing is
too exclusive and nothing will be too
expensive to go in a Bugatti so this car
I think is 2.4 million euro if you built
a 10 million dollar you got it could it
go faster as a present no 2.4 million is
the base price no text but in terms of
pipe performance at present this is it
we couldn't have done better does that
2.4 million euro cost does that cover
the cost of the car yes this car is
adding into the bottom line result of
Bugatti and we are making money with
this project and so is money going back
to to Volkswagen we are a member of the
Volkswagen are gay but I'm fighting hard
to keep all the money we make in sight
Bugatti to do the next project what's
the lifespan of this kart 8 years we
already pre-sold one-third of the total
run we think we will be able to do it in
eight years how much of the car is
actually built by you at you got it well
the car is 100% brain powered engineer
and all the conceptual work done in
Bugatti the engine is produced in-house
in Volkswagen Group and a lot of
components like the monocoque the
exterior is from our suppliers
international very powerful pilots with
only 500 units may
not many people are going to get an
opportunity to own one will technology
from this car make its way into other
vehicles from the Volkswagen Group I'm
absolutely convinced we consider
ourselves as a pre development and
research group inside the Volkswagen
Group and SP benefit from their
knowledge material science and
technology they benefit from ours it's a
big family thank you very much I
appreciate your time this morning and
congratulations thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
