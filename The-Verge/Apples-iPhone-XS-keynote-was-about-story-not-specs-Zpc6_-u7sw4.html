already know what I've seen inside here
the Steve Jobs theater at Apple Park in
Cupertino California it's the new
iPhones but here's a question how badly
does Apple really need to do these big
high D keynotes anymore and why do they
do that okay so the keynote is over
could happen behind me and I'm walking
into the hands-on area and I'm doing
this because I want to show you the
first answer to that question why does
that behold the events well it's really
obvious honestly the most obvious answer
is height because look at this height
there's just a lot of it and Apple wants
to have all these people here it wants
to show off all those phones it wants to
have a big media moment and so of course
they do a keynote they invented this
thing everybody's copied it but I think
hype is just one part I don't even think
it's the most important part see this is
an estimator which means that the
updates to the phone aren't as obviously
exciting as they were in a bigger year
so the iPhone 10 came out it was a whole
new design blah blah blah blah this year
the new features are a better camera a
faster processor slightly nicer screen
slightly nicer glass you know s updates
and so in order to make that thing build
up this level of hype Apple needs to do
more than just present the phone read
the specs and let us come take pictures
of it Apple needs to tell a story
because if Apple can tell a story that
means that Apple can set a narrative and
there are a couple of moments in this
Kino or Apple set a narrative that I
really want to talk welcome to the
theater let's get started with the Apple
watch everything about it has been
redesigned and re-engineered this
iPhone 10's we are very excited to show
you the iPhone 10 aw we're back we're
back in the studio processors back I'm
back it's good to see you except I can't
see you you can see me anyway in this
video I want to talk about that
narrative thing I mentioned I'm not
making a video about the specific specs
or features of the iPhone Tenace not
really there's a lot to get into and
we're gonna do all of that in the
official verge of you instead I want to
talk about how Apple tells a story
because I think it's just as important
as the specs and that features that
phone especially in an ST er so the
first moment I want to talk about in the
keynote is when Apple introduced the new
camera system on the iPhone XS tennis
whatever the name is bad
every time Apple introduces a new
feature they tend to go through a
three-step process step one is look at
all the amazing stuff we've done in the
past
step two is look at all this cool tech
inspection crazy stuff that we've
enabled on this new thing and then step
three is you get to participate in this
amazing future so watch this clip and
when you do don't think about those
specific features think about the way
that Apple is talking about them over
ten years customers have been taking
incredible photographs with their iPhone
cameras like this it is a remarkable new
dual camera system it has a 12 megapixel
wide camera 12 megapixel telephoto
camera and an even more improved true
tone flash this is a new error
photography some people call it
computational photography and the
benefits of this is not only for
photography but for video as well it's a
new era of videography as well with this
new sensor and the power of that HML
Bionic chip okay so why is this
three-step narrative important well
first of all the big innovation on the
iPhone 10s is the camera really and
what's interesting is they're trying to
do some very similar stuff to what the
pixel 2 already does it takes multiple
photos at once it stitches them together
it does a whole bunch of computation on
it
you know what didn't get mentioned at
all in Apple's keynote any other
smartphone cameras in Apple world
there's only I phone cameras and DSLRs
to me the clearest example of this whole
Apple world thing was when Schiller is
introducing this new feature on the 10s
that lets you take a portrait mode photo
and then edit it after the fact to
change the background blur on the
picture we're gonna slide the depth of
field and watch the background as it
changes the depth of field of your photo
this is done after you've taken it this
has not been possible photography of any
kind of camera this is something that
iPhone cannot do with the power of the
April Bionic chip now maybe he was
referring to all the features being a
first whatever but we all know or at
least I don't I know that Samsung has
let you do this after the fact bokeh
editing things since at least the note 8
last year just Sam the point here isn't
to dunk on Apple because honestly I was
super super impressed with how the blur
editing worked and my hands on at the
event no the point is to see how Apple
introduces the feature
it's always part of a story and again
that story is always how Apple was great
before how it has great tech now and how
it's gonna get better in the future
the term for this is framing basically
which has always been a thing in
politics political framing framing a
narrative and in this method Apple sets
the terms of the world and the things
that exist in it that's the frame and
then within that frame it tells a story
where one thing leads to the next a
little bit like the plot of a movie all
that means is that even in an s year
keynote where the announcements aren't
really that game-changing Apple can
still use this narrative setting
structure to change and shape how people
think about their products here's
another example of how all this works
it's the moment when Apple introduced
the new heart sensing features that are
coming on the Apple watch series for and
specifically the new EKG feature the
optical heart sensor has been essential
to Apple watch from the beginning we've
added electrodes into the back sapphire
crystal and the digital crown allowing
you to take an electrocardiogram
when you open the app this is what you
see on the watch face it's really it's
really beautiful people people in
general don't like things that are
medical this kind of makes you want to
take an ECG because narrative framing is
a commonly used tactic in political
discourse it's a pretty short jump from
talking about this rhetorical method to
assuming that it's just propaganda to
cover up lies or that it's there to
cover up a pretty mess set of product
announcements now to be clear I am NOT
saying that at all what I am saying is
that Apple is pretty masterful at this
method and it does it over and over
again in its marketing sometimes it's
super effective and sometimes it's not
but the funny thing is I think Apple
executives really do believe the stories
that they're telling I mean I don't know
look at any other tech company ki know
where LG or Samsung whoever is touting a
new feature it feels way more
scattershot Apple takes its time and
it's keynotes it goes a little bit
slower because those keynotes don't
exist just so you know what the new
feature is they exist so that you can
see yourself as a character an Apple
story and you know what Apple's always
done it this way here's a way older
keynote that uses the same method it's
the same great design of the iPhone 3G
that we just launched last summer but
what's inside is entirely new that's
amazing hardware and software that work
together as Apple as is known to do we
make these things work in in hand and it
says auto focus auto white balance auto
exposure to take just a gorgeous photo
for you
you can take videos with you everywhere
you go it's just as simple as that that
was taken an iPhone 3GS you just tap to
record it when you're done
the best thing is you can now share it
with anyone right here from your iPhone
you know the long-running joke about
Apple keynotes they create a reality
distortion field and back in the day
with Steve Jobs that field was mostly
created by sheer force of charisma yes
I'd like to order 4,000 lattes to go
please no it's just kidding
wrong number thank you
and yeah now there's just a little bit
less charisma maybe but there's still a
story that Apple wants to tell and
that's why they do these keynotes every
September hey thank you so much for
watching it's really great to be back on
the youtubes with you leave a comment
down below what you think of this
keynote and you know what honestly you
should hit that subscribe button because
we're about to enter silly season for
new product announcements and we're
gonna ton of videos and you're gonna
want to know about them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
