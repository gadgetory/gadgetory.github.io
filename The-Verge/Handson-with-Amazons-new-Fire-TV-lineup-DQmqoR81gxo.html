heating up and these are Amazon's latest
efforts in this arena we've seen three
different devices today there's a new
fire TV stick there's a new fire TV box
and there's a gaming model too
can this compete with Apple Amazon sure
seems to think so
first let's take a look at the fire TV
stick at first glance you might not
think it looks like anything new and in
truth it's not it's the same hardware
but now it's going to have a software
update Alexa which is Amazon's
cloud-based personal assistant has been
added to the fire TV stick and the fire
TV stick now comes bundled with a remote
beforehand you had to buyer the fire TV
stick and a remote separately now
they're coming together for 50 dollars
people who have the current fire TV
stick and also get these updates later
this year
then there's the second-generation fire
TV box which has both performance
updates and improvements in video
quality amazon says this has been
redesigned from the inside out
completely it has 75% faster performance
it has a GPU that's two times faster
even the remote which by the way it
looks a lot like the remote from last
year it's supposed to have up to 20%
lower latency which is really important
when it comes to things like voice
search and has a 40% longer battery life
like the fire TV stick the remote for
Amazons fire TV box now comes with Alexa
unlike the new Apple TV the Amazon fire
TV box supports 4k Ultra HD content now
of course you have to have a 4k display
or TV and you have to be watching 4k
content or to really reap the benefits
of this now Amazon says even if you
don't have 4k display or 4k content that
you're watching the Box supports HEV C
that stands for high efficiency video
coding it's supposed to be 2 times more
efficient when it comes to encoding and
distributing video that's a lot of mumbo
jumbo basically it means that even if
you're not watching 4k or using a 4k
device you're still supposed to have
improved video quality the new fire TV
box is $100 that's less than the price
of the new Apple TV box it goes on sale
will for pre-orders today and it's
shipping sometime in October then
there's the third part of all the new
Amazon TV products today and
that's around gaming it's a Kindle Fire
TV gaming edition it is basically the
fire TV box but it comes with a couple
of advanced game downloads and it comes
with a gaming controller Amazon says
this has been redesigned it's supposedly
a more precise controller it's organ
ominously more comfortable and like
everything else we've seen today it has
a LexA voice search built into it that
bundle is going to run you a hundred and
forty dollars Amazon claims that between
the box and a stick it was the best
selling media player in the US this past
summer and they're on path to continue
to be bestsellers but let's face it
there's a lot of competition out there
and we'll have to see how well these
actually work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
