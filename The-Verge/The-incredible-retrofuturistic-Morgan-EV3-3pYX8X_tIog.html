here at the Geneva Motor Show at the
Morgan booth with the new Morgan Eve III
it's a 64 horsepower all-electric 3
wheeler it's based on the same platform
as the Morgan three-wheeler that's
behind me which has a v-twin motorcycle
engine but this one can go about 150
miles on a charge or 50 miles if you put
it into sport mode that gets it up to
100 miles an hour when it goes on sale
in the UK later this year it'll cost
about 35 to 40 thousand pounds and
hopefully next year it'll come in the
u.s. between 50 and 60,000 dollars
Morgan is one of the more interesting
companies here at the show rather than
just focusing on the latest and greatest
it combines old-world coach building
techniques with new stuff this car
actually has quite a bit of wood in it
even with the carbon fiber exterior the
ev3 isn't about getting from point A to
point B though it'll do that just fine
it's meant to be fun on the track or the
back roads at first glance you wouldn't
know this was an electric car but if you
look at the front there's no engine like
there is on the regular three wheeler
it's got these gold fins that air passes
over to keep the batteries cool on the
back there's what looks like a petrol
filler cap except it's actually where
the evie plug is all these little
elements build up to make it look like a
car that might be out of the 1930s but
could be from the 2030s
this is uncharted territory for Morgan
and they're not sure how many they're
going to sell it'll be driven by the
market but they're hoping it gets a good
reception it goes on sale later this
year for more from the Geneva Motor Show
