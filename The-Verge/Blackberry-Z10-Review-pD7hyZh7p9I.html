were taking a look at the BlackBerry z10
the first-ever BlackBerry 10 device the
phone might look a little bit familiar
because it shares a lot with the iPhone
5 in terms of design language though the
z10 is a bit larger it's got a 4.2 inch
display it feels good in your hand the
back is made from a soft touch kind of
rubbery dimpled material which is really
nice to hold as I said it's got a 4.2
inch display and the resolution is 1280
by 768 and it looks quite nice inside
there's a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
processor 2 gigs of ram and 16 gigabytes
of on-board storage though that is
expandable through the use of a micro SD
card the z10 has Wi-Fi GPS and all of
the other sensors that you would expect
in a modern smartphone it also has two
cameras an 8 megapixel shooter on the
back and a 2 megapixel camera on the
front of the device the cameras on the
phone are decent but the software is
interesting RIM is touting a function
called time shift which allows you to
snap a picture kind of in burst mode and
then select through the different frames
of the photo that was taken to find the
perfect moment overall the phone is
nicely designed and I liked using it I
was a little disappointed with the
battery life however there were a few
days during testing when I took it off
the charger around 9 a.m. and ended up
with a dead phone at about 6 or 7 p.m.
but the story here is not really about
the z10 it's about BlackBerry 10 the new
operating system from RIM it has nothing
to do with blackberry 7 or any previous
versions though there are some similar
design traits exhibited the basic
concept of the BlackBerry 10 interface
is that there are really four states you
can be in there's in an application
that's pretty straightforward
on your home screen which does double
duty as your multitasker in your app
drawer where you can open up an app just
like on any other device or in
blackberry hub which encompasses all of
your messages that you get on the phone
and that could be email MMS SMS Twitter
Facebook etc you get into those various
states with a couple of gestures the
main gesture on the phone is
swipe up from the bottom of the display
which unlocks it and takes you to your
home screen if you're inside an app you
can swipe up you'll go out to your home
screen
the other main gesture that you use is
kind of a continuation of the home
screen gesture you swipe up and then
continue holding and swipe to the right
which gives you a view of what
notifications have come in and
eventually if you swipe all the way over
you get into your unified inbox your
home screen is limited only to 8 items
and those items can only be arranged by
what you've most recently opened so if
you've got twitter open and that's your
9th app and you open another one twitter
is gone and you've got to reopen it the
second problem with the concept is that
some of those apps turn into widgets
when you minimize them which is great
for instance the weather widget works
really well and updates in the
background right on the home screen the
problem is you can't keep the weather
widget on the home screen so you have to
keep reopening the app every eight
applications you open but the bigger
issue with the OS is the way it handles
notifications so instead of having a
notification bar like Android or iOS
you're actually just looking at the very
message that you were notified about the
biggest problem notifications is that
when you go into your hub and you check
a message it saves that state which
means that when you get another
notification and you go to check that
notification you actually end up in the
notification you were checking before
that what happens is you've got to start
backtracking into your hub to figure out
where that message actually is located
but in terms of general speed and
capability I would put BlackBerry 10 on
par with Android or iOS it doesn't seem
to be lacking any or many of the
features that those operating systems
have it's got a different idea about how
you should navigate it but the question
is whether or not it's a better idea and
in my opinion it's not on the app front
rim is done a pretty good job with its
first party offerings the browser is
very good and certainly as capable as
any other modern mobile browser that's
out there the email experience which rim
of course has been known for
historically is good even with my gmail
accounts but I would not say great
multiple message management proved to be
a little bit tricky in particular you
have to long press on a message then
select another item from a popover menu
and then start selecting your messages
and then tap on the trash to get rid of
those messages
seems like there could be a much quicker
way to get at multiple message
management one of the great things that
rim is done is integrate a lot of
third-party services into its core apps
they've got an app here which is a
note-taking a reminder app called
remember that integrates Evernote so you
can sync your account and folders right
into that application there's also a
surprisingly clever app called story
maker which allows you to combine video
clips with music and a variety of
effects and titles I thought it was
pretty fun to play around with and was
impressed that the typography and the
effects used in the application itself
the device comes pre-installed with a
Twitter Facebook LinkedIn and Foursquare
app in my case however I thought the way
it handles Twitter was a little bit
clunky much like Windows Phone it will
show you a list of your latest at
messages on Twitter but in order to
fully read those messages you have to
click into each one individually and
speaking of the Twitter app it's
actually kind of bad in the version that
I tested it looks and feels very much
like Android or iOS Twitter except that
it doesn't auto update in the background
and when you pull to refresh it takes
you from wherever you were the last time
you check the app to the top of your
timeline RIM has improved bbm for
blackberry 10 adding some really
interesting functions like bbm video
calls which worked well most of the time
when I was testing the device and a
novel function which allows you to share
the screen of your phone with somebody
else over bbm video rim claims that
BlackBerry 10 will launch with about
70,000 third-party apps in its
BlackBerry World app store and that may
be true but it kind of feels like 69
thousand of those apps are bad a lot of
them are rehashed playbook titles and
some of the ones that I tested which are
made for blackberry 10 just didn't
really seem up to snuff it is clear
however that making great apps for
blackberry 10 is possible the USA Today
app for instance is very good as our
handful of the games Angry Birds Star
Wars for instance plays as good if not
better than it does on other platforms
and rim says there's a lot more coming
including some fairly significant app
contributions from EA games as well as
Gameloft rim is added a content
marketplace to black bear
world so you can now buy music TV or
movies pretty easily through the same
interface that you get your apps in one
spot that I think rim has executed
fairly poorly in is the inclusion of
Android apps in blackberry world the
device is capable of running Android
apps in a runtime environment which is
essentially like software emulation of
Android and the apps definitely run like
they're being emulated they don't really
run that well and as soon as you're
inside an Android app you're literally
inside an android environment and just
reminder this isn't this year's Android
or last year's Android this is Android
2.3 it's not really in addition to the
OS and in some ways kind of detract from
what RIM is doing with blackberry 10 the
z10 is going to be available for $199 on
contract
overall the z10 is a fine device it's
even a very good device and BlackBerry
10 is a very good mobile operating
system I think it's extremely capable
and I'm excited about what it's going to
develop into the bottom line is that
it's a good phone but it's lacking a
killer app or killer piece of
functionality that's going to sway most
buyers from Android iOS or Windows Phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
