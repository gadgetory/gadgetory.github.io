the Byrds we're at CES 2015 and this is
the Elio let's go for a ride the Elio is
a three-wheeled car composed of car
components from American car
manufacturers like GM Ford and Chevy
it's got a steering wheel it's got one
wheel on the back two in the front
drives like a normal car it looks like
it would be an electric car but it's
surprisingly not it runs on gasoline and
it's gonna cost six thousand eight
hundred bucks when it comes out in 2016
he took the Elio on the Las Vegas Strip
and driving it around feels very much
like a normal car I will say steering is
a bit heavy it feels like because the
wheels aren't really flush with the car
that they sort of look like a prowler
the Elio gets 84 miles to the gallon on
the highway due to a combination of
aerodynamics its lightweight body it's
three cylinder engine so in terms of
performance the car was governed 235
miles an hour
so it was hard to gauge just how fast
and powerful the car was but a three
cylinder engine is definitely slow so
you can't really race this thing it has
a top speed of 100 miles an hour with 84
miles per gallon you'll be able to get
places really quickly but you won't be
able to bring that much stuff with you
the company tells us that it's going to
ship in 2016 for 6,800 bucks
