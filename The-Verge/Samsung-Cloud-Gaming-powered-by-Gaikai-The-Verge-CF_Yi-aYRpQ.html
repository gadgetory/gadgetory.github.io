into the Gaikai family one of Samsung's
high-end Smart TVs here in the Samsung
Smart Hub you can see we've got a new
icon here in the lower right corner
Gaikai which is a special thing that
they've been working on with a new set
of firmware for Samsung's high-end
televisions we want to jump in that
right now will show you the interface
Gaikai has told us that this UI you're
about to see here can be customized any
way the manufacturers like instead of
using a Gaikai account it actually uses
your Samsung Account which is
cross-referenced Gaikai so you get all
of your saved games and all of the games
that you purchased and so on when this
launch is based on that single login got
a variety of different games here we can
start up the witcher 2 and this should
load pretty quickly from the servers and
jump you right into the full pc version
of the title even though all we've got
plugged into this TV is power and an
ethernet cord here goes
nope one more round
Gaikai stands for the open ocean they
tell us and that's the literal
translation of that Japanese or those
Chinese kanji Chinese characters
depending on here's the witcher two
assassins of kings we're loading the
arena right now and again this is only
one way to say it it's a television got
a little bit of texture pop-in they're
pretty rapidly and as you'd see it on a
PC and now just going to jump into the
arena and slay a few combatants for fun
guy kai tells us just about any USB game
controller will work with these
televisions we're using a Logitech
one right now that uses the X input
system same one that's used in the Xbox
360 controller it's a nice alternative
if you don't have an Xbox 360 game
controller around
that's the witcher 2 let's take a look
at another game real quick
log out becca tells us there'll be a
survey here as part of the beta that
we'll be seeing when the service
launches on samsung tvs the beta should
give us access to a variety of timed
demos of games which they will be
they'll be evaluating before they launch
the full service at some time in the
near future
this is limbo a 2d platformer that's not
really a platformer it's more of a
puzzle adventure game where you are
running through a dark world trying to
find your sister i believe it's a very
dark grim little fairy tale of the game
and i like it quite a bit you can see it
takes a little while to load even though
it's a streaming game but there's room
there for pre-roll advertisement of
publishers are interested in that guy
kai says that it's entirely up to the
publishers and the TV manufacturers and
so on though that's not something that
they're going to be starting on their
own just wake up here and set off
through the forest
and so you can just imagine we've got
your your Samsung television here or LG
LG is also a partner of guy guys and
rather than watching TV or streaming a
Netflix video or watching Blu ray one
day you can just jump into the app and
pick a game to try if you like it you'll
be able to buy it and play it right on
your television and that's Samsung's TV
guy kai thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
