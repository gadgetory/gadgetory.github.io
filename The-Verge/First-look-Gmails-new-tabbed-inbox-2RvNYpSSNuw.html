checking out the new gmail inbox rolling
out today for iOS Android and web it's
designed to address a pretty hot topic
today which is email overload the new in
box is designed around five intelligent
tabs there's primary which is messages
from friends and family social which is
messages from social networks about new
followers new friends and photo tags
from Facebook and Twitter promotions
which is deals offers and other promo
emails from sites like Groupon updates
which is receipts bills and credit card
statements and forums which is messages
from online groups discussion boards and
mailing lists your part of Google uses
its trademark machine learning to place
your emails in any of these five buckets
and if you don't find yourself using one
of them you can add or remove at any
given point though you can't rearrange
the way they look at the top of your
screen inside the configure inbox screen
you can check or uncheck the different
tabs that you want and if you hover over
any of the names of the tabs it actually
gives you some examples of some people
or some companies or social networking
sites that might fall under each
category which makes it easy to decide
which ones you do or don't want if
Google miss categorizes any of your
messages you can always pick them up and
drag them into another tab at which
point Google will say do you want
messages like this to go to your other
category and you say yes the new gmail
for iOS and Android works very similarly
except instead of having your categories
at the top of your screen there in a
left sidebar just ahead of labels if
you're already fanatical gmail user and
have tons of filters set up to rid
yourself of social networking
notifications and the like you might not
notice much of a difference with the new
gmail but for most people the new gmail
should highlight the most important
emails from friends and family in your
primary tab which should be really
useful
