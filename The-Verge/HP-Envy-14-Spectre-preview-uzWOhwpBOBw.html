the HP envy 14 specter which was just
announced today and while I just
reviewed the HP folio 13 ultrabook this
is HP's more premium system which comes
in at 14 hundred dollars and that's
really the first thing I notice about
the laptop the entire thing is made out
of premium parts the lid the display and
the palm rest including the touchpad is
made out of Gorilla Glass even better
HP's brought over its radiance display
and it has a 1600 x 900 resolution based
on my first impressions the system feels
really nice and hand and well-built but
it's much heavier and thicker than any
of the other ultrabooks I've reviewed it
weighs three point nine pounds and it's
definitely thick enough to accommodate a
range of full-size ports including a
couple USBs an HDMI and an Ethernet and
of course HP has its notorious Beats
Audio with a special jog dial the
trackpad and the keyboard look pretty
much the same as the envy 15 and 17
which were released last month the
trackpad seemed pretty responsive though
a little bit stiff and the keyboard is
really nice and backlit internally the
spectre has specs pretty much typical of
the rest of the ultrabooks out there the
14 hundred dollar starting configuration
is going to have a core i5 processor and
128 gigabyte SSD and 4 gigs of RAM HP is
doing something interesting on its palm
rest though it's embedded in NFC chip
which will work with any NFC Android
phone that runs HP's app at first it's
going to allow you to transfer URLs
though HP says you'll be able to do more
later on overall the spectres shaping up
to be one of the best-looking ultrabooks
I've seen but I'm looking forward to
taking a more detailed look when it hits
the market on februari 8th</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
