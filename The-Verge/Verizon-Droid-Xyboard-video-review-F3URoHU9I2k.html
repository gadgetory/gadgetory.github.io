these are the motorola droid xyboard
that's right XY be 0 ard xyboard and it
is probably the worst product name ever
but the products themselves are actually
not all that bad Motorola has done a
significant amount to the tablet since
the original zoom which hit about a year
ago both of the tablets are much thinner
their point 35 inches thick and the 8.2
weighs only point 85 pounds and the 10.1
ways 1.32 pounds but while the tablets
definitely have differing screen sizes
there's not much else that really
separates them both of them have really
nice rubber edges and motorola's also
cut off some of the edges and they also
have really nice IPS displays and while
the 8.2 is smaller than the 10.1 it
still has the same 1080 x 800 resolution
Motorola's also increase the quality of
the camera on the back it's a 5
megapixel camera that takes pretty
decent stills and nice video and on the
front side there's a 1.3 megapixel
camera which is great for video chatting
you also notice that along the top of
the tablets there's an IR blaster
Motorola includes the digit app so you
can use your tablet as a remote control
for your TV and it actually works pretty
well however there are some things I do
not like about the hardware and the
first is the power button the power
button on both of these tablets is
located on the back but unfortunately
it's very close to the volume rocker so
you don't actually know which one you're
hitting and because they're so recessed
you're not even sure if you're hitting
one at all on top of that there's no
microSD card slot so you're stuck with
the internal storage there's also a
stylist that comes with the 10.1 and
while it's pretty cool for doodling and
taking notes when you put your hand on
the screen it's pretty bad with palm
rejection internally Motorola has also
up the specs a little bit it now has a
1.2 gigahertz TI omap processor and one
gigabyte of ram the performance isn't
bad by any means but it can get a little
bit sluggish in some places though the
browser performance was pretty good that
said I just came from testing the Tegra
3 powered transformer prime and that is
much faster all around both sideboards
run Android 3.2 honeycomb which isn't
the best app experience on
tablet but Motorola is promising an
update to Ice Cream Sandwich sometime
soon the standout spec of these tablets
is obviously the LTE provided by Verizon
and it is really fast I got great speeds
around Manhattan and I was able to
connect these tablets to my laptop and
use it as a hotspot but the big problem
is with those pricing plans both these
tablets come subsidized though they're
pretty expensive as is the 10.1 costs
five hundred and thirty dollars and the
8.2 costs 430 and on top of that you've
got to commit to a two-year plan which
will cost about thirty dollars a month
over the long haul that comes out to
about eight hundred dollars for two
years that's a lot of money to plop down
on a tablet that isn't exactly the best
by today's standards the transformer
prime hits later this week and not only
does it have a better display and camera
it has a quad-core Tegra 3 processor for
just four hundred and ninety-nine
dollars if you must have an LTE tablet
these are definitely options but I would
really suggest getting a transformer
prime in an LTE mifi which costs fifty
dollars or you can always get an ipad 2
with 3g which doesn't require that
two-year contract
