system has matured and developed greatly
since its initial conception and in that
time the concept of mobile has blasted
past the idea of a simple cell phone and
into the world tomorrow Android 5.0
lollipop has brought Andy Rubens
beautiful brainchild beyond the phone
and tablet into living rooms and cars
not to wrists but how exactly to
Google's bountiful buffet of desert
themed operating systems get to this
point the Android era officially began
on October 22nd 2008 when t-mobile g1
lodged the United States the first
version of Android which the public saw
has 1.5 cupcake was by no means a
perfect system but it laid the
groundwork for what the operating system
would become home screen widgets deep
Gmail integration in the pulldown
notification window all made their debut
in Google's first version of Android it
also where users would first experience
the Android Market in fact it was one of
the first mobile platforms with a
centralized App Store Google was quick
to release 1.6 donut which included a
couple usability updates before moving
on to its first major overhaul Eclair
Android 2.0 Eclair launched roughly one
year after G one's debut big would be in
an accurate description all around it
was a big deal
he made big promises and it was deployed
on big phones offered by big carriers it
also added Google Maps Navigation free
turn-by-turn voice guided navigation and
obviate the need to ever buy a GPS unit
ever again 2.0 was initially offered
exclusively on Verizon on the Motorola
Droid the phone that kicked off one of
the most successful mobile franchises in
history it was only a few months later
that Google would release Android 2.1
notate that wouldn't have been
significant before one thing the Nexus 1
the first flagship device designed by
Google itself a phone that would
showcase the purest form of Android
without carrier manufacturer
with 2.2 Froyo google had plenty to
showcase including a redesigned
homescreen a gallery app with some 3d
quirks and mobile hotspot support the
end of 2010 saw the debut of 2.3
Gingerbread which in many ways was
relatively minor release with several
aesthetic tweaks better battery and app
management tools and support for
front-facing cameras it debuted on
Samsung's Nexus S ii phone in the Nexus
line Android 3.0 honeycomb was to say
the least in oddity it was designed
exclusive for the tablet had a
strikingly different visual look and
perhaps more telling honeycomb debuted
on screen virtual keys were home back
menu and search but it would take a few
more years before Google figure out
Android and tablets in any meaningful
way eager to put honeycomb in the zoom
behind it Google released Android 4.0
Ice Cream Sandwich in the fall of 2011
it was without question the biggest
change for Android on phones yet many of
ice cream sandwiches new features and
design elements got their start in
honeycomb including virtual buttons a
blue tron light motif improve the widget
support better multitasking and action
bars within the applications Ice Cream
Sandwich also introduced Roboto Google's
typeface from Android side for high
resolution displays Ice Cream Sandwich
launched on the Galaxy Nexus one of the
first smartphones with a 720p HD display
ok by now you realize the numerical
increments don't really indicate the
importance of an update take 4.1
jellybean for instance which is for all
intents and purposes our rebooted
Google's flagging tablet strategy a
debut in the Nexus 7 a tablet that was
the right size and the right price when
a debuted in the middle of 2012
jellybean included some major
performance enhancements and interface
tweaks but its headline feature was
Google now an entirely new predictive
computing platform
Google now predicted what you wanted and
responded intelligently to voice
commands the next point one iterations
all made improvements on that baseline
introduced new hardware with 4.2 there
was the LG produced Nexus 4 and
Samsung's Nexus 10 tablet along with
debut of multiple users for tablets in a
second generation of the Nexus 7 for
Android 4.3 then in October 2013 Google
partner with Nestle 2 introduced Android
4.4 KitKat
the first sponsored version of the
platform even made a special edition
candy bar for the occasional KitKat
brought a visual revamp with the
jellybean aesthetic and debuted with a
Nexus 5 smartphone much of that
tron-like element disappeared by KitKat
with more visually pleasing white
interface elements replacing the
electronic blue that preceded them a
refined condensed version of Roboto font
a new app drawer most importantly Google
now integrated directly into the
homescreen
Google also committed to making KitKat
work better with lower spec devices all
that brings us to Android 5.0 lollipop
released in the fall 2014 multitasking
was redefined notifications were smarter
and more interactive most importantly we
once again saw a huge visual overhaul
which Google dubbed material design it
wasn't just for Android but for all of
googles apps and services colorful
interfaces playful transitions and
animations straight out of Disney's
playbook
if KitKat was about getting more Android
phones up to date Android lollipop was
about blending Android everywhere else
it became the tide that bitin Android
across phones tablets cars wearables TVs
and everything else moving Android from
the software that runs on your own
the software that runs on everything in
your life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
