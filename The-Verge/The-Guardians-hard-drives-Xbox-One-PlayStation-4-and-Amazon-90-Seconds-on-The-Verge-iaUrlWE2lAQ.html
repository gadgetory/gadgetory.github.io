NBA legend Kareem abdul-jabbar by night
this is 90 seconds on the purge the
Guardian reports that British
intelligence agency GCHQ rated the
publication's offices looking for hard
drives containing documents from NSA
leaker Edward Snowden those hard drives
were then destroyed with one official
reportedly saying quote you've had your
fun now we want the stuff back the news
comes the same week that lead reporter
Glenn Greenwald's partner was detained
at a UK airport for nine hours and
questioned under terrorism statutes the
White House has since distance itself
from the hard drive raid saying it was
difficult to imagine the same incident
happening on US soil Europe's biggest
games conference gamescom is here and
there's big news for fans of all
platforms Sony finally announced that
the ps4 will be released in north
america on november 15th meanwhile
microsoft announced 23 launch titles for
the xbox one and outlined a new
initiative for indie game developers
what about if you already own a game and
want to upgrade to the next-gen version
Sony will be offering discounts and
Amazon will let Xbox one owners upgrade
for just under ten dollars but only for
one game and finally digital paper
what's the difference amazon has
launched a new magazine subscription
program called all access it lets
customers sign up for a subscription
that gives them both physical and
electronic versions of their favorite
magazine of course cunning ass is the
only publisher that's signed up at the
moment but as long as your favorite
magazines are wired Vogue and Vanity
Fair you should be all set and that's it
for today's top stories coming up
tomorrow I dress even more like Rosie
O'Donnell travel back to 1996 and play
Michelle Trachtenberg lovable aunt in
