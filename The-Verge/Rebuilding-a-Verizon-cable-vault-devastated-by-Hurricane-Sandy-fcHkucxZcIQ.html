blood street cable vault this is where
all of the local distribution cables
that radiate out from the Verizon
building to commercial buildings or
residential buildings this is where all
of that wire line infrastructure comes
back to the infrastructure with inside
this vault is providing all types of
services while video services data
services as well as voice service after
the storm surge of Hurricane sandy this
vault was virtually filled to the top
with water and that water table stayed
in place for the better part of two days
we began a massive pumping operation to
get the water out of the vault but we
had the challenge of subterranean water
in the surrounding area that kept coming
into the vault as we were trying to get
the water out so it took the better part
of two days of a pumping operation for
us to overtake the equilibrium of the
water in the surrounding area we have
air dryer systems that pump dry air
through our copper cable infrastructure
those systems lost power those systems
also were submerged in water and
destroyed and once power began to be
restored to the West Street office we
utilized the opportunity to go down into
the cable vault and use an infrared
camera to walk along the cable vault in
each one of the bays and hold that on to
the copper cables and where water had
intruded the water meeting the
electricity in the copper cable began to
create resistance and the resistance
created heat and our infrared camera was
able to quickly identify where that heat
was the copper cable infrastructure
serving out of Broad Street both here as
well as in the distribution system and
our customer location has largely been
destroyed our fiber-optic based systems
working at the Broad Street office have
been uncompromised
we're looking at this tremendous
challenge that we've experienced here
and the impact to service as an actual
opportunity and we're taking very
immediate steps to remedy this situation
by replacing all of this copper cable
infrastructure that you see around me
with fiber optics it's far too tedious
time-consuming and not effective of a
process to try to put this type of
infrastructure back together to take
yesterday's technology and try to
restore it this is a challenge for us as
far as service restore but it's an
opportunity for us to bring in parallel
fiber-optic infrastructure add capacity
to what we already have here for fiber
optics and begin to flesh in the Broad
Street Network and the West Street
Network with more fiber optics as fast
as possible
