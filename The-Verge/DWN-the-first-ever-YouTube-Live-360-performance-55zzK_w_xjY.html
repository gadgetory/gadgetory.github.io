happy we're here
oh yeah
have you way
oh boy
why would you wanna do
if you can't weigh me I can't make you
stay Titleist we were tight end
scientists keep working
tighten
falling in you
honey miel
walking in the room feel my body falling
in nails soon as I look deep into their
eyes I throw my heartbeat for many times
like you know
Oh
you
so before we're done we thought we'd do
a party for you guys
lighter gloves up you guys ready
I don't know if you can say the f-word
on the live feed
y'all know this is our first time doing
this so everything you do is he's new
and I'm super excited that YouTube chose
two independent artists like me you know
what I mean so stoked that we were able
to be here and do this and everybody
watching thank you so much for tuning in
we love to pop cherries and YouTube's
cherry just got completely hot so if we
could I love to bring Emily out here and
we can do a questionnaire so that we
could talk and you guys can ask us
questions about how we got to this point
because everybody's been asking how is
she doing
how does she do it is how do you do all
this on your own and we love to give you
a breakdown and give you a really big
announcement that we have coming up
because uh we're really excited to
announce something really big that we've
been working on so Emily could you come
out here we can do we could do this
questionnaire yes okay and give it up
for my dancers my band Brady and Bill
and my dancers of course Joe Gerald
Doran and Michelle um thanks so much you
guys for coming out again
I know we had a little bit of technical
difficulties but um but it's it's all
good thank you so much um so I somebody
have my um but yeah can we get mics all
right we're working on you guys we're
working on it live TV live TV it's day
I'm yeah so I mean this is obviously
historic nobody has done and people have
done live streams on YouTube people have
done 360 shows people done 360 videos
but nobody's done this live so
I would love to know from urine first of
all before we get to the fan questions
just like what was it like like what
were the problems that you thought were
gonna come up like what were what were
the things but I mean building out the
show and building a set for a 360 camera
is such a different situation just the
scope of what you guys see we get told
no about 300 times a day and in this
situation it was kind of like they're
like yeah we'll just do a flat stage and
we'll put people in we do it all the
time and it'll be cool and and we were
kind of like I was thinking maybe we
wanted to put people in another world
and they were like no you know so we
push and we push those boundaries and
what we come up with is these kinds of
things these kinds of new creative ideas
and have a great crew great production
team a great director a great
cinematographer who work with me
tireless tired tirelessly to make this
all happen and this is what we created
for you guys and we're super honored
that we could be the first for people to
come in and see the mistakes see the
mess ups and see the what we're doing
what we're trying to do here yeah um I
mean it's it's it's so such a
coincidence cuz it's just about a month
ago we talked at South by where you
killed it by the way I don't know if any
of you guys saw her at South by but
those shows were amazing um and we were
kind of talking about the same thing
we're talking about you know tech
companies partnering with musicians and
you know everybody kind of wants a
little bit of each other on the tech and
music side and it just felt like you
know they're just it's it takes the
right artists feel to take an
opportunity like that and make the most
of it like yeah I think that marriage is
in that collision of those different
genres to come together like I mean tech
with fashion and and music and art they
all to me make sense together I think
they're great separate but when you
figure out how to marry them together
you create something quite beautiful and
I feel like we're all been trying to
give these but slowly but surely
breaking these gates you know
everybody's like oh no I'm a tech person
only and I'm like no but you have an
affinity for music and
we have an affinity for art and beauty
and what we're trying to do is be on the
forefront of pushing the limits and not
only that being independent and doing it
with no machine and no people to tell us
where to go we kind of create our own
lane for ourselves and I think the tech
world can appreciate that with us you
know so that's what we're excited about
yeah um really ok here everything's
great he's saying after we don't
interview we'll do our last song with
the gloves game okay cool awesome just a
little bit of a mixed up for tour where
we got it I got it
we're used to mixed up orders I got I
got one question from Joe from YouTube
he asked just everybody who's involved
in the making of the show tonight yeah
okay so we have our production team was
Daniel Lane and Hugh and they're with
new California and I am sound and
they're amazing and then I have my
director Martin wash with guerrilla film
works and then my cinematographer and DP
Queenie poo
Quinn Fellman and then we have a who
else other than Mike uh choreographer AJ
Anthony Jackson and then we have our
dancers and then I was a producer in
this which is random I would never do
that again
these producers out there you can't be
an artist and then also I was like
ordering the cruise food yeah she went
out to pick up food she was straight up
when I didn't see pk reading the pizza
rigging things no Ferrell is like
because I was acting his producer and
then I was like and they'll you know
text like here so we got this receipt
you gotta pay for this and I'm like okay
let me just get this living real quick
you know and then we have sound David
Brown from mates and um the list goes on
and on about all the great Phil all the
sound engineers and Paul I mean and then
of course you guys at the verge man Trey
and Emily you guys are insane for really
choosing us you could pick anybody
saying chose us and that's pretty pretty
awesome and in my glam team who's been
read wherever everything me my Nina and
Joey um Jeff on YouTube asks do you
think that you do you think that 360 is
the future of watching concerts I do I
think people don't always have the
access to be there and I think they want
to be there at everything they want to
see everything and I think this kind
this kind of take on viewing the concert
not only puts you there but now you have
a full view of what you can feel I think
emotions play a large part in this and
now you get to really feel present in
these moments and you can control it you
know you kind of can control what you
want to see what you want to feel I'm
always that girl that even though the
music's great I'm kind of trying to
figure out what's over here in the sky
while I'm listening
I'm that girl you know and you you get
to create and see your own moment for
yourself and I think that's what 360
should be about is like I want to see
what the dancer is doing because I'm my
my eye goes to the choreography and the
footwork so now you get to still be a
part of it and pan over and see what's
happening over there yeah yeah um so
that kind of brings me the next question
and then well asked which is when you
were told about you that you're told
you're going to get this opportunity to
do the 360 video where did you draw your
inspiration for the performance and I'm
guessing the whole set up to the design
ever yeah well the symbol in the
Triangle no I'm not an Illuminati guys
no that's not happening
no um the triangle is from the series of
albums that I've done I did a three part
trilogy well a trilogy in a three series
of their own their three series of
albums they're in three installations
and I wanted three points of the
triangle so this is a full circle or
triangle of this whole thing and the red
area is the final piece of the
installment so we put the triangles in
and we wanted to create another world
they were like instead of just making
this a live experience where you just
look at a show we wanted to wrap you in
our own world it's always about taking
you away and putting you into another
utopia like that's kind of utopian feel
where you feel you can have an escape
and that's been the music the sound and
the you know the hearts know like it's
always been about getting away from the
crazy and going to a place that feels
like you're welcome yeah and it's
otherworldly and the music is futuristic
the sound is is that same thing and we
wanted to create that world yeah because
I mean you know this weekend the 360
live is going to be happening at
Coachella for the second weekend and
they're going to be out there for some
of the sets but still going to be very
much like a stage set up one artist on
the stand yeah it won't be an
environment where again it feels like
you're wrapped
we're wrap
our selves around you rather than just
saying being seen people like and you
turn is like I have two choices people
or a stage you're kind of looking around
like what's that guy in the back with
thing doing he was kind of crazy living
I might want to date him let me zoom in
once they went something zoom in yeah
everybody L you guys are uh yeah get
checked out right now so I want to get
to next song but you have a announcement
to make it yeah I'm super excited to
announce that um I will be releasing a
VR experience interactive visual with
not above that the next the next video
and what makes it special is that a
we're pushing the forefront of
technology we're working with a great
group of people at VR Playhouse what
gorilla foam works is working with them
as well and we're going to launch it in
not only VR but a 2d companion piece as
well and at being an independent artist
it's just it's very unheard of you know
it's we're pushing the limits and I
don't know if any in it you know there's
few independent artists there's no
machine that's pulling out what we're
doing so we're really excited to do
another innovative thing this is huge if
you know VR and where it's going few
people are they're still trying to
figure out what it is and so for us to
be able to deliver a video in a couple
of weeks in the VR experience is pretty
awesome so that made a big announcement
I know you're saying a lot of people
asking like how do you how did you get
this you know that get this opportunity
how you get the opportunity the VR and
like the honest answer on my end is we
like you well we like you back and I've
always loved this I mean again I fell in
love with a long time ago I was a kid
that was a gamer I was a kid that loved
anime and even now I have an affinity
for Adult Swim and I'm now being able to
work with Adult Swim on my own and do
those things and this was only to me the
next real movement I mean we've always
been pushing for VR we we've been
researching it for a very long time and
to now be able to say that I have a
visual that will be in VR is insane and
then even to say it with no major behind
me and sitting here and being able to
say that is nuts and I don't I think as
young entrepreneurs and young artists
and
independent artists you can do this if
this isn't trying to inspire a movement
like you don't need a lot if you have
the creativity in the that know how to
figure it out you can do some really
really interesting things and I totally
want to do is be on the cusp of that and
we're grateful to a lot of people for
allowing us to do that so you guys need
to look out because you're about to see
a visual in a whole new way like a whole
new way yeah so tell me what's next song
keep it going you guys yeah yeah you
guys so much for sticking with it yeah
thanks oh thank you don't fall cuz that
would just be the worst thing ever
not as bad to give me of if a big
forgive me cuz what you need to get to
me
you smile
No
don't be
Hey
No
