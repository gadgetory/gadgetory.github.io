with the camera on this well with the
Fate you have the space on lock feature
yes and more controversy not controversy
but kind of just as good really you
didn't laugh at that one again face
unlock parently can be unlocked with
this photo the ideas you have created a
way to unlock the phone just to take you
have you have your face you hold it up
it unlocks the phone but apparently you
can just hold a picture of your face up
somebody could kill me take a picture of
my face and then hold it up to the
throne of the locket yeah we what is it
what's the reason we tend to optimize
for the more common use cases so that's
right use common yeah yeah but the base
off thing also you know like you get
kidnapped somebody takes your face off
but sit on yes it will defeat face
unlock as well but no seriously what is
it no seriously it's it's so that you
can have that measure of security so
that if you leave your phone behind you
drop it on the bus or something you know
some stranger is it going to pick it up
and go through all your crap right
before he knows you you can call and and
you know have your phone you know Silver
Bullet it deactivated right right so
yeah I mean will you give you see silver
bullet is yeah so that's what you call
deactivating phone remotely yeah yeah I
think the officials a aware that's what
we used to call it way back in that well
when it's not in your control it's a
werewolf yeah really got to take care of
it or a vampire right I can be verified
I don't know got it steak steak I would
soon as an older take the phone no it
was an old danger term didn't have any
do with koror's did it of course Silver
Bullet the beer nut course sorry sorry

all of you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
