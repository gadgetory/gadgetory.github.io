Pierce and this week we're looking at
two were the old technologies that have
both found new life again virtual
reality and 3d have both been tried
before and they both kind of failed and
they were relegated to theme park rides
and weird B movies you probably don't
want to see but both are back both are
being called the future and both are
being pushed by the movie industry the
video game industry and everybody else
as the thing you're going to have to
have next but are they we've set out to
find out 3d movies in virtual reality
seemingly have nothing to do with each
other but they followed surprisingly
similar paths both have been mostly
confined to novelty users like the snake
that jumps out of the screen at you at
honey i shrunk the kids at Disney World
and virtual reality has basically just
been for video games and sex scenes and
sci-fi movies more recently though both
made a move toward the mainstream and
they've been tapped to do roughly the
same thing even make our movies games
and the whole digital world much more
immersive both are even designed to
replicate how it is we see the world
take 3d for instance when you look at
the world through your actual eyes they
see two slightly different pictures
because your eyes are set apart your
brain meshes them into one which is how
you perceive depth accurately that's
also why catching a ball with only one
eye open is really hard 3d cameras do
the same thing they shoot with two
lenses and essentially capture two
images that they've been projected to
your separate eyes you use either
anaglyph glasses where one eye sees a
red image in the other sees blue or
polarized glasses which pick up light
being projected in two different
directions and pipe them into each eye
there's also active shutter 3d auto
stereoscopic 3d which is just a fancy
way for saying the screen does all the
work and you don't need glasses and
plenty of other options they all rely on
your brain to take two distinct images
and turn them into one 3d hasn't really
caught on though at least not among
consumers and everyday people it's
difficult and expensive to do right it
still requires that you sit with your
head very still and at a very particular
angle and there are a huge number of
people for whom it either doesn't work
at all or actually makes them sick the
technology is still changing and it's
going to continue to improve but here's
the thing virtual reality might eat 3ds
lunch before it ever gets a chance
virtual reality is also been around
forever it's also been gimmicky for most
of
time and is only recently threatening to
become something we use in our
day-to-day lives on one hand it has a
lot of the same limitations as 3d you
have to wear a thing connected to
another thing and it can be really
disorienting for some people but when
done right virtual reality brings the
immersion to an entirely new level it's
all about exploration good virtual
reality creates a three-dimensional
world that doesn't just appear to have
debt it has debt an object will look
different depending on how you look at
it and you can even see it from the back
you can't do that with a 3d camera
basically virtual reality works by
tracking what are called place cells in
our brand these stills are what orient
us in a new environment there how we
figure out where we parked or even get
around our house and surprisingly once
we're in a new environment these cells
make it really easy to figure out where
we are even if we found our just a short
time but virtual reality has its own
complications and challenges for this
reality to feel real there has to be
zero latency when you turn your head you
need to be looking to the side exactly
as fast as you expect any lag takes you
out of the experience and the effect as
it catches up can be so disorienting
that you can actually get sick and these
place cells you need information like
smells and temperature to really give
you a full sense of where you are both
3d and virtual reality are still
maturing but they're both moving towards
the same goal we want our movies to feel
like video games and our video games to
feel like real life converts will
reality bring the change 3d promise and
just how far into the matrix can we
really go
joining me now to answer all of my many
questions about all of this is Frank
rose the author of the book the art of
immersion and a long time contributing
editor at Wired he's also fresh off his
first experience at the oculus rift so
Frank thank you for being here really
appreciate it right there so real quick
just like 30 seconds oculus rift when
you think is it the greatest thing
you've ever seen I'm still gripping the
table yeah yeah you did the coaster and
you were like yeah go over the ledge
it's like oh god I'm gonna die yeah yeah
it's very intense ok so I want to start
with I don't know 60 years ago really so
ah 3d movies are not new at this point
they're old they went on for forever and
I always thought they were sort of you
know kitschy things that you know disney
world but they weren't they were movies
uh so what what happened years ago and
why didn't it work well basically it
didn't work because it was all analog
and you know the thing about digital one
thing about digits very precise you can
get things to line up very precisely
when you're you know 3d is basically
just you're looking at two images at
once and they have to line up if they
don't line up you're going to get a
serious headache at best and it's even
like the the slightest bit off yeah
totally throws everything yeah exactly
in fact almost the closer the closer it
is if it's not exactly on the worse it
gets yeah so along comes jinx Cameron
you know 10 years or so ago you know
fresh off Titanic and he decides he
wants to reinvent 3d for the digital age
and at this point it's much easier to do
because you know with digital technology
you can line things up exactly it's
still however a very it's it's very
difficult in that you have to go to
incredible lengths to reproduce an
effect that we actually see quite
naturally you mean just like a thing and
then another right behind it yeah doing
that were difficult than it seems right
yeah I mean seeing you know actual
objects in
you're in a depth field is quite easy
for about ninety percent of people but
but mimicking that experience on film is
very very hard and you know remains so
to this day I think Cameron obviously
very serious about it and an extremely
brilliant director and kind of had you
know all the money in the world to do
yeah whatever he wanted to this plan you
know I tan I could never like all right
to do whatever exactly exactly so he
goes off with with a sort of camera
expert named ninja in space and they
spend several years they developed a
stereoscopic camera and I actually met
him when he was in I think 2060 was at
us on a soundstage in Montreal where
somebody else was shooting the first
feature film to be shot you know using
this camera his journey uh yes journey
3d and um was really actually called
journey 3d i think so that's when i get
to 3d mystic easy didn't know right it's
in 3d exactly so you know so i get a
chance to talk with cameron about all
this and what he said basically was that
the whole point of 3d for him is to
remove what he calls the screen plane
which in a normal movie the screen plane
is just the screen but it actually
becomes sort of a barrier between the
audience and the experience and
especially in 3d so that's what he sets
out to do and the point of it is to
create an experience of depth of
something that can you know really draw
you into it and you know he knew how to
do this very very well for most
directors the the easy you know sort of
cheap shot thing to do is to have
something come out at you you know for
the snake you know whatever yeah and
there's that the thing at Disney World
arm is like a snake that came out and
bit you and terrified small children
yeah right right
or a hand or you know or anything like
that but but you know so it really comes
down to a question of what are you going
to do with it and how sophisticated is
your understanding of how to make it
work because again it's it's it's really
small and we've seen this even in the
sort of digital era as we've gone to it
is some people do 3d really big and that
seems cause problems and some people do
it really small and that seems cause
problems and there's like this sweet
spot that you know a couple of movies i
think avatar got a lot of credit for
doing it right and life of pi got a lot
of credit for doing it right right but a
lot of other movies people still seem to
think 3d is like it's either it doesn't
work or it's not really that useful but
that's really the question like is it I
guess done well is it useful there seems
to still be this huge debate like what's
this in service of other than charging
me five dollars more the movie theater
yeah well don't under uh I think you
know done well but that's that's a very
big caveat yeah you know done well it
can create an incredibly immersive
experience but the thing is that you
know very few people do it well so is it
but is it immersive just in that it
looks more like real life it looks more
like you know if I'm looking at the
world of wherever Pandora and after our
it looks more like it would if I were
actually there is that the the effect
here that's what we're going for that's
that's certainly the goal that's
certainly go you know a lot of what
happens to is that people try to you
know retrofit 2d movies and make them 3d
and that's never going to work well so
that's that's actually interesting
question it's like I think 3d has it was
the future of everything yeah you know
3d TVs ESPN was going to do sports we
were gonna do movies everything right
and it seems like that's been pulled way
back is that because the technology is
not there is it because people don't
care is it because enough people are
doing it badly that everybody has a bad
taste in their mouth like why is this it
seems like the it's possible to do well
right so why isn't it taking over the
world it's possible to do well but it's
very difficult and also i think the
glasses remain a barrier you know the
fact that you
have to wear these glasses even though
they're you know they're certainly far
better than that last as you were in the
50s you know it's it's it's not good it
cuts down on light it makes it a you
know just sort of cuts into the
experience and again I think that the
idea that you have to go to all of this
you know sort of extreme difficulty
meant to mimic something that's actually
quite natural suggests that maybe it's
not all that good an idea you know I
don't know it's certainly it can be done
but the question is you know can it be
done well by a lot of people on a mass
scale you know that remains to be seen
right but so it's it's I mean it's
interesting that I think people do want
something like this and you found this
in your book the art of immersion it was
it was really it seemed to me that their
work there were sort of two branches to
the book one was like how people want to
interact with stories and it's like you
had the madman example where people just
started tweeting as madmen characters
right and it became this whole crazy
phenomenon and people like they got shut
down and then they brought it back and
it was great marketing for the show
right but then on the other hand it's
it's not only do we want to you know
expand sort of horizontally integrate
these stories with all these other
pieces of the world we want the stories
themselves to be better roar is that bro
is that a fair way of categorizing it
Yura Yura which I mean we've clearly
veered toward d you know interacting
with stories I feel like that's that's
happened that we we won that battle
against people who didn't want us to do
it Europe and people are tweeting about
chose now and every you know every movie
has a video game and all this stuff but
so how what kind of progress have you
seen towards this let's fundamentally
change how we tell the story not a great
deal I mean you're right in that we're
we're certainly moving toward a kind of
a participatory experience but you know
one of the things I realized when I was
when I was working on the book was that
every time we come up with a new medium
a new form of a new medium for techno
type one of the things I realized when I
was working on the book was that every
time we come up with a new technology a
new medium for telling stories it takes
people at least 20 or 30 years to figure
out what to do listen Nina and list it
with some movies motion picture camera
was invented around eighteen ninety it
was nineteen sixteen before you had a
film that really took all of what we now
take for granted at the grammar of
cinema you know all the sort of tricks
of the trade you know cups pans fades
point of view shots you know all of
these things had to be invented because
before there was a camera there was no
way to even imagine share and it was not
a ten to twelve years after that before
you had sound so with television
television was invented around 1925 it
was the early 50s before you had
something that that was not just sort of
mimicking radio or mimicking stage play
and I think the internet is no different
I mean you know we've we've had the
internet now or we've had the web for
you know 22 years at this point but
we're still figuring out what to do with
it and it's also changing you know its
advancing pretty rapidly you know at the
same time you know just as movie
technology was advancing rapidly so it's
not really surprising that we should
still kind of be in an experimental
phase and I think that's where we are
you know you see you see things like
lost for example which was a TV show
that didn't really have all that many
aspects that were obviously interactive
but it was so complicated that it was a
it was a show that's almost impossible
to imagine before the web you know I
watched that show religiously and I
remember reading lostpedia between
episodes and it was like I'd watch an
hour of TV go what just happened and
then spend the next six days they were
reading through what everybody else was
trying to piece
together and like how the characters and
it's kind of true i can't imagine
watching that show your without having
access to all that stuff and all these
other people who are watching as well
yeah exactly you know I interviewed the
guy who created lostpedia and you know
completely fascinating I mean this was a
Silicon Valley guy he you know new
technology very well he you know binge
don the first season and then the second
season came along he you know it was
like whoa what was that just about and
so he did sort of you know what comes
naturally to people now which is you
know start start a wiki as a way of you
know developing developing the story the
the showrunners you know they they had I
mean I interviewed them as well they had
somebody on the production whose job it
was sole job was to keep track of
everything keep track of all the
characters keep track of what they were
doing what they had done where they came
from where they were going on days when
like a like a Bible of it all there's
like mr. Eko is you know X Y and not see
yeah exactly and and in the you know
they have a big writers room so in the
writers room there were you know sort of
giant post-its that covered three walls
all color-coded yeah but on so on days
when this guy wasn't wasn't there when
he was off or something the the
producers would turn to lostpedia to
figure out yeah yeah that's great but so
all this seems to be is this just like a
stopgap until we can actually be part of
the story it seems like that's that's
what you know George Lucas in Joburg
we're talking about this as like the
next great step is like that are our
movies feel like video games in the
sense that I can be part of it and I can
control it and that's something else
that's been tried and failed and you you
wrote a little bit about this was the I
forget what the movie was called but it
was Roger ever reviewed it and Roger
said it was the worst thing he'd ever
seen and it was like a movie where you
could control the plot right is that
exactly the this was in the this was in
the early 90s and
so there was a guy who decided that this
was going to be the future of movies and
it was a variant on the children in the
scenario which which i think is a kind
of a primitive example of interactivity
and almost inevitably like a wrong path
yeah but but especially a wrong path in
the context of a movie theater so so he
created these you know not very great
movies on it you know to start with and
then at certain points in the you know
in the movie the audience was asked to
choose you know a B or C which way with
the movie guts and they had taken a
couple of theaters in New York and LA
and so to check them out replace the cup
holders with with with buttons so you
know green yellow and red and you could
press a button and decide where the
movie was going to go except the problem
was of course you weren't watching it by
yourself people watching it in a movie
theater full of other people or in this
case actually not full of other people
looked like two other people yeah and so
so led to this you know scenes of
pandemonium where people would start
leaping over the states to get to you
know they can't control them and you
know it was a complete mess but the
whole point of immersion we've we've
always had this impulse to immerse
ourselves and in stories and in you know
fictional stories in particular if we
see a story or read a story and it
doesn't really matter what medium it's
in the something that we really identify
with we want to be in that world you
know in our at least in our imagination
and that's been a universal impulse it
has you know it's something that has not
changed you know you can lose yourselves
in eat you can lose yourself in books
and you know people still do that Don
Quixote the reason he went tilting at
windmills and in 1605 and servant
story was because he had lost his mind
from reading two months which was you
know then a pretty new activity and
actually is probably completely possible
yeah I'm still doable but it seems like
that's you know there's this interesting
convergence between those two things or
it's like we still want to lose
ourselves in these stories and we also
want to participate in them right and
that's amazing or something like like
virtual reality becomes really
interesting and I feel like in some
sense I don't know if you agree with
this but I think 3d is sort of uh it's
you know virtual reality is partly 3d if
that's part of the technology but it
seems like it's everything 3d is plus
all of the other things that needed to
be really be successful yeah in the
sense that not only does it look deep
and it sort of looks like it would be as
if I'm standing in the world mm-hmm but
it feels that way too yeah um and that's
I mean we've had this around for not
this particular thing the oculus rift
but we've had virtual reality around for
forever to write so what when you were
doing the book and when you were working
on all this of what diverse reality come
up at all it came up a little bit but at
the point when I was working on the book
you know frankly it was which was in
2010-2011 that's not that long ago Yeah
right right exactly but you know even
then it was not really on the radar it
was something that had been on the radar
a long time ago and and and was not now
I mean the people behind the oculus rift
have done something that's pretty
remarkable which is to you know to bring
it back in a in a credible version you
know obviously technology has moved
ahead tremendously since the late 80s
Early 90s which was when you know you
first had all of the all of the hyper
but you know they are right they were
like the big headsets you had to like
lower down onto your head run yeah sorry
but now you know you still have a little
headset so you know but the thing about
it is it's a very personal experience
you know it's just you in this world and
so I think there's a lot of appeal for
something like that and it's certainly
immersive in the sense that you know
once you're there
you know if it's if the production is
well done you're really in it so yeah
yeah I mean and I think I mean do you
think it's true that this is I mean is
this where we're going next are we all
gonna buy like throw away our 3d glasses
and buy virtual reality glasses cuz you
mentioned the big problem 3d still has
is they have to wear glasses rug and
this is not only glasses it's big fat
goggles you have to put it on attached
to a pc I mean I do think that's
problematic I think that certainly you
know this will attract a following how
big a falling I you know I really don't
know you know will it become one of the
next big you know interfaces for gaming
that's entirely possible um gaming seems
like the easy one yeah where it's you
know just the ability to stand there
because I'm already sitting on my couch
I already have a controller in my hand
and just to be able to go like this was
enough of a selling point that I'm
probably gonna your get into this idea
right but so what about things like we
were talking earlier about Sleep No More
and so many shows that you've been to
where and in a way you'd sort of said in
the New York Times a couple weeks ago
that this is it may be a hint at what
the future of movies and video games are
like what do you mean by that well it's
really intriguing so sleep no more of
course is a immersive theater experience
where instead of sitting down in the
seat and steering of the stage you know
behind the proscenium arch you are in
the middle of the experience in the case
of Sleep No More there's a five story
loft building that you are free to
explore and action takes place all
around you sometimes and sometimes
nothing is happening at all but there's
always you know that sort of like and
you basically I haven't been asleep nor
basically they give you three hours and
just started open the door and turn you
loose do have your own experience
however you want exactly and you know
I've been twice people you know many
people have gone a number of times and
you never quite have the same experience
twice because part of it is just
serendipity at you know what where you
happen to be at any particular time so
and it's its interactive in the sense
that you know in some cases you just
sort of watching what's going on around
you in other cases you actually kind of
brought into the action of them but and
that's kind of the dream right for all
four four movies for games that's as
what we want we want to be part of the
action right I mean what it really comes
down to is the holodeck right which is
which which you know Gene Roddenberry
invented in the so to speak in Star Trek
The Next Generation and the 80s and um
you know kind of remains the ultimate
holy grail now it's that in the minority
report interface see me do things
everybody talks about it like that I
want in life right now the minority in
the minority report interface is
actually fairly simple but but is a lot
more complicated and it's the holy grail
in the sense that you know the Holy
Grail was of course something that you
were never able to actually attain and
so far that's what the holodeck is but
what really intrigued me about things
like sleep them more is in a way it sort
of like the holodeck except in real life
it's not a virtual experience it's a
it's a real experience it's a physical
experience and it's you mean in the same
way as the holodeck it's it's very much
sort of what you want it to be and you
can create it differently every time you
go in exotic was I mean III it's sort of
you know even a level beyond some of
this other stuff for like if you wanted
a chair it could make you a chair right
and I guess I don't expect you know
sleep no more virtual reality to do that
for me but it did sort of put you in
whatever environment you wanted to be in
and it would always feel different yeah
exactly so in the holodeck you could you
could ride the Orient Express you could
have a conversation with Einstein you
could engage in a Victorian Gothic
romance you could do any number of
different things like this and in fact
there's a wonderful book called Hamlet
on the holodeck that was written by
Janet Marie who was done at MIT and is
now at Georgia Tech
in the late 90s that looks at you know
digital storytelling in a very prescient
way quite quite interesting for people
who are want to explore that further but
so with the with the holodeck you could
really experienced Saenz but in a
completely virtual environment obviously
but a virtual environment that was
completely convincing you had life-sized
3d holograms that had had you know
physical presence you get that you could
touch them you know that sort of thing
so that's pretty fanciful stuff we
haven't quite gotten there yet now right
now for that but something like Sleep No
More you actually are in a room with you
know 3d people and so is there I mean is
there a way to combine any of that stuff
like are we sort of our wheel well I
guess we are a long way away from being
able to be convinced by something like
the oculus rift that we're in a real
world because it's you know it's partly
about touching it's probably about being
able to smell things and hear things and
walk around in a more convincing way but
I mean is that that we were going are we
going back to adding smell-o-vision on
all of this stuff so we get to the point
where it all works well you can
certainly had smell-o-vision to the
oculus rift I suppose maybe that hard
yeah yeah right but again is that is
that what people is that what we want is
that what we're working towards that can
be James Cameron's next big project is
is let's figure out how to get people
even more involved in the story I think
I think that's definitely where we're
headed I think that's the kind of thing
we want we don't quite know how to get
there yet and the technology isn't quite
there but but but you know that's what
things like the oculus rift or four is
to show us where we can go so I think my
other big question here is it's it seems
like our attention spans are getting
shorter this is the big complaint
everybody you know every movie maker
seems to have is people don't pay
attention anymore right but then we're
making these things that literally force
you to pay attention where it's like I
can't wear this and do other things
mm-hm I'm just like physically that's
not hot I don't know
see people wearing this and driving I
don't want to be on the road I'm sure
will happen a 3d glasses and driving now
they're a good look but so is that are
are we going to come back to this place
where this sort of deeply immersive
storytelling becomes so good and so
engrossing that it takes over again or
are we are we lost forever to Twitter
and everything else while we watch TV
well it's funny because they are kind of
contradictory impulses and yet they're
clearly both happening at the same time
you know if you I mean look at lostpedia
or you know the wiki for any TV show
there's not a TV show in existence these
days it doesn't have a wiki about it you
know look at something like The Walking
Dead which is the most popular show on
TV has you know thousands tens of
thousands of tweets about it every time
it's on the air I have to turn off
Twitter if I'm an episode behind it's
terrible right right and you know has a
talk show about it which is also
incredibly possibly so there's clearly a
a big appetite for for immersing
yourself in zombie stories and in that
zombie story in particular so you know
at the same time that we have you know a
tendency to skim the surface of things
and to you know move quickly from one
thing to another if there's something
that we want to do a deep dive on it's
there for is to do you know when I was
talking with Cameron he you know we we
talked for a bit about avatar which at
that point was not yet greenlit it was
fairly clear that that's what he was
going to do next but he didn't want to
talk about it too much because he didn't
want to at that point giveaway the plot
and so forth but he did say that he
described it a sort of an edgar rice
burroughs action adventure story and he
said that for him the best way to tell a
story like that was to create almost
like a fractal experience where if
you're a casual fan you can just watch
the movie for two or three hours and
that would be it but if you were more
committed fan you can jump in almost in
powers of 10 and the pattern would still
hold and that's what's really happening
you know with something with something
like The Walking Dead you know the more
committed you are the deeper you can go
and I think we're seeing that you know
across a whole range of TV shows and to
a somewhat lesser extent movies at this
point you know partly these are
marketing gimmicks for the properties
but they're also ways to reward fans and
to get fans to engage more deeply and as
television loses you know more and more
of its audience in the sense of you know
broadcasting is obviously not what it
used to be it's becoming apparent that
one way to make up for that is to bring
people in deeper to get them more
engaged than more committed to a show to
a story and I think this is one reason
you see all this happening awesome well
Frank rose thank you very much ver she
taking the time so whether or not
virtual reality is the future of video
games and movies is definitely still
under debate but one thing it's already
being used for is in the medical field
and all sorts of other places that you
may not have expected so we decided to
explore some of the other places virtual
reality has been used for a long time
and might really be the future virtual
reality's whole appeal is how immersive
it is how real it feels that's great for
playing games and watching movies but
this crazy intense experience is already
being used for much more than that the
military is one of the biggest virtual
reality is used to treat post-traumatic
stress disorder for veterans allowing
former soldiers to relive some of their
most frightening experiences but in a
safe environment it feels every bit is
real but it's presented along with
therapy and doctors and safety and the
virtual Iraq program has been incredibly
powerful virtual reality is also being
used to train soldiers and pilots
allowing them to go through their
missions before there's real gunfire
involved it's basically ender's game in
real life doctors are using virtual
reality to treat addiction
even fear you strap on the virtual
reality helmet then work up to seeing
the exact thing you're afraid of it's
simple worryfree immersion therapy and
it really does seem to work we've seen
firsthand how affecting virtual reality
can be thanks to the hunger and Los
Angeles experience at the University of
Southern California verge editor brian
bishop found himself wearing an oculus
rift watching a diabetic man collapse on
the streets of Los Angeles and he
couldn't do anything about it even with
primitive graphics and a big head set on
his face Brian couldn't believe how
caught up he was this stuff works being
able to explore the world you're in has
all sorts of benefits as well it lets
architects walk through the buildings
are creating let's fashion designers see
how their outfits look or lets doctors
explore your MRI in a much bigger and
more useful way it's even letting
doctors perform much better robotic
surgery instead of just staring at a
monitor it's like they took the magic
school bus and went inside your body
virtual reality is an incredibly
powerful technology both for what it can
do and for what it can make us think
we're doing whether or not it's the
future of games we don't know but
there's no doubt it's part of the future
in a number of other ways we never even
imagined that's it for a show thanks so
much for watching thanks to Frank rose
for being here for a great interview
we'll be back next Monday and every
Monday with lots more to talk about
there's lots more coming this summer and
it's going to be awesome so stick around
we'll see you next week
you
