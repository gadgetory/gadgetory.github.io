his hands what the hell is that secret
power I'm Matthew snipper and this is 90
seconds on the verge Captain America the
Winter Soldier has set a new record for
April releases grossing over 95 million
dollars in its first weekend it would be
a major success for any film studio but
is especially poignant for Marvel after
years of letting other Studios adaptive
characters for the silver screen the
comic-book giant released Iron Man in
2008 its first movie produced entirely
in-house it also marks the beginning of
what is now known as the Marvel
Cinematic Universe with each movie
living within the same fictional world
and characters making cameos everywhere
the studio has released nine films in
just six years but it wasn't until 2012
The Avengers that Marvel showed it could
really set records so Marvel's proven it
can Shepherd these cross-pollinated
films but how far into the future are
they looking in a recent Bloomberg
Businessweek cover story Marvel Studios
President Kevin Feige teased that they
had mapped out ideas as far as 2028
which is kind of insane and probably
more speculative than anything but
Marvel isn't the only one recognizing
the box-office power of a superhero
dynasty Fox is currently revitalizing
the x-men franchise as for Sony it has
five spider-man films in the works
then there's Warner Brothers but the
Zack Snyder helm Batman vs Superman is
expected to introduce a cavalcade of DC
characters and will debut may 6 2016
which is the exact same day that Captain
America 3 is scheduled to premiere for
more on Marvel Cinematic Universe check
out the verge coming up we take a look
at some of Marvel's lesser-known
superheroes like sad man who lives in
the basement of his parents suburban
home spends all his time was named the
Smiths</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
