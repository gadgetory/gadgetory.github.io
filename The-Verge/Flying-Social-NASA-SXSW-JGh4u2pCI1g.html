outdoor either the EPA is progressing
beautifully there's nothing up the
flying out I guess you're about the only
person around it doesn't have TV
recovery to the main part of the Nasr
Charter dictates that the agency share
its activities and results so the
missions and the data with the widest
audience possible and it doesn't specify
how you need to do it just that it needs
to be done and so with the changing
media landscape a lot of people don't
get news from nightly news or newspapers
anymore they get it online the world of
South by Southwest is typically reserved
for fresh-faced startups in Silicon
Valley stalwarts but this year one of
the biggest presences was NASA in
addition to talks panels and astronaut
meet and greets the agency even brought
along a 12,000 pound model telescope
coming to South by as part of NASA's
larger effort to have a quote hipper
more accessible image and that effort
has had varying degrees of success my
management said you're gonna have to
start tweeting just like you do news
release or talk to media this is part of
your job and I rolled my eyes and I said
okay whatever you say boss and I did it
and actually i'll change for me
personally during the hubble space
telescope mission there was a spacewalk
occurring and there was a lull in the
spacewalk and i decided to see what the
conversation happening was and when I
went and saw that feed and people were
asking questions they were on the edge
of their seat made me realize people
love space they're following this stuff
and before there was always someone
between me and the public it was the
news media it was the internet but all
sudden I was able to you know connect
directly the public have a conversation
with them the agency has more than 480
highly active social media accounts
across Twitter Facebook YouTube Google+
and more all blasting out daily
information about NASA's many projects
it gives us a voice these little things
these little things before that were
happening in asked that we're great
they're potentially changing our lives
here in aeronautics and space and
technology they were happening before
they were happening in a vacuum nobody
knew about them a lot of the stuff you
see on social media coming out from NASA
comes from the experts I've
space twice I would you know fly to the
window of the space station see this
incredible sight get a camera take a
picture of it and then I could send it
out through the different social media
platforms instantly so this is what it
look like this is what the sunset looked
like at Corsica yesterday or today and
be able to do that have a real time you
know interaction it really was a way to
bring people along on the space missions
not just as spectators but it's fellow
crew mates if we treat it like
traditional media you know like press
releases or you know just making press
statements that are one directional
we're missing the point and the viral
success of the cheeky mars curiosity
rover twitter account has encouraged the
agency to mix humor in alongside facts
and science currently mars curiosity has
about 1.3 million followers on twitter
we've done several amas with different
team members one of them is the number
for ama of all time most people really
love it and respond to it very very well
if we drop a song lyric or a movie quote
he'll be like oh my gosh oh my gosh that
formula earned curiosity more than 1.3
million followers and invigorated the
agency's social media strategy but it's
unclear exactly what NASA is trying to
accomplish and whether it will benefit
the agency long term given the agency's
perennial budget troubles and it's
documented lack of focus is it time for
NASA to get serious about social our job
is to tell the story to the widest
audience possible and if someone's going
to get that message through a parody
video and there to learn something we
don't do things that are just silly for
the sake of being silly we do it for the
to get that information out and if
there's real content being communicated
you know whether it's social media
whether it's a cute YouTube video
whether it's a funny photo if we're
sharing information what the agency is
doing to help better us here on earth I
think that has value and I think people
get that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
