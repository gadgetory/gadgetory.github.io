Verge and I am here at CES 2016 looking
at one of the most surprising products
we're going to see all week it's nikon's
key mission 360 now forget the name this
thing is an action camera not only is it
an action camera it's a 360-degree video
action camera that can shoot footage in
all directions shoot it in 4k uhd and a
whole lot more unfortunately we're not
going to be able to touch the thing
today but we've seen some sample videos
of this thing unfortunately those have
been on some Wi-Fi that's not so great
so they don't look so great but what we
can see when we see some of the videos
that icon showing us here at their booth
is is it looks really great from one
side when the camera is locked on in one
direction similar to the field of view
of a GoPro it actually doesn't look that
bad it definitely looks a little worse
than a hero4 black or silver but the
quality is not bad and then when you
think about the fact that that video
will eventually be 360 degrees something
you can turn around and look in every
direction compared to other consumer 360
degree video cameras it's actually
really good it's better than the Ricoh
theta s it's better than the 360 fly and
it's on par with some of you know the
earlier multi camera VR rigs and that's
really what Nikon wants to do with this
camera wants to give consumers and
semi-pros the ability to shoot virtual
reality on the cheap
and with a rig that's light and easy to
use you can see they've obviously
started to build out a number of mounts
something similar to what you find with
like GoPro or Sony so you're gonna be
able to put this thing on your helmet
carry around on a stick you can sort of
stick mount it to anything
and that's a big deal you're going to be
able to want to show new perspectives
when you have 360 degrees to deal with
now we don't know pricing we don't know
availability there's a lot we don't
really know about this camera but what
we do know is that no one's really doing
anything like this yet and definitely
none of the big companies are doing
anything like this yet now what we were
able to learn from Nikon is that this is
not going to be the only action camera
they're going to make this is just the
first one and just happens to shoot in
360 degrees or more coming in a family
of action cameras so there's going to be
more coming from Nikon hopefully this
year for more from CES 2016 head to the
verge comm and head to youtube.com slash
