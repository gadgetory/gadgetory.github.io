cameras that most of us have so we're
taking more photos and videos than we
ever have before this creates a
challenge managing all those photos and
videos like when I finish shooting this
video what am I supposed to do with it
well there are a lot of services out
there that are supposed to help you
handle this problem but frankly they
aren't very good one of the best has
actually been Google's which had offered
through Google Plus the problem there
was that most of us didn't want to use
Google Plus storing your life's memories
inside a social network just felt kind
of weird well Google is announcing their
new solution to this problem they're
calling it simply photos and I have to
say maybe the photo management solution
that I've been waiting for billions of
photos are taken every single day the
problem is we thought that taking all
these photos and videos would mean that
we could relive these moments later and
it turns out it's actually a lot harder
right the sheer volume of this is made
it near impossible we needed to go back
to first principles and look at this and
really understand the problem space and
rethink and rebuild from the ground up
so the Google Plus version of photos is
dead and in its place comes the new
Google Photos a total solution for
managing the archive of all the pictures
you've ever taken that means an uploader
for your Mac and Windows PCs and new
apps for iOS and Android and starting
today Google will start storing for free
nearly identical versions of the photos
that you're uploading downscaling them
slightly in exchange for giving you
unlimited uploads and in our tests most
of the photos really do look almost the
same as their original version
particularly when you're just browsing
them on your phone the best way that I
like to think about it is you know
drawing the comparison and music this is
like us saying we're gonna store all
your CDs is mp3s
unlimited for free and I think that's
pretty compelling for a lot of people
who want to be able to maintain these
memories and be able to do so now if
you're the type of person who wants a
story original down to the last byte we
still offer 15 gigabytes for free shared
across your Google services and one
terabyte you can buy for example for $10
a month but this really unlocks
for everyone to be able to have their
memories their entire life backed up so
an online photo management service needs
to do more than just store your photos
it should also help you enjoy them and
that means finding things so here's
where the power of Google search comes
in Google is using all of its machine
learning technology to help understand
what's in your photos even if you've
never tagged them it recognizes famous
landmarks it knows what a boat looks
like it knows what a whale looks like
all you have to do is tap in key words
and Google will find it inside your
photos it creates a whole new way of
looking through your photo archive and
it's something I think people are really
going to enjoy we have this really great
technology and we try to decide like how
should we surface this what's the best
way that users are going to really even
understand how this would work and what
we found is that people describe photos
in basically four different categories
one is who's in the photo two is where
was the photo taken three is what is in
the photo is it a dog is it a hat
whatever it may be and then four is what
is the type of photo is it a panorama is
it a video so you just tap that blue
search disk and what you'll find here is
your entire life of photos automatically
organized into these little categories
so I have all my people all the
important places in my life so the place
I live the place my girlfriend's family
lives the place we go in Hawaii my
hometown in Garland Texas we have all
the things that are interesting in your
photos so all my food photos my photos
from the beach and and these are sort of
dynamically generated based on what you
say what I have yeah you're a huge sky
person evidently you live in a cloud if
you could so now that I've uploaded my
entire photo archive to Google it's been
really fun to see what Google is finding
in those photos and one of the best
things they've found is faces of all my
friends and family Google simply can
judge based on how many photos you've
taken of a single person how important
they are in your life and so when I
click on faces inside Google photos it
now shows me my mom my dad my brother my
sister-in-law and most importantly my
little nephew and I can now go back
years and time even as their faces have
changed over the years Google can still
hone in on what they look like and show
me basically our entire relationship
there's a flip side to all of this
algorithmic wizardry though and it's the
creeping sense that now Google knows
more about me than it ever has before
talk to us a little bit about what
privacy controls there are on photos is
is like geo-tagging just kind of like
the price of admission or do users
retain some sort of control over maybe
metadata around photos yet with the goal
of Google photos is to start on a
foundation of user trust that's a most
important thing we're asking you to
store your lifetime of memories with us
so at the most base level there's a lot
of these things that you can say look I
don't want and I choose not to do so for
example you could say I don't want to do
the face groupings and you have the
ability to turn that off in the cases of
geo information location history is
something that you can disable and say I
don't want to have location history used
as an input but all of these things are
purely private again only for you
they're stored on the content of the
photo or or associated with your account
only visible to you so we're definitely
trying to do a lot more here than and
we're going to continue to do more
because for us again it's it's really on
the foundation of building that trust
with our users so after playing with it
for a couple of weeks I'm convinced
Google photos is the best free solution
on the market for most people and I feel
that way because I trust Google with
those photos but if they were ever to
start selling the ads or try to sell me
products or services based on what they
were seeing in my photos well that trust
will go away in a hurry Google says that
they have no plans on doing that and I
hope to keep their word
but even if you decide Google photos
isn't for you it's important you start
thinking about the photos you're taking
on your thumb because if it falls into
the water or you'd lose it or it gets
stolen all those memories are gone and
they won't just be lost to you they'll
be lost to everybody else in your life
who might have enjoyed them so the time
has come to start thinking about this it
has never been cheaper it's never been
easier and it has never been more
important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
