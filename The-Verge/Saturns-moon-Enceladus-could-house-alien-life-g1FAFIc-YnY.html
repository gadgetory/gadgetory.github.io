out something pretty exciting coming
from Saturn's moon Enceladus turns out
hydrogen molecules are spewing out from
this icy snowball and while that might
not seem super interesting it's a huge
indicator that Enceladus could house
alien life Enceladus is already a big
favorite in the search for life
elsewhere in our solar system since the
moon is thought to harbor a vast liquid
ocean underneath its surface this ocean
water periodically erupts from Enceladus
in the form of geysers or plumes in
October of 2015
Cassini did a deep dive into one of
these plumes coming within 30 miles of
the moon's surface and when it did it
got a whiff of hydrogen molecules the
presence of hydrogen in the water is big
since it clinches this idea that there
are underwater hot springs on Enceladus
it's known as hydrothermal activity and
it happens when the chilly ocean mingles
with the piping hot rock on the sea
floor the same thing happens on earth
too they're called hydrothermal vents
and they form underwater along ridges or
cracks in the crust the heated mix of
water and rock leads to chemical
reactions that produce all kinds of hot
material that jet upward these reactions
can create a breeding ground for
microbes and many think that some of the
first forms of life popped up around
these kinds of vents hydrogen is
particularly enticing to since this
molecule is like candy for some deep-sea
microbes on earth some organisms around
hydrothermal vents munch on hydrogen
converting it to energy needed to live
so if hydrogen molecules are present on
Enceladus maybe similar kinds of
microbes are also munching on it which
could mean well before we get ahead of
ourselves
this finding does not actually mean we
found life on Enceladus so sorry no
aliens just yet plus there are a few
signs that indicate maybe life isn't
there
Cassini detected quite a bit of hydrogen
more than what would be expected if
microbes were eating it to survive so
it's possible that there's no one around
to eat this stuff or maybe the microbes
are there but something is key
the population from getting too big it's
possible there's an element missing that
these microbes need to really thrive
either way this is a huge finding from
Cassini and it ironically comes at a
time when the spacecraft is about to
meet its end in a couple weeks Cassini
is about to put itself into its final
few orbits around Saturn these will take
the spacecraft closer to the planet than
ever before but once those orbits are
done Cassini will then plunge into
Saturn and break apart but these latest
findings just mean that we need to send
something else to Enceladus Cassini
wasn't really designed to make the kind
of measurements it has regarding the
moon but now that we know all this info
perhaps it's time to send a probe to
Enceladus that's designed to sniff out
life I don't know what to say what do
you want to say
no eating we don't know</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
