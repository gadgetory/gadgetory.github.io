to curb crime in the big easy install a
citywide system of security cameras that
was six years ago now the camera system
is plagued with problems only a fraction
of the planned 1,000 cameras are up and
working and of those many actually
aren't working you'd think for about six
point six million dollars you'd get a
pretty good crime camera system they
work in many other cities to hold down
crime rates but here in New Orleans they
don't work and the reason seems to have
to do something with Louisiana politics
the majority of those 250 cameras are
not operational
we have four four cameras and they're
fairly high resolution so we have pretty
much coverage of all the sidewalks there
was also another armed robbery in our
driveway a couple of years ago and it
was about three women late at night I
guess around one o'clock and a car came
down the street and stopped and a man
got out with a gun and the two of the
women ran away from him but he grabbed
one of the women and ripped her purse
off of her we didn't really realize what
had happened until we saw a lot of
police out in the in our driveway so I
went out and told them I said well we
probably have this on on videotape so
they solve that crime practically
overnight
we recognize that you know a NOPD eighth
District here you know as a quite a job
but the stretch then often and they just
don't have enough you know foot soldiers
and so we thought that you know we got a
4,000 residents we can beat it we can be
part of their eyes too we can help them
save cams a program came about to help
from the French Quarter security task
force to help NOPD with location of
cameras that are throughout the French
Quarter in the 8th district i went from
canal street all the way up to Bourbon
Street looking at where the location of
all the cameras work and writing down
those locations the contact information
and stuff like that all the detectors
have iPads and what they do is there's a
link and they click on the link so if a
robbery occurs in the next block they
click on that location where they're at
and they can pull up and it'll show
it'll show dots of where all cameras are
in that area then they can click on that
particular dot in the area and see
contact information on the owner see
what what the best of time to get in
touch with the owner is and something in
some cases the cameras are actually
it'll tell them where the cameras are
pointing they'll know what footage
they'll be obtaining when they get the
camera
alright 7 case was a promise nest and
this happened is informed block of
bourbon street gentleman was with his
granddaughter went out to take some
photos he says Blackmill came from
behind snatch the phone i'll entertain
took off running he couldn't give us the
direction of flight we tried tracking
the video but it's just too many people
in Bourbon Street during that time we
always use the videos one of the first
things we look for and we're able to be
on the scene get real-time information
about who has video listening where it's
at and Larry and positive for their
tremendous job keeping it going in his
snow snowballing into a real success for
us thank God thank you I would hear them
say okay we got video of this crime and
we gave it to City Hall and we waited
for the media to come to pick it up and
they never came so I said a detective
why don't we put that on YouTube and he
said we've never done that before it he
had to call a chief's office to get
permission so once they did that and
they got several thousand responses
within the next week on that one they
said maybe we should try it again and
after it just become routine now
camera is not going to lie the camera
doesn't have to stand up in at the
courthouse and and basically testify
what you saw the cameras going to do it
for you knowing that you're going to
anywhere in the French Quarter you come
that you're going to be on video has
deterred a lot of crime you know I can't
say that positive that that is but we do
have a two percent reduction in violent
crime this year compared to last year
with less officers and you know it is
strategies that we put in place but it's
also the assistance of the camera
systems you know I had to say that I
believe that the knowing that you're
going to be on camera is you come to the
quarters as a big deterrent as far as
the young guys who out here hustling
they see the French Court as an easy
mark you know this is where I can go and
and they got sense enough to look at the
reports of the TV cameras to see that
these low resolution cameras that people
are invested in their homes don't really
identify anybody so you don't really
have to be that much afraid about being
caught on camera
I think a lot of tourists think this is
is real and it's safe and it's protected
and people are not going to carry guns
are not going to carry knives they're
not going to walk up from behind push
them to the side grab their iPhone and
run off you know block later people
recover and look up and they have no
idea who's committed the crime against
to me it's a security blanket you know
people want to believe that that this is
another crime prevention measure instead
of trying to solve this problem of
getting jobs for these kids raising up
the wages for their parents they decide
that what we will do will just arm
ourselves against these invaders I
believe that the cause of crime is the
great social distance between the poor
people and the rich people we can't
separate that from how bad is the
poverty situation in New Orleans has
thirty eight percent of the population
that lives below the poverty line sixty
percent of our children live below the
proper poverty line and I would say that
that is the nexus in which we can
discuss a whole question crime</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
