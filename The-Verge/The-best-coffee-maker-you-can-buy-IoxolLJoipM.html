keeps us happy it keeps us awake and on
those very rough mornings it keeps us
alive coffee only has two ingredients
water and coffee beans sounds simple
right well it's not one wrong turn
you're sipping black sludge too far in
the other direction and you're drinking
tepid rust water we found that for just
under two hundred dollars you can get a
machine that consistently produces a
quality fruit find the best coffee maker
we tried out a spectrum machines that
range from adorably petite odd
contraptions to full-size automatic rigs
but in terms of consistency quality and
simplicity
nothing beats a bonavita bv1800 goe
booth now there are a lot of coffee
machines out there and many of them come
with a full roster features so before I
tell you what it can do let's start with
what it can't Bonavena doesn't have a
built-in grinder so unlike the Breville
you brew it can't grande you beans it
has no automatic timer like you'd find
on the Cuisinart automatic coffee maker
so there won't be a cup of coffee
waiting for you when you get out of it
and it doesn't use a pod system meaning
there is a minimal amount of effort
required on your part but what you get
with the Bonavita is an elegant simple
machine in fact it only has one button
which makes it feel functional and
minimal I mean how many buttons is a
coffee machine really need Bonavita uses
1500 watt heaters heat the water to the
optimal 200 degrees Fahrenheit give or
take five degrees and has a wide
showerhead to douse the grounds evenly
and recreate a pour-over method after
machine has one special feature it's a
pre infusion mode that what's the coffee
before brewing in order to be gas it
it's thermal carafe keeps your coffee
hot for hours each pot we brewed with
the Bonavita
took about seven minutes we tap the
extensive network of coffee addicts and
our Vox media offices to sample our
briefs and the Bonavita consistently
produced a superior product it made a
cup of coffee that was neither watery
nor sludgy rich enough to get the job
done but not so strong that it would
knock you on your ass
the first batch we made on the machine
did have an acidic kick but it mailed it
out over later pops and the Bonavita is
cheaper than both the capresso coffee
tea mts and the Krups km 7000 to feature
heavy machines that
inferior coffee my favorite part of the
Bonavita was just how basic it was no
touch screens no dials no unnecessary
buttons just makes an excellent cup of
coffee now I have to admit that although
the Bonavita is the best option in terms
of price versus performance it didn't
actually make my favorite cup of coffee
during the trial that award goes to the
Chemex automatic in a sense the
automatic is even simpler than the
Buddha Vita it takes the wildly popular
glass can expand youa brewer and adds a
kettle and pour over system this setup
produced the best cup of coffee I tasted
there's a cost of nearly twice out of
the Bonavita it feels like a ripoff the
original Chemex cost about $50 so you're
paying roughly 300 dollars just to heat
water the plastic componentry feels
cheap and it the tracks from the Chemex
is original design so if you want to buy
a chem X just buy the basic one and
spend the rest of the money on beans
what's in here is that with coffee less
is more
adding features contraptions and options
muddies the concept and maybe your
coffee to doing anything before you've
had coffee in the morning to be rough no
one wants to get lost in features and
options and menus before you've had your
first cup so do yourself a favor and get
the Bonavita your 7 a.m. self will thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
