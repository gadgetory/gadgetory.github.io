CES 2016 and Samsung will give us a
preview of a pair of new laptops this is
their new book 9 series which slots in
under the pro series of laptops Windows
10 is what it's running but the most
impressive thing here is how thin and
light these are very much like LG's
Graham which was a laptop series
introduced last year these are all about
the weight
the 13.3 inch laptop weighs not point
eighty four kilograms the 15-inch laptop
weighs just under 1.3 kilograms which
for Americans is one point eight four
pounds and two point eight five pounds
and I just makes them just featherlite's
seriously for a laptop this is
ridiculous it's basically like having a
tablet another cool thing is the ports
on these the 15-inch laptop comes with a
new USBC port on it 13 inch lacks it but
that's really the only difference both
of 1080p displays both can have up to an
Intel Core i7 processor they're running
on skylake models they have fans and
vents on the back but the you know quite
subtle performance seems to be quite
smooth and fluid you can get up to 8
gigabytes of RAM on each of these so it
pretty much gives you everything you
want from windows laptop and just makes
it extremely light and extremely thin
the only trade-off that might be an
issue here is battery life one of the
demo units here actually ran out of
battery life while I was being
demonstrated so we don't know exactly
how long these would last but in terms
of looks weight and ergonomics they look
like great new introduction from Samsung
so for more videos like this from CES
2016 go ahead and join us on the verge
comm or on our youtube channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
