uninspiring box that sits to your desk
Apple's iMac showed that desktop
computers could be beautiful too and
have been some Windows machines that
have gotten close but now Microsoft is
trying its own hand a desktop PC and
it's the wildly different surface to do
this PC sits on a desk looking pretty
just like an iMac but the surface studio
doesn't just sit still
this beautiful 28 inch display
transforms into a drawing board with
just a push it's all part of the fancy
hinge that let's display flow you can
draw on it from any position or touch
the display to interact with apps just
like you do with a tablet in fact it
really feels like a giant tablet you can
draw and it's exactly what the surface
studio is designed for you could combine
that natural drawing mode of a new
accessory the $99 surface dial it's
funky and it looks like a volume knob on
an old-school radio but it's a useful
tool to use while you're drawing there's
something really futuristic about it but
it really jumps into outerspace when you
stick it on the screen you can tap on
the top crank the dial around or tap and
hold to access menus and controls in
absolute sketch Abul the surface dial
creates a radial menu it's used to alter
various inking controls it feels oddly
natural to use it while you're drawing
and I found myself tweaking the brush
size and colors a lot the only
disappointing part of the dial is the
lack of app support there's nearly 20
apps that support it right now but the
controls are really limited to just zoom
functions in several of them I'd also
like to see Microsoft improve the base
of the dial so it sticks to the display
better even at the near flat angle is
slowly creep down and display on a model
I was testing aside from the studio's
creative assets is a PC at heart the
stunning 28 inch display is truly one of
the best monitors I've ever used even
though it's glossy and slightly
reflective it's just 13 millimeters thin
and it has a beyond 4k resolution that
really makes what you see on the screen
fill lifelike there's even a free by
2-bit ratio just like the surface pro
and surface book and I love the vertical
space to read articles or write
documents overall it just feels really
good when you tilt on pull the display
towards you you can see every detail in
photos documents and videos underneath
the display is where all the PC
components are housed on the model I was
testing there's a sixth generation quad
or intel core i7 processor 32 gig of ram
a 2 terabyte rapid hybrid drive an
nvidia gtx 980m graphics card that's
actually a lot of old tech for such a
futuristic looking PC
it means Microsoft has opted for last
year's Intel chips last year's in video
chips and no full solid-state disk
despite this it was still very capable
italic coped well with games like Gears
of War 4 or Forza horizon free you're
not going to be able to play either on
the top settings but they're perfectly
playable on the studio if you don't care
about maxing out all the details having
all that power at the Bates means system
compromises with the surface studio all
the ports are at the rear which means
it's hard to access them if you have the
studio placed against the wall the PC
aspects of this surface studio are
exactly what you'd expect from a Windows
all-in-one and is very little to fall
here the questions I have around it are
based on its price and use cases at
starting price of $3,000 is up there
with Wacom Cintiq but for that extra
$200 you're getting a full PC and not
just a monitor for creatives that's a
tempting offer but you're really buying
the surface judo because of its display
it's stunning and there's nothing quite
like it on the market right now that has
the same aspect ratio touch and pen all
are being almost pixel perfect and super
thin it's an engineering marvel of a
monitor but I really wish Mike's was
sold it separately because I want to
dock my surface book to it and if I'm
investing in a desktop PC I really want
to be able to upgrade it and use it for
gaming a more powerful work I can't do
either of those things with the surface
studio that doesn't discount what
Microsoft has attempted to do here it's
truly something unique and a hint of
exciting innovation we haven't seen for
some years but it has a small target
market that will need to weigh up
whether this beautiful set of floating
pixels is worth the high price
probably be cooler if it wasn't getting
them tea stains the shot too though
