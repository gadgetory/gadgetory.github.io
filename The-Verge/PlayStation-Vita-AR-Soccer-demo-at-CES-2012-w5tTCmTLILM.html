Entertainment i'm a senior managing our
international software development
department and we're going to be talking
a little bit about the AR play which is
going to be bundled in with the
playstation vita day one so every vita
you nurse user is going to get six of
these cards so all numbered 1 through 6
1 2 3 4 5 6 and this is going to be our
common vocabulary for a our experiences
on the vita moving forward day 1 we're
going to have three titles that are
going to be available free it's all vita
uterine users on the PlayStation Store
three titles are going to be table
soccer which I'm going to show you a
little bit cliff diving and also
fireworks which is a bit of an a homage
to fan a vision which was a playstation
2 launch title so why six cards well
with six cards were able to explore new
technology we developed called wide area
augmented reality or for short war now
war is not possible without the strength
and the power of the playstation vita so
what i'll do is i'll go ahead and show
you a very simple experience with a
table soccer and we can see how it works
so let me go ahead and get this started
i'm going to know table soccer you can
actually play both single-player and
multiplayer so you play ad hoc or
infrastructure with two players but it's
one set of AR cards you just get
slightly different perspectives on the
AR playing field so i'm gonna play solo
i'm going to go ahead and select my
teams I'm gonna play as Argentina and
I'm going to play against the soccer
powerhouse that is the USA so go ahead
and get that started all right and here
we go so right now I have an empty table
but you need a playing field to be able
to play soccer so I'm going to take
cards numbered 1 through 3 and go ahead
create playing field so there's one
there's two and there's three as you can
see the fetal renders immediately this a
goal I can zoom in I can zoom out and it
keeps the perspective because it because
the war technology understands you know
where these cards are within relative
space of one another now you can plan a
very very small playing field
in group 2 cards Marik closer together
or since we have a very large table
we're playing on if I want to I can I
can push the cards out a bit and I can
expand the playing field and the beauty
will go ahead and adjust as necessary
but let's go ahead and reduce the size
of the playing field just to keep it
nice and tight and clean so playing
field if I want I can go ahead and start
playing the game right now but let's
give it a little bit more pizzazz let's
go ahead and add a couple grand stands
because you know we have some fans of
both these teams so let's go ahead and
do the the home grandstands and let's
now is put the visitors grand stands out
there and there we are so we have our
fans there they are clapping and
cheering for their favorite football
team but you know playing soccer you
obviously need a scoreboard because
otherwise what's the point so let's go
ahead and put one out there as well and
lo behold we have our scoreboard now if
i want i can move this stuff around i
can angle the stands however I see fit
if I want to push the scoreboard way
back I can do that and the deal will
respond immediately but let's go ahead
and get started so um so table soccer is
a very very simple turn-based experience
you get four turns passing play so I'm
going to take i'm going to play against
computer right now so i'm going to see
if i can angle my men around there's a
couple different things i can do i can
try to pass directly to them or i can
try to lob it over the top of this
defender just with a quick flicking
motion and i was able to do it and now
i'm going to take it aww offsides so of
course he's not a very good soccer
player but why he was able to steal the
ball so let's go ahead and put him out
there let's see if we can pass directly
to him off out of bounds I said the PSP
Go is powerful it is my hogs not very
powerful player and oh it's on a goalie
missed but the nice thing about this he
was really interesting is if you do
score a goal which i can guarantee i'm
not going to be able to do you get a
replay so it takes you out of the AR
space and puts you into a more
traditional soccer field setting and
then it puts you back in AR the NR space
as you can as you can see is it it's
really well ok so i'll see if i can i'll
see if i can let the let these guys
the game uh the parent think they are I
actually didn't play I didn't play
soccer growing up as a kid I was more of
an American football player so I wasn't
very good at that either unfortunate
that's why I'm making video games so
let's see if I can pass to that guy and
I'll take a shot on goal hey score hey
all right look at this ere we go go like
that and tada fireworks and and I'm sure
the if you had sound the crowd would be
a going wild okay so that's stable
soccer very simple very fun bite-sized
experience and you can expect a lot more
of these small a our experiences in the
future coming to PlayStation</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
