are spectacles version 2.0 now if you
followed spectacles history you know
it's been a little bit rocky snap wound
up writing down more than 42 million
dollars because it made more of these
that make it sell and even worse from
snaps perspective is that people who
bought spectacles didn't really use them
for very long according to a report less
than 50% of people who bought these were
still using them a month later so why is
snap trying again well they think
they've managed to solve customers
biggest complaints about version one
that they were too bulky that it was too
hard to transfer videos from the glasses
to your phone and that they couldn't
take photos here is version one and you
can see that this is just a heavier
version of spectacles the piece where
the arm meets the lens has a really kind
of bulky piece where all of the
internals of the camera are located and
here I have version two and as soon as
you pick it up you notice the difference
in weight that piece where all the
internals of the cameras are located it
is much smaller and it just generally
feels lighter when you put them on your
face even with all the miniaturization
that snap did for this version of
spectacles battery life is about to save
70 video snaps with even more snaps if
you're taking photos and the case is
much smaller this time around - so here
I have the case for version 1 and here's
the case for room 2 lot smaller a lot
lighter and if you have a big pocket
this version probably actually fits in
it spectacles still work the same in
this case actually is how you charged
your respect it also just by resting the
glasses inside it has a little contact
point here where it charges your glasses
up to four times on a single charge of
the case and to figure out how much
battery life you have left get us double
tap on the lens and they'll show you by
how many lights
go around the circle the reporting works
the same as well you have a big button
on top you tap it it reports 10 seconds
of a snap if you want to extend your
snap you can tap it two more times for a
snap that's up to 30 seconds long the
new feature this time around though is
photo mode so the first version only
took video this version takes photos to
do that all you do is press down for a
second wait for the blink and then
release your finger you've taken a
high-definition photo and I should say
something about definition to last time
around you have the option of shooting
in standard definition this time around
both your photos and videos will all be
shot in HD pixel density is about 25%
greater than it was in version ones of
course a signature feature of spectacles
was that it shot videos in a circular
format and as you would move your phone
around you could shift the perspective
as you were looking that returns this
time around for both photos and videos
and so when you go to export them you'll
see that all of your photos and videos
have a little white border around them
another nice feature of version 2 is
that these things are water-resistant so
you can jump into a pool jump into the
ocean and not worry that they're gonna
break and the case is splash proof so
you can go ahead and bring that to the
pool and just not worry about it
snapchat has also worked on the transfer
process if you own version one you know
the worst thing about them was how long
it took to get your snaps from your
glasses on to your phone snaps worked on
the transfer technology and it now says
that the transfer is three to four times
faster than it was originally the basic
method for doing it is still the same
after you pair your spectacles you go
into memories where your old snaps are
stored tap an import button then your
phone has to join a Wi-Fi network set up
by spectacles and only then will the
snaps transfer from the glasses on to
your phone it goes a little bit faster
than that makes it sound but it's
definitely not painless my dream version
of spectacles would transfer
automatically these spectacles just
aren't there yet
I was a fan of the original spectacles
even though they didn't sell that well
but it's also true that I didn't use
mine for very long after the first month
that I bought them are these gonna be
any different well I don't know on one
hand they look really good I like some
of the design details here there's this
kind of tapering color where it moves
from black and to clear as you move down
the the length of the arm there are two
microphones in this version which means
that there will be less wind noise if
you're recording outdoors and frankly
they just look like designer sunglasses
which they should be they cost a hundred
and fifty dollars that's 20 more dollars
than they cost last time also if you use
prescription or polarized lenses and you
live in the United States when you go to
buy your spectacles on spectacles calm
you can specify that you want those
lenses and snapshots working with a
third-party provider to let you get
those lenses put directly into your
spectacles when they ship to your house
so on the other hand I'm not sure this
is the product that's gonna launch snap
all the way into the mainstream this is
a really nice refinement / version one
but if you're not a heavy user of
snapchat it's not immediately clear to
me why you would rush out and buy them
still I think Snap is smart to bet on
hardware its competitors like to copy
every single thing it does and if Snap
wants to stay relevant it has to be
different
say what you will about spectacles
there's nothing else like them hey guys
