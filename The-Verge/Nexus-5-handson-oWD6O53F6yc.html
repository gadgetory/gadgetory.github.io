the gist announced Nexus 5 from Google
it is 349 and available today unlocked
off contract as you can see it has a big
huge bright 1080p screen and it's
running Android 4.4 KitKat which has a
few improvements
number one you can swipe right over to
Google now you can also just say ok
Google and it'll launch Google now it
has a Snapdragon 800 processor so it
does scream although scrolling
performance is still a little bit laggy
like it tends to be on all Android
devices it's relatively thin and it only
weighs 130 grams so it actually feels
lighter than the Nexus 4 the back is
this nice soft touch plastic Google
calls it silky I call it pretty good and
there is an 8 megapixel camera with
optical image stabilization so that
should help it take better shots it has
a hdr+ which does a better HDR shots
we'll see how it goes usually Android
cameras aren't that impressive the
buttons are made of ceramic for whatever
that's worth and the bezels on the side
of the screen are very very thin so it's
actually relatively comfortable to hold
in the hand despite the massive screen
we're gonna have a lot more with the
Nexus 5 soon but for now it's just a
quick look
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
