well his will did it happen while Wade
didn't have any flex your phone LG
didn't have any flagship phone they just
rebranded their old flagship phone HTC
motorola no flagship phones but still
Samsung wants the galaxy s 9 and s 9
plus which was really widely anticipated
at the same time they left people quite
a bit disappointed these are the first
Samsung phones since the iPhone 10 we're
kind of looking for something a bit more
aggressive from Samsung Debbie said even
though the design is quite similar to
the previous one the finger princess has
moved to the middle samsung has made
hardware upgrades as the latest chip it
has a new camera really cool camera as
do aperture uncool Samsung's AR emoji
they're terrible
they're disturbing nobody really likes
them I don't know what was happening
there with Samsung also on the flagship
front sony has the exterior exit to an
exit to compact to me personally they
look like HTC u11 phones they have round
the glass back they have a fingerprint
sensor in the middle in the back that's
a new thing for Sony also running
Snapdragon age 45 which the Galaxy S 9
will do as well and sony has a little
advantage over Samson Samson just
introduced super slow-mo 720p in the s9
sony has super slow-mo at 1080p
several major flagships one of Vic
stories here is Android go
Alcatel zeti nokia Micromax lava
there's a whole bunch of companies were
launching super cheap super affordable
Android phones and the idea there I mean
we're talking about price like $49 in
sub $100 prices is improving the entry
level Android experience also from Nokia
they do have a new flagship Nokia H to
Rocco but the more interesting one the
one has captured more imaginations is a
Nokia 81 10 you might know the name
already because the retro moto it's a
throwback to Nokia's matrix phone so the
one that has a physical curve and it has
a slider at the bottom also cool about
the 801 10 it has LTE it actually has
Google assistant and it is under $100 so
it's pretty kick-ass phone and you can
place a cronic chooses really major
themes here at MWC 2018 have been cloudy
and
they are absolutely the buzzwords for
this show fudgie is kind of like the
messiah like if you if you want a
religious figure for technology that's
what 5g is is the promise of the future
nothing is really happening with it
right now there are no phones no tablets
that you can buy with 5g companies are
showing off prototypes but we can't
really see anything and Franchi also
goes into like enterprise applications
we have connected cars and all these
things which are kind of a few years
down the line s to AI it feels like
something that companies are just kind
of tucking onto their products without
really thinking about it too much
hey SUSE I have to say it's guiltiest of
this they claim they have AI boost AI
camera AI photo learning they even had
an AI ringtone it's getting ridiculous
there nobody's doing all that much that
can really be described as artificial
intelligence but it's a buzzword that
everybody's kind of tacking onto and
trying to sell products with as you
smartphone hardware one of the big
differences this year relatives are lost
is that pretty much every new smartphone
especially the Android side especially
the high spec has very thin bezels I
love the fact that bezels is kind of
dying everywhere that you look nowadays
the bad side of that though a whole
bunch of companies are copying the Apple
not the Apple not on the iPhone 10 is
justified by having face ID which is
super sophisticated biometric
identification system nobody else is
doing anything near that they're just
copying the not a superficial it's
cosmetic not a fan of that trend so even
though it's not a retail product the
vivo apex is one of the highlights here
at MBC 2018
this has practically no bezels even thin
on bezels around the display and whether
the company achieves it is it integrates
the selfie cam inside the body which
pops up from above the screen anytime
you can get that sort of mechanical
engineering built into a smartphone
people going to get hyped up about it
that being said viewer has also evolved
the fingerprint ID system that had built
into the display and showed up at CES
2018 in this new concept that covers the
lower third of the phone's display and
finally even though MWC is traditionally
a function while we Lenovo
really cool laptop so show up while we
introduce the mais book X Pro which is
another one of those super thin high
spec Windows laptops that you've seen
everywhere but this one has extra extra
thin bezels it has something like a 90
percent screen to body ratio as a free
by 2 aspect ratio so actually it's a bit
more square than most laptop screens
which I really like is great for writing
on and also has a hidden webcam which is
a little mechanical button which pops up
from just above the keyboard so cool in
terms of design but might not be the
best in terms of creating flattering
selfies as the lenovo it introduced some
new Chromebooks which aren't pretty but
they also want expensive and they're
terrific for taking notes on them one of
them you can take notes with just a
regular pencil and the other one it has
a lag free stylus I tried it myself and
uses one of Google's Chrome OS api's and
it's super it's just a great experience
for taking notes and both of those are
under $300 it seems like this year many
of the big Android companies just
weren't ready to merge the flagship
phones here at MWC that's left us with a
different show there's less of the usual
Hardware height fewer headphone jacks
more AI blaster and more notches</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
