$249 Android wear device and in general
it's basically the same as every other
Android wear device it offers all the
same things you can get from a
SmartWatch you can get notifications
from your phone you can do basic things
like get directions or set alarms or set
reminders you can do all the things you
expect to do with the SmartWatch
including you know tell the time but the
thing about the SmartWatch 3 is that
it's really geared towards fitness and
that means a couple of things one that
it's made of rubber it has these
interchangeable straps that go all the
way around the square piece that has a
screen all the guts of the SmartWatch on
it you can change the colors or straps
whenever you want to it's also
waterproof and designed to be sweat on
and beat up if you want there's a new
version with the stainless steel band
that looks a little bit nicer but it's
still nowhere near as handsome or
elegant as a competition for Motorola or
even LG the most unique feature about
the SmartWatch 3 is that it has GPS
built in so because Android wear lets
you sync music offline that means you
can take your watch with you when you go
running and not worry about bringing
your phone with you you'll get your
location your speed everything and we'll
all sync back later all which would be
great except that the problem right now
is that not a lot of apps support GPS
otherwise though this has all the
strengths and weaknesses of pretty much
every other Android wear device it's
battery life isn't very good it has a
small screen that isn't very good and it
doesn't look very good either
Android wear devices are getting better
really fast and they're actually a lot
more interesting now than they were a
month or even just a couple of months
ago but this is still very much a niche
thing and it feels like the beginning
for smartwatches and even though this is
Sony's third SmartWatch it still feels
like a first try</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
