with Steven loo from j5 creates and he's
showing us the company's brand new
Android to Windows 7 connecting cables
so can you take it away yes definitely
whatever do is that this cable can
charge up your phone and linked up from
your phone whatever you see on your
phone you also see another computer you
can use this compute a ball to send text
message as we have right now we actually
can do it demo right now and it only
counts in then you will reflect on the
screen shows that there we go
this is Steven and we have a meeting
right now
yeah and the best part is that you can
actually see whatever something is what
is all on my phone so this case of
screen mirroring everything that's on
the phone is in the laptop as well yes
that is correct
all right and what sort of bandwidth do
you have with your cable there's kind of
been with right now we're looking at
anywhere phone right now at this time is
about two three frames per second the
videos we are we don't have that kind of
refresh rate yet now when the phone when
we can work within it vo let's say send
it to a manufacturer we can open up the
enjoy codes we can actually open up that
capability it can be done but right now
like I said the most important part is a
prototype and this is only compatible
with Windows for now at this time but
Mac is coming up in the future this
potential this potential Mac can you
give us any indication on price and
release date no not yet
we are still trying to work with the
couple of cell phone makers that way we
can work together and potentially even
package with their cell phone box so we
can replace the current generation of
just a micro USB cable with it with our
particular cable
