we're checking out the new Samsung gear
s2 this is the latest SmartWatch from
Samsung it's running Samsung's
proprietary software platform however as
a new feature this year it not only
works with Samsung smartphones but it
should work with most Android
smartphones that run Android 4.4 or
higher which is a new thing so it really
opens up these devices to a lot more
people that might be interested in them
as far as what you're seeing here this
is the standard s2 it's kind of like the
sport model it's got a 42 millimeter
face here it's a metal body and then
what they're calling elastomer rubber
strap here standard clasp at the bottom
underneath you've got things like the
heartrate monitor activity tracking
things like that this is a proprietary
strap mounting system but it is possible
to remove these straps and Samsung says
that third-party manufacturers will also
be manufacturing straps for it this
particular one is silver with the white
strap simpson will also be offering a
darker model with a black strap of
course what's really unique here is this
rotating bezel which is how you do a lot
of interactions with the watch now it
still has a touch screen you can still
tap into things and see more information
and scroll and things like that but a
lot of what you can do there you can
also do the scrolling on the wheel which
is pretty cool since it keeps your
fingers off of the screen and it's got a
basic back button and a home button you
can see the app launcher here various
apps and available Samsung says that
about thousand apps will be available at
launch and a hundred of those have been
developed in hand-in-hand with Samsung
so there's all kinds of things like uber
and weather and you can also customize
between different 26 different watch
faces ranging from digital to analog to
different various design or styles and
one of the new things is the new what
they're calling dynamic watch faces
which bring different information to the
fore so you can have things like your
Twitter feed right on your watch or
different news or things like that you
can also of course access your
notifications you can reply to messages
with your voice or we can responses
Samsung's also offering a t9 style
keyboard so you can type different
responses as well in addition to the
standard s2 there's another model called
the s2 classic which is a little bit of
a dressier design it's got a slightly
different bezel here with the knurled
grip on it it's a darker model it comes
with a black leather strap as opposed to
the rubber and it's a standard 20
millimeter strap here so you can easily
swap it for a different one the face is
40 millimeters so it's a little bit
smaller but it really doesn't look too
much different all the other features
are pretty much the same got your
circular ring here to control the
interface as well as the touch screen
all of the same apps are available as
well
Samsung isn't saying when the new watch
will be available or exactly how much
they'll cost they expect to have that
information fairly soon there's a quick
look at the gear s2 and the gear s2
classic on samsung</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
