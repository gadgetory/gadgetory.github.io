that it has the best camera that you can
get on a smartphone today but when it
shipped it didn't have one of the key
features that Google was talking about
it's called night sight it lets you take
photos that normally would look like
this and it turns them into photos that
look like this
you get photos that would be otherwise
impossible now that sample photo was
taken with an early leaked beta version
of the night sight software but the
official version is out now in an
upgrade for pixel phone owners and I
want to go out and take some more photos
but before I do I know that my friend
and colleague Vlad Sabbath has been
testing it and I want him to give me a
few pointers so let's talk to Vlad hey
blad hello so can you just tell me how
this thing actually works now how it
works is you have the AC up plus system
which makes the Google pixel camera of
what it is nice site takes that and
expands it over this period of a few
seconds to get you more light in
situations where you basically have
almost none so that means up to 15
frames or up to 6 seconds but this is
really complicated because Google
combines a whole bunch of information so
first of all when you meet to ring the
lights around you usually have the
static photo what Google does is motion
metering so it actually takes into
account the movement of the phone in
your hand if there's any handshake takes
to account the movement of the scene
around it and then it does the usual
static calculation of how much light is
hittin the sensor right so the whole
idea is you can take something like a
long exposure like a 6 second exposure
but Google segments it across frames
I think recombines alright so it's
getting dark I'm gonna head outside but
before I do any tips any tricks things I
should avoid whether I try this thing
out yeah the main tip is to actually
find genuinely dark areas so this mode
is really designed for nights and dark
scenes it would improve the quality of
the photo when it has lighting sure but
for you to be really blown away by it
for you to get the most out of it fine
nights actual night alright well we'll
see we can find I mean we're in the city
here but there's a lot of haze so I
guess we'll see
so the funny thing is the pixel camera
is so good that even this light I'm in
right now is almost too much to show off
night sight but if I take a photo here
and then I can go to a naval night sight
and then take another photo the whole
bottom of the photo is basically black
but if I look at the results you could
see that the night sight did pick up a
bunch of the green that wasn't available
there before but really what we need to
do is go someplace way darker because we
got to show this thing off so there's a
ferry pulling in so we'll take a shot
with a regular camera I'll go to night
sight and it is moving but we'll try it
anyway so I'll hold still and we can see
in the night sight mode you get the
foreground actually coming in you get
the boat all nice and lit and then on
the non night sight all that foreground
is lost the boat looks fine and it's
more than what my eye sees so this is
like a little bit unnatural but it is
like kind of interesting but it's able
to pull that off and I actually prefer
the shot quite a bit like that boat is
moving but it managed to maintain some
detail on it nonetheless alright it's
the next day we're back in the studio I
just want to show you a few more of the
photos that we took because I mean look
at these they're just filthy filthy
filthy good I mean they're really good
they're the kind of stuff you wouldn't
ever be able to get otherwise also Vlad
took a bunch of photos so let's take a
look at what he got this he illustrates
the basic use of Google's nice site you
have very little light it's nowhere in
the frame and as far as human I can tell
all you really have are the outline of
the bin and the bench with Nightside
turned on you get so much more detail
you get actual color of the leaves on
the ground and on the trees and you
actually have a usable photo
so here's an example of a shot where
Google's nice said it's not actually
particularly good for it's a nice shot
but it's really well lit and there's a
moving object in the frame no matter how
sophisticated google system is even with
all the boats pool exposures and
chopping things up into frames moving
objects will get
in these situations the only benefit in
this show if you look really closely is
the reduction of noise in the dog
sections of the sky when I first
reviewed the pixel 3 I was really
worried that all of the features that
Google is adding would turn out to just
be gimmicks that I wouldn't use but that
didn't really try to be the case I use
them a lot now and I think that the same
thing is gonna be the case with nitesite
and I actually asked Vlad about that
yesterday but as far as I'm concerned
it's not a mode it's almost having an
entire new camera in there I mean we've
seen things like tick so the guys who do
the camera benchmarks data an attachment
for the iPhone which cost hundreds of
dollars and it did basically the same
thing the knife photography improved my
photography Google's light side does
that exact same thing but just does it
free software I think that's exactly
right this night mode thing it really is
like having a weird extra single purpose
camera in your pocket at all times
you're not gonna use it every day but
when you need it it's going to be there
and it's gonna work way better than you
expect and I think it's kind of amazing
and what's most amazing to me is this is
year three of the pixel and if they're
pulling this off right now I cannot wait
to see what they're gonna do with the
main camera software next year everybody
thank you so much for watching and I
want to know if you had this mode on
your phone what kind of pictures did you
try and take with it what kind of stuff
haven't you been able to get before let
me know in the comments and then head
over vert science because they have a
dope video about supersonic air travel
it might be coming back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
