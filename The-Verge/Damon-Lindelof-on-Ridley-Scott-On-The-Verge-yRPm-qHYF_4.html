actually the seeds are from Ridley
directly absolutely because a aside from
its relationship to the original alien
which is a question iterations of that
question are the things that I've been
asked about the most I'm looking forward
to it at the end of the day when you're
working with Ridley Scott it's not about
me coming in and saying hey Ridley I've
got this great idea do you want to
direct it it's about him saying I want
to direct a movie in this universe
here's what I want it to be about who
are the ideas that excite me here are
the thematics that I'm interested in and
here are the character traits that I
want to demonstrate and it's it's it not
to reduce the process of screenwriting
but I feel like in film which is much
different than what i did in TV it is a
little bit like mad libs where my job is
essentially you know really saying
adjective noun you know euphemism and
that's how the movie was made yeah
that's a and that exactly I'm sure he'll
be excited when to hear that you
describe the doing thinking processes
mad libs</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
