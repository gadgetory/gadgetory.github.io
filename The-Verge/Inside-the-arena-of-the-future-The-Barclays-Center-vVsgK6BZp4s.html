Sports tech tech sports and we're here
this morning because this is the great
unveiling of the Barclays Center home of
the Brooklyn Nets they're saying it's
the most hi-tech stadium in sports we're
actually standing in front of a wild
piece of technology it's called the
oculus it is a 360-degree LED sign it's
HD they can show movies on it they're
gonna have audio out here inside there's
even more high-tech stuff this free
Wi-Fi which is choice and there's just

some trouble yeah till we can get up -
all right we are finally here to
celebrate the grand opening of the
Barclays Center Arena Brooklyn has
arrived as a center of exciting
entertainment thrilling big-time sports
and thriving commerce Barclays Center
Arena is so much more just a building we
are the most technologically advanced
arena to date we're standing in front of
the Daktronics center hung six
millimeter true HD center hung and then
you can see all the other Daktronics
ribbon boards we have almost 8,000
square feet of LED in here as well as
the sound system you see the speaker
raised and the lighting here is going to
be like no other venue that you've ever
seen before
Wow so how fast your Wi-Fi can be is
even better than LTE we're seeing we're
up to 2 1 gig surface we're bringing in
optimum light paths as our sponsor so
we're in 2 one gig circuits is active
active and it has BGP failover which
means you know one of them drops the
other one picks up right away are there
any other sort of interesting add-ons
for a fan perspective technology wise
that you can talk about so we're
focusing on the Barclay center app we're
gonna do working with a company called
bypass lane to order your food on the
app and then go and pick it up like easy
pass when you go through and drive
through the easy pest free Wi-Fi you
know as much as many fans as possible on
the run outside - absolutely you can get
it out

archive absolutely absolutely

closer you feel free to go anywhere Wow
people are gonna come here they're gonna
sit outside and bitch or I'm your wife
yeah but what I don't want them to do is
like yes I know I'm one of those guys
I'm kidding I don't know so what's the
coolest thing that you've seen so far
that's a blaring obviously the ocular
right out there hole led set they have
their I think the lighting for the games
will be very unique
this is my partner new life from the
verge she's from our tech site is there

fun do that incoming phone a Samsung
Galaxy s4 laughs in an app Scott 300
mascots lose more water vision water

huh at everything inside the van you all
all the canvases everything that lights
up is controlled from this room up here
no so I'm pretty sure if I hit this
button right now that that Center hyung
goes off so this is the this is the
video production room Logan is the the
director of facilities presentation here
at the Barclays center you know he works
on a lot of the content here but he's
responsible for this for everything
inside this room the only question I got
from from Bruce Ratner from my boss was
he walks over his iphones like where can
i plug this in it's like you have a
place you can plug this in and have the
musical everywhere yeah yes we do really
recent iPod doctor there's an iPod dock
for for the entire arena yeah so what I
do for the guys that put call me maybe
on repeat all the time and they love
until they get all their work Hey what

you it's it's actually very new to me as
well because it's just showed up
yesterday I was amazing
we basically this is our in-house
lighting system is this make everything
go faster
looks like I could get beamed somewhere
yeah so can we press all the buttons can
I just go like this
right now what would happen yeah I could
dream anything happens you know you can
control every led in the entire bowl if
you just press this button do it I don't
want to know what that is awesome well
