ross miller i'm chris sigler and today
on the show we're going to be talking
about all the things apple just
announced at spring-ford event later on
Casey Newton will be joining us from San
Francisco with first-hand impressions
okay so what all did we actually see
today well first we started with a sort
of surprise HBO announcement they'll be
launching HBO now they're calling it
next month exclusive to Apple at launch
then they went through an all new
macbook just macbook nas bro not air
just macbook and then finally we got
into some apple watch stuff yep and I
that's what I want talk about the most
but first let's just really quickly get
through apple TV yeah fifty-nine dollars
now sixteen dollars actually surprised
price drop which makes sense because
every other set-top box does everything
that thing does know yeah they're
they're at the point where the hardware
is old enough and the functionality is
commoditized enough so that they really
had no option but to drop the price a
little surprising that they didn't
follow it up with another box that maybe
has a little bit more functionality 4k
whatnot but I guess they're not ready
yet yeah that's maybe something later
this fall I mean the apple cherry rumors
of be its set-top box or actual set
itself has always been around but there
is something missed remembered forever
which is content deals mm-hmm which is
Apple's trying to talk to every single
content provider to get exclusive deals
is right first of that right and also is
a big deal because everyone wants
standalone HBO right and so this is I
mean we knew that HBO was was unbundling
right this was in the pipeline I was
going to be a 2015 thing for them but it
is surprising that it's an apple
exclusive to start that's a big deal but
I what's your take I think that you're
more plugged in Game of Thrones averse
than I am what is your take on I am
going back and forth so hard because I
don't want to pay for cable yeah but the
things are starting to add up for a
right fifteen dollars by itself like I'm
just being kind of a stubborn prick at
that point like yeah i did get sling TV
recently so use that for everything
basically except HBO and broadcast ms
yeah
but oh so that doesn't have ABC CBS no
but I'd like rabbit ears I beat in
dollars or ravisher everyone complains
about that anyway but uh will I pay 15
notes for a Geo maybe actually yeah but
I I know in my head is sort of add up to
even be more expensive than just getting
a damn cables ryan right well so one
thing that that I saw brought up on
Twitter that I think is potentially an
interesting point is that the existence
of this service incentivizes HBO to
start cracking down on the distribution
of HBO Go logins right that's the other
reason while I'm probably end up paying
dues right now I'm enjoying the hell out
of it fer ya know everybody uses
somebody else re 99 yeah there's like
one patient zero that has the master HBO
Go account and everybody is using that
one account and now presumably they're
going to crack down they're gonna log in
like the day before the game with Rose
repairs like I'm sorry caution by the
way rice is being used by 1253 people
we're going to have to pair that bag get
a new account guy so uh yeah it paired
with that they also showed the the
trailer for the new season of Game of
Thrones and we've seen a bunch of clips
of that before we won't dawdle on that
too much here but uh yeah well it's
exciting it might be a slight departure
from the books which is kind of
interesting but also Game of Thrones is
the number one most pirated show now
there's an option people like you know
to you you can actually legally pay for
it yeah it's expensive right you can't
use oh I'm I don't be tied to cable
subscription as an excuse anymore but
you do still need a an Apple device of
some sort whether it be an apple TV or
an iPhone or an iPad because it if i
remember correctly they they said on
stage that uh this is going to not just
be an apple TV thing you'll be able to
use any Apple device basically well I
didn't I remember hear that but I hope
to god us true because like that would
seem very stupid otherwise yeah I I have
to believe that they love an HBO now app
for iphone ride you know so and so
that's the first of many and like
obviously like HBO is one of the biggest
cable channels out there on ESPN with
next big one ESP was a big deal for
sling and that was on there will be
interested ESPN kind of follow through
or any other channels well suit
obviously apple is hawkish on getting
exclusive content deals whether or not
they're just a box or just tea because
this is the one thing that really
differentiates Apple TV from your Roku's
and your Amazon's right right did I hear
correctly do we have do we have KC ready
I
leave we do want we go alive decay
seedings in San Francisco Casey how are
you go you're so pretty Casey Newton
hello hi guys how's it going man hi guys
how's it going good good so tell us what
what's it like out there what's the
scene so as you might imagine it is
rather hectic inside the hands-on area
right now people are checking out the
macbook that they just unveiled as well
as taking a look at the Apple watch up
close heading into this event I think
most of us assume that the watch was
going to be the most exciting thing to
look at afterwards but man people just
cannot wait to get their hands on that
new MacBook it looks really really good
is it as interesting of a device as it
appeared to be from afar I guess maybe
you haven't gotten close to it yet but
from where I was sitting it looked like
really the most interesting announcement
of the of the event for sure absolutely
and a lot of what's interesting is
inside of the macbook for me the thing
that stood out the most were those
contoured batteries just sort of layers
of like these very thinly sliced
batteries on top of each other like most
of the interior of that notebook is all
battery so that's pretty cool the keys
feel really interesting they designed a
new system of course the butterfly
mechanism instead of the scissor
mechanism and there's that that sort of
all metal casing it looks really really
nice so yeah people seem pretty excited
about that here okay see did you get a
chance to actually go in and try
anything about you have you tried like
we're really curious what force touch
especially like how that feels did not
get a chance to try force touch yet but
I'm looking forward to when I'm finished
talking with you guys what's your
favorite buzz word from today is it
Terrace battery is it force touch is it
something else please please tell us
I'll it I'm going to be trying to find
ways to work butterfly mechanism into
all my sentences from here on out you
know
a story comes in it's missing a little
something maybe it needs a butterfly
mechanism I mean it's just like I'm
sorry this is scissoring too much we
really do need to move to the butterfly
at this point we're not case I mean this
is what I love is like reading their
live log of the events what was the feel
inside the theater inside the yerba
buena center uh you know the the feeling
at an apple event is sort of this like
quietly focused intensity most of the
people in the room are oppressed
everybody is staring down at a laptop or
their phone or some combination of both
so you don't have a lot of those really
human moments except for when there's a
bunch of sort of applause which is
usually coming from the Apple employees
or maybe maybe some of the VIPs that are
there but you know a couple of moments
stood out when Tim Cook said that the
addition was going to start at ten
thousand dollars I heard some pained
cries around me like the sort of cries
that you might imagine if like a child
had been injured in a car accident it
was that sort of just like ah like that
sort of a pained cry so you know clearly
at least within the press people are not
really prepared to spend 10k on a watch
and then you know the other moment that
I would highlight would be just sort of
the frosty vibe in the air when Christy
Turlington burns was on stage during
that sort of forced banter part of the
presentation talking about her trip to
Africa where she ran a race and somehow
the Apple watch made that easier but it
was difficult for me to understand what
the watch really had to do with her trip
to Africa and I think it was hard for
some of the other members of the press
to understand as well yeah that seemed
like a bit of a misdirection i'm not
sure why they why they went there were
there any moments during the event when
you think that they either didn't spend
enough time explaining what was going on
or spent too long sort of dabbling on a
single feature or set of features in
particular i thought that the kevin
lynch segment was a bit long but maybe
that's just my opinion I tend to agree
with you and in fact i think the event
focused too much on features period we
already knew heading into this that the
Apple watch can do a lot of things but I
think what a lot of us were waiting
for was that coherent story like make
the case that that I want this and and
and sell it to me at a level above oh
tap this to text this person and
scribble here to send a heart right like
we wanted some sort of like overall
message that was going to make us
understand how this fit into our lives
and instead we just got this very
lengthy list of well I can do this and
it can do that oh but if you don't like
those two things try this third thing
and I think it got a little bit
overwhelming and so I do wish that Apple
it's been a bit more time up top sort of
setting the stage for how this watch was
going to fit into our everyday lives now
Casey going into this have you been like
convinced that a SmartWatch is the
future do you even care about going into
it and now having come out of the Apple
watch event how are you feeling what's
your takeaway like just the whole
category wearables well you know I'm
very open to being convinced I want to
believe that you know a few years from
now the sort of default posture of
humanity is not going to be staring down
at this device as we you know walk
through busy intersection so I want
there to be something that means I'm
staring at my phone let less but what I
worry about with these wearables Apple
watch included is that they've
essentially just put another inbox on
our wrist they've given us another set
of distractions another series of things
that's going to take us out of the
moment and into the world of whatever
app developer we've decided to you know
install their apps on our device so you
know when I think about something that's
going to be buzzing me many many times a
day telling me to stand up to sit down
to respond to this text to read this
email to check out my instagram likes to
reply to meet these tweets it sounds
exhausting and and one problem with the
way that the watch was presented today
was that it was sort of this endless
series of like in your watch is going to
tell you this and it's going to tell you
that you know Tim Cook repeatedly
referred to it as your coach on your
wrist I think that could all be very
overwhelming you know there was a great
piece on our sister site racked about
what the tech industry doesn't
understand about fashion and I think
Apple probably under
sold the fashion piece today and that
maybe if they had made it feel like
something that was just going to look
really freaking cool on your wrist that
could have sold it more than any feature
that they announced so I am still sort
of on the fence i'm probably going to
wait to read the reviews on the verge to
decide whether i buy one of these myself
i'm very open to it but what I've seen
so far I have to tell you I'm still
rather skeptical well you have to buy
one Casey because otherwise I'm gonna
send you my heart beat that you know
what I would I would easily pay 350
dollars or more just to get the the Z
power heartbeat on the wrist yeah tier
point Casey it does feel like they're
taking the same tack with this thing
that they have been with the ipad for
the setup past several years where
they're sort of throwing it to the
wolves and saying hey developers you
figure out what this thing is good for
and in fact i think kevin lynch
literally said we can't wait to see what
developers do with this so uh you know
it it's it's entirely possible that in a
year this device is going to seem much
more coherently organized than it does
right now but I'm skeptical because if
they're leaving it in the hands of
third-party developers and that sort of
scatters it it doesn't focus it right
yeah I think that's very true and the
one thing I would say in response to
that is that when iPad came out I knew
exactly what I wanted to use it for I
could like when Jobs sort of reclined in
a chair and showed himself reading and
browsing the web and watching a video I
thought my gosh I I would love to do
that like that that feels like a real
improvement on you know me holding some
like laptop that's getting overheated
and like you know has a battery that's
rapidly draining so like in the moment
that ipad was shown on stage like I i
pre-ordered it in my mind and Apple
watch just didn't get there for me yet
likes because because again so many of
those features are just that thing you
could that thing you can do on your
phone now you can do it on your wrist
tomorrow it's just got to get beyond
that right so let's go back to the
macbook for a second are you buying one
and what color are you getting because
the goal
was out in nowhere nobody saw that
coming right right well so you know
Chris as you know at the verge we get to
replace our laptops every two years and
I'm excited to announce that my two year
anniversary at the verge is next month
congratulations so this really could not
be timed better for from a personal
standpoint I would love to get one of
these new macbooks my one question is
you know how am I going to be able to
keep it powered and plug it into an
external monitor and get photos off my
SD card onto my laptop right like so
these are three things that I do every
day maybe there will be some new set of
dongles I'm sure that somebody on the
verge will explain to me how I'm going
to do this but the answer short answer
is yes I would like to get one of these
things and I would absolutely get the
gold model because I'm a trashy person
and I want to find a new way to signal
that to the world just look at look at
this gold thing that I have that you
don't have like that's that's how I like
to live my life just going to walk
around a coffee shop the coffee shop
holding it out going look at this do you
even see it so n well I mean so kaisa
but there's a concern of like I fully
intend to wear it as a necklace if there
is a concern of power that I mean this
is not a powerful laptop in it it's on
par with most MacBook Airs but this
isn't something to get a lot of photo
processing out or you know definitely
gonna watch 4k video smoothly on some
like this is that going to concern me
I'm not saying what you're doing for
work I'm saying is that going to be
concerned though it definitely seems
like it is aimed at that market of
people who use their laptops mostly for
surfing the web writing emails you know
basically documents plus and Netflix and
that seems like a huge market category
and I think they're going to sell a lot
of them to those people that but what
you've just mentioned Ross is exactly
why I do feel like I have to wait you
know I don't have very specialized needs
working at the verge but I do take
photos for my job so they're going to
have to resolve a few of those questions
I think before somebody who works in a
kind of professional or
semi-professional roles is going to want
to
pre-order the thing you know Neal I
posited before and I think that's
absolutely true after I've seen today's
announcements that this device is
designed sort of to replace the concept
of an iPad plus an external keyboard a
little more expensive than that but not
much and so my question to you is well
first of all do you currently have an
iPad and secondly could you see this
device or something like it replacing an
ipad for you because it seems like
they're trying to bite into that market
to some degree here right yeah I mean I
think there's two kinds of iPad users
there are people who absolutely want to
work you absolutely want to use it for a
work device and then there are people
who use it more as a leisure device I
sort of fall into the latter camp like
when I pick up my iPad it's because I'm
not planning to type anything and in
fact one of the things that I like about
it is that you know sure I could fire
off a short email if I had to but for
the most part and playing games i'm
reading i'm watching a video so you know
maybe the fact that they are coming
after this more professional market with
an actual laptop indicates that you know
an ipad really isn't a great work device
like you can make it work if you need to
there was a time when I had an external
keyboard for my iPad and I used it for
work and you know it worked just great
but fundamentally you're forcing it
right people who work need keyboards and
physical keyboards are better than
virtual one so I do expect that you will
see people using that macbook for work
and you know maybe the ipad does start
feeling more like a leisure device or
other kind of like specialty device over
time yeah obviously i think the ipad
more like a gaming device than anything
else that's not something you're gonna
be doing with this macbook for sure
right but again it goes into the whole
idea like Apple watch me like a fashion
advice this is a fashion accessory like
yeah it's kind of like a stair scored by
the fact that comes in three colors
right including gold yeah but in gold
okay see I don't know me let me ask you
did you hear the biggest price for Apple
watch you just they just put the prices
online do you know how much they
actually go to know how much do they go
to I just take a wild guess what is the
most expensive Apple watch you can buy
right now
or you will be able to 15,000 little
hyozan little higher 20 nope Miller put
the difference seventeen seventeen
thousand dollars for thirty eight
millimeter yellow gold or rose gold with
the modern buckle but here's the weird
thing is that the most expensive watch
the pricing is just kind of like it gets
a little scatter shot the higher you go
in the in the the spectrum because the
most expensive model is not a 42
millimeter no see although right even
though on the lower end the 42
millimeters are more expensive for
obvious reasons there's more materials
it's you know whatever uh so who
actually knows what's going on in this
end of the market but i think that
apple's appealing to this group of
people who write a check for seventeen
thousand dollars or how are you pay for
something that costs that much uh
without thinking about it a check still
works maybe i don't know maybe they have
a special I don't have you have one
those metal axes I don't have that much
on a credit limit I have no idea yeah
it's it's it's impossible for anyone at
the verge to really say how you pay for
something that caused seventeen thousand
dollars we can only guess I'll just
bring your own gold yeah bring your own
bar of gold yeah so anyway obviously the
spectrum of pricing for this device is
huge on a percentage basis and
definitely larger than anything else
apples ever made right you can make the
argument Casey I think that you put in
the live blog that someone pointed out
that if you cost adjusted the Apple Lisa
for inflation it would be more expensive
than the most expensive apple watch
edition but we're kind of splitting
hairs at that point I mean yeah it would
be interesting to it would be
interesting to do you know customer
satisfaction survey with Apple Lisa
customers and then you know apple watch
edition customers a year after the fact
and see who is happier with their you
know seventeen thousand dollar
investment and the Lisa wasn't even gold
I just want to point that out nor was it
available in thousands of
nations nor was it designed by by Johnny
I've no idea where it is a knife nor can
you wear it on your wrist these are all
very good points so Casey let's say
let's turn briefly to the one other
announcement of the event which was
where we started the the HBO and Apple
TV news the HBO now is called which is
debuting exclusively on Apple products
fifteen dollars a month right $49 am L
feel sorry like that and of course they
reduced the price of the apple TV 2 $69
Casey what do you think this is going to
encourage people a to buy an Apple TV if
they haven't already and be cut the cord
is this the the turning point I think
it's a great partnership you know when
you look at HBO and Apple both of these
are companies that work so hard to
develop premium brands and I think each
one of them gets something out of this
arrangement right HBO gets to tell its
customers hey we're on the coolest
hardware Apple gets to say we've got the
best content so I think it's a huge win
for both companies like when they
announced it I thought that's that's a
solid move you know I heard you guys
talking a little bit before I came on
Ross was saying all these subscriptions
are starting to add up I'm sort of in
that camp I've got you know Hulu Plus
and I've got netflix and I may have the
WWE Network so it is but at the same
time 15 bucks does not seem at all
unreasonable for me and if I'm ever no
longer able to use my roommates parents
HBO Go password I don't have to take a
serious look at that yeah well this I i
was i was kind of seriously suggesting
that this gives HBO an incentive to
finally start cracking down on the the
sort of lackadaisical spreading of these
uh these account logins right right as
far as we can tell there are only four
known HBO GO law gets on earth there are
four subscribers who are collectively
paying for the cost of production for
Game of Thrones and here we have Jason
who's only three degrees from one of the
sources
roommates cousins somewhat anyway but
and I've heard that that game of thrones
is one of the most expensive shows ever
in terms of you know how much it cost to
make each episode so so obviously they
have some incentive to start dialing up
the heat on these these people I'm Casey
Newton any way to case we're gonna let
you go to second I have one last very
very important question as we're seeing
more smart watches more world of ice
wearable devices including like Apple
watch we see hands on from all these
tech journalists including our own where
do you feel on bleaching and or trimming
arm hair ahead of a hands-on with
watches it's so important Ross and I'm
glad you bring that up you know you
watch some of these hands-on videos and
you just see these thick forests of hair
and you think my god what sort of man
ape is making this video and you know we
we here at the verge are going to use
our platform to speak out against this
appalling trend and you know hope we can
we can stop the madness all right here
well get in there and tell me I said hi
I mentioned none of that there is a new
Apple watch hands on on the verge calm
you guys want to check it out casing is
anything else you want to say before
before we let you go I love you guys I
love you too love you as well Casey all
right case hanging everybody all right
before we start wrapping up that I do
want to like actually make a case for
Apple watch um okay ass not as spear
moliere a spirited case because then I
think about the price and go known but
the Jing I've heard the last couple days
is the apple watch will be the thing
that means you look at your phone list
and then the counterpoint is everyone's
mad that people looking their phone in
the first place right um I don't think
it's a bad reason I really don't I
really like the idea of not pulling on
my phone all the time I'm obsessed with
doing that I check notifications every
five years anyway I don't mind that idea
I do think there's apple pay interest to
interest the passbook stuff makes sense
here in as ridiculous as it is the idea
of like doodling you know obnoxious
cartoons its ongoing your heart beat us
in your heart beat making another watch
vibrating whatever cyber deal Datuk
thing you want to do with that sure
sketching dirty pictures or clean
pictures yeah
to your loved ones I mean there there
are little mini communication things
that it it's not worth 350 necessarily
but when you start thinking like how
much you spend for a fitness band anyway
and fashion products like that it starts
to be a justifiable cause at the low end
at least I'm telling myself that now
well and to be very clear $350 is the
very smallest amount of money you can
spend for someone who's not fashionable
at all right and so going into this
event I was hopeful if not outright
expecting that the the steel version of
the watch with a steel band would cost
500 550 at most but no the-the if I'm
not mistaken the steel 42 millimeter
with the steel band is 999 I think and
if you if you get the black version in
steel with the steel band it's 1099
which mean to be very clear that's like
that's that's in the world of luxury
watches you're starting to brush up
against the low end of that segment it
is no longer a commodity device it is a
luxury timepiece and the the the problem
that we've been sort of bantering about
for a few months now is that this isn't
a wha this isn't sort of an heirloom it
isn't a legacy device it isn't something
you can pass down to your children it's
something that goes bad after a couple
years and and to drive that point home I
was just looking at the the changelog
notes for iOS 8 point to which is out
today and the Apple watch isn't
supported on iPhones older than iphone 5
which is what three years old so you you
think about the fact that this device
you're spending as much as eleven
hundred dollars on and that's not even
getting into addition territory is just
goes bad in three years or less is kind
of out of control yeah there's there are
two things I've seen one that's pro that
one that's gone that and the one thing
that kind of like gave me a little bit i
was a little okay with it was the api i
was looking to the API when it first
came out a couple months ago and there's
so much processing power done
phone itself yeah that in many ways it's
just a receiver so as long as the screen
is okay sure it should last a little
more than a couple years like the urged
like an iPad the urge upgrade isn't
probably gonna be a strong sherry cycle
that being said you hear interview
especially like I think the profile what
Johnny I've was like there was a
thousand and one things he wanted to add
to this we wanted census but I did not
mean for my voice to go that way it just
does when you re say Johnny I've but
there are so many things harder why's
that they actually wanted to do with
this didn't and that's where i'm like i
should i wait for the second one where
they actually figured that shit right or
you know what do you want a circular
display maybe that's an apples future
who knows right so and you know with it
with an addition at the very least you
have you know assuming apple doesn't
offer a trade in program you at least
have the the gold value the raw gold
value with the stainless steel model you
have nothing you have a piece of you
know you have a few dollars worth of
metal that can't reasonably be
absolutely fair though we're talking a
thousand verses 10,000 and we are but
but still you know do you want to sit
you want to put yourself in a position
where you're spending a thousand dollars
every two to three years on a wad i mean
if you're if you're a watch collector
that's reasonable but you're you're
still expecting to add a watch to your
collection every few years as opposed to
replacing it so that's it's a tricky
tricky question for Apple to answer and
they didn't attempt to answer it today
Tim Cook didn't mention squat and not
not to say expecting to but he didn't
say a single thing about what happens
next year when they announce the Apple
watch too and you have a $15,000
watching hands right and then what do
you do but also like there's so many
things to do like when the ipod first
came out it was a niche market plus it
had it yet require a using a mac which
very people have the time right the iPad
that was a ugly ugly piece of shit first
product I'm sorry it was it really was a
big iphone the second one they kind of
figured it out the Apple watch you need
an iphone 5 which is not as ubiquitous
as they wanted to be and they won't be
for a couple years this is the early
adopter kind of test market if you're
gonna spend that much money now I think
you kind of know that this is like this
is kind of a test case for them maybe
well yeah that will see that so that's
that's the million-dollar
for Apple is does this become a
mainstream product are people going to
line up around the block the same way
they do for an iphone is it going going
to be a niche product is it going to be
somewhere in between what are they
expecting and what is the public going
to do we don't know this is kind of
untested territory for them and for us
so we'll see yeah is there anything else
we want to really tackle in here
actually like look to the future what
macbook are you are you buying oh hell
no I'm happy with this right here I know
yeah that's a 13-inch repa is the
13-inch redness of my my computer
anniversary was recent too so I got a
13-inch retina it's doing fine mm-hmm
the obvious didn't L suspect boost today
but I don't care this does just
everything I needed to do oh one thing
that that I was expecting today with the
new macbook that wasn't announced and it
makes me very very sad is I expected
them to integrate touch ID into the
touchpad oh yeah and that didn't happen
it seems like such an obvious fit and
such an obvious thing that they would
want to expand from the iphone over to
order macbook especially considering how
many features from iOS they've adopted
into his tent over the years that was
just a disappointment right but that
being said the the new macbook i had the
same reaction to the macbook today that
i had to the original macbook air which
is both good and bad because in
retrospect the original macbook air was
not a good product in many ways it it
ran hot it the port situation was
terrible and actually we should talk
about the court situation and it ended
up kind of being an afterthought in
history compared to the second
generation which was a very good product
so you know we'll see if they've learned
their lessons we'll see if the new
macbook is a fantastic product or if
it's one of those things where you want
to wait for the second generation but
let's talk about the port situation talk
about the port situation let's do it to
put two ports there's a there's a USBC
on one side and then on the other
there's a headphone jack I think that's
it that's it and then that matches up
with the rumors that we heard think mark
Gurman for 9to5 mac broke this and you
gotta like there's a graphic designer
that kind of went in kind of model based
on what the rumor was and that was
pretty damn spot on yeah i'll give
credit where credit's dude that was damn
spot on but yeah USBC reversible it's
very pretty you're getting an adapter
for every single thing yeah and those
days where you bought like the giant USB
hubs that's back that's happening again
but it's it's in vogue what can you say
uh uh make safe is gone yes which is not
awesome if you have kids or pets you
might want to write just going to hang
yeah you might want to make sure that
this this particular computer is off in
a different area of the house and yeah
you're going to be looking at spending
it I just pulled up the sum of the
unit's here pneumatic move engines if
you want the if you want the vga
multi-port adapter for us bc apples
listing it now for $79 you want the
digital AV adapter is also 79 david and
i know no one else is looking at this so
this is really compelling but click on
the front you're like what is it just
okay you have hdmi you have another USB
see so you can do pass through and you
have 0 array go to your speed can I just
say this is ugly as hell no it is it
looks like broadly so these these ports
look like the same white like last
generation Apple ID ports that they've
been using for 10 years I hear that we
have hands-on to throw two for the
macbooks let's check that I heard okay
we're here at apple's event in
California and we are just getting our
hands on with the all new macbook it is
just the macbook it is ridiculously thin
it's 13 point 10 millimeters thin and
you can see one of the headline features
here this USB type-c port this gets used
for power for
for display for USB for everything it's
a fastener point it is kind of gonna be
in the future of laptops it's been
around here and we also of course got a
headphone jack and microphone but the
big story here is the technology the
screen is 23 0 for x 1440 somewhere in
that neighborhood it's I retina display
looks really good there's a speaker girl
across the top and Apple is really
playing up the new keyboard they've got
a new Butterfly mechanism so that the
keys are really flat and chevre corner
you push on they all feel the same
there's not much key trouble to it
actually it feels pretty shallow but it
doesn't feel terrible it just takes a
little bit of getting used to what is
weird those the trackpad we've got an
entirely new mechanism so it also feels
saying that I know where you click on it
and Apple has created this new thing
called force plate where you sort of
like push through the trackpad and you
can see I just fail to get it done that
I'll try it one more time you push it
till you see a second click and then it
gives you like a third action so there's
single quick and double click and now
this force clinic for flexure do
different things you cannot configure
the strength of it there's a little bit
of tackle come back when you're doing so
this is the new macbook it comes out of
april 10 for 1299
is just stupid life crazy feeling and as
an intel core m processor so it should
be pretty fast and I can't wait to give
it to us more time so one thing that I
want to I want to note in that video
that I found very interesting is that
all three of the colors available for
the new macbook are similar enough so
that they just look like the same
macbook cast in different lighting which
is a little bit like the dress right oh
just good just throwing that out there
no um but does it seriously like that
the gold looked like a silver macbook
sitting in incandescent light the silver
looked like the silver and the Space
Gray just looked like it was in a dark
room so not not very extreme colors I
think that they were probably careful to
make sure that they weren't doing
anything too wild with this this this
new macbook they were just sort of like
adding a little bit of hue to each one
which I guess is ok I i I've been 14
years I've been wanting just a black
aluminum anodized macbook but Apple
won't give it to me give it time give it
time maybe there's I mean we're seeing
more and more macbooks there's a filling
in the little holes like there was that
famous the the iPad one presentation
where Steve Jobs is like we're gonna
make a case between this product and
this product and it became the iPad and
now we're just seeing Apple fill in
every single right which is the thing
we've seen to do for years and of course
the bigger iPhones were indicative of
that you'll get what you want look at
everything you want just give it time
well one one important distinction
though I think and this is just my
theory but I feel like this to end we
mentioned this with Casey feels like
this new macbook is filling in a hole
that is partially being filled right now
by the ipad for work use with you know
when you put in a keyboard case right
right and to that end it makes sense
that this this macbook would be
available in colors the same way an ipad
is whereas the higher-end more powerful
macbooks are still effectively pcs they
don't have this level of portability
this thing is ridiculously thin one
thing that i think makes it look more
like an ipad than a macbook is the fact
that the glowing apple on the back of
the display is not glowing but it's it's
shiny like it would be on a knife
right so this is so that's a
consideration the fact that this is in
many ways an ipad with a keyboard except
of course for the fact that runs OS 10
right the only thing else to know like
is this is considerably more expensive
than the macbook air how about well it's
early but it's not too 1299 right so yes
if you compare that with an 11-inch
MacBook Air yes it is a more expensive
device but you know if you go back
through history going back to what was
the power Brock do oh I think was a
famously expensive and very small apple
laptop in the 90s and I'm probably
butchering my Apple history here I don't
have Wikipedia and so I apologize but
the point is it is certainly not without
precedent to have the smallest lightest
version of Apple's pc lineup be a step
above in terms of pricing make sense
agree and again the second generation
will be a lot a lot cleaner be a lot
cheaper a jury yet you might be dreaming
I I like the way you think but yes AI or
you get rid of the MacBook Airs can't i
early so this is the cheap model yeah
could be one or the other could be yeah
cool i mean there's other things that
happen of course health kit and research
kit we've seen health care a lot
research kit is intriguing but I don't
know there's really much to say at this
point I'm just really curiously what
happens the next big event for them is
going to be WWDC the big develop
assuming they don't announce anything
before then presumably they're going to
have iOS 9 show right but you know there
have been rumors of a public beta for
iOS 8.3 which isn't even out yet a point
to is is released today mostly to add
apple watch support few other bug fixes
but they're kind of getting compressed
in terms of how much more they can do
with 8x before nine comes out so I don't
know how that fits maybe a 23 carries
him through the summer and then they
stay on the same release schedule as
usual so I guess I'm talking myself into
the likelihood that iOS 9 will be a WWDC
thing and not have a special event
beforehand but they have done that
before they have done ios-only events
early in the year so that's an outside
possibility trail I mean which is we're
just running out of months in between
this Brian so well staples saying cool
final thoughts final thoughts
I want it all I want the seventeen
thousand dollar Apple watch I don't even
I there is nothing in my possession that
I could sell that would all enable me to
buy that so I'm just gonna have to dream
and the the macbook looks nice but I
need to know whether the keyboard feels
as good as they claim it does I need to
know how these force touch touch pads
really work and I need to know that it's
fast enough for me to get my job done on
a daily basis so those questions won't
be answered until April what about you I
just need to bleach my arm hair i'm
feeling really subconscious about it now
so if we're all we're all about that's
let's just wrap it up at this point on
that lovely note for all things apple
including you know more coverage more
hot takes more impressions one else has
more video and not just Apple everything
