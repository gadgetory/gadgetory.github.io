Verge live I'm Ross Miller I'm Chris
tickler and today on the show we're
gonna be talking about all the things
Apple just announced a spring forward
event later on Casey Newton won't be
joining us from San Francisco with
first-hand impressions okay so what all
did we actually see today
well first we started with a sort of
surprise HBO announcement they'll be
launching HBO now they're calling it
next month exclusive to Apple at launch
then they went through an all-new
MacBook just MacBook mesmero not air
just MacBook and then finally we got
into some Apple watch stuff yep and I
that's what I want talked about the most
but first let's just really quickly get
through Apple TV yeah
$59 now $69 actually surprise price drop
which makes sense because every other
set-top box does everything that thing
does know yeah they're there at the
point where the hardware is old enough
and the functionality is can monetized
enough so that they really had no option
but to drop the price a little
surprising that they didn't follow it up
with another box that maybe has a little
bit more functionality 4k whatnot but I
guess they're not ready yet
yeah that's maybe something later this
fall I mean the apple cherry rumors of
be it set-top box or actual set itself
has always been around but there is
something missed remembered forever
which is content deals mm-hmm which is
Apple's trying to talk to every single
content provider to get exclusive deals
that's right first of that right and
also is a big deal because everyone
wants standalone HBO right and so this
is I mean we knew that HBO was was
unbundling right this was in the
pipeline it was gonna be a 2015 thing
for them but it is surprising that it's
an Apple exclusive to start that's a big
deal but what's your take I think that
you're more plugged in Game of Thrones
averse than I am
what is your take I am going back and
forth so hard because I don't want to
pay for cable
yeah but the things are starting to add
up for a right $15 by itself like I'm
just being kind of a stubborn prick at
that point like yeah I did get sling TV
recently so use that for everything
basically except HBO and brought
and that's yeah but oh so that doesn't
have ABC CBS no but I have rabbit ears I
meet in two holes for ravisher everyone
complains about that anyway but will I
pay $15 for Ag oh maybe actually yeah
but III know in my head is hard to add
up to even be more expensive than just
getting a damn cable - right well so one
thing that that I saw brought up on
Twitter that I think is potentially an
interesting point is that the existence
of this service incentivizes HBO to
start cracking down on the distribution
of HBO GO logins right that's the other
reason while I'm probably end up paying
dues right now I'm enjoying the hell out
of it first ya know everybody uses
somebody'll $3.99 yeah there's like one
patient zero that has the master HBO go
account and everybody is using that one
account and now presumably they're going
to crack down they're gonna login like
the David for the Game of Thrones with
me respect I'm sorry caution by the way
rice is being used by 1253 people I have
to pare that back get a new account guys
so uh yeah it paired with that they also
showed the the trailer for the new
season of Game of Thrones and we've seen
a bunch of clips of that before we won't
dawdle on that too much here but uh yeah
well it's exciting it might be a slight
departure from the books which is kind
of interesting but also Game of Thrones
is the number one most pirated show now
there's an option or people like you
know to you you can actually legally pay
for it yeah it's expensive right you
can't use oh I'm beat I do cable
subscription as an excuse anymore but
you do still need an Apple device of
some sort whether it be an Apple TV or
an iPhone or an iPad because if I
remember correctly they they said on
stage that this is going to not just be
an Apple TV thing you'll be able to use
any Apple device basically well I didn't
I remember hearing that but I hope to
god that's true because like that would
seem very stupid otherwise yeah I I have
to believe that they'll have an HBO now
app for iPhone right you know so and so
that's the first mini and like obviously
like HBO is one of the biggest cable
channels out there ESPN with the next
big one ESP was a big deal for sling
that was on there will be interesting
Espeon kind of follows there to any
other channels small suit obviously
Apple is hawkish on getting exclusive
content deals but they're not they're
just a box or just tea because this is
the one thing that really differentiates
Apple TV from your Roku's and your
Amazons right right did I hear correctly
do we have do we have case
ready I believe we do want we go alive
decadence in San Francisco Casey are you
go you're so pretty Casey Newton hello
hey guys how's it going man hi guys
how's it going
good good so tell us what what's it like
out there what's the scene so as you
might imagine it is rather hectic inside
the hands-on area right now people are
checking out the MacBook that they just
unveiled as well as taking a look at the
Apple watch up-close heading into this
event I think most of us assume that the
watch was gonna be the most exciting
thing to look at afterwards but man
people just cannot wait to get their
hands on that new MacBook it looks
really really good
is it as interesting of a device as it
appeared to be from afar I guess maybe
you haven't gotten close to it yet but
from where I was sitting it looked like
really the most interesting announcement
of the of the event mm-hmm sure
absolutely and a lot of what's
interesting is inside of the MacBook for
me the thing that stood out the most
were those contoured batteries just sort
of layers of like these very thinly
sliced batteries on top of each other
like most of the interior of that
notebook is all battery so that's pretty
cool the keys feel really interesting
they designed a new system of course the
butterfly mechanism instead of the
scissor mechanism that's sort of all
metal casing it looks really really nice
so yeah people seemed pretty excited
about that here okay see did you get a
chance to actually go in and try
anything about yeah have you tried like
we're really curious what force to touch
especially like how that feels did not
get a chance to try force touch yet but
I'm looking forward to when I'm finished
talking with you guys what's your
favorite buzzword from today is it
terrorist battery is it forced touch is
it something else please please tell us
I look I'm gonna be trying to find ways
to work butterfly mechanism into all my
senses from here on out you know
a story comes in it's missing a little
something maybe it needs a butterfly
mechanism I mean it's just like I'm
sorry this is ring too much we really do
need to move to the butterfly at this
point we're not okay see I mean this is
what I love is like reading their live
log of the events
what was the feel inside the theater
inside of your big window Center uh you
know the the feeling of an apple event
is sort of this like quietly focused
intensity most of the people in the room
are oppressed everybody is staring down
at a laptop or their phone or some
combination of both so you don't have a
lot of those really human moments except
for when there's a bunch of sort of
applause which is usually coming from
the Apple employees or maybe maybe some
of the VIPs that are there but you know
a couple of moments stood out when Tim
Cook said that the addition was gonna
start at $10,000 I heard some pained
cries around me like the sort of cries
that you might imagine if like a child
had been injured in a car accident it
was that sort of just like ah like that
sort of a pained cry so you know clearly
at least within the press people are not
really prepared to spend 10 K on a watch
and then you know the other moment that
I would highlight would be just sort of
the frosty vibe in the air when Christie
Turlington Burns was on stage during
that sort of force to banter part of the
presentation talking about her trip to
Africa where she ran a race and somehow
the Apple watch made that easier but it
was difficult for me to understand what
the watch really had to do with her trip
to Africa and I think it was hard for
some of the other members of the press
to understand as well yeah that seemed
like a bit of a misdirection I'm not
sure why they why they went there were
there any moments during the event when
you think that they either didn't spend
enough time explaining what was going on
or spent too long sort of dawdling on a
single feature or set of features in
particular I thought that the Kevin
Lynch segment was a bit long but maybe
that's just my opinion I tend to agree
with you and in fact I think the event
focused too much on features period we
already knew heading into this that the
Apple watch can do a lot of things but I
think what a lot of us were wait
for was that coherent story like make
the case that that I want this and and
and sell it to me at a level above Oh
tap this to text this person and
scribble here to send a heart right like
we wanted some sort of like overall
message that was going to make us
understand how this fit into our lives
and instead we just got this very
lengthy list of well I can do this and
it can do that oh but if you don't like
those two things try this third thing
and I think it got a little bit
overwhelming and so I do wish that Apple
had spent a bit more time up top sort of
setting the stage for how this watch was
gonna fit into our everyday lives
okay see going into this have you been
like convinced that a SmartWatch is the
future do you even care about going into
it and now having come out of the Apple
watch event how are you feeling what's
your takeaway I like just the whole
category wearables well you know I'm
very open to being convinced I want to
believe that you know a few years from
now the sort of default posture of
humanity is not going to be staring down
at this device as we you know walk
through busy intersection so I want
there to be something that that means
I'm staring at my phone let less but
what I worry about with these wearables
Apple watch included is that they've
essentially just put another inbox on
our wrist they've given us another set
of distractions another series of things
that's going to take us out of the
moment and into the world of whatever
app developer we've decided to you know
install their apps on our device so you
know when I think about something that's
going to be buzzing me many many times a
day telling me to stand up to sit down
to respond to this text to read this
email to check out my Instagram likes to
reply to meet these tweets it sounds
exhausting and and one problem with the
way that the watch was presented today
was that it was sort of this endless
series of like in your watch is gonna
tell you this and it's gonna tell you
that you know Tim Cook repeatedly
referred to it as your your your coach
on your wrist I think that could all be
very overwhelming you know there was a
great piece on our sister site wrapped
about what the tech industry doesn't
understand about fashion and I think
Apple
undersold the fashion piece today and
that maybe if they had made it feel like
something that was just gonna look
really freaky and cool on your wrist
that could have sold it more than any
feature that they announced so I am
still sort of on the fence I'm probably
gonna wait to read the reviews on the
verge to decide whether I buy one of
these myself I'm very open to it but
what I've seen so far I have to tell you
I'm still rather skeptical well you have
to buy one Casey because otherwise how
I'm gonna send you my heartbeat that you
know what I would I would easily pay 350
dollars or more just to get the the Z
power heartbeat on the wrist
yeah tear point Casey it does feel like
they're taking the same tack with this
thing that they have been with the iPad
for the past several years where they're
sort of throwing it to the wolves and
saying hey developers you figure out
what this thing is good for and in fact
I think Kevin Lynch literally said we
can't wait to see what developers do
with this so you know it it's it's
entirely possible that in a year this
device is gonna seem much more
coherently organized than it does right
now but I'm skeptical because if they're
leaving it in the hands of third-party
developers and that sort of scatters it
it doesn't focus it right
yeah I think that's very true and the
one thing I would say in response to
that is that when iPad came out I knew
exactly what I wanted to use it for I
could like when Jobs sort of reclined in
a chair and showed himself reading and
browsing the web and watching a video I
thought my gosh I I would love to do
that like that that feels like a real
improvement on you know me holding some
like laptop that's getting overheated
and like you know has a battery that's
rapidly draining so like in the moment
that iPad was shown on stage like I
preordered it in my mind and Apple watch
just didn't get there for me yet like
because because again so many of those
features are just that thing you could
that thing you can do on your phone now
you can do it on your wrist tomorrow
it's to get beyond that right so let's
go back to the MacBook for a second
are you buying one and what color are
you getting because the goal
was out of nowhere nobody saw that
coming right right well so you know
Chris as you know at the verge we get to
replace our laptops every two years and
I'm excited to announce that my two year
anniversary at the verge is next month
congratulations
so this really could not be timed better
for from a personal standpoint I would
love to get one of these new MacBooks my
one question is you know how am I going
to be able to keep it powered and plug
it into an external monitor and get
photos off my SD card onto my laptop
right like so these are three things
that I do every day maybe there will be
some new set of dongles I'm sure that
somebody on the verge will explain to me
how I'm gonna do this but the answer
short answer is yes I would like to get
one of these things and I would
absolutely get the gold model because
I'm a trashy person and I want to find a
new way to signal that to the world just
look at look at this gold thing that I
have that you don't have like that's
that's how I like to live my life just
go walk around the coffee shop the
coffee shop holding it out going look at
this do you even see it so well I mean
it's okay so there's a concern of like I
fully intend to wear it as a necklace
there is a concern of power that I mean
this is not a powerful laptop in it it's
on par with most of MacBook Airs but
this isn't something to get a lot of
photo processing out or you know
definitely gonna watch 4k video smoothly
like something like this is that gonna
me concerning me I'm not saying what
you're doing for work I'm saying is that
gonna be concerned though it definitely
seems like it is aimed at that market of
people who use their laptops mostly for
surfing the web of writing emails you
know basically documents Plus and
Netflix and that seems like a huge
market category and I think they're
gonna sell a lot of them to those people
that but what you've just mentioned Ross
is exactly why I do feel like I have to
wait you know I don't have very
specialized needs working at the verge
but I do take photos for my job so
they're gonna have to resolve a few of
those questions I think before somebody
who works in a kind of professional or
semi-professional roles is going to want
to
pre-order the thing you know Neela
posited before and I think that's
absolutely true after I've seen today's
announcements that this device is
designed sort of to replace the concept
of an iPad plus an external keyboard a
little more expensive than that but not
much
and so my question to you is well first
of all do you currently have an iPad and
secondly could you see this device or
something like it replacing an iPad for
you because it seems like they're trying
to bite into that market to some degree
here right yeah I mean I think there's
two kinds of iPad users there are people
who absolutely want to work who
absolutely want to use it for a work
device and then there are people who use
it more as a leisure device I sort of
fall into the latter camp like when I
pick up my iPad it's because I'm not
planning to type anything and in fact
one of the things that I like about it
is that you know sure I could fire off a
short email if I had to but for the most
part I'm playing games I'm reading I'm
watching a video so you know maybe the
fact that they are coming after this
more professional market with an actual
laptop indicates that you know an iPad
really isn't a great work device like
you can make it work if you need to
there was a time when I had an external
keyboard for my iPad and I used it for
work and you know it worked just great
but fundamentally you're forcing it
right people who work need keyboards and
physical keyboards are better than
virtual ones so I do expect that you
will see people using that MacBook for
work and you know maybe the iPad does
start feeling more like a leisure device
or other kind of like specialty device
over time yeah I think the iPad more
like a gaming device than anything else
that's not something you're gonna be
doing with this MacBook for sure right
but again it goes into the whole idea of
like Apple watch me like a fashion
device this is a fashion accessory like
yes cord by the fact that comes in three
colors right including gold yeah putting
gold I don't know let me ask you did you
hear the biggest price for Apple watch
they just they just put the prices
online do you know how much they
actually go to know how much do they go
to I just take a wild guess what does
the most expensive Apple watch you can
buy right now
or you'll be able to 15,000 little high
housing a little higher 20 no split the
difference
17 $17,000 for 38 millimeter yellow gold
or rose gold with the modern buckle but
here's the weird thing is that the most
expensive watch the pricing is just kind
of like a little it gets a little
scattered shot the higher you go in the
in the the spectrum because the most
expensive model is not a 42 millimeter
no see on the right even though on the
lower end the 42 millimeters are more
expensive for obvious reasons there's
more materials it's you know whatever so
who actually knows what's going on in
this end of the market but I think that
Apple is appealing to this group of
people who write a check for $17,000 or
however you pay for something that costs
that much without thinking about it they
can check still works maybe I don't know
maybe they have a special I don't have
you have one those metal ages I don't
have that much on a credit limit I have
no idea yeah it's it's it's impossible
for anyone at the verge to really say
how you pay for something that cost
$17,000 we can only guess just bring
your own gold yeah bring your own bar of
gold yeah so anyway obviously the
spectrum of pricing for this device is
huge on a percentage basis and
definitely larger than anything else
Apple has ever made right you can make
the argument Casey I think that you put
in the live blog that someone pointed
out that if you cost adjusted the Apple
Lisa for inflation it would be more
expensive than the most expensive Apple
watch edition but we're kind of
splitting hairs at that point I mean
yeah it would be interesting to it would
be interesting to do you know customer
satisfaction survey with Apple Lisa
customers and then you know Apple watch
Edition customers a year after the fact
and see who is happier with their you
know $17,000 investment and the Lisa
wasn't even gold I just want to point
that out
nor was it available in thousands of
Nations nor was it designed by by Johnny
I've no anywhere is a knife nor can you
wear it on your wrist these are all very
good points so Casey let's say let's
turn briefly to the one other
announcement of the event which was
where we started the the HBO and Apple
TV news the HBO now it's called
which is debuting exclusively on Apple
products $15 a month right $14 a month
you like that and of course they reduced
the price of the Apple TV to $69 Casey
what do you think this is gonna
encourage people a to buy an Apple TV if
they haven't already and be cut the cord
is this the the turning point I think
it's a great partnership you know when
you look at HBO and Apple both of these
are companies that work so hard to
develop premium brands and I think each
one of them gets something out of this
arrangement right HBO gets to tell its
customers hey we're on the coolest
hardware Apple gets to say we've got the
best content so I think it's a huge win
for both companies like when they
announced it I thought that's that's a
solid move you know I heard you guys
talking a little bit before I came on
Ross was saying all these subscriptions
are starting to add up I'm sort of in
that camp I've got you know Hulu Plus
and I've got Netflix and I may have the
WWE Network so it is but at the same
time 15 bucks does not seem at all
unreasonable for me and if I'm ever no
longer able to use my roommates parents
HBO Go password I don't have to take a
serious look at that yeah well this I I
was I was kind of seriously suggesting
that this gives HBO an incentive to
finally start cracking down on the the
sort of lackadaisical spreading of these
of these account logins right as far as
we can tell there are only four known
HBO GO law gets on earth there are four
subscribers who are collectively paying
for the cost of production for Game of
Thrones and here we have Jason who's the
only three degrees from one of those
sources
roommates cousins someone anyway but and
I've heard that that Game of Thrones is
one of the most expensive shows ever in
terms of you know how much it costs to
making each episode so so obviously they
have some incentive to start dialing up
the heat on these these people I'm Casey
Newton anyway in case we let you go in a
second I have up one last very very
important question as we're seeing more
smartwatches more world of ice wearable
devices including like Apple watch we
see hands on from all these tech
journalists including our own where do
you feel on bleaching and or trimming
arm hair ahead of a hands on with
watches it's so important Ross and I'm
glad you bring that up you know you
watch some of these hands-on videos and
you just see these thick forests of hair
and you think my god what sort of man
ape is making this video and you know we
we here at the verge are gonna use our
platform to speak out against this
appalling trend and you know hope we can
we can stop the madness right here well
get in there and tell me how I said hi I
mentioned none of that there is a new
Apple watch hands on on the verge calm
you guys want to check it out Casey
Newton is there anything else you want
to say before before you let you go I
love you guys I love you too love you as
well Casey all right case hanging
everybody all right before we start
wrapping out that I do want to like
actually make a case for Apple watch
okay that is spear Mull your that
spirited case because then I think about
the price and go no but the thing I've
heard for the last couple days is the
Apple watch will be the thing that means
you look at your phone list and then the
counterpoint is everyone's mad that
people looking at their phone in the
first place right I don't think it's a
bad reason I really don't I really like
the idea of not pulling on my phone all
the time I'm obsessed with doing that I
check notifications every five years
anyway
I don't mind that idea I do think
there's Apple pay interest to interest
the passbook stuff makes sense here in
as ridiculous as it is the idea of like
doodling you know obnoxious cartoons or
something your heart beat us in your
heartbeat making another watch vibrate
and whatever cyber deal Datuk thing you
want to do with that sure sketching
dirty pictures or clean pictures yeah
to your loved ones I mean there there
are little mini communication things
that it it's not worth 350 necessarily
but when you start thinking like how
much you spend for a fitness band anyway
and fashion products like that it starts
to be a justifiable cause at the low end
at least I'm telling myself that now
well and to be very clear $350 is the
very smallest amount of money you can
spend for someone who's not fashionable
at all
right and so going into this event I was
hopeful if not outright expecting that
the the steel version of the watch with
a steel band would cost 500 550 at most
but no the the if I'm not mistaken the
steel 42 millimeter with the steel band
is 999 I think and if you if you get the
black version in steel with the steel
band its 1099 which I mean to be very
clear that's like that's that's in the
world of luxury watches you're starting
to brush up against the low end of that
segment it is no longer a commodity
device it is a luxury timepiece and the
the the problem that we've been sort of
bantering about for a few months now is
that this isn't a wah this isn't sort of
an heirloom it isn't a legacy device it
isn't something you can pass down to
your children it's something that goes
bad after a couple years and and to
drive that point home I was just looking
at the the changelog notes for iOS 8.2
which is out today and the Apple watch
isn't supported on iPhones older than
iPhone 5 which is what three years old
so you you think about the fact that
this device that you're spending as much
as eleven hundred dollars on and that's
not even getting into Edition territory
is just goes bad in three years or less
is kind of out of control
yeah there's there are two things I've
seen one that's Pro that one that's con
that and that the one thing that kind of
like gave me a little bit of like I was
a little okay with it was the API I was
looking through the API when it first
came out couple months ago and there's
so much processing power done on
phone itself yeah that in many ways it's
just a receiver so as long as the screen
is okay sure it should last a little
more than a couple years like the urged
like an iPad the urge upgrade isn't
probably gonna be a strong sherry cycle
that being said you hear interview
especially like I think the profile with
Johnny I ever he's like there was a
thousand and one things he wanted to add
to this we wanted census but I did not
mean for my voice to go that way it just
does whenever you say Johnny I've but
there are so many things harder why's
that they actually wanted to do with
this didn't and that's where I'm like
should I wait for the second one where
they actually figured that out
right or you know what do you want a
circular display maybe that's an apples
future who knows right so and you know
with with an addition at the very least
you have you know assuming Apple doesn't
offer a trade-in program you at least
have the the gold value the the raw gold
value with the stainless steel model you
have nothing you have a piece of you
know you have a few dollars worth of
metal that can't reasonably be
absolutely fair though we're talking a
thousand versus ten thousand no we are
but but still you know do you want to
sit you want to put yourself in a
position where you're spending a
thousand dollars every two to three
years on on a watch I mean if you're if
you're a watch collector that's
reasonable but you're you're still
expecting to add a watch to your
collection every few years as opposed to
replacing it so that's it's a tricky
tricky question for Apple to answer and
they didn't attempt to answer it today
Tim Cook didn't mention squat and not
not to say I expecting to but he didn't
say a single thing about what happens
next year when they announced the Apple
watch - and you have a $15,000 watch on
your hands right and then what do you do
but also like there's so many things to
do like when the iPod first came out it
was a niche market because I had it you
had require using a Mac which very
people had at the time right the iPad
that was a ugly ugly piece of first
product I'm sorry it was it really was a
big iPhone the second one they kind of
figured it out the Apple watch you need
an iPhone 5 which is not as ubiquitous
as they wanted to be and there won't be
for a couple years this is the early
adopter kind of test market if you're
gonna spend that much money now I think
you kind of know that this is like this
is kind of a test case for them maybe
well yeah that we'll see that so that's
that's the million dollar
another question for Apple is does this
become a mainstream product are people
going to line up around the block the
same way they do for an iPhone is it
going going to be a niche product is it
going to be somewhere in between what
are they expecting and what is the
public is going to do we don't know this
is kind of untested territory for them
and for us so we'll see yeah is there
anything else we ought to really tackle
in here actually like look to the future
what MacBook are you are you buying oh
hell no I'm happy with this right here I
know yeah that's a 13-inch retina is the
13 inch retina so my my computer
anniversary was recent too so I got a
13-inch retina it's doing fine mm-hmm
the obvious didn't L suspect boost today
but I don't care this does just
everything I needed to do oh one thing
that that I was expecting today with the
new MacBook that wasn't announced and it
makes me very very sad is I expected
them to integrate touch ID into the
touchpad oh yeah and that didn't happen
it seems like such an obvious fit and
such an obvious thing that they would
want to expand from the iPhone over to
um or to macbook especially considering
how many features from iOS they've
adopted into OS 10 over the years that
was just a disappointment right but that
being said the the new MacBook I had the
same reaction to the MacBook today that
I had to the original MacBook Air which
is both good and bad because in
retrospect the original MacBook Air was
not a good product in many ways it it
ran hot it the port situation was
terrible and actually we should talk
about the court situation and it ended
up kind of being an afterthought in
history compared to the second
generation which was a very good product
so you know we'll see if they've learned
their lessons we'll see if the new
MacBook is a fantastic product or if
it's one of those things where you want
to wait for the second generation but
let's talk about the port situation talk
about the port situation let's do it two
ports there's a there's a USB see on one
side and then on the other there's a
headphone jack I think that's it that's
it
and then that matches up with the rumors
that we heard think Mark Garmin for 9 to
5 Mac broke this and you got a like
there's a graphic designer that kind of
went in kind of model based on what the
rumor was and that was pretty damn
spot-on yeah I'll give credit where
credit's to it that was damn spot-on but
yeah USBC reversible it's very pretty
your
and after for every single thing yeah
and those days were you bought like the
giant USB hubs that's back that's
happening again it's but it's it's in
vogue what can you say make safe is gone
yes which is not awesome if you have
kids or pets you might want to write it
just go to think yeah you might want to
make sure that this this particular
computer is off in a different area of
the house and yeah you're you're gonna
be looking at spending it I just pulled
up the some of the unit's here pneumatic
move engines if you want the if you want
the VGA multi-port adapter for USB see
apples listening it now for $79 you want
the digital AV Adapter it's also
somebody not wait and I know no one else
is looking at this so this is really
compelling but click on the front like
what is it just okay you have HDMI you
have another USB see so you can do pass
through and you have oh a regular USB
but can I just say this is ugly as hell
no it is it looks like ugly so these
these ports look like the same white
like the last generation Apple ID ports
that they've been using for 10 years I
hear that we have a hands on to throw to
for the MacBook so let's check that I
heard ok apples event in California and
we are just getting our hands on with
the all new MacBook it is just the
MacBook it is ridiculously thin it's 13
point 100 meters then and you can see
one of the headline features here this
USB type-c port this gets used for power
for
for display for USB for everything it's
a fastening point it is kind of gonna be
insured laptops and spin around here and
we also of course got a headphone jack
and a microphone but the big story here
the technology
the screen is twenty three or four by
1440 somewhere in that neighborhood it's
a Retina display looks really good
there's the speaker grille across the
top and Apple is really playing up the
new keyboard they've got a new butterfly
mechanism so that the keys are really
flat and then whichever corner you push
on they all feel the same there's not
much key travel to it actually it feels
pretty shallow but it doesn't feel
terrible it just takes a little bit of
getting used to what is weird those the
trackpad we've got an entirely new
mechanism so it also feels the same and
Apple has created this new thing called
force play where you sort of like push
through the trackpad and you can see I
just you push it until you see a second
click and then it gives you like a third
action so there's a single quick double
click there now this force clinic
reflection do different things so this
is the new MacBook it comes out on April
10 for $12.99
crazy it has an Intel Core M processor
so it should be pretty fast and so one
thing that I want to I want to note in
that video that I found very interesting
is that all three of the colors
available for the new MacBook are
similar enough so that they just look
like the same neck book cast in
different lighting which is a little bit
like the dress right just good just
throwing that out there no but does it
seriously like the gold look like a
silver MacBook sitting in incandescent
light the silver looked like the silver
and the Space Gray just looked like it
was in a dark room so not very extreme
colors I think that they were probably
careful to make sure that they weren't
doing anything too wild with this this
this new MacBook they were just sort of
like adding a little bit of hue to each
one which I guess is okay I've been one
for years I've been wanting just a black
aluminum anodized MacBook but Apple
won't give it to me give it time give it
time maybe there's I mean we're seeing
more and more MacBook so there's a
filling in the little holes mmm like
there was that famous the the iPad 1
presentation where Steve Jobs is like
we're gonna make a case between this
product and this product and they became
the iPad and now we're just seeing Apple
fill in every single right which is the
thing we've seen them do for years and
of course the bigger iPhones were
indicative of that you'll get what you
want get everything you want just give a
time well one one important distinction
that I think and this is just my theory
but I feel like this too in what we
mentioned this with Casey feels like
this new MacBook is filling in a whole
that is partially being filled right now
by the iPad for work use with you know
when you put in a keyboard case right
right and to that end it makes sense
that this this MacBook would be
available in colors the same way an iPad
is whereas the higher end more powerful
Mac books are still effectively pcs they
don't have this level of portability
this thing is ridiculously thin one
thing that that I think makes it look
more like an iPad than a MacBook is the
fact that the glowing Apple on the back
of the display is not glowing but it's
it's shiny like it would be on a night
right so this is so that's a
consideration the fact that this is in
many ways an iPad with a keyboard except
of course for the fact that runs O's
done right and the only thing else to
know like is this is considerably more
expensive than the MacBook Air how about
well it's nurse at $12.99 right so yes
if you compare that with an 11 inch
MacBook Air yes it is a more expensive
device but you know if you if you go
back through history going back to what
was the power plug duo I think was a
famously expensive and very small Apple
laptop in in the 90s and I'm probably
butchering my Apple history here I don't
have a Wikipedia link so I apologize but
the point is it is certainly not without
precedent to have the smallest lightest
version of of Apple's PC lineup be a
step above in terms of pricing makes
sense no I agree and again the second
generation will be a lots a lot cleaner
be a lot cheaper you might be dreaming I
like the way you think
but yes ai we're going to get rid of the
MacBook Airs kintyre ly so there's the
cheap model yeah could be one or the
other could be um cool I mean there are
other things that happened of course
health kit and research kit we've seen
healthcare a lot research kit is
intriguing but I don't know there's
really much to say at this point I'm
just really curious Li what happens the
next big event for them is going to be
WWDC the big develop assuming they don't
announce anything before then presumably
they're going to have iOS 9 show right
but you know there have been rumors of a
public beta for iOS 8.3 which isn't even
out yet a point to is is released today
mostly to add at Apple watch support few
other bug fixes but they're kind of
getting compressed in terms of how much
more they can they can do with 8x before
9 comes out so I don't know how that
fits maybe 8.3 carries them through the
summer and then they stay on the same
release schedule as usual so I guess I'm
talking myself into the likelihood that
iOS 9 will be a WWDC thing and not have
a special event beforehand but they have
done that before they have done iOS only
events early in the year so that's an
outside possible the trailer I mean
we're just we're just running out of
months in between and this Brian so well
staples saying cool final thoughts final
thoughts
I want it all I want the $17,000 Apple
watch
I don't even there is nothing in my
possession that I could sell that would
all enable me to buy that so I'm just
gonna have to dream and the the MacBook
looks nice but I need to know whether
the keyboard feels as good as they claim
it does I need to know how these horse
touch touch pads really work and I need
to know that it's fast enough for me to
get my job done on a daily basis so
those questions won't be answered until
April what about you I just need to
bleach my arm hair I'm feeling really
self-conscious about it now
so if we're all we're all about that's
let's just wrap it up at this point on
that lovely note for all things Apple
including you no more covers more hot
takes more impressions more analysis
more video and not just Apple everything
