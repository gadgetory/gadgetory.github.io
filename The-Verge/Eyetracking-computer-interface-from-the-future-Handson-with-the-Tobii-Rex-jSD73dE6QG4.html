and we're looking at toby's Rick's I
tracking technology for windows 8 after
a one time calibration you basically
hold down the delete key and then you
can navigate across the whole interface
so this is working on windows 8 now so
you can see that I've got my hand on the
Delete key here if I look at mail and I
hit delete they'll launch mail I can go
and look at the Microsoft account team
email on there and it hit the lead game
and it navigate to that so you're
basically using your eyes to track where
you want the closer to be and then the
Delete key will actually trigger that
action so I can start a new email for a
look at the plus at the top right and
there's all sorts of other ways as well
if we go into the maps application you
can actually use the scroll wheel on the
mouse to zoom in so if i look at Toronto
and then I start zooming in and out it
will do that navigation for you and then
I can look to Pittsburgh in the very
left there and I can scroll in and out
as well if we go back and then we go to
Internet Explorer you can use the insert
key and if I hold that down and then
look to the bottom of the page you'll
start scrolling and if I look to the top
it will start scrolling to the top so we
saw this last year and Toby are going to
be shipping this to consumers later on
in the year it seems like it's a lot
more accurate than it was before and I
mean if I go and look at people it seems
to be working quite well I look at the
desktop that's Toby's Rex I tracking
technology for windows 8
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
