verge out here in sunny Red Hook and I'm
holding the Osmo the newest tool from
DJI now we saw the Osmo demoed at CES
and this is the finished product it's a
handheld stabilizer DJI is probably best
known as a drone company and in fact
they make what's the world most popular
drone the Phantom what made the Phantom
so successful was that it's cheap and
easy enough for a beginner but powerful
enough for a professional and the Osmo
is trying to hit the same mark I'm here
with Michael Perry who's the head of
communications at DJI so you've got
these basic buttons here for still photo
for record and for manipulating where
the camera is moving then on the front
you have the trigger which is probably
the most interesting piece so this is
meant to be the ultimate selfie stick I
can double tap and I get my camera
facing forward in fact I can even rotate
the camera my the way I'm holding it and
always find that forward position with a
quick DoubleTap but since this is meant
to be a selfie stick what I really want
to do is triple tap and perfect triple
tap again back to my adoring fans triple
tap and duck face we have a number of
features onboard through the app you can
have a high degree of control over your
image just by setting the shutter speed
the ISO we have a mic on board so you
can capture audio natively with the Osmo
where we have a mic Jack on board so
that you can plug in external audio
sources like blobs or booms they also
have some intelligent photo modes
including auto panorama so you just set
the panorama
let's go it'll automatically start
taking overlapping exposures and stitch
them together into one image and that's
pretty great because normally you got a
spin in a circle to take a panorama like
that I'm not sure that that worked what
did I do wrong
we're setting the price point right now
but we're looking at between $5.99 and
$7.99 it will be available for pre-order
today and we'll start shipping in the
next few weeks it shoots about 60
minutes of 4k video recording and then
you're also going to be able to get
about 6 hours on standby mode the great
thing about the camera is that it's
optimized for ground performance it's
got a locking mechanism so that you can
easily carry it and it's also got a
focus that's set to one meter and beyond
so that whereas the aerial cameras are
set to infinity this is focused more
towards shots on the ground and so
what's the idea here why create this
product who's it aimed at what do you
think it does in terms of creating a new
market or working with the one you
already have for the drone we're not
just thinking about the camera flying
around we're also thinking about how it
moves on the ground we've taken out the
buttons we've taken out the handle
taking out the LCD screen and just focus
on creating a stable video experience
while it's on the ground there's so many
ways of capturing images now you've got
your smart phone you can use your GoPro
you can use action cameras whatever you
like but they do a good job explaining
what happened but they don't really
describe the experience of what it was
actually like and we feel like that's
where all snow comes in its expressive
it shows a lot more smooth vision that
reflects how you experience the world
around you
you guys make stabilizers they've been
popular in Hollywood for a while the
Ronin is this based on the Ronin is this
a related product yeah the Ronin has
been focused on creating easy
stabilization on the ground you set up a
camera and within five minutes of
tweaking and adjustments you're ready to
go out and film some amazing shots the
Osmo takes that same philosophy to the
ground but makes it a little bit more
accessible so you just put on the camera
turn it on and you're ready to capture
anything
