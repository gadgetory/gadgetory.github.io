2017 in Berlin and advice I'm wearing
and Samsung's new introductions for the
show so we'll see with Samsung here
ready for 2017 first of all have the
Samsung gear support this is new watch
this it's a long slide the gear is free
it would be a little bit cheaper but
it's big highlight is that you can use
it for swimming it's rated to the
waterproof down to a depth of 50 meters
and it's joined by the Samsung gear fit
2 pro which has the same waterproof
rating and also can be used for swim
tracking both of them have AMOLED
displays really nice I'm with this place
I especially like them on the wristband
here so the new gear icon X 2018 edition
earphones they don't really look
particularly different from the
predecessors that will come in new
colors so black pink and grey but a big
upgrade with them is they have extra
battery life now they used to only be
able to stream music for one and a half
hours now they can do up to five hours
of tribute from your phone and come with
this case which gives them another full
charge as well so the Samsung gear
sports is really the big highlight for
this and for myself I'm wearing at the
moment together with the wristbands and
as you actually really quite like it
it's still quite a chunky watch as most
pseudo smartwatches are these days but
the difference between this and gear is
free which is not going to replace it's
going to sit alongside the gears free be
a little bit cheaper is that this is a
thinner watch it doesn't have any LTE or
3G options for connectivity but that
sail saves on thickness saves and weight
and when I put it on I actually feel
really comfortable with it I feel like
this is in terms of ergonomics close to
the gear s2 rather than the gear s free
it has this rotating bezel on the front
which sits on a bit of a more
rectangular base and the separation
between the three things the more
layered design kind of hides the bulk
and the size of this watch which I like
it also reminds me of some diver watches
are now Samsung has been deliberate in
looking at existing traditional watch
designs you know horology traditions and
this watch can also track swimming both
are rated to 5 atmospheres of pressure
which means 50 metres underwater so
that's much better waterproofing than
I've e68 which has been the standard up
until now so the give sport comes in a
choice of either black or blue silicon
strap but Samsung is doing a whole bunch
of other straps which is going to do
with color and design match watch bases
and also these are standard 20
millimeter straps so you can interchange
it with any watch strap you already have
Samsung is partnering with Under Armour
Spotify and speedo for its applications
to enhance the whole fitness / exercise
device thing so with Under Armour you
get access to all of the apps that have
special apps made for Tizen which is
what this watch runs and seven Spotify
you can load your music on to here or
you can use this as a remote control for
music playing back to the phone and
speedo has a specific swimming tracking
app which is preloaded on this watch as
well personally I'm not really
interested in the wireless connectivity
of the gear as free so losing that but
gaining a nicer design in my opinion
just makes this a better watch so as far
as I'm concerned this is going to be
cheaper lighter more ergonomic and just
nicer than the gear is free so that's an
overview of Samsung's new devices here
at Eva 2017 I'm liking the new gear
sports I'm still not convinced but
smartwatches is general class but I love
Samsung's interface Samsung's Tizen
operating system I think it's nicer than
Android wear I think it's one of the
nicer interfaces I love Samsung's
rotating bezels and I think this is one
of the better watches out there in its
category in class
