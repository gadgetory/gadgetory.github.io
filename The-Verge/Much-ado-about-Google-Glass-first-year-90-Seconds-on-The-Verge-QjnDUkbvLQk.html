it go traveling or you can buy a
computer to wear on your face we're not
judging i'm ross miller and this is 90
seconds on the verge for one day only on
tuesday april fifteenth google will let
anyone in the US purchase a glass
headset for fifteen hundred dollars plus
tax you can choose from one of five
colors and it will include free frames
or sunglass shades it's been almost one
year to the day since Google starts
shifting its headset to the glass
explorers and it's gotten better so it's
the very beginning Google glass has been
touted as a way to share your view with
the world as well as a way to get
information without pulling at your
phone google has continued to update
both the software and hardware and
third-party developers have been
contributing various apps simply put
there's just more to do with the thing
now Google itself even created a few
mini games though admittedly you look
really silly when you play them and
let's not mince words here even one year
later it still feels weird to wear the
thing in public while celebrities
athletes and fashion models have all
been seen trying out glass most early
adopters have been developers and tech
enthusiasts and much of the coverage
about glass has been about privacy
concerns and public etiquette it's
enough that Google has made its own list
of do's and don'ts to help explorers
avoid these faux paws and that's one of
the reasons why Google isn't selling
glass on mass yet it's not that there
are more people to pay fifteen hundred
dollars it's just not comfortable to
think about people around us wearing a
camera eye level but Google is banking
on us as a culture kind of getting used
to it eventually for more on Google
glass check out the verge coming up we
check out Facebook's filling it's right
here tweener teeth and post everything
you say straight to your wall turns out
I say some weird things in my sleep</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
