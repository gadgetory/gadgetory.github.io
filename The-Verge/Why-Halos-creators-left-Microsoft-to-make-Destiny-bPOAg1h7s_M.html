and I basically wasted my entire weekend
last week playing the destiny beta
testing is the first game from Bungie
after the whole halo thing we've
happened to have Chris Grant the editor
in chief of polygon what up hey hey what
is this time on the destiny how long has
it been going on to make who going to
come out this September 2014 they
announced a partnership with Activision
in 2010 that's the game in 2013 but it's
been develop about five years
ok that's a lot it's like most games but
to three year cycle
yeah everyone so while you'll have
something a little bit longer but that
five year number represents not only a
huge investment on bungees part on
Activision sparked the numbers that they
release or five hundred million dollars
for the game this is a big game this
isn't a this isn't your run-of-the-mill
shooter
this isn't halo this is something closer
to over Warcraft they don't ever use the
word MMO which is what the world
Warcraft is a dirty word it is since
it's a shooter where you level up you do
these kind of grinding raid that's why
our provisions making this investment
they've got on the PC side on the
Blizzard side of the company they have
World of Warcraft they've got these
games that are for a lot of people very
difficult very impenetrable shooters on
the console how can we get some of
that's sticking as some of that
engagement a really high engagement they
have on the PC side on World of Warcraft
on T hablo Starcraft how do we get that
on the consoles and a shooter is kind of
their Trojan horse to get that connected
gameplay experience into people living
room right why couldn't they do this
with Microsoft why isn't this part of
the system of that I think you know
Bungie made the Halo series the Halo
series made the Xbox they were wholly
owned by Microsoft they were moved from
Chicago out to Washington State and they
saw when the supposed to be 60 launched
and halo 3 came out big hit but they
also saw Gears of War made by an
independent studio epic sell make a lot
of money make a lot of its developers
very rich and these guys were owned
outright by Microsoft they got some
bonuses but they weren't getting rich
so they wanted to go independent and I
think the quid pro quo is will make some
more Halo games for you if you let us go
if not we're all going to leave why do
this beta why it release a huge chunk of
the game for free propose to play that
an alpha actually before the beta and
them the Alpha gave us Peter Dinklage's
now famous that Wizard is from the moon
what is up with that voice I'm sorry
just what is with that voice or it's the
worst thing I've ever heard the hive
haven't been on earth in centuries that
wizard came from the moon the Dinklage
is performance my favorite personally
we'll see how it does but I think what
would Bungie wanted to do with the Alpha
and the beta was to kind of for them
technically validate a lot of these
shared server shared gameplay models
they talked about where you're playing
and your friends are coming in and out
of your experience very seamlessly
you're having these large events they
wanted to kind of validate all this
stuff before they released it if you
don't validate your server
infrastructure you get battlefield right
we just like crash yeah yeah it didn't
work for three to six months Bungie to
it's crept like the game launched on
PlayStation 4 and it worked awesome they
had six million users died now it's like
it was a huge beta and I think that
really proved the sort of scale of what
they're looking to do with a with a half
a billion dollar price tag the thing has
to be a hit right well thanks for
hanging out with us for more on destiny
check out the verge and polygon and next
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
