am here looking at intel's first adam
powered smartphone and Jeff's going to
give us a quick walk through here of the
Android UI and some of the games and the
apps that you guys are able to run now
right sure yeah absolutely so again this
is the atom based until smartphone
reference design it's been optimized for
Android this particular version is
running Gingerbread a lot of different
the dances we have on this particular
phone the things over particularly proud
of is the gaming performance on the
smartphone itself so what I'm going to
do is going to start a game here this is
asphalt 6 from from from Gameloft and
this particular game is a very popular
game that's in the android market today
I've already started someone to resume
and everybody can see how bad I can
drive here but the graphics on it are
stunning the performance is actually
wonderful and we've also in a really
good job of optimizing power efficiency
so it's very energy-efficient it as well
but is a good example of just a very
popular game out there well with one
hand yeah it's a little difficult but
yeah I'm getting there I'm getting there
so that's an example again a popular
game as I crashed into the barrier from
Gameloft running us off the Intel
platform itself when i exit that and
that game wasn't recon recompiled or
that that's an example of him actually
that was recompiled specifically they
optimize it for our platform okay
there's an example the game that wasn't
the one that weapon yeah there's an
example again that wasn't I mean
everybody knows this game this is angry
birds typical angry birds game itself
but the neat thing about this game is
this is a standard game that was
actually compiled for another
instruction set meaning in another chip
set architecture but it's running like
any other game would run on top of top
of the Intel Architecture so what I'm
going to do here
Kyle angry birds take out a couple of
pics again not the most exciting them in
the whole world but what it means is
that for all the wild birds how to do it
got it yeah everybody every had angry
birds and so obviously that's running on
the platform as well all right great can
you just give me a sort of a quick
walkthrough to see just sort of the
different windows that are the pains
sure yeah you know it's typical just I
want to see how fast everything goes
yeah yeah you know it's again it's a
typical android based platform so all
the typical user experience that people
know from the gingerbread operating
system itself are here so you know
you've got all your applications that
are running to the market from this sure
absolutely yeah so let me go back here
wonderful get into connection inside the
center always loves of fun but as you
can see this is the standard market
itself you know top free top a top
feature so the typical marketplace will
be and everybody with an android-based
smartphone knows perfect well thanks so
much for the demo you got it thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
