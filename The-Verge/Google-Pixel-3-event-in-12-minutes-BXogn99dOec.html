anniversary so let's talk about what
we've been working on first for life on
the go we design the world's best camera
and put it in the world's most helpful
phone introducing the beautiful new
pixel three for life at working in play
we're bringing the power and
productivity of a desktop to a gorgeous
tablet called pixel slate and for life
at home we designed a smart display so
you can hear and see the info you need
and manage your connected home from a
single screen introducing Google home
hub and here they are coming up here in
the pedestals for the first time seen in
real life let me tell you about how
we've reimagined Google for the home
with Google home hub we've redesigned
Google's most helpful services like
search YouTube Maps calendar and photos
so they're easily controllable with your
voice and provide glanceable help you
can also choose from four beautiful
colors to complement any room we also
consciously did not put a camera on hub
so that it was comfortable to use in the
private spaces of your home like your
bedroom we wanted to make sure that hub
is not an bright glowing screen in your
home so we made sure that hub can
respond automatically to the ambient
light in the room finally we also wanted
hub to be a communal device one that
works for everyone in your home so let
me call up mark one of our product
managers to show you how in action with
hub I can just say hey Google good
morning
good morning mark the time is 9 a.m.
currently in San Francisco it's 64 and
sunny the best way to get to work by
cars via US 101 south and will take 45
minutes there are 11 entries in your
calendar by the way remember to pick up
eggs for dinner tonight because have
recognized my voice it tells me
everything I need to know while I'm
finishing up my cup of coffee you can
simply use your voice to get help in the
kitchen you can set multiple timers you
can find out how many Ounces are in a
cup you can even figure out what to cook
for dinner tonight
now I like to tell you a little bit more
about YouTube onhub the YouTube
experience has been optimized so I've
access to a ton of how-to videos just by
using my voice with YouTube music you
can easily find the perfect song video
or artists through December hub comes
with six months of YouTube's premium on
us including add free videos and our new
youtube music streaming service but
sometimes it's really hard to disconnect
and enjoy time with friends and family
hub can help with that too just put hub
into downtime mode and it won't interact
with anyone in the house except for
those critical things like alarms with
filters you can ensure that everyone in
the home is enjoying family-friendly
content you can even see the state of
your entire home at a glance with hub
we're introducing home view with a swipe
down from the top of the screen you can
bring up a simple dashboard the
dashboard shows you the state of your
entire home at a quick glance so you can
turn down the temperature in the bedroom
and turn up the music in the living room
and we're providing the same level of
control even if you're not near your hub
we've redesigned the Google map to be
the mobile controller for your smart
home it has the same home view dashboard
as hub so now you can control all your
devices from any phone even when you're
not at home so we made sure that hub was
deeply integrated with nest devices like
nest camera nest thermostat and even
hello doorbell so for instance if you're
having dinner and
someone happens during your doorbell hub
will automatically show you at the front
door and you can tap a quick response or
use your voice to let your guests know
that you'll be right there home view
lets you control over 200 million
devices from over a thousand brands many
of them in your home today so now with a
simple tap or with your voice you can
control your dish hopper DVR your
chromecast your vizio tv and even your
Philips you light bulb you can pre-order
Google Home Hub on the Google store
today for a hundred and forty nine
dollars and it's also available on
October 22nd at retail locations here in
the US UK and Australia last year Chrome
OS took a big step forward with the
introduction of apps from the Google
Play Store and also with the
introduction of helpfulness from the
Google assistant and today we're sharing
a new chapter for our vision for Chrome
OS with the launch of Google pixel slate
we designed pixel slate to be both thin
and light it's crafted with beautiful
lines and rounded edges in a stylish
midnight blue pixel slate is engineered
with a stunning detailed display so
sitting back to enjoy a movie is better
than ever
it has 293 pixels per inch that's 6
million pixels for the sharpest picture
in the category so with pixel slate
we've positioned the speakers on the
front of the device so they can direct
stereo sound towards you it's also a
great device for cord cutters and
nothing brings us to life better than
YouTube TV we're excited to give you
three months of YouTube TV with the
purchase of a new pixel slate or pixel
book we're bringing some of that same
innovative engineering to pixel slates 8
megapixel front facing and rear facing
cameras we've also designed the front
facing camera to be perfect for video
chat it has a wide-angle lens so you can
fit everyone in the frame in a sensor
with larger pixels which allows for
excellent low-light performance
check out the reconfigured launcher
instead of hunting for the app you need
machine learning customizes the launcher
just for you you can easily multitask
with features like split screen which
lets you seamlessly shift between work
and play and now with pixel slate the
Google assistant is even more deeply
integrated within Chrome OS simply use
your voice and the assistant can help
you find a restaurant dictate an email
or play your favorite show pixel slates
power button doubles as a fingerprint
sensor so you can unlock it just as
quickly and securely as you do your
pixel phone the keyboard connects to
pixel slate in a snap no pairing or
charging needed just connect it and
start typing the folio is infinitely
adjustable so you can comfortably use it
at any angle you'd like pixel slate
comes in several configurations starting
at $5.99 pixel slate keyboard is $1.99
and picks a book pen now in matching
midnight blue is $99 all three will be
available later this year on the Google
store and at major retailers in the US
Canada and the UK
finally it's time to talk about phones
Google pixel 3 is designed from the
inside out to be the smartest most
useful device in your life excel 3 comes
in three colors just black clearly white
and a new color which is not pink the
new pixel comes in to display sizes the
five and a half inch pixel 3 and the 6
point 3 inch pixel three XL both of them
share the same features but we know
users who want a bigger phone really
want a bigger screen so we've designed
pixel 3 excels screen to extend all the
way to the upper corners her front
firing stereo speakers are 40% louder
and richer than last year
pixel 3 is the first phone that ships
with a new youtube music streaming
experience and we're giving it the pixel
you pixel owners on us for 6 months
everyone raves about the pixel camera
and today the smartest camera gets even
better with the pixel 3
you can still miss the perfect shot if
you don't hit the shutter at exactly the
right moment top shot solves that
problem top shot oughta quickly mildly
captures alternate shots in HDR plus so
your timing wasn't perfect it will
suggest a better one you can also scroll
through the alternates and save one of
those instead
and then there's super resume instead of
shooting a grainy photo pixel three
shoots a burst of photos each a bit
different taking advantage of the
natural tiny movements of your hand you
can guess what happens next
you run the variations through a merging
algorithm to create a beautiful zoomed
in shot so you can get closer to the
details and frame your shot the way you
want another feature that we're really
excited about is night sight night sight
works so well you'll never use your
flash again an extreme low light returns
machine learning to choose the right
colors based on the content of the image
so we added a second camera on the front
that captures a hundred and eighty four
percent more of the scene than iPhone
10's the difference is striking you
aren't just getting more people in the
frame you're getting more details we've
evolved a are stickers to what we now
call playground and both sit into both
the front and rear cameras this year we
integrated google lens directly into the
pixel three camera pointed at a takeout
menu and lens will pull out the phone
number to call point at a movie poster
to click through to the URL so now when
you're where your friends wearing a cool
new pair of sunglasses or you see some
shoes you like in a magazine you can use
lens to find them online and browse
similar styles so here's a quick list of
some of the other features you'll see in
our demo area later photo booth mode
automatically snaps photos with a smile
or when you make a funny face no shutter
button needed with motion autofocus just
tap on people puppies or anything else
that won't host dull and they'll stay in
focus as they move around the frame and
one of the best acts books of pixel 3 is
free unlimited storage at original
quality you'll never have to worry about
storing syncing or finding your photos
and we're going even further to help you
with phone calls with our new call
screen feature when you get that call
and you can't or don't want to pick up
just tap the screen call button and your
phone will answer for you and ask who's
calling and why as you can see here the
conversation is transcribed in real-time
on your screen call screen launches
today with pixel 3 in the US and comes
to the entire pixel family next month so
we've developed a feature we call flip
to shush an easy gesture to minimize
distractions just turn your phone upside
down on the table your pixel will take
the hint and mute sounds and
notifications we're excited to introduce
the smartest wireless charger ever the
new pixel stand it charges your pixel 3
super fast even through cases pixel 3 is
available for pre-order now starting at
$7.99 and pixel stand is $79 pixel 3
will arrive on October 18th in the US
through Verizon and unlocked on the
Google store in project fie on November
1st it will be available in 12 more
markets including four new ones this
year France Ireland Japan and Taiwan
