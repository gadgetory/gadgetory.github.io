and you're probably seeing a bunch of
reviews for the BlackBerry probe but
ours isn't quite ready yet because our
first unit was actually defective but we
have a new one here and it seems pretty
good so I just wanted to walk through
seven quick things that I know and
actually love about the BlackBerry print
so the first thing is that it is the
first BlackBerry device running full
Android it is straight Android it's
android 5.1 lollipop and it has some
blackberry customizations on top the
second thing to know and probably the
most important thing is that it's a
blackberry so it has a physical keyboard
and the physical keyboard is pretty good
as physical keyboards go yes you can
type faster on a touchscreen but a
physical physical keyboard lets you see
the whole screen when you're typing
which is really a nice advantage really
quick about the hardware I think it's
really good it's a five point four inch
screen it's actually curved around the
sides and the back is really Rippey when
there's this 18 megapixel camera here
it's really grippy so you can hold on to
it and like I mean look at that I mean
okay so the keyboard let's talk about
that a little bit so we're going to jump
into a compose message here in the hub
and one of the things you can do is you
can swipe up to just autocomplete
letters and it's a little bit tricky so
it doesn't always work but you can swipe
down to just get symbols and then my
favorite thing is you can DoubleTap on
it and then you move into cursor mode
and you can just slide your finger on
the keyboard to move the cursor which is
really convenient and now BlackBerry's
added a bunch of software customizations
on top of Android but they're really not
that bad they're actually pretty good so
it's secure there's a security out a
piece of software called D Tech which
tells you what is going good and bad
with your device you can also swipe up
from the home button to get three
shortcuts Google now blackberry hub
actually whatever you want and the
BlackBerry hub itself is like a lot of
good ideas it takes all of your incoming
email and tweets and some Facebook stuff
bbm and puts it in one giant bucket and
you can set all kinds of crazy filters
to do stuff on it really good idea
although it's a little bit too much
noise for me as far as specs go it has a
Qualcomm 808 processor 3ds Ram
two gigs of storage and it's expandable
storage and the camera is an 18
megapixel camera which is actually
pretty good even in low-light although I
will say it's pretty slow so the last
thing about the probe is it is short for
the privilege of privacy which is about
the corniest thing i've ever heard
anybody say about a phone it is $699
which is pretty expensive and in the US
it's available on AT&amp;amp;T we will have a
full review of this thing very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
