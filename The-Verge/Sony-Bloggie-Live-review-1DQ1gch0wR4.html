this is the Sony Bloggie live it's
reminiscent of the flip cameras that
Cisco killed but it's actually
better-looking than a lot of the flip
models were it's made of brushed metal
and it has the heft of a cell phone as
you hold it it's got a power button and
a shutter button for taking still photos
on one side and there's a USB arm and a
tripod mount on the bottom the USB arm
is it's nice to have but it's actually
really small and it takes up a lot of
space on your computer when you plug it
in there's an extension cord for the USB
arm but it's kind of a pain to have to
lug around another cable and kind of
defeats the purpose of having it in the
camera anyway there's a micro HDMI port
underneath a port flap the LCD is touch
enabled and actually worked pretty well
it's not the best screen we've seen it
mutes colors a little bit and it's
pixels are really easy to identify but
it gets the job done fine and the touch
experience is actually better than we
thought it might be the camera actually
has Wi-Fi inside which lets it do things
like share your videos and photos to
Facebook or YouTube or Picasa and doing
all that is really simple you just
connect to a Wi-Fi network and then with
a tap or two can put a video straight to
your YouTube account if you want there
are a couple of annoyances with doing
that to save battery the Wi-Fi radio
actually shuts off every time it's not
being used so anytime you want to upload
anything there's about a ten-second wait
while you connect to the network before
it'll even start uploading you can
earmark videos or photos to be uploaded
when you connect so you can set it to do
them all at once and then only deal with
connecting wants you can upload photos
and videos to Facebook YouTube Picasa
Flickr and dailymotion or you can use
Sony's new player memories online
service to upload and store everything
in Sony's cloud and you can access it
from any web browser but the most unique
thing the blog you live can do is
actually livestream footage from the
camera it connects through quick and
once you set up an account you can start
streaming from the camera really quickly
and you can see it in a web browser or
on mobile apps users can share the
stream or even can comment on the stream
as they're watching it and you see
comments on your camera as you're
filming when you're done live-streaming
your footage automatically gets uploaded
too quick so you can see it later as a
video there are a couple of challenges
with the quick live streaming one it
obviously requires Wi-Fi and two it only
will live stream at a 320 by 240
resolution other than the connected
features the Bloggie live really is as
simple and as good a camcorder as most
the flip cameras work it'll shoot video
at 1080p at 30 frames per second or 720p
at 60 frames per second plus a lot of
different lower resolutions videos
occasionally to contrast II which makes
the whole video look a little bit darker
than it should but generally especially
for such a small and expensive device it
looks really good the camera can also
shoot 12 megapixel photos but it doesn't
do it as well photos are fine in good
lighting as long as you don't have any
motion but as a still camera it's not
nearly as good and in low-light pictures
are basically unusable the Bloggie live
comes with as much as 8 gigabytes of
storage which is enough for about three
hours obtain a DP video and that works
out because that's about as long as the
battery lasts to overall Bloggie life is
a great camcorder it's as simple to use
as any of the flip cameras and is
probably better made but unless you
really want the live streaming or the
sharing features you probably don't need
a camera that's expensive at $249 it's
pretty expensive for this range of
camcorders and Sony's made other Bloggie
cameras like the touch and the Bloggie
duo both of which shoot video and photos
that are at least as good as the Bloggie
live but they don't have some of the
connected features so if you don't need
the Wi-Fi and the connected features
you're probably better off saving your
money and going with one of those or
looking for a flip cam</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
