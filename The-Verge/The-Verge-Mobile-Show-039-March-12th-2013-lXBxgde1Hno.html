am I'm dieter bohn we have a whole group
of people whole huge group of people
here so let's just run through everybody
that's here it's gonna be amazing I'm
glad savile i'm dan seifert i'm chris
sigler and we have a special guest David
Pierce well hello I'm Jay welcome to my
horrendous intro cuz I was been been
waiting to start for the past two
minutes and then it kind of came and I
wasn't ready at all and so I just want
to point out that that at this point
David Pierce's fame and infamy has has
exceeded our own due to the premiere of
his own program his own weekly program
which I think we're all pretty excited
about facial fame is a little strong I
think it but don't be modest it's it's
Fame it's just straight-up thing well
say yeah the problem I have with cops
shelf is that it's so professional it
makes us look like the morons that we
are and it's true the beauty of that is
I have literally nothing to do with that
that's like that's all these people
behind me who I come down here and like
swear into a camera for an hour and then
suddenly it looks good actually actually
disagree with DJ I think we're exactly
its professional is David it's just that
we spread it out among all four of us
and we also I the next time but yes and
the problem is that we also magnify or
unprofessionalism by four times so it's
true right so last week you guys did
sony yeah and can you can you tell us
what's coming next week there's a big
secret uh well coming this week we have
some of the same stuff we're going to
talk about today actually the the HTC
One and the Xperia Z and we're also
going to talk with Tom warned about some
of the cool stuff you saw Microsoft this
week or last week I guess um that's
gonna be fun I'm looking forward to it
but I'm Way more excited about this if
I'm being honest top shelf is whatever
but this is way better actually as long
as we're like talking about ourselves
and we're just gonna continue doing it
david has the New York office behind
which is really exciting yes it's
awesome you should all move to New York
immediately just come hang out with me
it's basically a 24-hour love fest over
there I and I was talking to a to jour
in one of our esteemed video guys who is
saying that if only the new office had a
shower he would literally never leave
and he wasn't joking you will be playing
around um okay I'm done talking about us
we should talk about mobile stuff I
think and I think most important news is
from a couple of weeks ago I got my
orange iphone i would agree so our last
broadcast we unfortunately couldn't do
video so dieter could not show off his
orange iphone yeah so it's been bugging
him for for two weeks now like has been
weeks now how's the power button there
is it yeah its needs it's a little bit
janky no it didn't get fully cleaned out
but although that it's great so but no
okay the really big news is that we have
reviews and I think there's two big
reviews there's that HTC One and the
Sony Xperia Z um let's start with the
one I think because it's I think 02 is
is selling pre-orders so it's available
to some people now in Europe but HTC
kind of just said that everybody else
gonna have to wait a little bit longer
than they had planned but that's you
know they didn't have a firm release
date anyway so it's like it's delayed
from a thing that we didn't know about
in the first place yeah they haven't
said anything at all about the US yet
right now nope shape that I'm aware of
um Oh flats got one I'm the one but
listen they did talk about it because he
said a whole loaf and I don't know if
it's a love affair I mean so the the
thing to me was it's it's a really good
phone like I'm personally kind of a
sucker for hardware design and I kind of
had this like visceral reaction to this
phone where I just keep like touching it
and I just want to use it for things and
like it's it's not a very good TV remote
yet I've forced myself to use it as my
TV remote because I just like holding it
on but the thing that was really
interesting to me was HTC really pitched
two things as like the future of HTC and
the reason this phone is the best and
one is the camera and one is sense and
blinkfeed and stuff like that and
actually think those are in some ways
the the wii
iker parts of the phone like they're
fine the camera i think is good and does
a lot of interesting things i'm actually
curious what you guys think cuz there's
been some interesting debate about what
makes a good cell phone camera on but i
think that that blinkfeed is sort of
cool like this Flipboard thing on your
home screen is nifty but I wound up
moving it to a second home screen and
going back to a normal home screen and I
think the camera is fine but it's not
nearly as good as I wanted it to be on
ya I want to I want to get way into the
camera because there was a ton of hope
that HTC was finally gonna blow up the
megapixel myth and we're going to stop
this race to more and more megapixels we
don't need 13 megapixel cameras or 16
megapixel cameras or whatever so they
went down to four and they're
ultrapixels everybody knows the story
but like the proof is in the pictures
and the pictures look pretty soft to me
yeah i mean that's that's the thing I
keep coming back to like it'sit's
incredible in low light on that they're
big pitch was you know we have these
bigger pixels that take in more light at
a time and that's true it takes in a ton
of light and I I would take I took a
bunch of pictures with the iphone 5 and
then with the one and universally in
every case the one photo was brighter
and a lot of times the iphone 5 just
wasn't usable because it was dark and
the one would look totally passable and
that's great and I'm psyched about that
and in a lot of ways that's better than
what any other camera out there offers
but photos are just soft and like you
you zoom in and you get this kind of
moshe noise reduction anything that just
doesn't look sharp and it to me kind of
kills the vibe of the whole photo when
nothing looks particularly clear and
crisp in terms of low light performance
would you take the one over a 920 uh
there it's it's hit or miss i think it's
they're both really really good is the
point and I think the one to me is I
think a little bit better because it's I
don't know it just seemed to render
colors a little better than the Lumia
920 but they're both really good and
they're both leaps and bounds beyond any
of their competitors so what's your take
on the Zoe Zoe is its I it was another
thing that I wanted to be cool and it is
and like
for action shots and stuff it's nifty
and it's fun to like actually scrub back
through a video and then be like that's
the shot I wanted to get and I've always
kind of wondered why you couldn't do
that in just regular video footage and
now you can and it works great but they
have this whole sharing set up that I
just don't think people are ever gonna
really use and you have to remember to
turn it off which is sort of annoying
cuz i would take like landscape shots
that you don't need as always for and i
would take like 67 shots before i knew
what i was doing and then going back
through all those was kind of a pain
well i'm gonna get this button the
toggle Zoe's like all the way on the
other side of the phone from the rest of
the controls right so like you've got
your camera you've got your video and
then you got a toggle for Zoe like
completely separate which seems insane
to me yeah totally um and but again it's
it's really cool I was playing soccer on
Saturday and shooting with it then and
being able to get like you get these
action shots of like the moment
somebody's foot hits the ball that you
wouldn't get with a phone otherwise
because there's always shutter lag and
weirdness like that so it's a great
thing to have but again i don't know if
it's like this game-changing feature
that HTC is kind of setting it up to be
so i just because zoe of david talking
about the zoe which was fun david good
take a zoe your flag showing my talking
about sign her longer I do love it wow
you did way too excited about the show
be okay hang on so I'm from gallery and
is David and that's the other thing the
gallery is now kind of customized so
you've got Zoe's coming to life and just
kind of doing little animations for you
and there's David still talking about
the Zoe he can't stop talking about it
and all right well the display actually
looks over it falls in the webcam but i
agree with egg these are we things of
fun they kind of like vines insofar as
because they're limited uh you know I
mean they're like three seconds we had
this discussion with dieter second is it
three seconds or four seconds man I
don't know but the point is you get
these really brief video clips and just
like vines you kind of have to start
coming up with creative ways to use them
and the thing I noticed the first she's
always that I took was I would press the
capture button and then there's
so we would capture me turning the phone
around to review the photo which was fun
no no but seriously like having this
invitation of three or four seconds and
having to do something fun with it and
then coming up with something that is
coherent and makes sense and that you
can post or Twitter or wherever is
actually quite satisfying so I agree
it's a it's a gimmick but it's one of
those gimmicks that you can definitely
see you so fooling around with for quite
a bit time definitely so I want to go
back and talk about the low-light
performance a little bit because you
know Zoe's are cool and all but that's a
novelty that's going to wear off but so
it seems to me what happened here with
the the ones camera is that HTC wanted
to be the best in low light so it's
doing these ultra pixels which are
bigger pixels and supposed to let in
more light but I don't think that at
just the pixels alone were enough for
HTC to get where it wanted to be as far
as the low light capture so then it
layered on all of this noise or diet and
and that's what's ruining the sharpness
on all of these photos and really kind
of you know the worst thing in the world
whereas if they had not if they had
scaled back on the noise reduction it
maybe not quite made it as impressive on
the extreme low light end we probably
would have had better pictures overall
from the bright to the dark and whatever
so can they have dynamically adjusted
depending on lighting conditions what
kind of all sure they do I'm sure as it
raises up sent sensitivity the noise
reduction gets greater but you know it
seems to be too strong on all levels
tita they'll do dynamic adjustments is
just that they all kind of suck that's
pretty much standard for all of the
software but I mean that make it raises
a really good point and the other thing
is it's really disappointing at 4
megapixels to see the noise reducing for
the smudging things up and getting the
web sharpness and detail because you can
forgive it with a 12 megapixel camera or
12 megapixels in air quotes because once
you step it down to four or five
megapixels the pictures look sharp where
is with these guys it's essentially
either you get a really high quality
picture 4 megapixels or you screw and
broadly speaking I do find that
camera technology seems to kind of
stagnated and either not advance or even
take a step back because I remember
maybe where we were had the advert for
in the f-4s galaxy s2 galaxy s free
those have some really excellent cameras
like I'm actually convince the iPhone 5
has a better camera I don't know how you
guys feel the galaxy s2 had a fantastic
camera exactly yeah right so when we had
those phones it was very natural that
provision was always better image
quality but now I think I feel like guys
might be compromising on quality to make
the phone spinner well as far as the
iphone 5 goes i can say that comparative
to the for the 4s in extreme low light
conditions it's much better I've taken
side-by-side photos with them and the
defy the five I don't know if it's a
software tweak or just a boosting of the
sensor the five lets in a lot more light
in extreme low light situations in
normal situations it's it's you know
negligible difference but as far as you
know it breakthroughs in the technology
the idea that I think HTC is on the
right track as far as minimizing the
pixels and increasing the pixel size I
just think that you know they went a
step too far to try and be the absolute
best in low light and beat the blind 20
and maybe even get to where the 808 is
as far as low-light capabilities are and
they went way too far as with the noise
reduction which is a little
disappointing because I would have
rather had you know good low-light
photos that aren't like the best I've
ever seen on the extremely low light
spectrum of just like taking a picture
with one candle but had better pictures
all across the board yeah so one that's
so are we basically saying the cameras
like it's fine but it's still like it
doesn't live up to what what we were
hoping like it's not a swing and a Miss
but it's it's like it it's like a ground
rule double yeah I mean I think it's
even like I would even go so far as to
call it like an above average camera for
where we are now I mean it at HCC made
what's kind of a calculated bet that
like most people are not going to look
at the hundred percent view of their
photos most people want to take pictures
and put them on Instagram or Facebook
and in that case like these photos
mostly look fine like you're
a 1024 x 1024 picture on Instagram so
you're not zooming in and seeing the
softness and the machinist and you are
getting a brighter picture then you
would get otherwise so like that's a
totally worthy trade off but for people
who really care about the quality of
their photos whether you're on you know
whether you're posting them to flickr or
just saving them and wanting to use them
it's it's definitely a step down from
some of the best cameras out there and
even like the 1x or the droid DNA both
take good sharp pictures and and they
got away from that in this case to do
something else and i think it works in a
lot of situations and doesn't work in
others it is just to say that was a
really complicated baseball analogy head
i had to like think we threw this ground
devils and what not that's about
american glad it also just comes
naturally to everybody else is easier
when you're eating apple pie and
watching baseball alright i'm kidding
i'm tease way to help Doug on top so
what's it like actually using blinkfeed
I'm curious about this I you do anything
under the skin I think everybody without
exception just turned on this phone
looks at bling feed and it was like okay
how do I set my home screen to be not
bling fee which is exactly what I did I
did exactly the same thing as David
actually want to talk about the display
on this phone because again you just
kind of getting pushed out by my
terrible terrible webcam but it is great
to stunning and I think this universal
women among all of us that this might be
once again the best display in mobile
devices that crown was held by the HTC
One X which chris reviewed and basically
wrote an ode to how beautiful it is and
this is still 4.7 inches but changes
resolution from sounds way to 1080p and
it's like it's beautiful one thing that
concerned me in your review David was
when you said that like you found that
you had to like cup your hand over the
display to see it in indirect light is
that like a serious problem no I mean I
think it's it's most phones are that way
um but I it's funny every time I meet
with a company that makes anything
the screen which is constantly they talk
about how it's better laminated and so
the glare is down twenty eight percent
and you'll see it and it's just not true
like these things are still super
reflective are going if you can
eliminate this anymore than it is no you
can't and and like I think it's just it
this is the world we live in like if
you're outside and it's super sunny
you're going to have trouble seeing your
phone unless it's so bright that you can
like watch the battery died and this is
not that and like it's no worse than any
other phone we have for sure yeah go
grab a visor prism and take it outside
and come back and talk I don't want to
do that I'm not doing okay you can
actually really see the view dangos now
where I'm showing it and and you just
stupid like I said you call laminates it
anymore like is he on weight loss the
Glen what is on the girls Vlad we're
going to happen is that at next year's
HTC event they're gonna be like you're
thinking about lamination all wrong like
fundamentally rethought lemon this is
ultra lamination where the glass is the
display there was yeah I mean basically
in order to step up lamination from here
you have to do like magnetic levitation
above the display you have to do a
hologram it's like that but I mean David
Davis point is true reflectivities
reflectivity it's kind of meh Malaysia
couldn't go so far to rectify these are
closer displays like if we don't want
well if we want really saturated color
riche punchy exciting devices that when
you walk to store grab your attention we
have to deal with the reflectivity
otherwise I keep talking about the old
IBM thinkpad displays which your color
accurate but they were muted and Matt
and nobody was particularly excited
orgasmic about them so nobody's making
that choice nobody is offering this man
this place other than actually screen
protectors there's some really nice
screen protectors that term this play
mat yeah but scripture to the worst
things ever me all of it so wait why
aren't there matte screen displays now
thinking about this like I I always
every time I review a laptop that has a
matte does he play I'm like yes Matt
display is why because well i mean the
glossy displays make your blacks look
deep
makes your address higher and everything
so when it's in a store it's in on a
display shelf every lesson or with all
matte display these are plastic anyway
right yeah yeah yeah I mean I guess if
you have the ground glasses and sort the
glass is reflected yeah and they're
heavier and thicker too I guess so it's
fair enough but let this reduce let's
let's kind of talking about hardware
because there's a bunch of people who
scold us about into hardware centric and
how the hardware respects of matts its
proper use experience and the other the
other and this is where i actually i
think david and i might disagree because
i feel like every new android phone is
kind of like the old android phones i
just can't build up any excitement
whereas take it is falling in love so
instead of listening to me bitch about
about it let's hear what David is
suicide well so I mean you just defeated
my whole ex parte even I mean if
hardware genuinely doesn't matter then
this phone is not super exciting but I
really believe hardware does matter on
but on the software front i think what
what HTC is done and they've talked
about bringing a lot of their sense 5
stuff to some of their other phones in
coming months and actually think in the
most part that's a really good thing
they've they've scaled sense back and
there's still some messy stuff i
remember when when i first got this
phone dieter was like open the People
app it's terrible on every sense device
ever since history of the world and
that's true it's still bad and confusing
and kind of clunky but it's it's better
and there are a lot of you know easier
ways to get around and the hardware so
good that like even if sense is
overbearing and big and heavy it doesn't
totally destroy the performance of the
phone and like I feel like software's
job in a case like this is just to kind
of get out of the way and let Android do
its thing and let apps work and let the
hardware work and it does there's some
stuff about sense I don't like but it's
it's not nearly as much of a pain as it
used to be like I would turn on the 1x
and just hate the world and my life and
everyone in it and I don't get that at
all with this phone well I mean this is
the story of sense for the past two
years now it's where we keep saying it's
it's okay but it's not as it's not as
bad as it used to be but it's still
sense
right i mean that's essentially that's
the same thing we said about sense for
comparing it to sense 3.5 and 3.6 it's
still sense but it's not as bad as it
used to be but it's not as good as it
could be so here's my take on on sense
like it it was solving problems that we
had when we were using you know three
three-and-a-half inch screens and
android 2.3 it fixed those problem it is
it contested what I've I've right it
fixed all those problems but like now
you know those problems are have been
taken care of in you know the core stock
UI of Android Google fix those problems
right so it was up two cents to like
decide what problems it actually wants
to fix now and um I mean it I suppose
it's still fixing some like you know
contact stuff when you know social
integration in there they fixed they
fixed the home screen with blinkfeed but
like just just updating the UI so it's
actually appropriate to a screen this
size made a world of difference and you
know also throwing in a wicked fast
processor so it didn't get bogged down
yeah I have to say this phone just fit
was very nice and quick I don't think
it's necessarily them to the processor I
think we can give HD credit for their
own software but it is very quick and
responsive so I like that an HTC did do
a couple of things actually really like
so like this is the UH know if you can
see it very well but this is the
multi-tasking menu its tiled instead of
having like the one list going up and so
you get nine apps at a time and it just
looks better um like the homelands kind
of ugly that's a marked improvement over
the one nonsense for yea which is like
the weird 3d thing you had to scroll and
yeah it was awful and then there's like
really good lock screen notifications
and you can swipe right into them and so
like HTC's done some things but then
like why did you change the icons like
they look worse now and you didn't need
to do that and that's kind of HTC's end
game is like let's change a bunch of
things you don't need to and i can't use
dashclock widget on the lock screen
because it's not android 4.2 yeah well
that's the other problem is that this is
probably never gonna get updates and i
said like i said in the review i was
like i want this phone and then
somebody's like should you get this in
the nexus 4 and I was like well I'd buy
this but then ask me again when the
nexus 4 gets key lime pie and this
doesn't and I'm
are being uncontrollably on top of this
phone wanting up yeah no I mean the
other thing to consider and it's
something that we tend to forget is that
the nexus 4 is dramatically cheaper I do
believe yeah I'm not actually sure what
the HTC One pricing is at the moment but
I imagine it's priced the normal way
where is the nexus poorest price to be
awesome price to one margin ear yeah and
move it does unless you're crazy glare a
new triple over pay for it no I know
dude whatever I the nexus 4 before you
did so whatever 600 bucks right man no i
know i only paid like and i paid like
400 or something I don't know I I had to
I'm I to sign up for a month of t-mobile
prepaid to buy it I couldn't buy it
without an account which kind of bugged
me wow I'm already sure the t mobile
sales rep just like took you on that one
it's possible somebody get some mixes
for right now they will have a nexus 4
before I do as well I've never gotten a
hold of one what I do have and it is my
kick-ass Segway is an experience said Z
this is nothing yeah and I'm gonna start
talking about this just by showing you
it's viewing angles exactly as I did
with HTC One and this is see the screen
is a screen on no that's my point it has
turbulence and you know what I think how
the comments to my review have been what
are the view tangos matter man you just
look at it directly I don't know why I'm
any great in our commenters by a
terrible as I making myself you know I'm
very friendly presence but seriously you
and angles do matter in phones like one
thing we don't appreciate how often we
turn our phones on I think when HD were
doing the HTC One briefings they were
saying that people activate their phones
an average of stuff like 200 times a day
400 times it was some crazy crazy number
in the hundreds I was like wait guys are
you serious like what will sort of you
know addicted freaks are you getting
this
data from and it's just what we do is
like you check the weather you turn the
phone on then you forget that you also
wanted to know the time so you turn the
phone on again you might do like seven
times in quick succession so do that a
bunch without realizing it and another
thing will do without realizing is we
look at the phone from side angles a ton
like so much so so many times I have the
phone in my desk stretch your hand out
just turn it on and check for
notifications or whatever I'm not
tilting it so I'm looking directly at it
I'm looking at it from the side and
that's where these viewing angles that's
where these issues come in and sony has
just chronic problem with this and it
just drives me crazy because the
experience that everybody who looks at
it just in pictures is like this is one
of the most attractive most beautiful
phones as a great design it stands out
from anything else it doesn't copy your
eight the iphone it does its own thing
it's beautiful and in turn display on
and lets it down but Vlad I thought that
that the Xperia Z had Bravia Engine 2
how could Sony let us down like this
yeah it's Bravia Engine x2 because it's
like two times is awesome I think you're
missing a branding name in there there's
another one in there too good then oh
there is is a reality engine yes the
reality all right listen reality has bad
viewing angles will be truly download
boot there's also clear Audio plus
whatever that is I don't know it just so
cool be then who is worse on the
branding of their features is it HTC or
is it Sony oh man that is tough yeah
sounds is pretty bad yeah samsung isn't
even in this conversation yeah this boom
sound is and this is camel case it's one
word with camel case right uh but then
you also have Beats Audio it's like what
would the heck is going on here like
boom sound would be it man that's this
only way yeah and you go Oh trip
aggressive if you think about it boom
and beats I don't want my phone to hurt
me well do you remember do you remember
that HTC Rezound commercial from a while
ago were the guys like walking on the
street in the world
really exploding around it like that
that's what they want to happen you yeah
I mean set wolf why we really really
need you actually like get our heads
together and come up with a ranking it
because Samsung is pretty atrocious and
nobody's LG is worst yeah howdy just
takes what Samsung is whatever named it
and then they like write lyrics for you
but that's with Q that's all no no they
run it through a translator and then
they've run it back into like its
original language so like things like
smart stay become wise screen and like
and it just happens over and over again
with all these features that are just
like the same feature but with a corny
your name I don't know it's pretty hard
to be putting s in front of every now
and on the planet and calling it a
samsung price stuff for the swalot
Association wallet is still is a samsung
wallet today they do look I'm I'm still
waiting for the music app s hit I tell
you what they were in terms of branding
actually and I raised this point in the
review Sony is really abusing the
PlayStation brand and in a terrible way
with this PlayStation mobile things
Sony's just killing the PlayStation but
like slowly with every new Playstation
yes and and that that kills me it's
heartbreaking to me seriously like that
somebody actually commented on reddit
saying the virtue of being anti Sony for
so long and and is so wrong because
myself and Eli are like the biggest sony
fanboys I pretty much have to wrestle
with ross miller to get into a Sony
keynote right there's mud wrestling
greco-roman style etc Andros Miller is a
surprisingly powerful guy he's like he's
like this so this out I mean most of us
have grown up with Sony in the nineties
and and just having that as a top-tier
brand for well I I just want to say with
regards to the experience see so many of
us on staff are like we want to play
with it we want to actually like this
and check it and we're really curious
about it and we've been waiting for this
review and we've been anticipating it
and we had high hopes word of course and
like we love its industrial design but
you know i'll let vlad continue because
we totally derail this discussion of the
review but you know it lets us down on
so many levels and it's it's because we
want it to succeed not because we hate
sony or have a bad vibe against Sony or
whatever yeah and like my mother is from
them is that these are fixable issues
like if Sony just fit fix a couple of
things this phone could make tht one
irrelevant as far as I'm concerned like
the first thing I'll fix is give it a
better screen give it a smaller screen
because I mean this thing is 5 inches as
well like that that merits saying it's
just about as tall is the HTC One but
it's wider and it's less economic
because the sides is just so angular and
straight edged which is you know kind of
a sacrifice to do really attractive
design okay kind of live with it but if
you stick a really nice display like in
the one and end the thing that a few
people mentioned to me is that Sony is
making some of the displays in the HTC
One which is just inexcusable wow you're
making the best display on phones with
somebody else and not sticking it in
your own phone but it's it's not branded
mobile bravia to ya hagan some what
you're saying fixed and display I'm
assuming you're gonna get to fix a
camera and then yes fix and software so
basically fix all the things that make a
phone what a phone is and then it would
be sure build a different phone that's
better and then it would be better ah it
has the extra features it has the extra
goodies well listen as far as I'm
concerned I'm guessing the reason
PlayStation mobile places certification
haven't taken off is because Sony
underestimated how much its licensing
costs would be for those classic
PlayStation games and nobody actually
wanted to play ball with with Sony and
just give those games away for free i
don't know what the situation there is
but you can't make it if you come do it
justice just throw it away because
playstation mobile at the moment is like
this crappy-ass secondary app store for
just completely disposable random games
yeah there is no PlayStation action
going on there it was such a huge
opportunity that was just completely
squandered by enemy leading up to the
announcement of the original xperia play
there
was so much hype around the possibility
of what a playstation phone could be and
they have just completely blown it on
every level including a certification
yeah but what it will say is that's
fixable either you do a lesson bishes
version or you just get rid of it so you
don't embarrass yourself in this fashion
the rest the rest of the software is
actually really nice I am a fan of
Sony's Android skin because it's so
light it's actually it might be the one
that's closest to stock it just does a
few to make some top and so I like this
kid's got some funky animations but
otherwise i agree i find it be one of
the more tolerable customizations of
android I don't think the responsiveness
of this device is good enough it has
another quad core processor exactly like
the HTC One but whereas the one feels
futuristically fast and smooth and all
those good things this is not as
responsive it's not as far so so many
needs to sort that out like data says
okay yeah to fix software and the camera
can be so easy to fix like don't give me
a 13-megapixel monstrosity with
supposedly HD are built into the sensor
that's an exmor r no it's an Exmor RS
stats for RS i'm sorry the front facing
camera is x more oh that's that's the
old stuff so with more else now is it
now with an S which like the iphone 4s
is almost indistinguishable from the
known as version but yeah i think you
before i'm just waiting for them to call
the camera and alpha mount just go all
the way yeah i mean this is the other
thing saudi makes awesome displays he
doesn't have one here Sony makes awesome
cameras and sensors because every also
nickel sensor you can think of is made
by sony basically yes Chris me Alice
only I'm not disputing that there's
nothing wrong with that if this if this
show turns into me and damn debating
canon vs nikon i'm not gonna allow it to
happen friend just finally this this
phone is waterproof well they call it
water resistant but you can take it down
to a depth of 1 meter for as long as 30
minutes
and you can take it in the show which oh
that's that's what I want to know that's
what I don't know about this phone is
like does that actually make a
meaningful difference in like how you
use the phone or like what you do with
it or where you take it or like or is it
just it like oh if I get drunk and drop
in the toilet like it maybe won't be a
huge problem if you know a real baby no
I mean the like we love about it but it
wouldn't be any problem I you literally
could drop it I don't know I dropped my
eyes in a urinal once and I thought I
thought long and hard about whether to
retrieve it believe me like it was it
was a serious debate whether to leave
that thing in the urinal you did yes the
philosophical aspect of that is
difficult so the thing with the thing
with the waterproofing is that it's it
can like you know withstand the water
exposure but it's not a rugged phone so
it's not like I think the average user
is still going to probably want to put a
case on this thing anyways because class
but they're gonna drop it in all chatter
I've dropped it twice maybe three times
but like I'm serious like this is cases
on things because they're afraid it's
going to shatter this is their baby soft
clothes like I'm not joking this is
retail person and the way it's being put
together is that the side parts wrap
around the glass so both on the front in
the back it just feels really robust
like it kind of like when I hold this
and use it and drop it because it's
awkward to hold it feels like like any
plastic fold in terms of durability like
good plastic phones not like a pretty
terrible one so I've got no complaints
about it I think I feel like this is one
of the most rugged flagship Android
phones around and this is what drives me
nuts like this waterproofing stuff again
it's a novelty that were off but it's
just so much fun and if you actually
want a high quality phone you can
literally take with you to the beach
without worrying this is it you know
I've done that I've taken a Galaxy Nexus
to the beach it's like stick it in the
bag stick it in the bag inside another
bag so Sam doesn't get in it it's a pain
man I know it's a first-world problem
but it's pain
i will save let that Europe your header
beat rockin block was one of the best
things that's ever appeared on the site
yes that's inspiration he's been asking
me to be more creative it's pretty
amazing yeah so experience that is like
it just it overall it feels like it's
like okay which is what I expect from LG
and then why are you buying into the
communism of Zed dieter I don't
understand why nothing this look it's
easier to say than Z easier to
understand exactly what I mean I mean
what if I were you know what if I were
like saying a sentence and you know I
was talking about the sea maybe you
thought you know the xperia c right z
yeah but you realize that this is a
gateway drug before long you can be
talking and like kilometers and using
the metric system and yeah measuring
your weight in stone driving on the
wrong side of the road way now you're
just getting your nationalities mixed up
I doesn't work at all listen we're in
America you can do what we want you can
t thorium mega stuffs anymore though
right I've got yes my world came to an
end this weekend of those we have said
does anybody have anything else I want
to say about the Z or Z whatever I still
whatever I still want to use one
regardless of lads review so uh AT&amp;amp;T has
announced the Z right am I crazy or did
that happen haha I want to say that it
was rumored or likely to come but I
don't think if there's been an official
announcer beak razy though okay hey Jane
Sony have like they've been friends for
years now so it makes total sense that
that would be the case yeah yeah I'm
just wondering you know in the US how
these phones are gonna be positioned
yeah I worry about Sony because I feel
like they really put their heart and
soul into the Xperia Z and and put what
they perceive to be the best possible
product they could on the market yes
it's going to do nothing compared to the
one and the galaxy s4 I mean nothing
it's gonna be a drop in the bucket right
just just to raise a couple of extra
points
at the moment it's already on sale here
in the UK and I expect across Europe I
haven't checked somebody needs to send
me out on flights with like Milan and
Geneva in places like that just make
sure this is to go to the stars season
store shelves like check the sony store
yeah people who preordered it and i
think there's some others they get these
mdr1 bluetooth headphones as well which
are like 399 pounds or something and
these are really good headphones so
that's a nice bonus and the box is
really barren which I want to
congratulate Sony for just keeping a
really minimal box there's a USB cable
and then then there's a these headphones
which also really nice like it's a
headset it's I don't know XP something
300 it's got a pretty horrible name so
they got a really nice headset and just
a charger in the box and everything else
is recyclable paper so I feel like Sony
gets a ton of things right with this
phone and then gets like diese says some
of the core crux issues badly wrong
Jesse a ton of things right yes yeah it
gives a ton of things on the side right
and then gets the main things wrong and
that's the really frustrating part so
Chris brought this up it's a Spectre
thats hanging over this entire
conversation which is where what almost
exactly 48 hours away from the announced
of the what could be a galaxy s4 yep yes
yeah I believe we were 50 hours away to
be 50 hours away ok whatever um 49 48
minutes thank you i hate you all so we
saw a leak we saw a video leak and like
so now we do need to be a little bit
careful because we've seen we saw leaks
of the s3 that turned out to just be
like dummy boxes and not at the actual
phone um but if these pan out like it
looks exactly like the galaxy s3 but
okay here's my thing though is that why
would they change it like this phone has
been a giant smashing success they have
taken over android we've we've seeded
Android to Samsung I'll tell you what on
that all these issues with it but why
would they change it it were also I'll
tell you why they change it because we
people buy a new phone they want it to
look new and if it looks exactly like
their old phone like I mean that's a
Apple didn't have too much of an issue
going from the 4 4 s designed to the
five but at the same time like why why
why upgrade my phone if it looks exactly
the same no I don't think Samsung is
after people who bought GS threes I
think Samsung is after people who bought
galaxy s tues or don't own a smartphone
I think Samsung is like Apple plays to
this crowd who buys a new phone every
year and Samsung is like you have that
apple will take the billion people who
don't have that and what I think it's to
mix a guy I do think that Samsung you
know I mean of course Samsung has a long
and storied reputation of borrowing from
Apple's playbook I think that to a
certain extent this is a continuation of
that they're saying hey we can play the
4s 5s game you can we can we can make a
phone that's basically a revised gs3 and
get away with it because we are Samsung
and and so it wouldn't surprise me at
all if if the phone that we see on
Thursday does look like the gs3y little
boy I'm sorry but just briefly to
clarify because there's be kind of a
cold war happening between one tipster /
leaks there in the forum in China who
evidently does have a new Samsung device
in his hand and it's sensing itself
trying to drop a little teasers in the
hints so Samsung's teaser today which
are just a picture kind of shadowy with
a little light cast on it is basically
the galaxy s3 I can't you overlay a
picture on top of it of the galaxy s3 in
it that's what it is the only thing
that's missing is the aps and
front-facing camera and all those senses
which sounds gonna have bone conduction
man no your piece needed right so
that'll be wild that's forgot yes you're
in the galaxy s3 with bone conduction
don't that gives us the possibility of
the galaxy s4 being essentially
unchanged from the galaxy s free design
and just saying straight up this design
is great we're gonna while you guys with
something else and another piece of
evidence that that is going to happen is
the fact that the note 8 was literally
just announced two weeks ago with the
same ID and two to go just two weeks
before changing ID would be very strange
right well I mean there's not there's
nothing suggesting that Samsung is going
to change his eyes because the leaks
that the person who has the phone his
phone is evidently a or at least looks
to be a 5-inch device it's bigger it has
a smaller bezel rounder display but it's
actually look and design is exactly it's
completely consistent with the latest
galaxy devices and with the galaxy s3 so
either one where do you go with
Samsung's teaser or with Lisa's images
and video we're still looking at the
same time it's just a matter of science
I just find that I mean I know that we
were not super enthused about the s3 and
it turned out to take the world by storm
just well I wouldn't say that I think at
the time when Vlad reviewed the s3
originally you got the highest score of
any Android phone that we'd ever
reviewed yeah i'm in a minute the
announced but i like like the phone
itself just doesn't like inspire a ton
of passion like it's it's like it's just
a really good phone but and i think that
the s4 is going it again just be really
good fun i think that like my hesitancy
to talk about it is like or like get
excited about it is I just don't think
that their industrial design is all that
great it just doesn't look awesome it
looks oh hey you know it's a samsung and
that work it doesn't feel awesome and
you're in your hand either well there's
yes it works maybe I ergonomically but
like the materials or not it doesn't
feel like it has a craftsmanship that
other devices have especially like when
we just talked about the one yeah and at
the end of the day you know the s3 was
the phone that I used at CES right
because it had a replaceable battery and
it like it filled the slots that I
needed for a phone that you know does
the job yeah i think that the s4 is
going to be another android phone that
does the job and it's gonna you know Sam
phones going to market the hell out of
it it's going to sell fine but it's not
going to I don't for me I don't think it
inspired to cut a passion but I think
I'm got a really good metaphor for this
because I shared easiest feelings on
this and it's a if you think about space
travel oh there's no there's no friction
in space but every time we have sci-fi
movies and you know graphic novels and
art about space travel what do we get we
get these really
sharp looking spaceships which is just
like needle-like like a Concorde and
looks so beautiful and they're firing
flames out of the back even though there
are more efficient forms of getting
traction and locomotion and all these
things so the samsung phone is like this
chunky shapeless mess that just gets
from point A to B edge of space travel
well that there is actually friction in
space I'm gonna challenge your thesis
here uh it's yes watch no not much but
in interstellar space there is a certain
I mean you can go look at the data
coming back from the Voyager spaceships
right now and see that there is in fact
you know there are molecules in space
fair enough III don't I don't claim to
know much more beyond sci-fi movies but
does what that was my point like Sony
HTC those guys are the ones that make
the really pretty spaceships which
actually break down and someone that
just gets you from point A to B and does
really good marketing so so the s4 is is
what it's it's a fire fire casa
spaceship and yeah yeah that would be a
really good one because the was a movie
firefly serenity that's what it was cold
the only bad thing about our movie is
that they use papyrus as the font as a
side face on the title hey don't do that
man they had their reasons I mean did
you watch the show did you watch I
haven't watched it show I've only well
man don't even can I kick you off this
podcast yeah you should then I could go
and actually catch up with it I just
watched to both series right now so okay
I is there anything else to say I mean
what else we're expecting maybe I
tracking I guess I feel like yeah it's
it's going to be you know the the design
of it's probably not going to throw a
lot space than what we've seen so far
we're not going to be in love with the
additional design but as far as software
goes it's going to have like everything
in the kitchen sink I just I hope that
when they offered a software that it's
not like the like with the s3 it was
just like exhausted
here's another crazy feature here's
another crazy feature boom boom boom
boom boom and there was no like
coherency to any of it if there's like I
want you to be able to share your photos
right I just want smart stay too as long
as they they bring a new smart stay to
the table I'm a happy camper which
actually they're going to write that's
one of the rumored features is they have
being with scroll with your eyeballs
which is making the last thing that I
think of all these features and like the
first thing I do to extend my battery
life is turn off all of these features
so it's like and maybe maybe they can
blow me away with some revolutionary
battery technology that allows me to
keep all of these whiz-bang features on
and still get good battery life I just
want to point out squirting with you I
Bose is a great way to like break
whatever muscles control your eyeballs
like it's so wrong think about it every
time you scroll whether by touch or by
mouse scroll way whatever you pull the
page up and your eyes look immediately
down at the thing you just pulled up to
see what it is right whereas in order to
scroll with your eyeballs you have to
look at a given point and pull it up
with your eyes and then like you don't
know exactly how it's gonna what I think
think they could build in a lag there
yeah no I think I think the idea was
that it'll scroll automatically when it
figures out you're down at the bottom of
the page so you just like keep reading
those last three lines and they are you
jogging with you which would be cool but
I feel like all of these features like
watching Samsung's ads over the last
however many months since gs3 came out
has been really interesting because I
feel like all Samsung does is say how
many things can we have that nobody else
has so that we can make ads about them
so people are like huh that's cool and
then they go into a verizon store and
they're like I want that galaxy phone
and it's like that seems like it's the
ball game and that's how Samsung one so
much is they like I remember it used to
be you would either buy an iphone or a
droid rachel is either that was that was
the game and that has completely changed
you now either by an iphone or you buy a
galaxy like that people think and
Samsung who did that by saying like all
they advertised was NFC because
everybody who had an iphone was like I
want that that's cool and then they took
off and so they've advertise all these
features the
they just they have and they don't spend
it on the time talking about the look
and feel of the phone because that
doesn't play on a commercial they are
like here's the thing that our phone
does that nobody else's does and then
people buy it and like that works and
it's kind of smart and it sucks for us
as people who like care and pay
attention to get to try a lot of these
but it's kind of a smart move it seems
like well and the features don't even
need to work right like nobody actually
knows NFC we know that because they
don't know it I just think those crazy
photo sharing features we heard like
everybody in the room is supposed to
only galaxy s3 and then you hit shared
it beams the photo the photo to all your
friends in the room a Wi-Fi direct just
the most ridiculous but like that's one
of those things that it's like oh it
looks really cool to commercial and you
never actually use it really all right
well we'll find out on Thursday um oh do
you want to talk about the TV Odyssey I
do dia TV Odyssey do you want to say
anything about it should we just move I
review okay uh you know it's like yet
another windows phone for verizon that
was kind of the whole issue that we had
when when kind of constructing this
review was that verizon's already got
the HTC 8x which is a higher-end Windows
Phone that I think they're pricing it
like a hundred bucks now and they've got
the lumia 822 which is taking care of
their low to mid-range but you can get
for free now and now there's this
Samsung which is not as good as either
of those and it's priced at 50 bucks so
uh it's it's it this is definitely an
example of Samsung just you know pumping
out another phone out of its like
massive factory of continuous phones to
fill a carrier's request that didn't
feel like there was any uh any
innovation or input here on on Samsungs
end so wha wha wha haha ok we go we have
other Windows Phone rumors the Lumia 928
on the ride man well that's it so more
exclusive the toaster that's koo
pitchman scooper Rooney I just said that
it's called Tommy ice cream in
Tom two scoops born wow that's pretty
good aluminum body xenon flash a little
bit thinner and lighter than the night
it sounds like I'm making awesome
android phone yeah I say about flash
weeks be excited because you never see
that anymore except on old nokia so can
somebody explain verizon strategy here
to me i don't get it at all like verizon
continues to say we want your phone your
best phone but kind of a little worse
and we want you to change these four
things so that nobody will buy it and we
want to wait six months to put it right
you know like really why verizon seems
like they have the clout to do whatever
the hell they want like if they ask for
the 920 i'm sure they get the 920 so
what are they doing well they wanted to
be exclusive only on verizon that
matters but it is this what swiss about
it this sounds like a bit well it's yeah
that's worse is that it's coming out
later basic it's thicker cuz it's it's
incremental against the 920 and
presumably it's not going to show up
with new version of Windows Phone it'll
ship with some service release of
Windows Phone 8 which is is fine i guess
if you're into that sort of thing no i
think it's going to be a very very good
blend of this one it'll be the best
windows phone on the market it'll be on
verizon and a verizon won't do what's
necessary to you know sell and market it
yeah yeah classic Verizon Verizon is
reason reisen is is of all the carriers
in the world reisen is definitely the
most possessive about brands and about
building its own image as the the
purveyor of the hardware you know what I
mean even more so than AT&amp;amp;T which itself
is a very meddling carrier obviously but
verizon is really concerned about brands
right I mean they created and they own
the droid brand this this goes back four
years I mean the original stories of
verizon rejected the iPhone because
Apple wouldn't let Verizon Verizon it up
I mean which is so this is this is
definitely of verizon's reason to be yep
okay I'm excited to see an aluminum
nokia phone though because i love
Nokia's hardware and their build quality
and their what they've done with the
polycarbonate so very excited to see
what the company does with aluminum I'm
less stoked about that because I think I
mean I know key never gave me the one
thing I wanted which was an N 9 running
in cyan yes running Windows Phone 8 and
and if you go back to the n8 which I
think correctly wrong was the last
Luminum phone they made no there was the
e7 came out after it yeah oh yeah yeah
good point yeah but yeah sure so but if
you look at those two phones were of the
same ID though right they they yeah yeah
birds of a feather they they did not
inspire me in the same way that the n9
and the Lumia 800 did from an ID
perspective well I mean what but when
the m9 in the 800 came out like nobody
was doing that with polycarbonate right
like like that was like when you when we
first saw that and and people were
saying it's like plastic we're like well
it's not really plastic because if you
go look at another plastic phone it
doesn't look anything like another pie
or feel anything like another plastic
foam so they've been doing that for a
couple of years so maybe you know they
can apply that type of manufacturing
technique to aluminum which would be
pretty cool why I think what really set
apart their plastic phones which let's
just be very blunt about it that's what
they are they're plastic I think would
set them apart was the fact that they're
they're built using a unibody approach
like that you know the the 920 900 800
the a9 there they're kind of like milled
from a single block of plastic as far as
I can tell and that's what really made
them what they were made them how they
felt and I'm sure that they'll be able
to apply some of those techniques to
aluminum I mean other companies
certainly have I don't know i I just I
feel like yeah I think Tom Warren
mentioned on our last show from mwc that
he felt like the the seventh was it the
720 was kind of like the ultimate
execution of that yeah I'm not sure that
I agree I think that they could have
continued along that path
for a while yet it gave them a lot of
flexibility in terms of coloration and
maybe they'll continue doing that with
aluminum they can anodized it certainly
at the way peter has his iphone but
we'll see well clean they're just afraid
unless service phone yeah the surface
phone yep as I judging an aluminum cyan
nokia would be pretty amazing in my
opinion just so uh ass or anything else
going to talk about nokia i mean i guess
i guess we could this this ridiculous
pressure they're trying to put on
instagram to instead with love knows
actually I don't want to talk about that
just surprise me crazy I mean I think
that's the Nokia trying to own the the
whole movement like and brand itself and
put its own branding on it yeah yeah but
I mean this is just it's kind of sad to
be honest it's really sad it's like
looking at the somebody with a physical
disability struggling along and my card
I just you know you it's not something
you want to watch little what's so
what's the company also nokia and
microsoft both of them already
struggling to get apps and until they do
what's the point in discussing this like
it just grown increasingly desperate so
you know what's really sad about this is
that Microsoft is a major investor in
facebook and yeah maybe they don't
appear to be able to get instagram on
Windows Phone but but uh blackberries
getting it though well kind of kinda
yeah almost the backdoor way of getting
it that you can come up with yeah right
so so with with Windows Phone how much
do you guys think Microsoft and or Nokia
would have to pay facebook to get them
to port Instagram TV spend it effin as
their strategy I thought Microsoft one
of those companies is already building
an instagram app yeah i think they're
just gonna build it and then be like
listen we've already built this give us
an email interview guys know but but if
I'm facebook then I say well you know is
it bill to our standards do we want to
license your name let me let me just say
this facebook's mobile app standards
pretty low for you facebook for android
and facebook for iOS the app built
in-house fair enough I don't really
think Facebook cares as far as Stander's
come varna hang on so we've gone an hour
which is good for us we usually been
short lately but it's running over so
David Pierce has to run I don't want to
keep a mirror if he's got other more
important things to do than Yammer on
with us do I have to go build Instagram
for windows phone I'll tell you all
about it well thanks for being on David
we agree thank you David I put it up
with our super professional broadcast
any time I guess all right so now it's a
quote broke-ass there we go all right on
talk smack MIDI we've gotten rid of the
the 5th Corps the let's see what's what
it in video call their two companion or
confession which actually runs most of
the show yeah because if the one that's
used those that okay we can't roll out
without talking about t-mobile and
MetroPCS their murder has been approved
by the FCC they still have got a few
more steps to go but this is this is
basically like this is going to happen
yeah yeah I mean there's no major
roadblocks like I think with the biggest
comparison that we have always to
compare this type of merger to is with
1880s attempt to purchase t-mobile a
couple years ago and how that was
famously stopped in its tracks by
pressure from both the DOJ and the FCC
and so far for the metro pcs and
t-mobile deal the Department of Justice
back down and a couple of weeks ago said
it's not going to pursue any more
investigation and just today the FCC
said that it's gotten the green light so
I mean there's a little bit of things
left i think the FTC technically has two
degree light it and the handshakes and
papers have to be signed but for all
intents and purposes it feels like this
is this is a done deal and in terms of
size difference i feel like this is a
closer arrangement to verizon's
acquisition of alltel then yeah 18 tease
attempted acquisition of t-mobile and i
think that the fact that the FCC green
let this was so little opposition
Shin speaks to that and and this
recognition that even as a combined
company there they're not really that
there's no threat of them creating a
anti and antitrust situation it's it's
not not going to be an issue and I think
this is going to be it's a big win for
tmobile and I think that you know it's
really funny me if you look back 18 or
even 12 months t-mobile really looked
desperate and like they were in very
very bad shape for a variety of reasons
they didn't have the spectrum they
needed Deutsche Telekom seemed desperate
to shed them and and it wasn't clear how
they were going to really carry on and
and now i think they are looking in many
ways like the most competitive major
carrier in the US this this is a huge
spectrum acquisition for them they're
going to pretty rapidly deploy LTE in
2013 they've already got HSPA 42 and in
a lot of if not most major markets in
the u.s. at this point and they're
they're doing some really creative
things with subsidies and prepaid versus
postpaid that i think are going to end
up being Bell what Bell weathers for the
entire industry I think that in the long
term you can see ATT and Verizon go the
same way oh wow Verizon Verizon how do
Olsen someday I I'm not saying this is
2013 thing but I think that I've been
saying for five years that the subsidy
model is not sustainable I mean I don't
want to say that that I I informed
t-mobile on this decision but I inform
t-mobile on this is chris Christie uses
clairvoyance and his Jedi mind powers to
predict five years ago the Fallen Jedi
mind-meld but it's been it's been eating
that the subsidy model has been eating
itself alive for years now and it's
going to continue to do so and I think
that t-mobile has really done some
pretty ballsy things to try to break out
of that and and I mean I you know hats
off I think that they've they've put
themselves in a position where they
aren't being particularly offensive to
customers who are trying to buy phones
affordably and yet they
still gotten out of that model so that's
that's good that's healthy and I think
that you know it's it's looking a lot
better than signing up for two-year
contract and getting a heavily
subsidized phone every two years Curtis
I have to just change you quickly on the
point about the subsidy of malobi and
sustainable mean it is what 18teen
verizon practice and those guys just
keep rolling in massive profits every
quarter yeah but it's like have you seen
the movie Ferris no no too fast in
somebody's gonna get furious on the crab
with that thought that's how that works
I'll rebut that Vlad because actually if
you look at the major carriers 18 teens
verizon's last fourth-quarter results
both of them attributed a big loss to
Sky's Christmas making his google face
right now like I'm sorry to interrupt
but he's just he's concentrating so hard
it's yeah I'm googling he's actually
this actually googling but it I mean
they actually are on the books saying
that subsidies are causing you know 18t
lost a lot of money last corner for a
couple of reasons but they specifically
mention the subsidies that they had to
pay out because of all the smartphones
that they sold and as the iteration and
the pace of development has greatly
accelerated smartphones over the past
couple of years people want the new
smartphones faster and they want them
more often and that's where this the
subsidy model really starts to fall
apart so what I want Chris is finishing
up his google job margin call margin
call Martin calls the movie I've never
heard of them but let's quickly mention
that the blackberry z10 got announced by
AT&amp;amp;T for 1 99 99 which presumably
doesn't have too much of a subsidy on it
everyone was like that's a terrible
price it's probably got some kind of
subsea it also deals or doesn't have a
chance in hell but yes elevate motivated
selling it subsidy free in the US for
what is it 629 now I think yeah 689 I
think there was they dropped the price
today if we was 999 yeah but so uh so
anyway that that the the point I was
trying to make about margin call is that
like that you know this this hedge fund
business looks like it's going really
well but one of their risk assessment
guys notices that there's some like
trend happening that nobody else sees
that the business is about to collapse
entirely I'll stop there because I don't
want to spoil it for everybody but yeah
oh girl what happened to the US economy
it was the dramatization you know
there's no spoiler it's like spoiler
alert Bill Clinton won in 1992 I mean
come on just now this is I'm talking
about a movie I'm not you guys know
boiler room I'm not talking about your
oh I like that movie boiler room is one
my favorite movies boiler room is a top
five movie for it and it really is other
race cars and boiler room there's no yes
exit there are there are race cars in
boiler room because all the all the guys
working at the firm have like Ferraris
and stuff but anyway so so the point I
was trying to make is that you can you
can tell there's just a malaise in the
in the industry because customers and
carriers have become so heavily
dependent on the concept of having the
concept of not paying full price for the
for the hardware that they're owning
it's unhealthy especially if the rate
people are dropping their phones then
what I don't know it's just if it's bad
and the fact that t-mobile's trying to
break out of that I think is extremely
healthy for the industry and for their
consumers and we've heard AT&amp;amp;T say we've
heard out of his Randall Stephenson or
Ralph de l'abbaye I think with Stevenson
said just very recently that that they
were looking at the subsidy model and
re-evaluating how that's going to play
out in the coming year so it's
definitely on their minds they're
looking at what t-mobile is doing right
I think they're going to look and see
how well it's working for tmobile in it
right formulate their plans but well
listen as an outsider I'm still getting
over the fact that t-mobile was nearly
lost into the ATT giant globe of white
and blue paint evil yeah so I'm happy
that that carries to exists I'm
delighted to hear that now they're
stepping up and actually acquiring new
spectrum
and you know new opportunities and you
know since chris said it is basically
fact that verizon a TD following in his
footsteps and you guys are going to get
a better deal i think out of it I mean
if everybody follows t-mobile footsteps
US UK europe etc that would be brilliant
look I'm basically the nastradamus of
the phone industry I'm just gonna be out
with that I mean you say it as a joke
but when the when eventually the
freaking amazon / kindle phone comes out
yeah oh yeah doesn't doesn't that mean
you'll be right about twenty percent of
the time or something Chris now it means
I'll be right a hundred scent of the
time as usual just like I'm right about
nikon over canon oh wait what NASA night
are you a choice wait Jory Chris I don't
even enjoy dropping your eleven hundred
dollars on a cool pics a man and all
you're gonna it's gonna be the best
point shoot I've ever owned whatever man
nikon yeah plus Sony right here that's
right foot forget about plus it's it's
it's what about so many thank you you
guys are having lost centuries
conversation new converse Canon it's
about so I'm sorry when you say when you
say it's about Sony you mean it's about
nikon since they're using so no interest
no I mean it's about Sony's mirrorless
cameras and I mean it's about the rx1
yeah right down next ya know the arcs
one is an amazing phenomenal camera and
that's what I'm talking about like any
and you know what else I'm just gonna
say it openly to Sony so it hears me I
would actually pay a higher price than
any other smartphone if they fix all the
things i mentioned i need to be fixed
with experience that i would pay just
because it's so any engine because that
trust them but they don't trust
themselves to charge the premiums that
leaves you and they I don't know hey I'm
gonna start rental sony needs the market
helped so many need some love itself yes
not your fault it's not your fault it's
not your fault sony it's not your fault

show for that we thank you so much
