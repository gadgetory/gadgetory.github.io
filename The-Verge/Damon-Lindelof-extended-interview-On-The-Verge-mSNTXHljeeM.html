Los Angeles I flew out from New York to
sit down with Damon Lindelof one of the
men behind lost the co-screenwriter of
Prometheus and basically just an insane
genius so let's go have a chat so you're
busy man you've got a pretty major
project that's about to be revealed to
the world uh when are you ever because I
got for me the-- oh yeah
should I is there a sore something else
that I should know about there's a
you're very busy guy
there's it more there's this Disney
movie 1952 that we just announced Brad
Bird is gonna direct but we're not
talking about what it is or can you tell
me a little about what it is no you just
give me an idea of the plot it's a it's
a it's about characters who want
something and there's other characters
trying to stop them
you tell me who from guest-starring in
this film no we don't have any I would
tell you but there's no actors to
animated no I'm not cousin Tina it's
like check out in uh happily is that
true there's a happy ending yes it's a
Disney movie oh I mean you know
anything's possible in this day and age
it's 2012 it's a penis guarantee even to
even the movie 2012 has a happy ending
I've never seen it see ended I'm sorry
to hear that you just love CJ is it yet
credibility this is by the way not the
first time 2012 was come up and people
were I think Neil deGrasse Tyson was
talking specifically to me about 2012
and I had no response because I didn't
ever seen it no he wasn't talking about
the movie no no he was talking about the
movie as it relates to the universe oh
of course I'm sorry to hear that yeah he
said he was completely right that's how
that's how it all ends that's it well
it's a it's a fascinating movie not to
digress but um but when you think about
a movie that's essentially about the end
of the world and it's John Cusack versus
the end of the world like what's the
ending of that movie look like like how
does how does a had as one character
beat the end of the world and I riff on
what I think happens yet this is what
this is much more interesting probably
than the actual movie baby I think that
give you a hint John Cusack along with a
small band of survivors find some one
spot on the planet that's where we're
going to start over yes and rebuild
humanity the way it should have been
built
first time around right without fossil
fuels yes more or less that I got the
idea I would sort of amend like small
band of survivors to like four ginormous
arc loads of survivors basically
represent the the lottery winners slash
wealthy Oleg arcs of all societies and
the not you happy ended yeah but that
these arcs do get to the the place that
you refer to yep it's all like rich
bastards most of them are rich bastards
John Cusack one of them he's a
stockbroker he's not a rich bastard his
what if memory serves his wife has
married a rich bat his ex-wife is
married a rich bat okay so it's kind of
like or he falls in or not he finds it
he falls in with like a Russian rich
bastard so it's sort of like an
Independence Day how Jeff Goldblum's
wife is working with the president so he
ends up like with all the important
powerful people sure and then save the
world and his dad Harvey Fierstein no
Harvey fires is not it is that is God
hurt her shreya oh my gosh yeah yes he
gets a he dies right they kill him off
for sure I fit right in yeah you have
the attractive Jew survived sure well
yeah the attractive Jew here Goldblum at
the edge I heard no yeah well he
survives to that's right he survives
they all go into the into the bunker yes
where where they're keeping the alien
ship yes there's a lot of Jews and in
the area have to say kind of Jesus yeah
and there's a real you know there's a
real like well there's a very religious
kind of subtext to the whole thing
absolutely it's an important movie maybe
talk for 90 minutes just enough it's
arguable that it's more important in
some ways than the Torah
what then the Torah that's right you
heard it here first right exactly
Independence Day is more important than
the Torah yes we are this exactly this
exactly what I thought we'd be talking
about by the way I knew it I just talked
more about Judaism than I have since my
bar mitzvah so you varmints was on the
mine cuz you have to leave tomorrow to
go to a bar mitzvah I do I did for your
second first cousin once removed second
cousin once we're there is some
fundamental debate as to whether or not
it's my second cousin or my first cousin
once removed but it's definitely a
person who's related to you
yes that's the important thing correct
the son of my cousin this is I'm sure
why they sound right
Dada they've tuned out now so you can
say whatever let's just write so so you
don't want to talk about you can't how
about 1952 which has a happy ending
correct and stars no one yes but but
that's good but you can't talk about
prometheus which is a small film that
you've done independent film you've done
yes Ridley Scott sure you are the co
screenwriter yeah a gentleman by the
name of John Speights wrote on the moon
wrote the first draft of the screenplay
for several first drafts he worked in
the movie for about a year and then I
came in after him so we didn't ever work
simultaneously you kind of took when he
added that's right exactly another plays
yes I mean that's the that's that's the
the process out here right John when I
was just I was still working on the last
season of Lost while he was writing on
prometheus and then he went on to do
bigger and better things and then I came
in on prometheus and normally there's a
whole chain of screenwriter so I'm proud
that it's just John and alright it's a
small process yeah cowboys and Aliens
which is the only other movie I have a
writing credit on I think there's nine
credited writers does that bother you
that there's nine credit writers yeah I
think it would have been a better movie
had to just been your name on it
no I don't I would have been a better
movie if my I've been nowhere near and
really I just think I because I would
feel if anybody tampered with anything
that I did I would always feel like
whatever the end result is going to be
somehow bastardized a bastardized
version of my version yeah but I'm yeah
he's easier said than done because I'm
tampering with you know when it but when
I came into that movie it was between
the fourth and the fifth season of Lost
so I worked on it for two and a half
months and uh and injected some ideas
and did a draft of the script that was
built on the foundation of other drafts
and then there was considerable writing
done after I left which is just it's
weird it's sort of the equivalent of
like going to the sperm bank and saying
like maybe this will be used in a kid in
combination with a bunch of others like
you can't really do it you know if you
don't have fundamental authorship so
it's a worse than that in a way cuz at
least with the with the kid you know
it's at least one of them right the good
news was I got to meet and
work with Favreau Jon Favreau on that
the the draft that I wrote with Alex
Kurtzman and Bob warsi got John on board
and then I started hanging out with him
for maybe a month before I had to go
back onto lost and he's a great cool guy
and I loved I loved that collaboration
but he seems like he seems like a guy
who is incredibly powerful and rich and
famous but whenever I've seen him speak
anywhere or just he's not the kind of
regular dude he's like a very nice guy
yeah here is he a huge-ass no he's not a
huge-ass at all he's one of us I mean
he's when I am when I first came out to
LA in 94 swingers was like the big thing
and essentially he and his friends Vince
Vaughn the most prominent amongst them
we're sort of living the Hollywood
existence that my friends and I were
except they were much better looking at
having much more success with women but
that's what that movie was about right
and so I completely and totally idolized
Jon Favreau and the idea that he was
also a writer and a director and started
putting more time and attention into
that part of his career than the acting
part of his career I thought was
commendable and then he's into all the
same stuff that we are as fanboys you
know he just nerd he already got he's
nerdy and it comes across in his movies
I mean they don't they seem like they're
they have the touch of obsession
no definitely which is a huge component
for making these things work and also a
tone is everything and I think I give
massive accolades to Joss Whedon for
Avengers and he did an incredible job
but I think that Favreau was the guy
with Iron Man that did the first like
four so when you see the Avengers other
than the fact that it's awesome and you
want to see it again you go like why did
it take so long to figure out to do this
I mean these characters didn't get
invented like ten years ago right why
did it take them so long and the answer
is it's such it's so totally difficult
to pull off those movies and Iron Man
was the first one where it's sort of
like I'm going to take this seriously
I'm never going to have the characters
turn and wink at the camera but at the
same time it's going to be
super fun to watch right women are gonna
want to go and see it and they're
legitimately funny mood yeah they're
awesome so I give Fabro huge props for
basically kick-starting you know that
whole progression of movies it's like he
kind of took the and we're still way off
topic of my question but it's like he
took which I don't mind all he took
can't wait to hear it
he took well yes and there's a lot of
area what I want gay talk about his
point he took that that um he took
comics the way comics used to be even up
until the 80s were they when they really
got dark in the 80s but where they were
that you could tell a real story and but
still have fun with it and it was
actually like there was something kind
of adventurous and exciting that wasn't
it wasn't dark and heavy and brooding
you know if it wasn't all Batman yeah
and he made a movie that would did all
the stuff that like a rift that a great
Batman movie should do right where it's
like action-packed and has serious
moments but is somewhat light in a way
that like is way more palatable to a
broad audience yeah no definitely which
is weird because it's actually really
nerdy that kind of tone is kind of a
nerdy weird specialist tone yeah it's
it's II it's completely and totally
socially acceptable right now and
actually socially expected to think
superhero movies are cool yeah and we
take for granted that 15 years ago that
was not the case this is a good bridge
to talking about your new movie that
while you talk about it that's right I
did you but basically said no doubt go
with that segue to say that and we'll
move uh so prometheus is a is an arm
movie it's not really a broad audience
well it's obviously a broad audience but
it's an adult audience yeah and I'm
curious to know what your thoughts are
me god movies like The Avengers that
aren't very much like their four kids
and therefore the kids parents as well
and this seems like you specifically
really and you are obviously trying to
make something that is for adults yeah I
think you know the first thing that I
have to say and I and I mean this
completely genuinely without an ounce of
Hollywood you know false
modesty is it's Ridley's movie John and
I John John certainly contributed at a
tremendous amount of
ideas most of which I built on and then
I came up with some stuff organically to
the process but at the end of the day my
job was sitting across a table from
Ridley Scott asking him a series of
questions like he was on 60 minutes and
then based on his answers to those
questions I then went and generated at a
screenplay but that process that I just
described to you went over the course of
three or four weeks so I really felt
like I just I just kind of bullied
Ridley into dictating the movie to tell
you what then I got to put my name on it
so the movie a lot of the ideas are
actually the seeds are from Ridley
directly absolutely because a aside from
its relationship to the original alien
which is a question iterations of that
question are the things that I've been
asked about the most I'm looking forward
to it at the end of the day when you're
working with Ridley Scott who is people
throw the word visionary around a lot
but that's literally what he is by
definition and so he's going to make the
movie he needs to get the movie and it's
not about me coming in and saying hey
Ridley I've got this great idea do you
want to direct it it's about him saying
I want to direct a movie in this
universe here's what I want it to be
about here are the ideas that excite me
here are the thematics that I'm
interested in and here are the character
traits that I want to demonstrate and
it's it's not to reduce the process of
screenwriting but I feel like in film
which is much different than what I did
in TV it is a little bit like Mad Libs
where my job is essentially you know
really saying adjectives now you know
euphemism and that's how the movie was
made yeah that's a and that exactly I'm
sure he'll be excited when to hear that
you describe the moviemaking process as
Mad Libs i but i but I do feel like I I
have great pride in my own lack of
authorship in the movie and I feel like
if the movie is a huge success it's all
because of Ridley Scott and if the movie
is not a success it's because I wasn't
able to execute his vision successfully
um and that's that's the that's the
feeling that I have so let's talk about
the connection between aliens or alien
or
universe because there's been there
seems to be some and correct me if I'm
wrong but I feel like people who are
talking about the movie who are involved
in the movie have gone not out of their
way but have made a point to say look
this isn't a sequel to alien or aliens
or alien 3 or Alien Resurrection sure or
alien vs. predator right or alien vs.
predator - yes you're saying this is a
different movie but it isn't mean it's
not a sequel - it's a prequel if
anything right
you're not even calling it that well I
mean I take exception to the fact that
it that it's called a prequel because
and and I know a lot of this sounds a
lot like that you have to get a slightly
defensive terrain but for me just as a
fanboy when I hear the word prequel that
doesn't get me excited right and the
reason that it doesn't get me excited
isn't because I have a negative
association with prequels we have to
think like what's contextualized that
word the first time that I heard that
word in any sort of public or social
setting was in reference to the fact
that George was going to do the first
three Star Wars movies and I was
enormous ly excited about that yeah that
aside once you actually see what a
prequel is a prequel is by definition a
march towards the inevitable so while we
know that the guy is going to get the
girl or there's going to be a happy
ending there's certain story beats that
you hit the idea of saying I'm now just
going to watch this young boy turn into
Darth Vader you're leading me into the
story that I already know there's
certain things that I know can't happen
like nothing's going to happen to
obi-wan right because it's a prequel and
so I and and then I went and saw the
thing prequel and I loved the I love
John Carpenter's The Thing and I was
really excited about it but then when it
ended it spoiler alert the the thing
ends with a dog that has the thing
inside it running across the frozen
tundra as it's being chased by a
helicopter that's shooting at it and
when I saw that there was a small degree
of satisfaction in terms of like oh this
is where the other movie began and on
the heels of that a tremendous amount of
disappointment and going like then why
did I just watch this movie it was just
sort of you just wrote the prologue for
me and I felt it was really important
that
that Prometheus was not positioned as a
prologue to alien right that in fact if
Prometheus were successful and there was
a sequel to it the sequel to Prometheus
would not be alien I also felt like
alien is as close to a perfect movie as
it gets
and I was very reluctant to engage in a
conversation that would somehow diminish
alien right like that if you saw if for
some reason Prometheus didn't succeed
creatively that when you went and
watched alien again you'd be like this
movie is now you should taste would be
soured in some way why yeah why why oh I
bet that so all that by way of saying
that if you my hope is that if you see
Prometheus and you watch alien again
there will be certain things that were
mysteries before about alien that you
have more clarity on but not but but the
mysteries that made alien great are
still mysteries right and I've had a
certain degree of success and failure in
mystery resolution I feel some mysteries
are just much more engaging than their
resolution and I don't want to answer
those it's like ooh where is Amelia
Earhart
she's rotting somewhere and the bottom
of like the ocean are you like you're
cheating that's the probably unless she
was abducted by aliens or you know or
she's living you know somewhere in you
know in France like 50 and hotend and
has discovered the Fountain of Youth
like but the reality is is the answer to
these mysteries are usually less
compelling than whatever our imagination
transposes onto them and so if they're I
do think that we succeeded in if there's
a sequel to prometheus it's not about
the things that alien is about which is
eggs and facehuggers and chess bursters
and xenomorphs right like that that not
only alien but then aliens they need to
go and live off on that tangent
Prometheus is launching it's servicing
that tangent it's saying here's an
explanation you'll understand the
context of maybe where some of those
things came from but it's much more
interested in going off and its own
duress
chin and we're there a sequel to
Prometheus it probably wouldn't need to
trade in any of those ideas so let me
let's just get nerdy for a second I'm
gonna get real specific as opposed to
what I would like here because you've
been for the last 20 minutes you're
speaking very broadly about the you know
you're kind of setting the stage for
this but yes
but here's my impression based on the
trailers and it's funny because I
actually could not I haven't seen alien
for years probably since not since I was
a teenager or like I really young like
13 mm-hmm and it was on television we
had this debate in the podcast and we
were talking like how does it start
because I couldn't remember mhm and it
was on television I watched it and I
remembered I saw a bunch of self I was
like oh yes now it all makes sense so
Prometheus clearly is not about
Sigourney Weaver's character correct
it's clearly not about I mean I think
from just what I see in the trailer it's
not about people fighting the alien
creatures that doesn't seem to be at
least that that's not what a hint of
what I've seen you know yes haha but it
does seem to be taking place in or on or
around the the beginning of alien which
is or or alien full-stop which is this
large there's this large alien craft
they stumble upon I mean that is it that
seems to be in your in Prometheus so
there is a connection some connective
tissue there right I mean there's there
are places that are shared there X is
what I'm asking uh yes but not uh I I
think that again I'm not trying to be a
Crypt overly cryptic but if I answer all
these questions I think that we cross
that line from let me just say like
there there was a two minute trailer out
there the people were like I can't wait
to see this movie and then there was a
three minute international challenge
yeah and that one extra minute of
material is the line that you cross
where people start to say you told me to
my right and I agree I think
semi-trailer was gave away so my desire
to not tell you what is the relationship
between my hope is and again this is
frustrating to some but it's the space
in which I live which is the reason to
me that I loved inception was after
inception was over there was stuff for
me to fight about and discuss with my
friends is too
it meant what happened what was a dream
what was in a dream like all those
things that the movie left and some sort
of ambiguous space and I know ambiguity
is a very scary word especially when you
apply it to the context of of the
television that I've done however I will
continue to embrace ambiguity because I
find it really interesting and I have a
tremendous amount of faith in the
intelligence of the audience most of
them are much smarter than I am and I
will have an intention but the idea of
not spelling it out entirely I will tell
you right now that this movie even when
you go and see it there is space to
debate what the relationship between
this movie and alien is we are not
connecting the dots for you we are
giving you the requisite information to
make an impassioned an impassioned
discussion about it you will know a hell
of a lot more than you did before but
it's not like this movie ends with a
derelict spacecraft full of eggs crash
landing on lv-426 which is the derelict
spacecraft that the Nostromo happens
upon at the beginning of alien that's
inevitability and it's not interesting
right so but with ambiguity that the
danger there is it by the way I'm not
just I think I'm not trying to get you
to tell me like what happens in the
movie yeah I guess my question was
they're in the same universe because
there's been a debate with people that
this isn't it completely separate right
universe they are they share the
universe absolutely and I don't want to
segue into the viral of the movie but I
will say like when Ridley and I and I'm
sure he and Jon and a couple of guys
worth mentioning
Michael elenberg who was sort of
Ridley's right-hand guy at scot-free
when I came on there and an executive
producer in the movie and then a guy
Steve as Bell who is an executive at
20th Century Fox who was like the hugest
like alien compendium of information
incredibly impatient creative guy those
guys are worth mentioning very early on
we started saying this is the question
that is not going to go away is it a
prequel what is it so is there a way
that we can start generating content
other than just the trailer to start as
opposed to Ridley Scott in interviews or
me an interview
saying here's the movies relationship to
alien where we can begin to message to
the people who care about that stuff and
the people who care are the people who
are fans of the original the Nerds the
fanboys if we're going to typecast so uh
that was the birth of the the Weyland
idea
now Weyland was a character in John
Speights draft he's a key he is a
character that appears in Prometheus in
a different way than he did originally
but I said Weyland becomes the universal
bridge because we all know the name of
the the company in an alien is
weyland-yutani they are the company that
basically that the Nostromo works for
and they're kemal t a conglomerate
that's into terraforming amongst other
things and so if we say Weyland is in
our movie and we give the audience some
context for who he is and we are then
they'll know that they're happening in
the same universe right and can we can
we shoot a cool piece of material that's
not going to be in our movie it's not a
trailer it's not a scene that you see
three months before the movie comes out
it just exists completely and totally on
its own that will begin to sort of
message that to the people that care and
we think it's important to do that and
really completely and totally agreed and
that was the birth of what evolved into
this Peter Weyland TED talk right that
we unveiled at ed and then and then went
viral that guy Pierce who plays Waylon
in the movie agreed to do and I think
that it's hard to watch that in any
context and then make the argument that
these don't occupy the same behind line
yeah so so getting back to the ambiguity
point I think the danger there and for
what's frustrating for people and I
think that with lost I think a lot of
people feel this way is that it
ambiguities it can sometimes come off as
not like hey here's something for
discussion but you didn't know sure or
like you didn't have the answer right
right it's very frustrating to feel when
you when you're very attached and I
think alien is franchise obviously
people are very very attached to lost
obviously people are very attached to
and it's frustrating when you when you
love something and you really care for
it and you want there to be real answers
you know
for comic book fans and like like
fanboys mm-hmm
getting the answers is really important
sure and so I think that the fine line
you have to walk it with it with being
ambiguous is was it ambiguous because
the person you know doesn't have the
answer or is it ambiguous because they
want you to ask the question right and
and I think that that that's what's that
can be that's what can be frustrating I
mean I I told you I was going to ask you
at the summit so just get into it now I
mean I'm a person who watched lofts all
the way through again and thought the
ending was extremely disappointing okay
disappointing because it felt like if I
felt like the praat there was a promise
of something much more and not profound
maybe not more moving certainly not more
moving in my opinion but something
smarter right and it felt like it ended
on this in this way that was like well
so what was the point
uh-huh and so there the ambiguity was
not I mean there was there stuff that
was specific and stuff that was
ambiguous but I think there was it felt
like well they didn't have the answer
right this was the neatest way to wrap
it up share without having to answer any
of the questions or you know avoiding
some of the questions right do you does
that now haunt you like that kind of
sense of people being of needing the
answer and not getting it and you having
to answer for it I mean I know you
tweeted about Mass Effect the end of
Mass Effect 3 sure you said I wasn't
involved in the ending of rewrite people
have been disappointed with some of its
ambiguity and sure does that feel like
it's haunting you and it does it haunt
you with this I think haunt is probably
not as accurate a word as I think haunt
sort of implies like it's it's it's
something that creates a tremendous
amount of stress and sadness and fear
for me as much as it is something that I
accept as a part of the legacy of that
show and do I embrace it I embrace it in
the same way that Matt Damon embraces
Robin Williams and Good Will Hunting
like under duress and wanting to punch
it too so like it is a it is a it is a
deeply conflicted ongoing battle that I
have
but I have is is is obnoxious and
entitled as the sounds I also have no
regrets about it like so in order to be
haunted by it
like I think regret is part of haunting
where it's sort of like you know I if I
could go back in time I would do it
differently and for me I just sort of
feel that and again my own authorship
and lost I have to say there were a
bunch of other writers on the show there
was JJ at its inception there was
Carlton all the way through there were
amazingly talented writers in the
writers room but I take responsibility
an authorship for lost in in terms of my
own feelings about the ending and I make
no apologies for it
I do feel like that was the ending that
I wanted to do and I was always
comfortable with the ambiguity of the
show and I think that that there were
times over if there was one regret that
I had there there were times over the
course of the show where in interviews I
said the answers are coming but if you I
challenge you to look at any interview
that I gave post the middle of season 3
which was the turning point when they
said you can we can now give you an end
date to the show because up until then
there was there was a degree of
improvisation that had to occur because
we didn't know how many of these things
we were going to do or how long we were
going to be around to be doing them once
we said there's going to be 48 episodes
left at that point a firm plan had to
come into motion then from that point on
I think that I started saying publicly
if you are watching the show for the
answers to your mysteries you're not
going to like the ending and I will I
will pull you know at least 10 instances
of Carlton and I saying this in
interviews and major publications in on
television and I'll say hey you know if
if you didn't do your due diligence and
listen to what we had to say you were
warned right and I just it's not that I
didn't care about the mythology of the
show I just feel like many shows have
come and gone that are very focused on
their mysteries and their mythologies
and their
and there is no were seen in the history
of genre than the architect explaining
to neo everything that happened in the
matrix I wasn't going to touch that with
a ten-foot pole that is a particularly
awful instance of over explanation of
like feeling like you owe it to the
audience right okay so we have the
architect and then we have lost and the
lost lost is not enough and the
architect is too much and somewhere in
between is just right and I'm going to
always be closer to lost than I am to
the architect because that is just not
interesting to me right and I think like
I my own storytelling the things that
capture my imagination and make me want
to re-engage are sometimes frustrating
and challenging but for lost it was like
by the way I will actually answer any
questions that you have about the show
but I won't say oh here's what it was I
will actually refer you I'll give you
the required reading if you're worried
about what the numbers were all about or
what was Walt's purpose or those are the
things that actually bothered me I was
sitting here I've just been sitting here
listening you talk about and I realized
I wasn't disappointed with like that
with lost not giving me answers at the
end what I was actually disappointed
with the answer gave which it felt like
the answer was all the things that just
happened didn't really mean anything
they kind of didn't happen that was that
my takeaway from it what do you mean
they didn't it was like all the things
that happened all these things that were
set up as you know you've got to stop
the man in black because X Y &amp;amp; Z sure uh
it didn't matter
right wooly because it wasn't real yes
it was
well but not really and it was like it
was like a shared fantasy I mean it
didn't seem like there was like I mean
what no so so so the things that were
gone on the island were happening in the
actual world yes I cannot believe we're
talking about this by the way cuz I had
no plans to get into a detailed
conversation about it so they were
happen in like our timeline correct I
mean yes I mean there's no oceanic
Airlines in our no no I mean but but in
the real world not in it's like kind of
like moment before death fantasy world
where everybody's trying to find each
other so they can go to heaven no
correct
so at the end of the show the last frame
of the show Matthew Fox closes his eyes
closes his eye and dies you know that
happened like in our context of
happening like that happened that's all
it's then from the moment that he closed
his eye all that other stuff that we did
in the in the sixth season of the show
the flash sideways where nobody knows
each other and the plane never crashed
that is whatever your interpretation is
I'm not going to talk about what our
intention is but that's what you would
define is not having happened or
happening but everything that we ever
showed you anything that takes place on
the island and lost happened you know
absolutely 100% the plane crash those
people survived everything that you saw
throughout those six seasons like some
whole struggle between good and bad
that's like a really meaningful thing
that actually occurred yes that would
have threatened the universe had not
been the Dharma Initiative Israel the
island is real all those Hurley right
now
right now at this moment in time Hurley
and Ben and with help some with some
help from Walt are actually running
things on the island maintaining it this
is the or the ending good thing about
this for the for the movie that could
have potentially happened no I mean I
what
well look III again I don't want to ruin
the mystery and ambiguity of the show in
terms of talking about our intention but
I do feel like one of the things that we
always wanted to do and we're very
passionate about doing was exploring the
idea of purgatory both figuratively and
literally and this was so obvious to the
audience that within three or four
episodes of the of the first season of
the show they were like it's purgatory
right they're all dead and we kept
saying we swear to God they are not all
dead this is really happening but the
audience is telling us that they really
want some sort of clinical evaluation of
an afterlife right and purgatory is
about judgment and this show has never
really offered up what I would call
Christian Judeo judgment in terms of
there's a deity it's always about self
judgment so the idea of like and you
know does Jack
think that he's worthy or Sawyer can
Sawyer forgive himself for his sins or
did Kate kill her stepfather justifiably
so I always felt like if the characters
can forgive themselves then they can
then then the show's over show's called
lost it's not because they're on an
island it's because they're lost so
right so how are we going to creatively
demonstrate that self forgiveness we're
going to we're going to do this idea and
so there was an interpretation I think
largely a large part of it came from
ABC's decision to run footage of the
plane wreckage over the end credits of
the finale and we publicly got out and
said oh my god that was not our idea
right don't don't it that was kind of
like well it did almost a race a lot I
think that that was the feeling but we
also anticipated your reaction in terms
of and here's the thing is I can't logic
anyone who is disappointed in the finale
and is suddenly being undisciplined with
it right you have a visceral reaction to
things you either like them or you don't
like them and I honor your your your
feedback among and the feedback of other
dissenters that is to say though that in
the fun I think that in the final scene
of the show that proceeds the church
where basically Jack's father Christian
Shepard says some things to Jack one of
the things that Jack says is like wait a
minute hold on is this is this real
like did any of this happen like because
josh is going to be busting Damon's
balls about this and Jamie's going to
new year a few years after the famines
going to need to say something we edited
that part out because it would have been
weird for you uh-huh like you would have
been like oh my god this is strange but
then his father says it's all real it
all happened everything happened you
know and so I was like that's going to
make it pretty clear but yeah I wasn't
clear enough I have to say it's been so
it's been I mean when did the show and
how many years ago was it two years two
years ago which is seems like a long
time lot of stuff exactly like it ended
you
it ended May 23rd of 2000 the 2009/2010
sorry I I mean I am distant from it now
but I just remember that I had that
feeling of going well this none nothing
matters that's interesting now I want to
go back and watch it having heard this
from you let me now that I've got you on
the couch though because I'm actually
I've actually got you on the couch but
that's fine I find this refreshing
because I am actually really interested
in in gait few people will engage me on
their level of disappointment because
it's an uncomfortable thing to do that's
like telling somebody works so I yeah
but I like it and what I would say to
you is coming into the finale the night
that the finale is going to air like
before you even sit down to watch it can
you honestly tell me that you felt
optimistic that at the end of those two
and a half hours you would be satisfied
or were you already like this no I think
that something could have happened
rather be really satisfied right you up
until that point in the show you were
like I love I because you guys had been
you your faith had not wavered prior to
oh no no my faith had wavered plenty
there were three whole seasons that I
was like this is why am I wasting my
time watching this show because they
were just very disappointed I have a
quest and I actually want to ask about
that because I feel like to me lost felt
like a show that was meant to be fewer
seasons than it actually was and you
even said there was some filler there oh
my god sure I mean to me it felt like
and this actually gets to it so let me
be before I get into this question and
we will talk about prometheus at some
point I was look if you guys had had
revealed that the entire thing was some
thereof in space it was part of an alien
experiment going on with thousands of
other groups of humans that they'd been
plucking off the planet yeah I was
riffing by the way I've just I have been
like okay this is like some weird philip
k dick stuff that's how it's going to
end it's gonna be like
slaughterhouse-five and I could get
totally behind that right because it was
like it would have made sense to me that
a lot of things didn't make sense and it
would have also been a really upsetting
ending share sort of a nada I feel like
the ending was almost like a happy
ending and which to me I didn't see
coming or kind of didn't want right by
the way I'm one man amongst millions and
millions of shows people I mean admit I
know
there are millions of people who love
the end are very satisfied by it sure
but but yeah there were things that I
think that going into it I felt like if
there had been I wasn't my mind wasn't
set against there being a conclusion
that I would have been happy with if Bob
Newhart had woken up and it had all been
a dream that he was having which I
talked about for years as a ninja with
my wife I would have been completely
satisfied with that ending and would
have thought it was the most brilliant
thing that was ever put on television
sure we wouldn't be having this
conversation right now yeah I mean I
guess I'd be I we resigned ourselves
either correctly or incorrectly fairly
early on to the idea that whatever
mythological construct we came up with
for what the ultimate ending of the show
was and I feel personally speaking like
one of the most unsuccessful episodes of
lost is this one across the sea which
basically tells the origin story of
Jacob and the man in black and it's just
kind of rife with like fundamental
explanation it's as close to the
architect scene as we got and it also
needed to set up like here's where the
end the end game of the island is going
to play out that that's sort of like I
wasn't really emotionally invested in
that episode because it didn't feature
any of the people that I had been told
to care about in the preceding 115
episodes it wasn't that Jacob and the
man in black weren't interesting
characters they were but it was sort of
like wait a minute I thought the show
was about any time you say to people
what's lost about it starts with like
well there's this plane crash and
therefore they don't say like well
centuries and centuries ago in fact
millennia ago if they say that you go
like boom out so I always just felt like
the the show that the ending that we
were shooting for was going to be one
that the dealt was sort of the emotional
reality of the characters and gave some
fundamental explanation for why what did
these people get out of this plane crash
right and the and the answer is corny as
it sounds
was the one that appealed to me the most
which is each other that's what they got
they were all sad individuals who were
lost in their own lives and hated
themselves and somehow they found some
fundamental community amongst each other
they hadn't met each other and spent all
that time on the island then they would
never have been able to forgive
themselves for their past sins and break
through to some sort of level of self
awakening and forgiveness
it is new agey it is okay but it's the
story that I wanted to tell it's
interesting because I feel like now my
the alien ending that I just talked
about seems very cynical and
mean-spirited in comparison to what you
were talking about like I wanted to find
each other and be happy well which is
like they are doomed in space to go
through alien experiments but the thing
is when you go for anything there's
going to be some fundamental
polarization so that like life on Mars
for example the American version I will
not spoil the ending for anybody who
wants to embark on it but the concept of
life on Mars is that basically a
detective played by Jason O'Mara and the
British in the American version
basically he he he is without
explanation suddenly finds himself in
the 70s as a cop and so the series is
asking he gets in a car crash and then
he wakes up in the 70s as a cop and so
the series starts to ask the question of
like well how is this possible and they
did 13 episodes the show was cancelled
but they did resolve the the ending of
the show well there was a resolution it
was an explanation for how that happened
and I would say that it is very much in
the wheelhouse of what what your
solution was and there were some people
who said that that was great and clever
and there were a lot of people who said
that they didn't like it right and um if
there is a perfect ending out there for
a long form sort of mythology serious
the Newhart ending doesn't apply because
it was a sitcom they just did a very
clever last scene right for the entire
series but well that's extreme that one
is really like but there are no more
question right but it's almost like
saying elsewhere like they did the crazy
snow globe ending but this but it was
just a hospital show it didn't even
require that right but if I said to you
like let me ask you something do you
like the x-files are you asking me that
round asking oh I love it what happened
at the end of the x-files in the last
episode and just anything that happened
so loose you remember Airy last episode
yeah I'm trying to think it's been year
uh I don't remember right so I said oh
releasing I have I remember the universe
I kind of remember with the resolution
like what happened to the warring alien
fat boy ler alert whoever's watching
yeah it's been long enough screw you you
should have seen it yes uh you know I
remember that you know what happens the
smoking man oh is he is he I don't know
I feel like I am gonna spoil it for
people but I kind of remember what
happens but you have a question here
what is your question it wasn't a
question it was at least you remember
being really disappointed in the way
lost ended and you have very specific
memories of why you were disciplined -
right but you know it's it's what had an
ending that was very clear yeah I'll say
that it wasn't in any that I
particularly liked yes but it had an
ending it had an ending yes it
definitely added and something you could
you know say specifically happened to
the characters right and I feel like at
the very least no matter what your
interpretation is you do know that
everyone that you ever cared about died
and and that you got treated to some
version of an epilogue how it is they
died and how that all fits together
discuss amongst yourselves I feel like
we were pretty clear in it but one of
the things that I didn't want people to
do is like well when's the movie coming
out right sort of like when The Sopranos
ended and people were like I hope
there's a Sopranos movie I'm like if
they do a movie it completely nullifies
the brilliance of the cut to black yeah
and there were people who didn't like
the cut to black because they felt like
they wanted more resolution or that
there was a promise of more resolution
and at the end of the day like they
didn't even understand that a movie
would completely and totally erase the
boldness of that decision it's just like
that's it like that's the last time you
ever will see Tony Soprano is eating
onion rings in that diner with this
family that's all you get I also imagine
that ends by the way that's an alien
experiment yes I know some and guess
what spaceship no one can prove you
wrong
that's right even David chances well
that's why it's so brilliant why it's
perfect so so so actually let's bring
this back around to what you're seeing
right we're talking about alien space
alien spaceships but but the the
creating something that goes on for six
seasons or longer seems like a kind of a
challenge to
on the creative process of telling a
story I mean it seems like a finite you
know a book I mean you do have books
like you know the game of Thrones books
that are obviously they're going on and
on right and that works yes but it does
often feel like in the creative process
you want to have some you want to know
there's a finite amount that you can you
can say right now I feel like dark shows
that work really well because they're
like you know the office the British
office for instance yes they said we're
gonna do two seasons and we're done yep
and it isn't special any Christmas
special right where they answer a bunch
of questions wrap ups and absolutely we
finally understand we know what happened
with made the operands kick yeah yeah
sure uh is it more satisfying to you in
some ways to work on something like
Prometheus where you have you're like
look I've got two hours to deal with
this thing there's not going to be any
filler I've got to tell this story
succinctly and answer questions in a
relatively short amount of time is that
more satisfying them to you now you you
know you've obviously done both things
what do you get more satisfaction out of
and do you think it's actually I mean
because I I'm sorry I'm gonna let you
answer that question but I have a
follow-up to it yeah I mean it is very
satisfying to to do a movie that has a
beginning middle and end and you know
exactly what you're getting into when
you start the job television you don't
know what you're getting into you don't
know how many years it's going to be on
for you don't its hubris to say I have a
plan for the entire second season of the
show because no one's even watching it
yet they have to like it for you to get
to that point so they're you know and I
talk about this often so I won't belabor
the point but the two things that sort
of came up all the time during lost
where question number one are you making
it up as you go along and the answer to
that question is no like that's what
people want you to say no we absolutely
have a firm plan and there's a binder
over there and that's where our plan is
and we've got it and you're in good
hands mommy and daddy know where we're
going don't worry about you have a map
that's question number one question
number two how much input does the
audience have and the answer to that
question is a lot we listen to you guys
all the time we want to know what you
like and what you don't like and we will
adjust accordingly are these your actual
answers these are the
that people want these are the answers
that people want yeah you know nobody
wants to be told you don't matter like
the audience like we don't care what you
have to say about the show we're doing
it the way we want to do it and nobody
wants to hear we don't have a plan we're
kind of winging it and whatever feels
right we're going to do like the true
those the real answers they are not the
real answers the real answers I've given
an is politic as they may sound the real
answers are there is a plan and when the
plan doesn't work we change the plan and
the other answer is yes we really listen
to what you have to say but norm like
98% of the time we agree with you before
you've said it because the episode that
you've just hated we hated six months
ago when we first wrote it and we
started fixing already so there's a
space between the seasons where you're
where it matters a lot because we
haven't started writing the next season
of the show yet but while the show is on
it's we can see the iceberg that you are
telling us to not hit but we can't turn
off the ship we can't turn off the
engines in time to not hit it we've
already written those episodes so those
are the those are the true answers but
the bit the inherent contradiction
between those two ideas of you you you
want to listen to us but at the same
time listening to us would require you
to deviate from the plan that we want
you to have it feels like it's a
catch-22 which is exactly what it is but
I love being in that catch-22 like I
love doing that dance and I do feel like
I there's a lack of safety and
television that's so exciting to me and
that's why I watch TV because I sort of
feel like anything can happen it can
sort of go off a cliff and the more fast
and loose and dangerous you play the
more exciting it is to watch and
sometimes that means creatively and I I
sort of embraced that idea I did learn
lessons you know from loss that I feel
rolled into Prometheus and what's
interesting about the original alien is
you can watch that movie and be like I'm
curious as to what what's the story with
that space jockey in this derelict ship
but that isn't important the movie isn't
telling you that that's important the
movie is telling you that the thing that
just jumped out of the egg on that ship
and is now stuck to John hurts
face that's important that's what you're
supposed to worry about now and then and
then the sequel and so on and so forth
but the idea that Prometheus now enters
into a more and maybe this is why Ridley
and those guys sought me out in the
first place into the movie is asking
very specific questions the characters
are saying we want answers to these
questions some of the answers they get
some of the answers they extrapolate and
but then something happens that leads
the resolution of the questions is
secondary to their own survival I think
all of this stuff is already endemic
people don't want to see Prometheus like
a bunch of people sitting around a table
pondering the meaning of life they want
to see like what happens when you open
Pandora's Box like that's fundamental
sci-fi storytelling the scientist wants
to make giant Tomatoes to feed the world
and the next thing you know there's
enormous ants and spiders like crawling
through Albuquerque eating people and
it's it's that idea of like we want to
there's a line we shouldn't cross the
line we all know we shouldn't cross it
we shouldn't fly too close to the Sun we
shouldn't steal fire from the gods
we do it anyway we can't help ourselves
we're humans and then we pay the
consequences that's sci-fi 101 that's
the story that really wanted to tell
that's why I loved Blade Runner it's
it's why I loved alien and it's like
almost every alien movie is essentially
about an iteration of the same theme
which is no matter what these things do
to us the company keeps feeling there's
a way to monetize all right you know
right it's like all right well you think
we would have learned our lesson a
second got it I know last word did I
well yeah exactly this is gonna be it
right it is odd you would think for such
a smart group of people they would just
go you know what but that's us I mean we
can't help ourselves and we wanna
everyone says like oh my god like when
people are in a scary you know in a
house and they hear a noise in the Attic
and then they're like we should go check
that out you just moan to yourself like
ah but if they just left the house like
what's that movie right you know or but
in but in your life you would I mean you
would you go investigate the sound I
guess maybe you would I'll tell you what
I would do I would call the police
that's what I do
just and
depends on the sound maybe just like a
little like a squeak or something you're
not gonna call the police no I will go
and check it out what what sound what
how what kind of sound would have to be
to get you to call the police let me ask
you a question like is the house like a
people been murdered in the house before
yeah you bought a house you got a summer
home for your family yes and you found
out when you guys were moving in that
family had been murdered there right and
then I hear a noise in the Attic you're
a noise it sounds like a person moaning
yeah uh I do not go and check that you
call the police right well I send my
wife or that's nice you know he's just
I'm sure your wife would be so happy can
you guys see with the screaming right on
it is yeah that's really wonderful
um I probably don't do anything you know
I probably just like that's a really
scary noise like we should just stay
down and flip the house right for profit
sure absolutely bad try not to do
trinomials like no betcha the murder
think we're grandfathered in we weren't
murdered yeah you were there for a whole
couple of days right exactly
Prometheus viral stuff yes you first off
what is your level of involvement in the
in the viral things like the the David
video and and you've got a new one new
viral video that's yeah that just
could've just came out the the viral
stuff that stuff that we did on lost all
the time I'm really into viral stuff for
other movies I did not invent viral by
any stretch of the imagination but it's
always been something that I've really
been interested in one of the one of the
failings I think sometimes a viral
content is that it doesn't feature the
actors from the movie so it's just like
it's kind of like just for the Nerds so
it's like put together the trailer for
the movie or whatever and I love doing
that stuff but I'm essentially like for
something to really like be interesting
and compelling like it should have the
same production value of the movie and
for that you need the resources so it's
like who's going to have the balls to
say to Michael Fassbender can we take
you for a day and do this cool idea that
we had but Ridley the great there are so
many great things about him but he and
Tony run this company RSA which is
essentially their commercial production
house so they have all these brilliant
like young commercial directors who are
enormous ly innovative individuals used
to basically just kind of
conceptualizing and figuring out on
their own laptops Adam
content and so we had that resource at
our disposal and so Michael elenberg and
I essentially started saying like the
first idea I had was I was just really
into TED Talks and I was like we should
do a TED talk with Weyland and it'll be
we'll get if we can talk guy into it we
don't have to do a full 18 minute TED
talk but we can talk about some of the
themes of the movie but it'll be like in
the future like we'll set it in like 20
23 tab and like um we just have to ask
Ted if they let us use their branding
otherwise it'll be like a Fred talk and
it'll feel like cheap and disingenuous
right and I know this guy Tom Reilly who
is um who's sort of um you know this
very plugged in super tech-savvy very
cool geek at Ted who when I went to the
conference was sort of like my conduit
in there I called him up and was like
would you guys be open to letting us use
the Ted branding and he said I'll do you
one better
what if you showed it at Ted you know
what if you unveiled it at Ted and we
and you could use even the Ted website
to show this thing and so everybody got
super excited about that when we pitch
it to Ridley and then he essentially I
wrote the TED talk and and then his son
Luke Ridley's son Luke directed a guy
through the TED talk and then produced
that entire thing through our essay and
then the I said the other idea that we
had was we should do a commercial for
David the Android I was like there's
there's commercials for iPhones this is
before Siri came along I was like
there's a commercial for an iPad or an
iPhone wouldn't a robot have a
commercial light and what would that
look like and so this guy Johnny hard
staff that's his real name
come on you know what his porn name is
like Glen Frankford like it's completely
innocuous no his name's Johnny Hart
right of course I would have to be he
bit he basically took that idea the
David idea and ran with it and I wrote
some some consum dialogue for that but a
lot of the visual ideas were totally
Johnny's and and were produced by those
guys and then the first piece of viral
was
new we really want a new Mira pass to
basically be the star of the movie and
she had done girl with a dragon tattoo
and was already doing the Sherlock
Holmes sequel but I think Fox just
wanted to see to see her on film to do a
screen test with her and so I wrote this
this transmission that she makes to
Wayland
in an effort to try to convince him to
fund her crazy mission and so that it
would just be a monologue for her
because there wasn't really any there
weren't really any monologues in the
movie and so we gave that to new me and
then she did it and it was super Ridley
didn't shoot like it wasn't just new
Mira Paz on video he filmed it like she
was in costume you know it was there was
incredibly high production value it was
like well this should go on the DVD and
he's like screw the DVD this should be a
piece of viral like if I saw this on my
laptop like on YouTube I would find it
enormously compelling I'd wanna I want
to go see that movie right and so that
was that was sort of the genesis for for
that idea so in Fox marketing I have to
say like it's easy to blow smoke because
essentially they're my bosses but all
the people over there from bumble Ward
and and and Katharine covert and Nathan
Marcy of all like so embraced the viral
idea they completely understood what it
was and so the idea of using that to
kind of bolster the more traditional
trailers because there was this period
where nobody was talking about
prometheus is it a prequel what is it
and then very quickly we just flooded
everybody with all this materials so
then the conversation became about like
well what is this what does this mean
how does this how does this fit into the
overall puzzle of the movie and they
just the way that they doled it out and
however they told it out created a
zeitgeist where there there was no as I
guys there was only sort of curiosity
bordering on frustration
yeah because it's that thing of like
you've got to give me something right
and I think the viral became an answer
to all right look this is the something
that we're giving you what's really
interesting about it too is that it
creates this grout it somehow makes the
it makes the film so much larger
it broadens that universe of the movie
right it's like suddenly it feels like
it's got gravity they didn't have before
because there are artifacts from that
universe that have you know it's kind of
clear the David commercials not going to
appear in the movie yes right you
wouldn't deserve that in the middle of
the film but it gives the idea of this
universe so much more wait to have these
little artifacts that live outside of
the film itself which i think is really
fascinating it's something that we now
have a medium where we can we can you
can you can do the film for theater yes
right and but we've got this amazing
fluid flexible medium of the web that
allows you to show the masses these
other little pieces that kind of flesh
out some way that the universe that
you're trying to create for the big
screen and I think that as a native
people are so hungry for any additional
content because it creates this sort of
this this feeling of being in the know
being a super fan of something you have
sort of a stock and trade so you're able
to say like hey did you see the David
video and other people are like no and
you're like oh I'll send you the link
and then that suddenly makes you a
purveyor of content you're you're on the
inside and I think it's like again to go
back to like kind of what Marvel did by
at the end of Iron Man by just dropping
in that reference to the Avengers and
having you know Nick Fury pitch that
Avengers initiative and that became the
first piece of viral for like I have a
better word you know that led us down
the road to Avengers but suddenly what
started happening is for any Marvel
movie the entire audience will just sit
there through all of the credits just to
have the experience of watching 90
seconds more of content and uh it and
it's like did you did you need to do
this Joss Whedon you did not you're
giving this to me this gift like you've
already got my 14 bucks and you're not
only going to give me like one
post-credit scenes but now like if I sit
through the entire movie there's yet
another one and thank you like any kind
of sort it's a premium is what it is
because you know as opposed to looking
at at viral as marketing to get you to
see the next one which by the way that's
what the Tony Stark Nick Fury scene at
the end of Iron Man
it's viral marketing they're essentially
saying go buy a ticket for the Avengers
right like if you didn't know what
coming like you and I knew what the
Avengers were before we saw Ironman but
my wife didn't she was like what's
Avengers yeah and I was like homeboy
just wait yeah do you have like two
hours you start with the Infinity
Gauntlet yeah that's that's I mean that
is interesting I mean to think that well
it's actually I think a viral is purely
for the Internet but it's interesting to
think about it as something that now is
we're like putting Easter eggs and
movies because they're essentially
Easter eggs in some way right because
fanboy culture has bled so much into the
mainstream that people are looking for
it like you said like people are like
looking for these little clues viral is
Sasha Baron Cohen showing up at the
Academy Awards and spelling Ash's on
Ryan Seacrest and that's you know it
becomes web content because you heard
that it happened but when it first
happened it was live theater it was you
know it was that it was that idea of a
shell being in the audience so viral by
definition is any form of a Content that
gets you more excited for the product
that its steering you towards right is
Prometheus an action movie
and before you answer I want to set this
up a little bit it seems like modern-day
science fiction cannot exist without it
having an action component and if you
look at you know a movie like 2001 I
would not classify it's it's not an
action of it correct something else yes
so did you is prometheus an action movie
or is it something else I couldn't
describe it as an action movie any more
than I would describe inception as an
action movie but there's a lot of
explosions and people shooting guns and
the entire you know that entire final
set piece and inception that takes place
at the snow fortress is actually an x
action set piece you know it just
doesn't feel like an action movie so I
wouldn't describe it that way I think
not that I'm putting Prometheus and
Inception on the same in terms of
they're the same movie I'm just
answering your question in that way was
saying like first and foremost I think
it's a sci-fi movie and I think I think
that it's safe to say prometheus is as
much an action movie as alien is
horror movie which is it trades on those
genre elements obviously just from the
trailer you've seen there's there's much
more of an action fuse on Prometheus
than I think then I then I then I think
alien but I would say aliens is an
action movie
yeah and Prometheus is much more if it
feels a lot more like alien than aliens
to me in terms of its storytelling I
think it takes its time and and it's not
just about getting to the next set piece
that being said once that fuse gets lit
it's a there there is a fair amount of
sort of scope and sizzle to it bollocks
and really really wanted to do that
stuff I think one of the things that
I've been hearing both again in in the
reoccurring theme of this interview you
take the good with the bad is the good
side it's like this feels a lot like the
original alien like because there's
motifs in the original alien there's an
Android you're not entirely sure you
trust there's people in cryosleep
there's a there's a female lead there's
clearly something happening to these
people that is reminiscent of those
ideas
there's creeping around through dark
corridors with flashlights like so
people go this feels a lot like alien
and then there's other people who are
saying like this feels a lot like alien
so like it's just that it's just more of
the same sex and look and you that
that's what you're up against when you
are courting that fan base and I'll take
it every day of the week like that's the
price of doing business because I I'm
just as critical of of other content and
I would rather have people say to me for
the rest of my career you screwed up a
Ridley Scott movie then not say that to
me because I'm like hey like I got to be
involved in a Ridley Scott I got a screw
up a rivers go Maasai fight not only did
I screw up a really Scott movie I
screwed up the first Ridley Scott's
sci-fi movie in 30 years like that if
that's not going to go on your headstone
then what should I think that's a good
place to edit Kamin thanks so much
my pleasure really off thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
