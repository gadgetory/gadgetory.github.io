trying his hand at hardware with two new
devices project mighty is a
pressure-sensitive stylus that uses
bluetooth to draw on an ipad or iphone

companion digital ruler that lets users
draw straight lines or curved shapes in
a possible blow to software pirates
everywhere the company also announced

creative suite will only be available
through its online subscription service
Creative Cloud the new versions of Adobe
Creative Cloud will be released jun 17
projects mighty and napoleon are still
in development remember how the new xbox
was supposed to require an always-on
internet connection that might not be
the case Ars Technica reports that an
internal microsoft memo has dismissed a
mandate stating that quote there are a
number of scenarios that our users
expect to work without an internet
connection along with single-player
gaming the memo mentions watching a
blu-ray disc or live TV as a few of
those scenarios of course we're
resetting to hear the full details at

multi-year deal with EA for new games
