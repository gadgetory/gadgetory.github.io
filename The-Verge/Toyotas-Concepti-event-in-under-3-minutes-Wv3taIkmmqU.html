welcome you here to the 2017 Consumer
Electronics Show it is my pleasure to
introduce to you the advanced artificial
intelligence system we call Yui now Yui
learns from us grows with us builds a
relationship that's meaningful and
emotional so Yui what are you still
doing up on the screen why don't you
come down and show everybody our new
amazing car
say hello to the Toyota concept I even
the exterior of the vehicle is about
building a relationship between the car
in the world around it and focus on the
driver vehicle relationship now thanks
to Yui the concept is built to enhance
that relationship this is a vehicle that
grows with you the more you drive the
smarter you it gets now this concept I
isn't going to be on the road tomorrow
but we still have a lawful lot of work
to do and yet we know as wonderful as
artificial intelligence is artificial
intelligence systems are inevitably
flawed pri is taking a two-track
approach we're simultaneously developing
a system that we call Guardian which is
designed to make human driving safer
while simultaneously we are working on
artificial intelligence in a system that
we call chauffeur and so the difference
is that Guardian only engages when it's
needed
while chauffeur engages all of the time
whenever the autonomy is turned on the
Guardian driver is meant to be in
control of the car at all times except
in the cases where the Guardian
anticipates or identifies a pending
incident and briefly employs some kind
of corrective response depending on the
situation Guardian can alert the driver
with visual cues with audible alarms and
then if necessary influence or control
speed and steering the same way that a
chauffeur would do but only temporarily
the concept I might also be a way to
modulate and maintain the driver
situational awareness using mild
secondary tasks to promote safety
perhaps for example UE could engage the
driver in a conversation that would
reduce the vigilance decrement the way
talking on the two-way radio or even
looking for speed traps seems to do with
truck drivers and so our goal at TR eye
is to someday create a car that will
never be responsible for causing a crash</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
