here with the new surface headphones
from Microsoft now these are the first
wearable devices in Microsoft Surface
product line we've seen tablets and
laptops and crazy desktop computers like
the surface studio but the server's
headphones are something you can
actually put on and wear out of the
house now they are wireless Bluetooth
noise cancelling headphones and their
over ear style so they go on top of the
ears of your on the side of your head
and they're pretty similar in a lot of
the features that we're familiar with
this kind of headphone so if you're
familiar with Beats wireless headphones
or Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen 2bl play headphones
and many others these are pretty similar
but there are some really unique
features here that Microsoft built in
now you've got touch controls on the
side so you can tap to play and pause
and you can double tap to skip tracks
you can also long press to launch
Cortana or you can say hey Cortana and
Cortana will launch on your phone or
your PC and then give you answers you've
got a USB C charging port ten point five
millimeter line in so you can use some
wired standard button to mute the
microphone and then power and then on
the other side you kind of got a similar
design now what's really unique here is
on the right Cup you've got a volume
scroll wheel so you can raise your and
lower your vanguard easily but on the
left side you've got a same kind of
wheel that adjusts the noise canceling
features so you can adjust it from 13
different levels you can completely
block out all outside sound or you can
turn it down and let in some outside
sound if you need to talk to a colleague
or hear traffic or whatever it's a
really unique feature many headphones
that are like this let you either just
turn the noise canceling off or on or
maybe not even bad it's just always on
even will do adjust it to that many
levels is really quite unique now inside
they've got 40 millimeter drivers you
got big padded memory phone ear cuffs
arch it really quite comfortable they've
got this like big cutout for your ears
or yours fit right inside of them an
adjustable headband they fold flat
they're gonna come with a case that you
can put it in for travel and such like
that and they're mostly plastic and this
kind of squishy material memory foam
material very similar to kind of beasts
headphones if you're familiar with them
in the past now Microsoft says that it's
going to be shipping these by the end of
the year before the holiday season
they're gonna cost about three hundred
and fifty dollars which is about right
in line with the price of other
headphones of this style now for sound
quality I briefly try
them and it's a pretty loud environment
but they sound basically like a lot of
other headphones like this you're gonna
have really punchy bass you're gonna
have good decent presence but it's not
gonna be a super wide soundstage and you
shouldn't expect like audiophile sparkly
highs and stuff but for this price point
and what these offer I think a lot of
people are going to be really happy with
the way they sound so that's it on the
surface headphones for everything else
that Microsoft announced today the new
surface pro 6 the surface laptop to the
new surface studio
