big boat there we go
that is the beginnings of circuit any
futuristic doesn't have to be meal it
can also mean using old tech in a way
that hasn't been done before we're here
in the seaside town of Margate to visit
Sam battle Sam is also known as look mum
no computer he's a musician and circuit
bender who breaks apart old toys and
sins to create his own instruments some
of his creations include a musical
flamethrower and a pervy organ he's
invited me into a studio so that I can
check out some of his creations for
myself and so we can break open a toy
and circuit bend it together my name's
Sam and I do a project called look mum
no computer which is basically like
repurposing things and making silly
inventions that are loosely based around
music and I do do some circuit bending
things
what is circuit bending circuit bending
is basically taking like machines and
toys and cheap things from the past or
even nowadays and just making them do
things that they're not intended to do
usually like let's say in the 70s
somebody's got a toy in there I could
speak and spelled like those orange and
yellow toys like somebody's eye I wonder
what it's like inside there they pull it
apart they see all these circuit bits
lick their fingers because it's only got
two batteries you're not going to
electrocute yourself blue I'm joking and
then it makes you find that it makes
different sounds or you can change the
pitch if you touch the ground with one
finger and like a certain bit of the
chip goes like oh yeah and like you're
making it do an intent of things in this
maybe it began probably as something
that was fun and then it quickly like
evolved into something like musicians
used to make new sounds out of tight
circuit bending spans several musical
genres with artists like Trent Reznor of
Nine Inch Nails Beck and Danny Elfman
all using circuit bent instruments and
performances well it's not as popular
anymore
the
still something about Sam's creations
that's just really cool
they're massive and insane for a full
circuit Ben Furbies all circuit been in
sequence around the back if you look
really carefully behind it they will see
behind them they've got like you can see
all the wires and stuff a little peek in
there now you miss it now you miss the
sound but how long did you get built
this thing I built this in about two
weeks if not sleeping however I've been
planning it for seven years and then it
took me about a year to find all of the
furbies this is like Gordon Ramsay but
Furbys someone what God do is we've got
to get it really by removing its
protective cable tie then you got a bear
bit forceful so there we go
oh wow okay now when you go do is you
get that and have a fiddle there's no
wrong
and there we go I mean what you do is
you find something like that yeah and
then you put some sort of thing that
would make this permanent or not so you
snip that and you put switch on it so
you can choose those control over it
nice they just see what it does
sit back and enjoy
I mean I've always I've circuit been
Furbies a lot from when I started
because they were quite cheap for how
advanced they were in what they did
apparently ever since they came out
there was a people that wanted to you
know fiddle with them and see what's
inside them circuit bending really was
it was an exploitation of this little
window of time when the scale and
complexity of electronics was just right
you know it was complex enough to do
wild stuff but simple enough that a
little hat could make it you know
malfunction in cool ways that's Peter
Edwards who founded Casper electronics
he's a circuit bending expert who has
built custom instruments for bands the
consumer electronics we have in our
lives have evolved in a way that's
completely oblivious to these hacking
practices and have moved away from hack
ability I was teaching circuit bending
workshops for about 10 years and then I
stopped because eventually no one in the
workshop could hack anything there was
nothing to bend because the circuits
just weren't bendable anymore so yeah is
there a future for circuit bending I
think from the perspective of modifying
kids toys I think no not really
but from the perspective of people
approaching you know consumer products
and electronics with an adventurous
spirit and finding new ways to use them
like absolutely and Sam is one of these
people who is pushing the medium forward
and finding new ways to make music
through hacking electronics
it's like a DEFCON fight yeah hit up
every every since bike needs a air horn
this one's even got a head it's got a
face look every synthesizer needs a face
his name is Cosmo or huh I don't know
right now we're going to control it with
this solar panel so I'm going to patch
in a solar panel into the parameter that
controls the mouth so I'm gonna get the
solar panel are you ready okay so to be
fair with circuit bending it's not
nearly as popular as it used to be there
aren't a lot of people that do it as
much anymore but you are over here doing
the absolute most that you could
possibly do with circuit bending and
doing these gigantic projects yeah yeah
I feel it's involved a bit the kind of
people that did circuit bending are into
building like modular synths now and
stuff like that
the problem with modern toys is they're
not as hackable as the old ones however
you can still hack them but they require
a different way to do it and it's not
usually as obvious but I love it and I
just I'm trying to take it to different
levels and like right now I'm trying to
take existing projects that I've had in
my head and just make them larger but
why when everything has a when
everything is evolved so that you can do
it on a laptop and there are digital
replications of most Hardware
instruments that are out there yeah why
put in all of the effort and time and
money into creating is so tough I mean
the only answer I have is why not I
guess I've just a deeply curious do you
make music and all digitally at this
point or do you are you really committed
to just using hardware I think I'd be
crazy to just do hardware I mean like
computer is a very enabling for people I
do a lot of work with a variety and I
tend to be stuck in front of a computer
for that stuff anyway shot myself in the
foot with the name like look I'm no
computer company use a computer but at
the same time whatever like I make the
rules
I make the rules for my project so you
can't tell me if I couldn't use a
computer or not because
the name Tec in music runs the gamut
from futuristic technologies like AI on
one hand to circuit bending old
electronics on the other circuit bending
has fallen out of style a little bit but
that doesn't mean that it hasn't
continued to evolve and progress
creativity doesn't require new
technology but rather a new way of
looking at the things that you already
have this video is presented by aloft
hotels different by design if you
