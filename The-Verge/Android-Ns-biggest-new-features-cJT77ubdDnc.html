beta for public consumption
this has been out in the wild for a
little bit now but Google says it's it's
safe to put it on your phone so we put
it on our phone and we're going to check
it out so the biggest change is
multitasking so it's just like the old
times you can push that little square
button and you get a view of all your
open apps there's a new clear all button
you want to clear all apparently this
was much requested people applauded when
Google announced the clear all button
but the most important part is
multitasking so if I'm in an app like
I'm in Chrome right now if I hold down
this button I get to choose a second app
to have side by side and you see that
little warning the app may not work with
split screen
I'm guessing a lot of apps will be
tweaked and improved in the coming
months before this is actually released
so that they're not going to warn you
about that but it works just fine even
even with that warning you can resize
this split here if you want to get rid
of an app you just drag it away and the
other cool little tweak is it's like alt
tab for Android if you double tap this
button it's going to switch between your
most recently used app so if you're
bouncing back and forth between two apps
you're not in the split screens you can
just double tap there you go the other
big tweak of Android in is notifications
they're full width now and you can reply
inline just kind of cool that's a bummer
can also press down on a message and
change like what kind of notifications
you get from that app right from there
but I like I like getting my hangouts
the only thing that's different about
the notification tray is that when you
drag down you get these options right
here you don't have to expand which used
to take two taps on marshmallow to get
us these quick like toggles for settings
so now it's just really easy to turn on
a flashlight also this this animation is
totally superfluous but it's really
pretty clear that it's just amazing
speaking of settings the actual settings
menu has been changed a little bit it
now shows you kind of information about
each one of these options it's kind of
like where it's at right now the ringer
volume is at 71% I have 36 apps
installed so you don't have to dive into
each of one of these to figure it out it
also recommends settings for you
you know settings that you maybe you
haven't used recently and they're
missing you so this wants me there like
I had a fingerprint set up email which
makes a lot of sense you can also just
collapse that if you know what you want
another big change is you can now change
your keyboard theme for the default
Google keyboard so you can pick a color
like pink or red or blue you also pick a
photo background you can turn on and off
the keyboard er so let's check it out
and we could type on Jake's face so Jake
that's totally Jake this was also
designed some new emojis for Android n
basically kind of revamp a lot of them
these blobs used to be kind of a bunch
of different shapes and now they're just
pretty uniform blobs but still not
circles importantly Google's also
proposing some new professional women
emojis which aren't in here yet but I'm
looking forward to see where where's the
cops here we go so these are the these
are the current professionals and they
used to be these like weird finger
shapes I think this is much more
pleasing that's about it Android n is
not a big change over marshmallow it's
supposed to be faster it's got these
little tweaks that are nice to haves
there is some stuff under the hood like
there's this new
compiler apps are supposed to launch
faster and run faster
there's Vulcan graphics which should
make games run better and consume less
battery there's also a bunch of VR step
that's coming and and that's going to
require new hardware and that's kind of
a whole program and it doesn't so far I
have a lot to do with Android in and
there's also instant apps you click a
web link you get an app it's like pretty
slick apparently works pretty good but
it doesn't even require em you can
basically any phone with Play Store it's
going to get this and that's basically
how Google works now they can't cordon
off all their best new features for
something like Android n there's just
too few people who have phones that run
the newest version of Android so they
just make it available to everybody and
everybody gets to have fun with the new
features and the few people get to have
improved notifications and multitask
could you text me
whatever yeah I love the verge I love my
boss and all my coworkers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
