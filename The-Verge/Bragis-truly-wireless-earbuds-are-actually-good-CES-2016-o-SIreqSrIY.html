and I'm here at the Venetian in Las
Vegas here at CES 2016 to speak to
nikolai vide the CEO of bracket company
that makes that wireless year but that
everybody seems to want called the dash
so the most basic description of these
is they are bluetooth wireless earbuds
now the important distinction here is
that's not bluetooth between the earbuds
the chose bluetooth connect to your
phone Bragi - used to use bluetooth
between the earbuds but that was part of
the reason the production was delayed
last year the company decided to ditch
bluetooth between the earbuds and go
with something different called
near-field magnetic induction what it
does is it's better for communicating
between the two earbuds without losing
signal quality but forget about all that
let's talk about the experience of using
them a lot was promised when we first
met up with Bragi last year at CES and
we've had a lot of ideas about what it's
like and you'd think that with troubles
and production and all these delays that
it would be hard to realize some of
those promises but it's actually that
much fun to use not only do they sound
great but the accelerometers the
JavaScript inside lend themselves really
nicely to some motion gestures that
aren't really crazy once you have these
in your ear using this pretty simple
they have touch sensitive sections on
each ear bug one is more for like your
music and volume controls and things
like that the other is more for
activities there's a personal assistant
inside that helps guide you through sort
of the menus that kind of exists within
the software here but a lot of that
sounds really complicated and it's
really not as complicated as you think
but probably the most impressive thing
is what they call the audio pass-through
with just a swipe on the Left earbud you
can actually bring up the room mix and
it's not only now in your audio mix that
you it is directional the microphones on
here can pick up what you're hearing in
the room and give you a sense of space
on there you go wow that's that's
extremely strange
it's pretty cool isn't it yeah it's very
cool it's just an experience that you
really have a hard time finding and are
probably hard-pressed to find at all in
any other earbud whether is wire or not
that's some of that stuff that's inside
here like the audio pass-through and the
directional microphones are really what
Bragi is trying to say is going to be
used and much bigger in broader ways as
they go forward with the - and maybe
other products there's more built into
these that really change the experience
of like how you listen to music how you
use headphones and how you use wireless
earbuds somethingö and the best thing
about it when you're done with them you
throw them back in a charging case
you've got five more charges in here and
keep this with you at all times you're
not going to lose it you're not going to
lose the charge of these and it's that
simple
that's the braggy - we're going to see
more from these guys and we're
definitely going to see more about this
particular product when the rest of
these ship this year and when we get our
hands on them back in New York for more
from Las Vegas here at CES 2016 head to
the verge comm and head to youtube.com
