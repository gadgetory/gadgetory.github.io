welcome to the verge
so we've been having technical
difficulties but we're on we're live
it's very exciting it is the week of May
twentieth 2013 we've been gone for a
couple of weeks but we're here or some
of us are here and others are here as
well let's go through who those people
are I am dieter bohn i'm chris sigler
and i'm sean hollister welcome to the
Virgin Mobile show sean hollister is
this your first time on the original
show this is my first time on the Virgin
Mobile show well also my second time
using a google hangout well we're
excited to have you here we so Dan is
traveling back from the beautiful and
glorious city known as Las Vegas where
he attended ctia Chris Ziegler is still
there and because we are a day late and
a little bit later than we usually start
Vlad savov is sleeping hopefully so this
is our lineup for today and you should
be grateful or not but you really should
be because not only do you have these
handsome men in front of you you have
just a ridiculous amount of news it's
been a crazy couple of weeks that's
actually part of the reason we didn't
have a mobile store last week is I was
busy at ctia or no I was busy at Google
i/o um and did that had not come through
the microphone I didn't hear a head
knock no no we also have bandwidth
issues today accra Ziegler his frame has
frozen and he out there he just woke up
now your frame froze with your eyes like
half blinked and so think you are like
just like on drugs and zoning out and
then it popped into life with your head
shaking up like oh I'm here I'm here
let's imagine no gone again no so well
Google Hangouts has a bug where it just
doesn't start and it also has a more
exciting bug where it can't handle low
bandwidth and so then if you turn it on
to low bandwidth settings which chris
sigler is going to do right now your
video goes like plaid it goes into this
insane mode where it only shows the
outlines of you and it looks like a
ridiculous like
k'nex demo yeah so we're tired we're
cranky we're going to talk about two
weeks worth of news it's going to be
amazing there's there's Chris looking
like evil ghost I don't even know if I
can handle this Chris maybe we should
just we should just all oh ok that's all
how's this how's this yeah they're fine
that's great love it that's we you need
to get a profile picture for yourself so
we're not just looking at a generic head
when you're speaking no that's me it's
actually me that's what you look like
you're just yeah blue I see no facial
hair on that head though a good point ok
so we've got a ridiculous amount of news
we're not going to get to all of it
we're probably going to end up punting
some of it to next week but there's some
stuff we absolutely need to talk about
and I think the first thing to do is to
talk about the stuff that wasn't news
that was handed to us at the giant
events or a trade show but rather the
news that was solely the result of chris
sigler literally pounding the pavement
his fists are bloody and he has an
amazing story about what's going on at
HTC so give us the the breakdown of
what's going on here uh well the bottom
line is that HTC well for a few quarters
now they've they've had a lot of revenue
issue for that who is just dominating
Android right now and HTC really does
have anywhere else to turn the windows
phone still isn't penetrating the way
they needed to penetrate but so this the
story that we got kind of has two main
parts the first is this ongoing
narrative of people leaving the company
most notably a coogi Coderre who was
their chief product officer so he kind
of like was in charge of this entire
product portfolio including the one and
he left last week we found out and then
we also heard this kind of soap opera
ish tale of the first and
but it it sounds like what happened was
uh HTC an eighteen t had originally had
to understanding that Facebook home
which is Facebook's home screen
replacement there they're uh they're
downloadable home screen launcher for
android devices that they believe that
home was going to be launched in the
google play store on a significant delay
from the launch of the of the first so
in other words if you wanted the face
become experienced the first would have
been the only place to get it and that's
that's what HTC in it that that was the
belief that HTC and ATT were operating
against and then at some point very
close to the launch of this device
facebook said oh actually we're just
going to go go ahead and launch facebook
home immediately uh which kind of you
know I stole the the rug out from under
the first and took away its entire value
proposition and of course we've heard a
lot of rumors in past couple weeks of
the first being just a complete flop
practice dropped from $99 1099 signs
within a couple weeks of launch and and
at least one of our sources said that
the the phone has been nothing short of
a disaster so that's not a good look for
the company so yeah they've had better
days yeah so the the I mean we've got
the this chief product officer leaving
we've got Jason Gordon leaving I forget
his title Eric land we've said a bunch
of people leave the company uh within
the PS like like you I think he said
like three odd months and that's that's
about right and there was just like
there's just a bunch of people just gone
and a lot of them from HTC America and
you know I don't know if we can blame it
on the one but I think we can blame it
on I don't know maybe the grind leading
up to the one maybe some mismanagement
they're one of the most interesting
thing to me was that there were some
complaints about CEO Peter Chou about
how he you know heard that there might
be some manufacturing problems and he
basically said damn the torpedoes full
speed ahead of releasing this thing and
you did actually have problems with
manufacturing and getting getting enough
of them made for the initial launch
period
you know that short window they had
before the the galaxy s4 got released um
I'm as curious though I mean we like the
first we like the one we think they're
great phones right the best part yeah
absolutely ziff supply is their worst
issue I mean that doesn't seem like a
reason to lose all well then supply
isn't their worst issue though I mean
you know that marketing is obviously
still a huge problem for them fighting
Samsung in every way that Samsung
competes an Android is you know a
herculean if not entirely impossible
task for anyone else just because of
Samsung's raw manufacturing capability
the fact that they can you know in how
source practically every component goes
into the phone something the HTC can't
do so one of my sources III didn't use
this quote in the piece but he pointed
out he said something to the effect of
you know by the time the one rolls off
the assembly line HTC is already lost
because uh you know that they're there
bill materials is so much higher than
Samsung's or you know that their costs
are so much higher than Samsung's
because they're not able to insource
this stuff that makes it a lot more
difficult before they even put a phone
on a shelf I mean HTC needs to they need
to make a better phone and they mostly
succeeded at that at least in terms of
like overall impressions they need to
have a better marketing campaign with
more impact they need to have better
relationships with carriers so that
they're the carriers are willing to
throw support behind the phone and they
need to like make a profit and on every
single one of those fronts like they are
behind the eight ball and Samsung has
huge advantages and you know HTC is
doing its best in the areas that it
actually can control but it just might
be too much for them how terrible is it
to be in HTC's position behind Samsung
aren't they still one of the major
players on the Android side well yes
they are but like how much does that get
you these days i think i saw you know
some report yesterday or today that it
was you just look at the profits in
android samsung gets like ninety-five
percent I can't source it I maybe I'm
making this number maybe I dreamt it
I often dream about analytic reports the
smartphone market I actually believed
you which is scary ya know it's true I
do um so and the the the stuff about the
Facebook like deciding at the last
minute they're gonna release it on
google play and like sorry HTC like
that's crazy and it sucks for HTC but if
I mean if I'm in Facebook's shoes I
don't know if I do the exact same thing
I don't know if I'm more upfront about
wanting to release it sooner or what but
it makes sense for them right I mean
they see what Facebook's ability is to
market a phone they see the phone that
got produced and you know like what does
facebook Oh HTC what you know it's not
like Facebook is worried about that
relationship right right yes go ahead I
think that it's easier the only thing
that I can see is an advantage for
facebook to having cat the first as an
exclusive for a period of time is that
it's much easier from a consumers
perspective to understand marketing
around a product like a physical product
and so they can put out these ads for
the first which 18t had very briefly
there now got all gone as far as I know
on TV and and they you know they could
have built this brand awareness around
the first and about the concept of a
facebook phone and then a few weeks or
months later they can say oh by the way
you can now get this experience on your
phone right yeah from like a carrier
perspective from an HTC perspective what
if I keep thinking what if Facebook
marketed this as the facebook phone
because you know they could have
definitely put all this you know all
this folks around the device said this
is you know this is our halo experience
for getting facebook on your phone so I
think HTC device I think the reason that
they did they didn't do that and the
reason that they like decided to screw
HTC at the last minute is because it's
not you know it's it's it has a pretty
bad camera and it's you know not the
fastest thing the thing that we like the
best about the first was that it had
stock Android which is it you know what
facebook wants if you think about when
we think about the first right and if
the first flopped which apparently it is
and it was like the only way to get
facebook home that look
really bad for facebook I think they
would rather have the problem of trying
to market software that is and it's
difficult to market then they would have
the problem of the facebook phone as a
failure right yeah now the story right
now is the HTC first as a failure
because in part of Facebook right
instead of Facebook being a failure
because of the HTC first right I have to
say thank you just thinking about the
one versus the galaxy s4 people you know
people they do not know what the one is
unless they are like us and they're
reading all these sites and because of
the marketing sand the tremendous
marketing spend samsung has I hear this
all the time but also when you pick up
the galaxy s4 it's just so much lighter
even though it's this big phone it
doesn't feel his be the way the one is
it lighter here's is are they about the
same I don't know you'll sign ahead I
don't know leadership but it feels like
it feels a lot lighter and you know I
brought my wife fob into a best buy the
other day because we decided for some
reason we were going to go his invest my
I don't remember why and she picked up
the two of them and she said oh the one
this this this looks this is pretty and
then she picked up the galaxy s4 and she
said I kind of want this and she's a
knife allow nice is really gonna like
this and and she could not for the life
of her tell me why that's the same
that's that's the opposite of what we
usually hear I mean I'm so here's the
thing though I I would been using the
one I've got the unlock 32 made you know
the five hundred and seventy-five bucks
or whatever it was to get it and I'm
pretty sure that I'm gonna sell it I'm
pretty sure to put it on ebay i can make
like a twitter dollar profit on it right
now because HTC can't sell them they
don't have them in stock and I like the
battery life for me is fine on an
average day but on a serious I need to
get done day it does not doesn't
last also I just swore that happened and
you plug it on ebay auction but we'll
ignore all sorts of terrible things just
happened we're gonna have to throw this
podcast on start over no uh-uh yeah well
I mean that's true of literally any
phone on the market right now save ammo
rolla max series divided writing I mean
even a gs4 with the 2600 milliamp hour
battery ends up dying I think owing in
no small part to the fact that as a
1080p Emma let's play right so you know
what can you do it you know like Samsung
like it's it's the same thing that
happened to me at CES like yeah the
hardware feels slimy it feels
straight-up terrible but i can replace
the battery and i would rather have an
extra like quarter ounce or half ounce
or even ounce weight so that i could
have a better feeling back and to
replace the battery but like they made
that trade off and like it's like I
don't know as I tried to hate it but I
can't hate it it's like I want to not
use the gs4 but that keeps on calling me
back in this decision have anything to
do with the fact that google just
announced that galaxy s4 with stock
android ya know that's exactly in fact
let's let's just jump right into io like
that segue we've talked about you guys
talk about IO quite a bit there was we
had a live show Christie were on so we
don't need to go over everything but
there's there's definitely some mobile
stuff I want to tuck into here and the
first is the stock android galaxy s4 and
i'm like it's it's enough to get me to
switch from the one you know if it
worked stock i'd probably would keep the
one and deal with it i bought a mophie
battery for the one and everything but
because it's straight plane bone stock
bihn stock I I think I'm gonna do it
yeah I think we all are and yet it's
funny to me to think about the fact that
we are all more than happy and willing
to put up with the second best hardware
in exchange for the software experience
we want like to me that that's sort of a
very final statement that we prioritize
software / hardware right I don't know
if we wanted was I think tangent about
QWERTY keyboards but I prioritize the
hardware every time so if you guys
aren't where sean hollister is the last
man alive who demands a physical QWERTY
keyboard on his android phone he demands
android so blackberry won't do it and he
demands a landscape physical QWERTY
keyboard
uh and to his you know it is defense I
have seen this man literally blindfold
like literally somebody put a blindfold
on him and he was able to take notes on
this keyboard more quickly than I could
with a pen and paper it he was basically
transcribing in real time with two
thumbs well in practice what this means
is that he's going to be using a droid
for for the next ten years you're never
getting into their phone my battery life
is uh III try to take a morning walk now
try to get a little exercise you know
mile or two takes me a little while to
do this and by the time I get back
checking my email one walking around the
block I'll see my battery go from a
hundred percent of sixty percent or
something like that six things for you
you go through forty percent of your
battery and one walk yeah yeah ok so
this all depends on like like signal and
how heavily use it like so this morning
waiting at the airport for an hour I
killed probably thirty percent of an
iphone 5 battery just because it was the
airport LTE like it's hot three four
bars Ville t walking down the street
verizon LTE in a pretty good
neighborhood for that I mean I shyness
Sean if there was such a thing as a
droid for max would you buy it whoa yes
it could be an inch thick I'd buy it
haha I tend to agree I mean I when the
iphone 5 was first announced I would
Apple you guys are a bunch of idiots but
you should have made like nobody was
complaining about the thickness of the
4s to keep the thickness of the phone
the same and use that extra space that
you've been able to to get out of it as
as extra battery capacity and then you
know hang on like thickness matters you
have a different experience of the
thickness of a phone depending on the
screen size yo an iphone 4s is not as
tall as an iphone 5 it's got a smaller
screen and I bet you that if they had
kept the thickness we'd all be calling
it like thick and heavy right I mean
that's that was that's that's our
experience of the Lumia 920 right like
it's not that thick
it's not that heavy but because it's at
got that larger screen size you put all
those things together and you're kind of
like her no but the 920 is thick right
isn't it well millimeters or something
it's insane I don't know I've got it
around here somewhere I can grab it um
yeah I mean you're right I think I mean
said you know sadly I think that what
this might mean is that Motorola had the
right strategy all along which is you
know just bite the bullet and make two
versions the phone to keep everybody
happy I would certainly take the thicker
phone I'd love to know Motorola's sales
breakdown between the the thinner and
the thicker models I'd love to know why
they didn't just spent the difference I
mean I know why his right hasn't asked
them to because they still a more like
that's why right and they can charge a
hundred dollars more for the max which
is completely insane I think that was
the highest price we've seen for a
smartphone on contract at the time jus
99 right yeah yeah I don't think we'd
ever seen higher than that I think the
the epic 4g came out at 250 and said
that as a ballad Christ here well
another day you know 64 gig iphone yeah
okay but what I mean well the talking
about like real talk here real talk here
I definitely paid four hundred dollars
on contract for a treo 650 like that I'm
sure what about a treo pro i also bought
a treo pro that i bought unlocked and
that was a pretty good phone I'm I kind
of Miss true so we thought you might
otherwise yes I'm all were talking about
price 649 for this stock android galaxy
s4 do they do they price these things
you know and not get carrier deals for
these things with these beautiful stock
android phones that are unlocked because
they want to be able to say we told you
nobody buys these we told you so and
nobody wants this that we want they want
their TouchWiz they want their you know
I mean they they they didn't want to
deal with making carrier deals because
they obviously uh Google obviously hates
verizon and AT&amp;amp;T they they get in fights
all the time or something I don't know
they didn't wanna make carrier deals and
you know unlike the the actual Nexus
phone Google doesn't didn't want to like
try and use this phone to
span Google's ecosystem they weren't
subsidizing it so the question is why is
it google treating the s for stock what
we call it but does it have a name not
yet no no god damn it at all we just did
like what are we gonna call it we call
it the bone stock s for the boa gen
stock yeah yeah for sure I'm claiming it
as my own and and this is this is why
I'm claiming it as my own because I
think one of the reasons they're even
bothering doing this is the phones moved
ahead more quickly and like they need
something with like more recent specs
sure but the nexus 4 doesn't have LTE
and I think that Google seriously
underestimated just how much flack they
would catch for that well deserved flak
and they're like what we need a stock
android phone with LTE and we look
stupid without one so let's do this one
and so it's they're they're happy not
subsidizing it because they don't want
to give like you if your google do you
really want to be giving samsung like
just money right now do you want to be
handing money or to Samsung to subsidize
a one of their phones I don't guess that
what they're doing with LJ and the Nexus
Wally on the hand they have three they
have to be I mean they know when X is 4
4 2 49 or whatever it is yeah but yeah I
mean I think it's it was kind of a
no-brainer for Google because um you
know they didn't need to put the time
and money and effort and investment into
crafting a new Nexus device yeah and
especially at lekki sand that you know
the turnaround from the next the nexus 4
is not that old of a phone so they saw
an opportunity with GS 4 and then and
they knew so first of all that the gs4
is not carrying exclusive in the US
which probably made the contractual
elements of this a lot easier to deal
with and then so you know so all they
need to do is go two cents on and say
hey just drop stock Android and this man
you know it's it's no sweat off your
back will sell it ourselves and Samsung
will make anything for anybody at any
time you were your I could go to Samsung
and say hey I want to I want to pink GS
for running iOS and they'd be like okay
well you know we can tell you those for
twelve hundred dollars apiece they would
be
totally okay with that so so you know it
was very easy for Google make this
happen I could be wrong about this but I
also think that it is easier for samsung
to just say yeah sure we'll just make a
version of it with stock than it is for
say HTC because of the way that HTC does
their drivers and kernels and all that
other stuff was sense at least looking
at it like from the outside of like
trying to like get cyanogenmod support
for the you know these these phones
samsung vs HTC i mean obviously they've
got a like numbers behind Samsung so
that makes more sense to tax time so I'm
and support that sooner but I also feel
like it's just plain easier because
there's less complication between
TouchWiz and Android than there is
between HTC and the drivers and stuff
for android I could be wrong but I have
a suspicion what about LG though why
aren't they just you know building an LG
Nexus more with LT elderly exactly why
I'll tell you exactly why because they
had a dinner miss GN AT&amp;amp;T and it sucked
well also that let's not forget that the
nexus 4 has LTE but what did ya what
they what happened was Google had a
terrible two things first of all Google
had a terrible experience with LG in the
nexus 4 they left a bad taste in their
mouth and I'm sure that they were eager
to move on from that relationship and
then the second of all google has a long
reputation of rotating between OEMs for
its for its you know it's quote unquote
Nexus devices they they spread the love
between at this point between HTC
Motorola LG Samsung uh and am I
forgetting anybody quite a few different
company so um no it's HTC Samsung and LG
that's it yeah we need let's get a ZTE
google phone motorola oh come on I mean
the droid yeah and the zoom zoom Oh God
we're working in urban soon okay that's
fine um well I mean we'll see what
happens with the you know this this
rumored phone that got approved by the
FCC I
question is is it the X phone or not and
I don't think it is but that'll be close
to stock but probably not exact stock
and here's the other thing even if it is
the X phone is the X from the phone that
we think it is well I think so because
dan I wished and was on this this show
right now because he was telling me
yesterday hey I think he's a little more
up to speed on this situation than i am
but he was telling me that there are
rumors of two new motorola devices and
that my phone may not be the nexus right
that's correct yeah there's those rumors
of to a mid-range and then the X phone
that does magical things and Eric
Schmidt thinks it's amazing and so look
but then there's also rumors about
customizability and it's not sure which
applies to which and then in terms of
hardware customizability and software
customizability and so it's not really
clear what applies to what but yeah I'm
expecting two phones out of Motorola
this year I'm hoping but I mean so
motorola wasn't at i/o i'm going to
bring it back to I oh uh and neither was
Android 4.3 they I mean there was who
wrote it ah somebody wasn't a somebody
wrote a pretty decent story that like
Google at i/o wanted to prove that they
could update Android without actually
updating Android it's really smart
because like usually every year what
happens is they give you an update to
Android and then we all go oh these are
really cool features too bad nobody gets
to use them ever and this year they
added a whole bunch of stuff especially
for developers and then it just applies
to four point oh and up yeah but
nevertheless like the way they push down
there to hangouts you know the way they
pushed out hangouts it's here you know
you've already got this app installed on
your phone talk let's just let's upgrade
that before we get into the you've
already got hangouts installed which is
a mess um yeah what do you guys think
about the lack of 4.3 I mean there were
there have been rumors it was a
last-minute cut had there not yeah i'm
yeah exactly i'm gonna be a little more
pregnant I mean I get that that that
idea that they wanted to prove that they
could update Android without updating
Android elyria it's very nice spin yeah
yeah I I'm gonna be a little more
pragmatic and say that 4.3 just wasn't
ready
or even 5.1 you know I think that there
is is some understanding that there will
be another update to the four point X
line of Android and then of course
they're also working on the true next
generation and it remains to be seen how
those two kind of like dovetail with one
another and I just think that they they
weren't ready ya know I did more I 4.3
if I had any idea what it would do for
me Tokyo blue too shall we yeah energy
that's all we know and they basically
announced it okay it's coming to the
next SDK and it'll be on the next
version of android but there were like I
went to this there was a meet-up of with
a pebble and it was for all the backers
was right after i also like there were
just a ton of people with pebble in the
room and like a pebble is like yeah you
know will support Bluetooth le when they
get their act together I mean it wasn't
actually pebble saying that but
everybody in the room knew that android
support for Bluetooth Bluetooth has been
a mess and even at i/o there was
sessions were like they basically are
like yeah we've kind of screwed around
with bluetooths a long time but I think
we finally got it so it's good that
that's finally getting supported but oh
actually as long as we're talking about
pebble uh there is going to be an update
coming that is soon for scrollable
notification so instead of getting one
in a disappearing if you don't look at
it you'll be able to page through
notifications will you be able to see
whether on your on your face yeah we
feel to see what now whether on the
watch face yet um so actually I was
talking to one of our video producers
John lagomarsino he is deep into the
pebble scene he does like he uses Tasker
to have his phone be automatically
unlocked when it's paired and in range
to his pebble and then when it gets out
of range then the passcode comes on so
if you're ever in the same room with him
you can totally like use his phone and
he won't know just you just have to get
it out of his pocket anyway he says that
there's some pebble hacking community
somewhere that has managed to do like
HTTP pass through so that you can
communicate directly to the pebble
through the phone by pebble app so you
could have
whether pushed straight to the pebble so
yeah it's possible thing the hackers but
it's not happened yet yeah see this is
all nonsense I mean like I'm so over
nerdy geeky smartwatches is that the day
and time has come for a practical
good-looking smart watch Citizen has
tried and failed with the proximity
which is a terrible device yeah if for
no other reason than the fact that it
doesn't support text messages of all
things you cannot get a notification
root access which it which makes no
sense look no you need to stop blaming
the Watchers like building a building a
SmartWatch as long as you're not stupid
and don't try and build it on top of
Android itself which is what I'm watch
did and they're ridiculous as long as
you like just build a really simple
clean real-time operating system and you
code do it with some objective c or
something like you can do it it's not
that hard what sucks and what's hard is
that the hooks to actually have a
smartphone communicate to it aren't
there I in either iOS or Android in a
very efficient way right and because
there's these rumors at both Apple and
Google are working on smartwatches I
don't see any incentive for them to do
that to build that in so Google I guess
eventually will when they release our
SmartWatch hopefully they'll be open
enough to let other smartwatches
communicate with it but if Apple puts
out a SmartWatch and it only and that's
the only watch that of work with the
iphone that with like full support for
everything you'd wanted to do I would be
kind of mad because like you should have
and you know if you've got a platform
that can talk to other things that you
talk to other things but right now I'm
not like I don't get mad at you know I
don't know fossil and citizen for making
crappy smartwatches because they don't
have a stable like roadmap of the way
it's going to communicate with the
smartphone at all right now and trying
to build itself contained is terrible
horrible idea yeah that's that's very
true in a great example that is the fact
that 4.2 doesn't support ble and it's
very very happy and iOS 6 it feels like
I think we talked about this before but
it it feels like to the developers it
feels like Apple has kind of like dipped
its toes in the waters of this whole
smartphone concept or really the
wearables concept with like ran
look you know kind of spread throughout
I os6 without any rhyme or reason but
none of it is fully fleshed out so they
just you know it's all very happy and
like a good example that is the fact
that in order to get notifications for
anything other than calls and texts in
iOS you need to like go in and like you
have to do some insane thing in settings
that makes sense I think its sixth apps
you need to go into settings you need to
go into the notification for your thing
you need to make sure it's enabled on
lock screen because I don't think it
works otherwise with the screen off
which is useless you need to toggle
notifications off and on and then you
need to toggle the notification type to
nothing back to either on screen or
banner and so it's like one two three
four five taps and then six to get back
out so it's six tabs to make like each
and then you have to do it for every
single app every time the phone happens
to get disconnected from the watch so
that's terrible guess what i do when i
am using an iphone i only get text
message notifications it's because the
rest of it's just not worth my time
right i mean isn't couldn't that be what
Google is doing though building a
platform for smartwatches and they just
happened to be prototyping one so that
they figure out how it works okay I hope
so in fact in fact I'll bet that is what
they're what they're doing I think
they're probably going to show a
referent you know they might have like a
nexus watch but I think that the idea is
going to be very much about like hey
here's this entire framework that we've
built for for making wearables maybe you
won't even be limited to watches they'll
be like you know there's a watch there's
a watch profile for this platform but
this is it really I mean oh we lost you
Chris no no but yeah small little small
device what I want here to have screens
and notifications here's what I want I
want someone to take Google glass yeah
you can grab that platform in well yeah
welcome back man it's good to have you
here oh no how long was I gone a while
your whole rant is just this in the
ether and I said some really awesome
stuff yeah well I'm going to say
something even more awesome here's what
I want Google to do take glass removed
from my head and put it on my wrist and
we're done
no that's not you want yes it is oh I
want so bad i canna want her okay you
think you want it dieter let me ask you
how long have you how much time have you
spent with glass in your head like I've
probably spent about I'm going to call
it 253 seconds the entire time of which
was spent trying to see it while wearing
it above my actual glasses and seeing a
blurry nothingness while wearing it
without my glasses so I'm going to and
and I mean this with all the love in the
world eater but I'm gonna put your level
of expertise on knowing what you want a
visa V glass at a very low baseline okay
how okay fair enough that's fine I'm
just saying like glass is so I see right
now like straight up like everything
about it is not quite right and I don't
blame google for that because they've
been very very forthcoming about the
fact that this is strictly like a proof
of concept developer platform II kind of
thing but like if none of the
interactions right now our dead on and I
think that they have the beginnings of a
very rich and cool wearables platform
but it's not there yet yeah you know
when everybody had glass on like you
walk gonna be like a glass and like yeah
like everybody had him and so is it like
you use it you change life like yeah I
don't know that's cool I guess I mean
Dan Scott do you get a hell of a point
here though I've used glass for a few
hours now everything it does right now
except for taking pictures in recording
video from your perspective everything
else it does could be translated
directly to a watch right now it uses
swype you know left and right up and
down tap gesture that's all you need to
make it work and your voice that in your
voice and it just scrolls through you
know notifications of cards now what we
wanted to do is use that camera give you
this overlay and do some augmented
reality things and they will and maybe
that wouldn't work so well and watch but
what they're building right now could be
able to I don't know man a camera on my
watch like I could that would be so
serious like superhero garbage like I
did be a point like you know in your
wrist at somebody last point your wrist
adam i like-like-like throw it up like
this like like oh oh no no I want Wonder
Woman bracelets that are Google glass
table then I can cling them together and
block bullets and then I hold it up like
this I can videotape people I really
don't like you guys right now this is
your look you're not you are not this is
not what the world needs to make smart
phone or excuse me smart watches a
successful car we are we stall showering
you right now is this a scoble shower
moment it is a finale scoble showering
me that is exactly what what's happening
here in opening want to bham right there
watched no but I do know I dogs out this
um do I need to explain skull showering
no no so during I oh I mean there's a
famous picture of Robert Scoble wearing
glasses in the shower looking crazy
because he's in the shower wearing glass
and Larry Page told him they didn't
really appreciate it and so now it's
become like this touchstone for like
what you don't want for your emerging
technology you want people to think of
it as like cool and not you know insane
and geeky right right and and everything
about that picture of Robert Scoble in
the shower was that same what else okay
so hangouts I cut you off earlier on
this John so hangouts uh you know it's
the unified messaging stuff from google
it replaces Google+ messenger and google
talk and Google Hangouts the video thing
and then there's some drama because it
will eventually integrate google voice
and text messaging but for now it
doesn't in fact if you use google voice
to make calls me desktop you need to not
switch to hang outs because you can't do
that that stinks but assuming they get
to where they're promising they're going
to go uh it's it's pretty good right
like i'm using it to talk to my
girlfriend i'm pretty happy with it
because they do this cool thing where
every pic
sure that you post into hangouts gets
automatically put in a private shared
album on google+ so instead of like
sending Emma messes and they disappear
you can you can just drop them in here
and you know that you'll be able to go
back and find them later which is cool i
think uh i mean yes so i think that that
the new hangouts is certainly a step in
the direction but i feel like it's a
baby step I feel like yeah consider your
serious problems with it yeah it
considering how much has changed and how
much work they obviously put into it I'm
kind of disappointed by the you know the
risk versus reward and and you know
hopefully they'll be able to do the
things that they're saying they're going
to do like like in a great voice which
is very important well they also they
also desperately need to still solve the
problem of people who have more than one
google account in fact David Pierce I
think was on top shelf if you haven't
watched last week's top shelf you really
should he interviewed Bradley Horowitz
who runs google plus uh or he's one of
the guys anyway super important for
Google+ and he basically is like
straight up said yeah we're doing a bad
job at this right now like when you go
to start a hangout with somebody and
they have more than one google account
like you literally can't tell which one
you're talking to so for us at the verge
know we're you know we're using google
stuff i don't want you know we'd like
I'm not it sucks because every time I
want to hang out with somebody I don't
know which account on pinging it's the
worst right and there are many many
things that don't work well with
multiple Google accounts right now and I
almost have this sneaking suspicion that
is on purpose because they want you to
have one persona associated with your
real name on google island but oh my god
we are not okay they're not gonna going
to talk about Google Island I it's been
coming pretty well in the live show but
it is insane google island where Larry
Page I want to live on Google island I
would ruin heartbeat I would move in a
heartbeat Wow okay depends real fast
google fiber ones on google island yeah
it's a good point google fiber on google
what if instead of like an island they
just wall
Kansas City and then we that that was a
pretty sick kansas city burn or maybe i
don't know maybe it was like I actually
have you ever been to Kansas City it's
not about town that got you know good
little downtown area you can hang out
that they apparently have good barbecue
barbecue that's true sounder they not
have fast internet they have fast
internet and so do all their suburbs
apparently now that's all I want just
really really fast internet so the other
drama about hangouts if we don't want to
get into my communist rant about either
how do we do we do eat we have to get
into that do yes let's do it yeah so I'm
really mad about messaging right now and
I have been for literally months and
I've been promising to write this
editorial for literally months and not
done it and so finally with hangouts and
especially with Larry Page talking about
how sad it is that a Microsoft like
interrupt like takes their stuff but
doesn't like interoperate and how kind
of hypocritical that that statement was
I finally like put this rant out there
um we can't make ways to talk to each
other anymore that are open and free for
people to do like we don't have like
with like jabber which you know is like
XMPP which actually came from google
like like since then everything that we
use to talk to each other is owned by a
company right it's we're using facebook
messenger or google hangouts or I
message or you know whatever and there
are so there's like WebRTC is out there
which is direct browser to browser
real-time communication and there's some
cool stuff happening there and I think
Google's using some of the technology a
little bit but it's still like within
the hangouts framework so like there's a
chance we could build something but in
reality like you know we're living in a
world where you basically what was the
headline you either have to be
fragmented were like you're using 15
different messaging apps and depending
on who you're talking to use a different
one that's the world I live in if I want
to send yeah I want to say a message to
the verge like we use one app to four
different people if I want to send a
message
to family i use facebook i'm using
hangouts for some things or snapchat
sometimes if you want to send i don't
know like different countries Ellis were
a really great report that like laid out
how different messaging apps are popular
different countries so it's a huge mess
and we're waiting you know if you're
hoping that somebody is just going to
win and dominate I don't think that's
likely number one and number two even if
you get your wish that which sucks
because then a single company controls
your text communications all of our text
communications I would much rather have
a world like SMS but not insanely
expensive right or like jabber where I
am clients can talk to each other or you
know back when AOL had to like start
working with msn messenger right but
that world seems unlikely so it's either
fragmented or it's expensive like SMS or
it's locked into a single company and it
sucks and I don't know how to fix it
other than to like demand everybody use
IRC to talk to me I'm only talking with
people on IRC you know I I think back to
the days when you couldn't SMS between
carriers which is insane to think about
now but it was a thing at one time and
what ultimately ended up happening is
they they conjure the carrier is
contracted with companies whose whose
job was to federate the SMS
infrastructure and interchange text
between carriers and understand which
which SMS needs to go to what carrier i
mean i would i would be happy it to live
in like the fourth option between
fragment that expensive and locked in is
like talking to each other so if i can
find a way for facebook and BBM and
hangouts whatsapp to all get in a room
and be like all right if i want to send
a message from facebook to whatsapp this
is how it's going to happen and like
we're going to agree to do that again
they just have to compete on like
features and like you get more features
if you happen to be in network but they
can at least talk to each other which is
kind of how hangouts works with the old
google talk right now right you know you
don't get to send stuff but you get to
the least have text work right that's a
nice great yes go ahead
likely do you think that is honestly
there it's not likely at all it's not
going to happen but but you know what
bothers me about that is that I think
the reason it's not going to happen is
because all these guys consider their
fiefdom to be a competitive advantage a
company like Facebook is like well we
have a billion subscribers we don't need
to worry about this but the reality is
that a interoperability is a talking
point not a disadvantage and all these
companies still have plenty of other
ways they can compete unlike you know
the features and and the UI of their
client and they can offer some sort of
like rich or media when they're
communicating internally with other
users of the same right form so I mean I
want to believe that's right but sorry
Sean go ahead okay I also think
interoperability means that when there
is a new hot new thing out there the
latest and greatest you know chat
messaging program or whatever everybody
doesn't immediately switch there because
it's still at are operable what you have
right now is good enough I see I've got
lots of people I know who are still
using AOL mail or yahoo mail or
something like that rather than you know
Gmail or or whatever you know we're
using now because it still works it's
still it's good enough to communicate
with those new things they don't need to
switch I might try it but they don't
have to so I would like to believe that
the reason that like they're they want
to like they think their fiefdom czar
value-added and important but I think
the real reason that we're not going to
see these these companies interoperate
with each other and we're not going to
see bbm and I message talk to each other
anytime soon is all of these companies
smell the possibilities still out there
that they could win everything I think
it's just like mobile payments there's a
chance that you could win everything so
why would you give up that having a
small chance of like grabbing the whole
enchilada and holding that drippy messy
greasy enchilada in your little hand and
yes I own the central lot like that they
want it so bad they love them some
enchiladas right and someone who didn't
have lunch
that just sounds amazing I really want
an enchilada yeah and like what where's
the upside for them not trying not
waiting to see if they're gonna get the
whole enchilada like like there's no
upside to like saying you know what
we're going to spend a few million
dollars and we're going to work with
each other now like for now there's no
reason for them because there's no
pressure from them from the consumer
market or if there is a very strong and
there's certainly no pressure from you
know the government right so yeah like
happy texting that's how I closed the
piece and that's how I feel like it
sucks and it's going to suck for a long
time and her a technology what a world
we've made for ourselves goodbye so
here's my question for you guys why do
you suppose it is that that CC and the
FTC don't feel the same way about a
textual messaging that they do about
telephone service can you imagine if
there were six different companies that
all had non interoperable of voice
networks I can't imagine well I mean
hang on a mood like Skype and Google
Hangouts and gotomeeting and we have
something something something nice pots
I should write yeah so but but that's a
good point so the thing about pots is
pots exists because we had relative we
had all these different networks that
they used the same standards that were
that many stairs well they didn't really
talk to each other till they were forced
to and then they weren't really forced
to they lived AT&amp;amp;T one right ma Bell
took over and so we we had a regulated
you know monopoly and then it got broken
up but they when they got broken up they
were required to still talk to each
other so like our system of multiple
companies using the same standard to
inner communicate with each other took
150 years right um so I have no idea you
know how we're gonna be communicating
telepathically in a hundred fifty years
right so I don't see I don't foresee
anybody having the the will to like drop
in regulation on an open free market
right now because that you know that'll
drive people crazy and like there's like
serious concerns about that kind of
heavy regulation but i also don't see
the markets fixing it what happened with
AOL Instant Messenger
AOL wanted to merge / get bought by Time
Warner and the Department of Justice
said yeah if you're going to do that
we're really worried that you're going
to have monopoly over instant messenger
so you need to interoperate and AOL did
it and then they complained about it a
couple years later and then instant
messenger kind of just became
commoditized right and it turned out to
not be a big source of revenue so it's
not a huge deal and there's like it
that's what happened with the semester
like it didn't like eight weekly result
by regulation as a result of some kind
but I mean here there's just too many
this time it's not that we have one it's
a way of too many um there's you're not
going to find a solution man I know
you're like they can all we could we can
solve this right now in the mobile show
it'll be great yeah no it's not going to
happen we're screwed your Excuse I know
I'm a lot of energy now what else do we
need to talk about from I oh oh do we do
we want to talk about the AT&amp;amp;T hangouts
thing yes yes Chris go I've ranted it's
your turn uh okay so shot doesn't care
cuz he's on verizon so he lives in a
beautiful perfect world he does limited
for us new data so do rising world um oh
yes did you know that Sean stole an
unlimited plan on verizon which is
insane like this point at this point
anyone who is on a grandfathered data
plan of any sort is like this this
mythical beasts yeah you're like a lord
of the earth if you're like a you're a
demigod you're Hercules is what I'm
saying it would close with my phone but
it's across the room okay it's our
Christmas 18t yeah so you know what one
of the the hot new features of the
updated hangouts app which replaces
google talk on your phone on your
android phone is a video calling of
rowers and it's supposed to work both
over Wi-Fi and cellular but if you know
if you're using an ATT sim if you're
using an AT&amp;amp;T sim than the than the app
if you try to make a call over some a
video call over cellular it says you
need to be on a Wi-Fi network you do it
on a verizon phone this doesn't happen
and you could be on a nexus 4 which
doesn't have one iota of ATT branding
never sold by AT&amp;amp;T never advertised by
18 teen never sold in ATT store you
still get that message right and so ATT
initially said something to the
effective and I'm paraphrasing here but
they said something to the effect of uh
you know pre-installed video calling
apps like dash instead of paraphrasing
let's just I'm just going to read their
statement and um find it here um you
know you want me to read their statement
oh yes Sean course not not the new
statement the original statement these
and you want google hangout video chats
don't work on 18t cellular connections
on Android but why that's tape oh yes
all AT&amp;amp;T Mobility customers could use
any video chat app over cellular that is
not pre-loaded on their device but which
they download from the internet pause
wait wait hang on back but once they
download me like that distinctions is ok
I'm sorry continue just because there's
so much austerity it'll be great for
video chat apps that come pre-loaded on
devices we offer all OS and device
makers the ability for those apps to
work over cellular for our customers who
are on mobile share tiered and soon
unlimited plan customers who have LTE
devices so so here's why here's why that
distinction is so important to ATM t
between pre-loaded and and downloaded
download no easy internet guys not just
downloaded over the internet over the
int that you enter tubes wow the the
reason this distinction is so important
is because the one aspect of the FCC's
net neutrality regulations that apply to
while that applies to wireless networks
is a is a rule that states that any app
that a user downloads uh that replaces
or obviates functionality offered by the
carrier cannot be blocked by by the
carrier so in other words uh if you know
say ATT offers a video calling service
they can't say well to customers
can't download your own video calling
service that's not allowed right um and
so 80 is making the very tenuous claim
that hangouts which you download via
Google Play is a pre-installed app on
Android by virtue of the fact that it
replaces the Google to the built in
google talk app which I submit would not
stand a chance of holding up if it came
to an FCC hearing when civilians also
like like grabbing on to what to me
sounds like an actual accidental
distinction about like apps that you
download over the Internet and
forgetting the FCC basically didn't
didn't account for the use case of
taking an unlocked phone that had
pre-loaded software on it onto a network
it's such a garbage distinction right
right it's right ridiculous yeah but but
so there there are many that that's
discretion the service the service
issues here because the next problem is
that it is completely unclear and still
to this very minute completely unclear
who is blocking this disservice on ATT
cellular and how resin is it google
who's playing ball with 18 teen saying
okay well we'll just we'll add some code
or apt its and not while users to do
that or is eighty somehow doing
something you know are they doing some
deep packet detection where they're
saying oh this is coming from google
hangouts we're shutting it down is it a
combination we don't know nobody's
saying i actually don't need to do deep
packet detection so I we there was a
story in the past two weeks about a new
MVNO but they don't want to be called an
MVNO it scalds act and they sell these
cheap Android LG phones and the idea is
that you can have like incredible
parental controls and then you can like
adjust your data and buy facebook only
plans and whatever you can adjust data
minute by minute right on the phone it's
kind of cool but it's you know it's on
sprint so I don't know how far it's
going to go but they can you can like
set up parental controls to block the
use of certain apps on your kids phone
and the way they do that is they just
like they know what all the apps are in
Google Play they know what the apps are
then they just like hash it and if that
app is being run at the moment they can
and like a lot our just allow data so
yeah possibly 18t we be able to run that
software I don't know Carrier IQ we've
seen that the carriers can see which you
know exactly which apps are using
they'll know which of them have been
preloaded or not don't know this is
appointed all that fun stuff the weird
thing is that it it's like pop it's not
just failing out it's popping up an
error message so Google had to write
that error message right right
presumably yeah and and also let's let's
not forget that this is happening on a
nexus 4 not on a mighty NT device right
which is really kind of weird and scary
and frightening but so a CT ended up
capitulating is some extent just like
they did with the facetime situation
last year and I've been saying that all
video apps video chat apps will be
enabled by year's end is that right I
think that's what they said they said do
you wanna read the second save and Sean
I the second statement is actually gonna
make to me as well like I don't believe
I don't I believe there's still wiggle
room for them to be horrible people in
the second statement but go ahead yeah I
almost don't know if this this will help
anybody listening but for video chat
apps that come pre-loaded on devices we
currently give all OS and device makers
the ability for those apps to work over
cellular healer that I don't for our
customers who are on mobile share tiered
plans Apple Samsung and blackberry have
chosen to enable this for their
preloaded video chat apps and by
mid-june will have enabled those apps
over cellular for our unlimited plan
customers who have LTE devices from
those three manufacturers okay pause
right there so this doesn't solve the
hangouts problem yet this paragraph
because they're saying we give these
device makers the ability for those apps
but you need to work with ATT in order
to do it basically and then the distinct
that they're making is that it currently
doesn't work on unlimited but they're
going to solve that by mid-june so right
basically what they're saying is like
the distinction between eighteen t plans
of what you can and can't do with those
preloaded apps is going to go away and
that's great and what they should have
done from Jump Street but it's still
like there's still like this weird super
insanely subtle dig at Google for not
playing ball with AT&amp;amp;T continue
throughout the second half of this year
we plan to enable pre-loaded video chat
apps over cellular for all of our
customers regardless of data plan or
device that work is expected to be
complete by year-end today all of our
customers can use any mobile video chat
that they download from the internet
such as Skype and you download a
hangouts from the internet there dot I
don't uh yeah so we plan to enable
pre-loaded video chat apps over cellular
for all our customers regardless of data
plan or device so that is the the
sentence that makes it sound like
they're probably going to turn on
hangouts over 3g or edge or LTE or
whatever that work is expected to be
complete by year's end come on come on
come on just come down yet everything
about this is just complete BS because
neither AT&amp;amp;T nor Google have made any
effort to cut the doublespeak and just
be straight about what's going on Oh
have we heard a statement from google
yeah no no but that you know there's
certainly no Diane yeah yeah we've been
trying we started trying day one uh
right right and and you know let's let's
not let's not forget that this is
happening on on the Nexus 4 is it so is
happening on a Google Nexus device with
a google app so you know i mean that
their silence speaks volumes and and
somebody needs to come out and and
explain i think that somebody owes us an
explanation on how and why this is
happening and frankly the FCC i don't
think that that mignon Clyburn is going
to make any effort as in a role as
interim chairwoman of FCC to investigate
this but somebody in the government
needs to say what the heck is going on
here because the FCC oh no we heard I
sources have sources have told us that
the FCC did in fact basically go to AT&amp;amp;T
in the facetime situation and say you
guys need to work this out which it
which is why AT&amp;amp;T came back and said ok
we're opening it up
somebody needs to do that again you know
I don't know if we need to get a public
interest group involved they probably
already are I mean in we're going to
rename this from the virtual show to the
verge FCC do your job show I like it but
are you on like a digital trampoline
right now Chris off somebody needs to
put pressure on FCC to put pressure on
the n AT&amp;amp;T rented to be really straight
about was going on here yeah um yes yes
yes think there was a segue in the same
i I don't I think he was saying yes to
saturday i need i need some wow um Chris
if we can keep you here we're going to
talk about CJ but if we can't we might
need to move on we were planning to keep
this a secret from you all the way chris
has evolved into a completely digital p
yeah he's not using the matrix uh oh
wait Chris we got you okay good this is
some good radio right here um google
play music I don't know it seems okay
although it seems to be really
unfriendly to data like it seems to just
suck down data even though it shouldn't
be like goo stream and album even it
seems crazy high but I haven't used it
enough to tell but it's good it's got
like it's got like the right interface
the only problem I have with the google
play music all access is that it doesn't
have like my friends on it but other
than that like actually like finding
music and starting a radio stream and
like queuing up playlists and all that
stuff it's just I don't know it's more
boring of an interface and audio or
Spotify but it's more comprehensible to
my brain maybe because I'm like such an
android guy as a really basic Pandora
user who does not pay for any music
whatsoever and just likes to listen to
new things in sequence without searching
for them is this something I want to try
yes I one you could actually like have
your own music library to you can you
can
play a specific song if you want it
three when's the last time you heard a
song on pandora that was new come on I
always hear the same stuff on pandora
all its it often gives me the same
things but I never ever want to search
for anything I just want something that
is spitting out music in the background
I don't care about having a library I
don't care about the trash Pandora's not
I'm ready for you I guess okay I just I
didn't understand I totally understand
the Pandora use case for people who are
not you know not like super into music I
get it they just want some background
audio Sean uh you know what I'm trying
to say is that you're not that into
music but if you you know if you have
favorite artists and you have favorite
albums then I think that you need and
even if you just want to access the new
albums quickly I think that you need
everybody needs at this point some kind
of subscription streaming music solution
and what I'll say about all access that
I haven't found I haven't found any
reason like there's nothing about all
access form like oh my god I need to
drop my Spotify subscription of moves
all access and I think Google knows that
which is why they're offering the 799
discount that presumably people will be
able to grandfather into where if you
sign up now you pay two bucks less than
you're paying for for Spotify or Rdio
which is kind of cool I guess right yeah
I mean I'm paying for Spotify Rdio
itunes match and now google music all
access yeah I need to drop my itunes
match that's a complete waste of money I
need to drop three of those so no I
might be paying for Pandora pro there
was a wild boar I was also paying for
slacker let me just lay that out there
like there may have been a period had I
not if i'm not paying attention it's
possible i am but i got it i got a check
him pretty sure i'm not we're like I had
subscriptions to Pandora slacker itunes
match our do Spotify and itunes what
about mug never mog never could you ever
pay grooveshark I did used to pay
grooveshark for a while because they
were the only thing that was around with
webos I think you're right Chris I'm
just not that into music yeah
yeah here's a problem is like I use
Spotify for a while I call god this is
like I love this radio feature this
works really well like then I'm like oh
but wait this interface is horrible and
then they go to our do and like oh this
is great only like I can't actually like
find my own music this is horrible and
then I give up on everything and I Sean
it up and I'm just going to turn on
pandora forget everything and like no I
want something specific and then I go to
google and like oh this is good I just
need to like settle on one and I just
end up giving up and listening to a
podcast instead so well regardless of
how you do it i will say that that like
that just the notion of actually buying
an album seems so weird and antiquated
horrible now the guy I can't I can never
I would never even think about paying
you know even seven dollars just to own
an album I would never dream of it now
um I would if I couldn't get it on in
the internets to stream I would are
there any rumors are there any rumors
about a streaming service coming amazon
prime because that seems like a really
obvious thing it does but as you would
wouldn't know if you read Greg
Sandoval's work on the verge the music
publishers are really starting to climb
up at least with apple and I wouldn't be
surprised with with others about
licensing stuff well work for Google
yeah I worked for google I don't know
where Amazon's add I think I'm worked
for Google in part because they're not
Apple so maybe maybe it doesn't maybe
haven't done doesn't need to worry but
they should do it all right let's let's
talk about ctia what happened to CJ a
Chris you're there still yeah um so I
think that the highlight of the show I
mean there's there's obviously obviously
been a torrent of news from ctia but i
think the i think that the sure that the
crown jewel has been a JLo at horizons
press conference today which was
literally i didn't time it but i want to
say who's under 15 minutes it started
late and then ended like 15 minutes
later was the weirdest thing and JLo was
jayla I don't know if jail has ever used
a teleprompter before but like
right right in front of her they had
like this giant projector it was the
biggest teleprompter I've ever seen in
my life and she just stared at it the
entire time made no effort to look at
anybody in the audience was was Phil
Dickinson of android central sitting
directly behind the teleprompter because
he was posting photos that were it
looked like she was staring directly
into his soul haha yeah that's that's
very plot oh yeah I in fact I know
exactly where to fill my concern was
sitting yes he was toward the center of
the of the stage yes yeah okay so she
announced that verizon is partnering
with a company called Morehead to open a
a bunch of all and bright star to open a
bunch of Latino focused a third-party
eat cellular retailers the faso that
could finish no please i I'm dying to
have you interject some some commentary
here no I'm just depressed because the
fact that I like actually like
recognized Moorhead and bright star and
that Verizon have held an event where in
my knowledge of those things became
relevant and makes me very angry at
myself and at verizon Oh Sascha Segan a
pc magazine was livid that that uh that
they you know that I suspect that he
probably would it would have been gone
by big from vegas by now it had not been
for the timing of the spent and yeah
they called everybody there's a huge
line to get in the press conference it
was like CES style you know around the
around the block in the venetian is the
only thing that was the only press event
at CES of yeah yeah and every you know a
lot of sites were live blogging it and
there was a there was a forum post in
the verge forum saying why isn't the
verse live blogging this and i replied
like because we're not expecting it to
be worth the live blog and we were right
we were absolutely right i mean don't
get me wrong i was a little star-struck
sitting just a few feet away from from
JLo but yeah that was only news and then
yesterday I mean Kia Sierra introduced a
new low end waterproof phone his name I
don't even know cricket announced
a couple new low end android devices
nokia is showing be Lumia 925 here but
that's not really new because we've
already done a hands-on with that you
can see it on the verge calm so yeah
it's been a very very quiet show yeah
okay great you mentioned the 925 so we
vote if we since we've last podcast as
we've done hands-on with the 925 and the
928 the Lumia 928 is coming to verizon i
think it is horrible 925 is awesome by
the way I think the 925 isn't quite as
awesome as you do but I but it is really
really good compared to the 928 it's
night and day the 928 is just like a
square block with a bump on the back
it's got a xenon flash so that's
interesting they'll be review up on the
site soon so I'm not going to say much
more and by the way uh this is a very
interesting thing that I didn't know the
925 actually is a better camera than the
98 it has more element 0 is always yeah
six elements instead of five but it
doesn't have the Xenon flash so you know
but it's got a this aluminum you know
body thing and then like the the thing I
don't like is that the back has a seam
around it but like that's kind of a
nickel but like it feels it feels like
basically like a really good I don't
even know it's it's not quite Nokia's
design language it's a little bit of an
evolution of it and so like that seam
doesn't help but it it holds up way
better than the 920 just in terms of
like this feels like it belongs in 2013
I think yeah I don't mind I'm okay yeah
and yeah I still really like the that
the old design language they've had
since was of the m9 ya know we all do is
look um it was enough to get me to buy a
windows phone I mean right but yeah so
the 925 looks good but it doesn't it's
not like like crap your pants good right
I would put it on the same plane I think
that it it has a legitimate claim to sit
at the same table as the iphone 5 and
HTC One in terms of materials and build
quality and design
and then of course the you know the
kiddie table next to it is like you know
gs4 and you know the the optimus g pro
and the nexus 4 is kind of like someone
between the two tables so I would I
would I would put the HTC One on the
iphone 5 at the the adult table I would
put the 925 and maybe the end for at the
the kiddie table or like they just got
promoted to the adult table but they're
not sure if they belong it they don't
know which fork to use yet and then like
I would put the s4 as like at the card
table out in the garage with the
relatives that you don't know right
right which is sometimes the coolest
place to be but sometimes not sometimes
it smells like gasoline yeah card tables
covered a lot of tiree crash you are the
gs4 of your family's what you yes um all
right we've been going for like an hour
and 20 minutes uh the only other thing I
will talk about the q5 blackberrys stuff
when dans back because he was there at
blackberry live and it'll be late but it
doesn't matter because it's the q5 and
we're not going to talk about the yet
more drama with sprint and Clearwire and
dish because like we could tell we could
basically say the same story every week
we don't know what's going to happen
there's going to be a board vote soon
there's lots of insider crap going on
and that stuff keeps changing actually
that that's it we talked about it's done
sprint up their bid for clearwire to try
and be dishes bid but Clearwire's
investors are still unhappy about it and
sprint doesn't have it as locked up as
we thought they did and it's a mess and
it's going to continue to be a mess and
hopefully by the end of the month when
did they delay their board boat
clearwire it's late i don't know i don't
have the date in front of me it doesn't
matter it's a mess and like it'll get
fixed i guess and i don't know if dish
ends up winning out that'll be huge but
i don't know it will say what I mean
I'll offer I mean
no dish really fully grasps the gravity
of the of what they're trying to do I me
no not at all you know I mean look urban
co which you know with all these cable
companies who had this grand vision of
creating their own wireless network and
then they're like oh wait a second holy
crap this is really hard and it's a
nightmare and this is not something we
want to deal with and so they just ended
up you know pawning off all their their
spectrum and dishes running in the
opposite direction yeah and I don't
think that they fully understand what it
means to build out a nationwide LTE
network no um on that note thank you
