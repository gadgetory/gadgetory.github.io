our daily afternoon show about all the
gadgets and gizmos and all the weird
stuff we found at CES and there's a lot
of it I was actually out on the show
floor for like two and a half hours
yesterday and it was the most exhausting
thing I've ever done in my life just
trying to look at things here to talk
about it all of me is my long-lost
co-host I missed you yesterday nilay
patel you look so handsome I
just and you're right that's what
anything saying really nice things
really threatening over this way I like
them did a good job I kinda I want to
cry right now I would like to carry you
people I'm very tired so I hope you're
ready for a free-form journey intimate
it was it was it was kesho last night
just ruined you forever you didn't come
down from cashel until about ten minutes
ago yeah pretty much also I watched I
the four minutes watch blackjack yeah
and then he didn't I don't know if S&amp;amp;E
no no you later black I think that
Michael Michael Shane one like 300
honors yeah good for my yeah i have
always lost thousands of dollars playing
blackjack I don't think I've ever want a
hand a blackjack oh yeah uh our
operations ascent Leo was there playing
and she had this like what essentially
like a bio-computer of nerds behind her
telling her exactly what to do and the
other and she won seven dollars in four
hands like immediately but it was only
because of this like brain trust of
nerds being like I don't have to do some
calculations do this and she was like
Watson sitting yeah it was amazing
everyone else was so mad that's often
that we took our money and we ran away
and then we spent the money other place
and then they kicked you out and tried
to get meet you up have a casino content
because now they're making a movie it's
the whole thing but so anyway there's
lots of news to talk about this is day I
don't know Dave 5000 if we been here
like a thousand years yeah but it's like
the last full day of cs right rain is
our last show actually it is it's a last
show CES it's gonna miss you I'm gonna
miss you too so yes is kind of winding
down its still there's still what is it
like 160,000 people here yeah but the
actual news the cool new stuff is all
it's all there and yeah we've seen it
all so we're gonna do is talk about some
of the kind of the biggest things that
happened and some vinegar trends and
coolers and there's actually a lot you
know I i think the the biggest
overarching trend here is the rise like
the indie hardware startup and how many
of them are how many of them there are a
lot of them are funded by kickstarter
and indiegogo adrian's and greg reporter
Matt right so a lot of the biggest stuff
we saw this week wasn't from samsung or
sony or panasonic like they all had
these big kind of would you call them
busts I kind of I kind of want to call
their press conferences bus where they
were like you know big bombastic and
they're like 4k gems and like that's
cool but nothing is really you know
life-changing blowing my mom owns
abilities I keep comparing I don't know
why this keeps going up to me but like
two or three years ago there was a sous
was here and that they put out like 500
concepts my press conference yeah it was
exciting and weird and so who is this
company and like what are they talking
about I literally don't know what you're
talking about but that phone looks cool
and that there wasn't a lot of that this
year I think Samsung showed off like a
curb to secure phone yet um but it's
really the little guy some of whom
aren't even on the show for who are here
they've all got really cool ideas
they're getting funding in a variety of
like new ways basically right and there
i think in adrian's piece the the
difference is she's like Samsung and
Sony those guys they look around the
world like what the manufacturing
partners are doing they're like okay
that panel is ready and this chip is
ready and now we're going to glue them
together and that's when you smart
that's a samsung and LG end up releasing
the world's first TV it exactly the same
all right and the indie guys are
basically saying what do I want right
and then I building that and that's
really different yeah but then there's
another trend which i think is really
extinguishes there are there's a lot of
robots nomination the show yeah and Paul
Miller right yeah Paul Miller what's not
on the internet you may have heard of
him yeah he's not on the internet yeah
that's all I know about him he's
standing outside he is standing outside
not on the internet at this moment
that's very hard Paul you went sour
irobot right yeah it's cold not on the
internet
yeah i went i robot yes we know we have
heat on the inner uh so tell us what
what did you what did you see it i robot
what's i robot up to now well so the you
know they got a new pool cleaning robot
which is exciting at iRobot is doing
exactly what I robot has always done
which is they make these horribly boring
not even that great vacuum cleaners now
pool cleaning robot the louche which
cleans your gutters nomad there's a new
lose out at this year's CES does it
clean your gutters banners what yeah and
I better here's what I don't understand
about iRobot night let me just ask you
this question as far as i know i robot
makes military robots right they can
kill you right hey let me make a line
they make a line of domestic robots Paul
say don't kill you they can't kill fine
they definitely kill you think can drive
around and identify who to kill right
and then they make a line of extremely
boring things that can clean various
parts of your home right do they make
anything for consumers that is useful
welcome so so for one they are selling a
ton of vacuum cleaners and they are
making money and that's what makes them
like kind of the most interesting
exciting best robotics company in the
world is because they make money and
they are a real business and you know
for for like Toyota and Honda show off
these great concepts but they never sell
them to us room you know I wrote makes
these rumbas and in these military
robots but what they've been doing for
years now is developing really great
intellectual property and for the past
two CS as they are showing off this
thing called Ava and it's their mobility
platform which can map out a space it
can navigate a space autonomously avoid
running into people and it's finally
mature enough that it's going into a
product it's the I want to get this
right the rp-vita yeah which is a
hospital telepresence robot and I got to
play around with it it's just it's dead
simple you've gotta like an iPad app
like a doctor would have an eye
app they pull up like a list of hospital
rooms basically tap on the name of a
room and the robot just drives there and
and you really don't have to worry about
it will map its own course it will avoid
running into people and then so the top
half of the robot is developed by in
touch health which they bundu
telepresence robots but they're like
stationary before so this is like a
really great commercial applications lot
not for consumers it's about like five
thousand dollars a month per a month to
get one of these in the hospital but to
be honest like as far as health care
costs and when you're talking about like
monitoring stroke victims and stuff
that's actually decently reasonable and
and so but again I robot is all about
making this a sustainable business
they're going to make money on this and
the thing is that they've developed
really great technology here and will
continue to develop technology in this
realm that will lead to eventually call
an angle the CEO I talk to ya said about
10 years for a personal whole robot and
there's a lot of problems still of a
home robot to be really useful is
probably gonna need to arm it's probably
gonna need to be able to go up and down
stairs yeah it's gonna need a base
that's not as large so there's still a
lot to figure out a laser weapon of some
kind but they're of the Pat yeah laser
laser weapon for sure but there are a
lot of developments lately that our are
getting getting closer I mean have you
seen so here's my question i went to
LG's booth yesterday and they were like
we have an unprecedented new robot robot
vacuum mmm it's a square oh it's like
literally a square and they're like
you've never seen a vacuum like this
before like that's true I have not it's
like this one this way I mean like are
those companies a threat to iRobot today
do they represent actual competition
today and can somebody get this done in
less than 10 years anything sounds like
a question it isn't
right well I Robot actually just bought
another company I think evolution
robotics which makes the mint which is
square the mint is a it's a like it's
like a swiffer robot so you put a
Swiffer pad on it and he uses different
technology for navigation and so you
know I Robot bought them you know for
that product which I think was a
successful product it's a little cheaper
than I robots own products but also
intellectual property I think I think
the sort of a race is on and called
angle talks about how he sees the robot
like they're being a robot Butler and
you won't have to manage the little
robots that are doing your little chores
around the house you'll you'll engage
with a robot Butler the thing is is that
we are engaging with robot Butler's
right now on our phones like with Siri
and Google now and and call an angle
admits the iRobot is not in the business
of developing that sort of artificial
intelligence yeah they're in
manipulation and navigation and that
sort of stuff so you know we might just
be controlling our smart homes with our
phones like we saw you know LG has those
you know you touch your phones in the
washer dryer so there's a question if
we'll we'll have robots in our homes in
that role that he wants I still think
there is a role for a robot in the home
with an arm that can do stuff pick stuff
up folder you know fold your laundry
make your bed but we're still like at
least an order of magnitude maybe two
orders of magnitude away from shipping
something like that to consumers as far
as price something that you would want
in your home right now probably cost a
hundred thousand dollars to build and
you'd probably want to pay a thousand to
two thousand dollars for something like
that ultimately cool Paul thank you so
much for talking to us I have to I just
have to make it ten years and then I get
one of these things and then call call
angle says you know everybody always
says 10 years that's a robotics like
cliche
oh he'll be in ten years and then it
never happens call Nagel says he never
says that so he's really serious this
time ten years ten years I'm writing it
down what's the date I don't know what
the data is ten years from this January
tip 2013 if I can't buy one burning the
building down all right all of the
buildings uh Paul thanks so much for
joining us thanks guys so do you want to
roll like I want a robot really that I
had a rumor i was so broke in the day
did you my favorite thing they've seen
is that the DJ rumbas where you just put
a speaker on top of a Roomba it's not an
actual thing you just put a speaker on
top of a room but it just goes around
playing music I could get into that
seems amazing I mean but that's not even
a rope that's just a speaker that
doesn't fit like bumps into things
hilariously I don't know you said it
like it's not the greatest they're fine
so one of the things we've seen a lot of
is like different way are you dare
contradict me I'll go sorry this is a UH
one of the things we've seen a lot of is
like different ways to interact with
gadgets that's one of the big things
that's like how do we use our stuff and
even robots kind of play into that it's
like you know how we interface with the
whole world around us um and there's a
lot of it here oh yeah everything here
is I mean it's kind of like this it yeah
there's a sense and animation video and
some stuff like that but there's a sense
to where it's like it's like 3d was
where the TV manufacturers told
everybody in HDTV you know like man we
got to come up with something else like
that like what they sell on was 3d it's
like everybody else is looking at
Microsoft's on the connecting like we
need something like that and they don't
I'm not convinced that everybody has all
the parts like Microsoft had with the
Kinect yeah every yeah I mean that's the
thing is uh it was when we were talking
about the the Pebble watch yesterday
dieter said something I thought was
really smart he was saying there's not a
lot of bells and whistles but like if
you don't have all the bells you can
make better whistles and I feel like
that's what connected it's like this
really basic thing that they did really
really well right and all these other
things are really cool and you know you
see the possibility for like what leap
motion blew my mind really i thought it
was it still like it just the fact that
it could recognize all of my fingers and
then i could put a pencil in between my
fingers and it would recognize that that
was different from the finger that I'd
like just was crazy and so there's all
this stuff that you can do but it seems
like what are you gonna do with it right
it's like a fun novelty right answer
russell brandom wrote a really great
report yeah it's actually interesting
all those companies are here but they're
not really talking to consumers we have
like little offices right we're like
sony and samsung and microsoft they're
all going to meet with them and see what
they can do intel has a big push for
what they're calling perceptual
computing yeah I mean it's again like to
me there's I have a definite sense that
like everyone like woke up to touch and
what Mike shots soon with the connect
with natural user interface there and
there's a big rush to like try it out
and see see what they're you know
version of HD will be right and there's
I think there's me a lot of fallout yeah
so one that we dig it's try out was the
Toby eye tracker right this one which is
another pretty wacky thing and Tom war
and got to play with it so let's let's
check that out hey guys it's tom warren
from the verge and we're looking at
toby's Rick's I tracking technology for
windows 8 after a one time calibration
you basically hold down the delete key
and then you can navigate across the
whole interface so this is working on
windows 8 now so you can see that I've
got my hand on the Delete key here if I
look at mail and I hit delete it'll
launch mail I can go and look at the
Microsoft account team email on there
and it hit the late game and it'll
navigate to that so you're basically
using your eyes to track where you want
the cursor to be and then the Delete key
will actually trigger that action so I
can start a new email for a look at the
plus at the top right and there's all
sorts of other ways as well if we go
into the maps application you can
actually use the scroll wheel on the
mouse to zoom in so if i look at toronto
and then i start zooming in and out it
will do that navigation for you and then
i can look to pittsburgh in the very
left there and i can scroll in and out
as well if we go back and then we go to
Internet Explorer you can use the insert
key and if I hold that down and then
look to the bottom of the page you'll
start scrolling and if I look to the top
it'll start scrolling to the top so we
saw this last year and Toby are going to
be shipping this to consumers
run in the year it seems like it's a lot
more accurate than it was before I mean
if I go and look at people it seems to
be working quite well and I look at the
desktop that's Toby's Rex I tracking
technology for windows 8
I feel like all i want to do with that
is like staying behind people as they
use computers and just stare at things
while they click and just wait and see
what happens and that's a good confused
I don't know may find out stuff it's
like that's great but is it useful do
you care like serving me by one of those
yeah I don't know how much like is it
that much more work so anyway the thing
I think is the coolest of all of these
wacky things that we've done and I an
interesting combination of robotics yeah
and you I and yeah is a self-driving car
critical and so we yeah it's chris
ziegler so Chris showed up to CES
basically got off the plane and just
disappeared for like days and days and
days go on like where I have to go hang
out somewhere I believe I assumed you
were dead yeah gambling or those just
those the only two thinkin serves me is
that you assumed I was dead and you
didn't think to do i mean about in here
does it do yeah busy gambling i gambled
in your honor i poured one out I
appreciate that I appreciate that so
what were you actually doing so I was
deeply embedded in the world of auto
journalism which is a very foreign huh
thank for us but it was great i checked
out lexus had a self-driving car here
that they didn't actually demo but
they've been demonstrating it privately
in both Japan and in ann arbor michigan
which is where Trina is located which is
their research arm they've been doing
that for the past five years and they
just showed it for the first time
publicly here and then we checked out
Audi which eventually they're gonna get
to true self driving cars but in the
short term they're doing what they're
calling a self parking cars basically
you you walk outside your hotel you
press a button on your smartphone and
the car creeps around the corner at 2.1
miles and hours which which for the
record is just astonishingly slow yes
right but it's like awesome like the
video you guys made is awesome yeah it's
I mean it's it's Tennyson shields
shields yeah you could but I wouldn't if
he said shields I still wouldn't go into
an area with gunfire right I wouldn't do
it stop yeah that's the best in that and
the first Batman you know oh yeah yeah
yeah when the Batmobile yeah it's like
he's like racing at it yeah
walks out there to stop yeah yeah I love
that this happened this mean but why
would anyone do that right so i thought
i would definitely if i was like the
first guy on my block with that feature
i would definitely talk into the phone
like I was talking to the car remote
late yeah and then everyone it was
slowly creeping yeah you oh it's super
1oz bruh it's super creepy the first
time it happens when the car just
appears around the corner and there's no
one in it it's it's weird so yeah that's
that's what i was doing this week and so
all these companies are like making a
big deal out of this is the future this
is like it crazy thing that's ever
happened in the world so Ford's CTO Paul
Mascarenas who we actually talked to
this week said last year that Google has
kind of pushed the entire industry in
the directional driving cars like they
force the issue and everyone is having
to respond well in good for Google it's
just too it's just a means to an end
right like Google doesn't seem that
interested in selling me a self-driving
car but everybody else kind of caught on
to the idea and is now doing it
themselves I go drink us again would you
buy the google has everything by the
speaker like if Google made a car would
you buy all you want I mean how many ads
in your chain email Xperia it's like
Google makes a card what whatever
verizon samsung gonna do do it first
true uh I swear that shit's gonna be
here my copper droid car to open the car
and make like a droplet sound oral I
mean you know does have LTE actually the
Audi does have LTE yeah they just before
they were doing HSPA and they just have
great deal to you right so but that's
neither here nor there so they're going
to get to the self-driving cars
eventually but the problem is that
they're very careful in the language
that they use to describe these vehicles
because they know that there's this
looming legislative battle around
getting these things legalized so
they're being very careful not to call
them autonomous cars not to say that
they drive themselves they're like oh
it's a safety feature like we're helping
the driver you know
and it's it was really interesting to
hear the very very careful language that
every single executive use to describe
later trying to do here yet let me ask
you the real question like it's not
whether I'm gonna buy a Google car it's
whether this technology and it's not
even whether it's legalized if there's
demand for it if people want it right
the legal stuff look at sort of maybe
it'll be a little bit slower than we'd
like but it will definitely sort it out
but without the demand there's no reason
for Congress to like spend its time
talking about self-driving cars right
that's true but I would also argue that
there are many things that people want
that aren't legal I think that's fair
yeah oh so actually I mean let's let's
talk about some of this legal stuff cuz
it's it's like we're not gonna get
anywhere until we figure this out right
and so russell brandom who's been a busy
guy this week has been out has written
some stuff on us for us about this
before and is actually here in a totally
different place from where Paul was a
few minutes ago yeah it has to be very
clear about that but so Russell tell us
tell us a little bit about some of the
the big legal issues that are going on
here yeah um I mean the main thing is
all the laws are written as if there's a
driver in the car so there are all these
things the driver has to be that
autonomous drivers aren't gonna be they
aren't gonna be you know conscious and
they're gonna be in control of the car
but it's sort of not it's just hard to
make those laws work with essentially a
robot driver like how do you give it an
eye test how do you do sort of any of
the things people do to get driver's
licenses well it seems to me that the
bigger problem is I mean you could you
can do i'm sure you can develop a
certification program for robot cars but
our laws are punitive when you make a
mistake let me punish you right and it's
like how do you punish a robot driver
for making a wrong decision you can call
me what i was sitting in the past it's
like you got your robot blew the stop
sign yeah like it is bad robot I be
wrong what's that what Russell what's
that what's the situation with that
stuff well the concern is that you sue
the person who made the robot driver
right so if it was you know if it was
this this is why I think companies like
Lex's are being so careful is
cuz they don't want me to say oh I
thought the Lexus was gonna sort of
drive for me and it would be fine and if
you getting that paradigm then anything
it does Lexus could potentially be
liable for a all those you sort of don't
know until people start suing each other
but it's also you know a 50 billion
dollar like auto liability lawsuits are
50 billion dollars a years it's huge and
so there's really it's kind of a
dangerous pool to wade into I don't know
I would just play in the robot I'm sure
look what we need to do is develop
robots that feelings and then you can
blame them right if then you can blame
them and they'll feel bad about what
that done yeah i mean that's actually i
think the most interesting of all the
robot stuff like no one worries about
the legal implications a vacuum cleaner
that can like that sir andrew has once
you put things in like a two-ton car and
say don't worry about it the robot it'll
take care of it and they're very careful
to not call them robots right right
actually the Audi's the head of Audis
R&amp;amp;D lab Wolfgang der heimer said that we
are not out to compete with the robot
industry check that was a very
interesting ways I've got this robot we
built a check out this robot uh yeah
it's gonna be many many years until they
figure out exactly how this can or and
they're all saying what this is this is
decades away we're just we're putting
stuff together Lexus like oh we're
showing safety features it's just in the
package of a self-driving car don't
worry about it but there you know this
is not anytime soon well and how does it
ever get done because it seems to me
that like the that's already happening
right there's a little state in Los
Nevada is one of them we're doing as it
should be put its car on the road here
right but again there are no laws here
bring that car can also like drive to a
brothel okay while drinking yeah like it
doesn't matter what you do here that's
why I love Las Vegas Russell I know
what's your what's your sense on the
legality of the situation I mean is
there action around the states the
federal level I think there's a way to
work it out but I also think the concern
is the reason I would want to buy a
self-driving cars so I wouldn't have to
drive and I wouldn't have to like pay
attention so I I think the concern is
you get by the time you make a product
it's been so sort of pared back to deal
with the legal things that people don't
actually want to buy it
I guess I mean I was on about or two and
I think I think the answer for the
industry is to say look this will make
the roads actually safer yeah and
they've got to get there they've got to
prove to people that highways full of
self-driving cars will be safer than
like my distracted casual listening
right but they also have to somehow
remove all liability from themselves or
else they're never gonna want to play
the game right because if I'm as long as
I'm able to blame Lexus hang on a death
lexus is gonna yeah we're all we're
going down no I really it's got to get
mapped out but we'll see okay yeah all
right so we have we have one more demo
Russell thank you so much for for
talking to us and I'm now kind of
depressed about self-driving cars like
they're awesome so I they do here I feel
like I'm never gonna get one I'm only
here at press thank you they'll go for
that anytime um but so there's one more
demo we have left and I feel like I've
said this is the coolest thing I've ever
seen in my entire life like 400 times
this week yeah um but this might be the
coolest thing I've ever seen in my life
it's called the artifact and like let's
just we have a video of it we've played
with it a little bit so let's just start
with that and we'll go from there hi
this is Rondo from the verge and we're
here with the art of fun instrument one
and its inventor Mike Butera
what this is is actually an advanced
midi controller with an iphone 4 its
brain if you know how to play guitar you
can intuitively just start playing and
it has the fret board down here with the
strings and then you strum on this
touchpad down here or you can finger
pick it has five different modes guitar
bass violin banjo and custom the cool
thing about that is if you know how to
play guitar you can have the guitar
sound and that's cool but you can
actually have it in guitar mode and then
change the MIDI instrument to say a
violin you can change it to an organ you
can change it to a synthesizer but then
play it like you're playing a guitar so
because this is actually a midi
controller it can work with Eddie
anything that has a MIDI input so this
works with GarageBand this works for
pretty much anything and you can also
play live with it you can record with it
this can also use vocoder apps so it has
a microphone input we're using for
sensing technology on this for both the
fingerboard and the strum section so all
in all the instrument one is unlike
anything i've ever played but at the
same time exactly like everything I've
ever played it's expected to be eight
hundred dollars for pre-sale this spring
and then other models on sale after that
so this fell pretty squarely into the
realm of things that we saw and we're
like we have to try immediately yeah so
we actually brought Mike Butera into the
studio with us with the artifact is it's
the instrument one is that the first
system I mean it's easier to you have to
see it in person it's made of wood feel
like it's you too very good say African
hardwood sustainably harvested and we
make it in Nashville right and I mean it
looks crazy yes sir Tillis let's start
with kind of the back story of how you
started the company and built this thing
yeah sure so I have a PhD in sound
studies and my dissertation was on the
way we listen phenomenologically with
technology right so I teach that and
sociology and then I I'm a musician and
I played multiple stringed instruments
so I wanted to make a device that
changed the way that we approached
instruments that wasn't just a guitar
then we have apps and so with MIDI you
know all kinds of things but if you're
limited to a screen you basically right
you know the non tactile so this came
about so you have it this is a touch
sensor yeah these are force sensing
resistors actually on the fret board and
the strum section and so they they
measure the the pressure and then
translate that into various MIDI
commands you can you can do effects by
pressing harder you can do slides you
can turn off the frets and go between
you can do for brato so there's it's
more expressive than then we
yes so you've developed this to work or
to be a huge number of instruments right
it can think you were playing around it
was a whole bunch of different things
that you had it yes the ideas you can
play it in she has mad skills a trick
this is amazing like a guitar or a
mandolin something like that but then
you put it up right you can use it like
a harp or a upright bass or cello if you
put it on your shoulder right I can show
you so we'll change the string mode and
then this becomes like a bow right so
you can run any app any iPhone app that
takes midi this is just controller yeah
that's right so you know we are
programming the firmware and actually
people can customize the firmware to
make it whatever instrument they want
interesting so we made this we made it
this weird shape because it's organ Amin
and its portal thing so you know it's
you in all these different positions you
have a reason even though it's it's an
odd thing once you once you hold it like
oh yeah so you're I mean this is part of
the bigger story which is a lot indie
hardware projects here yeah you're so
nothing um yeah what's it like being an
indie hardware developers especially for
a project it seems it seems like you
couldn't immediately explain this to
someone well you could one as soon as
you see it i think you get it but we've
been doing this for two years and we
kept a client for almost that long we
were just unveiled you know basically
today and so um
we've gotten local angel funding in
Nashville I mean Nationals an amazing
city for this not only because the tech
scene but music scene and all that so
we've been able to get by and with a
great team of engineers I mean these
guys have built consoles like they're
veterans of the industry and so we we
just love the project and that got us
here now to go farther than that I mean
a lot of people do the kick start doing
the yoga thing where we're kind of going
a middle ground of we want to get
investors who care about the field
because we're doing domestic production
we're not just shipping off to China and
looking at the bottom line this is this
is about caring about the not only the
production process but then when people
hold it like right well you're caring
about your instrument right yeah it's
you'd like love and the funny thing is
by including your phone which you know
all these psychology studies saying
people actually have loved type emotions
with their gadgets you know this we're
kind of bridging that yeah divide well
so that's I was actually gonna ask that
so it's um we've seen a lot of digital
instruments like that's kind of anything
for a while but they're all sort of
they're all very much keep this away
toys right and in this
oh my goodness yes but this feels way
more like an instrument like one thing
on purpose did you're just gonna do this
is amazing what you're very sound
getting trolled by an electric banjo
no it's great that's great that's good
thank you our music yeah we're all very
proud of you I'm sorry so I mean this
feels much more like real a measurement
then just a toy for your iphone so you
can play guitar yeah and that's I mean
that's the big difference between you
know a lot of the guitar hero type
guitar controllers and and this is what
we were making this for professional
musicians I mean from keyboardists who
want to get out behind the keyboards to
string players who want to expand their
sounds to people who want to practice or
write song right in multitrack recording
on the bus you know there's a lot of a
lot of uses and it connects I mean the
connects with all your standard music
gear so are you finding that people want
to make music using iphone as a central
controller we've been doing a lot of
customer development in nashville and
and elsewhere to figure out what people
want like that would matter to them and
we've actually changed the design and
continue to based on that feedback a lot
of musicians are saying that you know
how does this fit you got the omnichord
that old sort of weird instrument then
you have weird you know Qatar's or since
guitars yeah and some people use an omni
chord as a almost Kitsch thing now and
people don't generally use other since
guitars but by making it something that
sort of fits your life a little better
that you can actually carry around that
you can put your phone in theirs it's
more blended in in that sense so we you
know that's what people are grabbing on
to they they see it they want it and
then they're like oh yeah and it would
be useful in this and this and this
space so Studios wanted just we met with
a lot of students in Nashville you and
they're like hey you know we just went
this laying around cuz at you know eight
hours into a session when you're just
out of ideas you pick this up and you
just mess yeah you can see what happened
so can you can you play us a suite down
right here
yeah what do you want to cuz i've been
trying um you're doing great okay you're
learning so fat I think yeah so that
yeah you're very see you just fire me I
say nice things to you jack
that's awesome can I have one yeah say
hi to sauce yeah haha that's supposed to
work all right Mike thank you so much ah
that's awesome that is our show we this
is our last day in the studio sadly
they're taking all of this away from us
but we still have more coming we have
diverged mobile show coming up today at
five we have a virg cast at six and our
last webcast at CES is always really fun
yeah so you should definitely hang out
for that there will probably be more
tired Neal I just more tired everybody
else which is just amazing but so stick
around we have a ton of great video
content will be around all night and
thanks so much for watching Mike we met
