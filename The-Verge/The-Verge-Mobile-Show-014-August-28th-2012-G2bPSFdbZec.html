took it home and then i slaughtered the
goat and I offered it up to the gods of
mobile as a burnt offering begging them
to bring another mobile expert to the
verge and a couple weeks ago dan seifert
join the team coincidence who can say
stay tuned for the Virgin Mobile show
I'm dieter bohn i'm dan seifert i'm
chris sigler it was up that so oh my god
he's here we have been trying to get
Vlad connected to us for some time now
he is live from Aoife in berlin and how
is it there lad it is nice and not so
anymore it's night now but it's lovely
the people are lovely it's a beautiful
city and I'm enjoying it apart from the
really ghetto web connection that I have
right now otherwise is of length yeah
you saw a mess really what's really odd
to me is that Berlin is supposed to be
basically the San Francisco of Europe
right a lot of stops there you would
assume that the web connectivity would
be absolutely fantastic everywhere you
go there apart from the hotels and I'm
in a hotel so what can I do one right
you know I've got Wi-Fi here basically
got to take to the window so again
maximize its connectivity who knows how
long our laws but you know as a voice
and as a still picture in this otherwise
video podcast I will do my utmost
so we're we're missing a golden
opportunity here to haze dan who is with
us for the first time and I think
there's no better way to do that than to
just say hey Dan I was going what's new
it's going well um I think we got
anything done a lot better you know I
could have and you really put me on the
spot there so well he's oh he's already
done 90 seconds on the verge so I kind
of feel like he's already he's already
over that hump so to speak uh this is
kind of the easy part this is cake
compared to the nightmarish halibut and
I just want to say you know for the
people that watched the 90 seconds on
the version I was actually on I am
wearing a shirt that fits this time so
you know nobody needs to take a fence or
avert their eyes because of a shirt that
make might not fit oh you can always get
thrown just throwing it out there yeah I
like the fair and my bro they're pretty
brutal when it comes to uh to our
wardrobes I gotta say is that a time
they are yeah that's a little tied and
that's amazing great that's your your
mate I'm wrangle for the bulk show I was
about to say I'm wearing a tuxedo but
then I realized my camera so i can't
really lie about that um but yeah this
is this is very exciting so for those of
you who don't know all of you should
know at this point but dan seifert is a
very very new addition to the verge and
we are very excited to have him aboard
and I suspect this is an early
prediction but I suspect you're gonna be
seeing and hearing a lot of him on this
program going forward I think that's the
same as well see how he does yeah no I
mean he totally bombs and he's out
obviously right well you're pretty high
I park here yeah the string no pressure
at all yeah no pressure um also dieter I
just want to go back to your open
because that was I mean you've done some
disturbing openness but that really
takes the cake and I'm a little
emotionally scarred right now and that
frankly i don't know if i can continue i
might do yeah i would like to add that
that i had no idea that was coming
either I mean I saw the notes word in
the in our notes
and I had no idea who is going going
that direction yeah so so just to give
our listeners an idea of what's going on
we're looking at our show notes here and
it just says virgin mobile show episode
14 cold open colon goat sacrifice and I
didn't think to question deters I just I
let him roll with it and it comes and I
come to find out that he was actually
going to talk about buying and
slaughtering a goat it hopes that dan
seifert would join which I yeah that was
that was unexpected so I would also like
to say no animals were harmed in the
making of ya say it turns out that
sometimes these these opening stories
aren't actually technically true I
didn't literally buy abilify only
metaphorically bought a goat and made a
burnt offering of it to the gods of
mobile by the way gods of mobile would
make a sweet superhero movie we think
we've talked about this before we should
talk about Aoife because Vlad's here on
a tenuous and risky connection and we
should use it while we can so the I
guess the big news so far is LG is that
fair to say yeah I think so of what we
know well I mean actually it's I think
it's premature to talk about evil by
exactly one day so if it'll conductance
podcast tomorrow it will be a really
fascinating breakdown of the comings and
goings the movers and shakers but today
is just like LG announced the Optimus G
which is not an offer at least not yet
the jeff blagdon over in Japan he went
to the entity docomo launch event for
this device and managed to get some
hands-on time with it but our dedicated
so there's they're seriously IDs um I
don't know if they will have the phone
here I don't actually know that for
myself I mean my conversations with LG
have actually led me to believe that it
wouldn't be launched yet it wouldn't be
good if I I expected it to be launched
little later on but there you go that's
just how far you can take
or you can trust your communications PR
people I guess um but yeah I mean look
if it's a diva you we found it will be
videoed and it will be sniffed and
touched and tasted no please don't bring
those of the pho but nigga don't sniff
the phone you can you can you can touch
it you can look at it you can take video
of it don't use any of your of your
other senses don't taste it don't sniff
it I I I implore you unless you want to
come down with some diseases that you
can't pronounce their have any bones
that have smelled bad i will i will
point that out there there are certain
manufacturers where they don't get all
the glue out before they ship it and so
it just smells terrible coming out of
the box well a very good example of that
is a nexus s when you whip out the
battery before switch yes and then get
back in it's a very consistent
unpleasant about but anyway I reject
Chris's absolutism about dumb stuff to
phone I should do whatever comes
naturally twin banker completely and
that's your funeral it's glad it's your
funeral and frankly we have Dan lined up
as a perfectly suitable replacement for
when you die so I know I know I'm
already super presence as it is you guys
are probably posted a picture of a clown
while I speak oh and yes I found myself
like no the thing hey anyway so yeah the
news of eva is coming it's not with us
yet but as far as we're concerned the
korean companies they've done their
usual thing of pre announcing things so
we know there's the LG optimus G the 4.7
inch device and whenever something is
going to launch the galaxy note 2 so
those are two big standouts from Korea
and we should get a hands of bow
tomorrow basically I don't know yeah I
optimus 2x was just not an impressive
phone to me so whatever you know LG this
is not the first time the LG has made a
point of trying to jump out ahead of the
competition and you know trying to make
a big splash with
flagship device and they just in in the
past they have not in my mind delivered
the optimus black was not an impressive
device the 2x sucked i had g2x and it
was not not a good phone so we'll see
I'm up you know a little bit only
because the 4x HD was impressive at
least I mean it wasn't it's not quite up
to the bar of say you know what Samsung
has been producing or even HTC but it
was a marked departure from the really
ho-hum phones that were coming in 2011
2010 etc mm-hmm sure different
interesting thing my dad I'm told I'm
ready to have this thing break my heart
like I like the design it's just a big
unapologetic slab of you know powerful
smartphone awesomeness as far as the
specs are concerned like there's there's
no adornments like the corners are
barely barely curved they may as well be
like 90 degrees straight you know sharp
corners it's just you know a glossy
black slab with a screen on it I mean
actually it's late to have is that it's
super glossy yeah I was gonna say don't
speak too quickly about liking this
design because from the front absolutely
agree with you it's really a severe
looking which is fun and good for
something that is respect women but then
you flip it around and is this glossy
back and it's just you know it makes you
cringe I don't know what I needs to do
that why do you need to get it up and
make it all flashy and all of those
things but the really interesting aspect
for me with the optimus G is that this
is the first advice from LG that has the
famed in-cell touch technology which we
anticipate it will be in an LG display
in the next generation iphone and this
is essentially the same thing that we've
seen from Samsung with a super amoled
displays where they take the capacitive
touch elements and the display and they
just you know bond the whole thing
together and make this place look like
it really is on the surface of the glass
unless you make it as you build thinner
displays which lets you go thinner
phones point that Chris has been
drilling into people for a while so I
mean and I mean obviously the first
quad-core Snapdragon s4 is going to be a
spectacularly awesome awesome chip so I
mean that the potential is totally there
but then we've also said that whole
bunch of times at LG devices well the
other thing to point out is that it's
currently only announced for Korea right
we don't have you know who knows when
it's going to come to the u.s. if ever
korean Tom I mean we're just now getting
the Optimus view on verizon as the LG
intuition which like did they just have
like a like one of those cages with lots
of little bingo balls in it they've all
got ridiculous names I don't really just
rolled it around and one popped out what
is what does intuition have to do with
this giant weird you know four by three
device I don't know but that's a long
time from the time that devices
announced it arrived in here and so I'm
not really you know I'm betting if it
does come to the u.s. it'll be a while
and by the time it does I don't know you
know I'll care as much yeah especially
for two hundred dollars on contract are
you kidding me yeah I know um so I guess
I got to finish before we move on I just
want that there are a couple things I
just wanna say real quick about the
optimus G I feel like and actually about
the Snapdragon s4 pro in particular
because i feel i keep going back to
something that was said to Vlad and I at
mwc this year when we spoke to arm and
the gentleman that we spoke to said you
know this year I'll be using a quad core
a9 this time next year I'll be using a
dual-core a 15 and at this point omap 5
is right around the corner right i would
expect before the end of the year we're
going to have some ol Matt 5
announcements which i think is widely
expected to be the first a 15 SOC on the
market so and you know is the s4 pro
those are really is the entire s4 lines
rain you know with the crate
architecture about to come to an end and
you know what kind of battery
characteristics and performance
characteristics are we going to see from
these quad-core krait chips versus dell
Matt 5 and whatever whatever other a 15
ships we see over the next few months
well I mean uh for me at this point it's
I'm more concerned with battery life
than I am with with performance and if
the omap can-can went out on battery
life then I'll switch over I mean I've
got no problems with the dual core s4
honestly I I really am NOT especially
once you get something you know close to
jelly bean on it like it's just fine so
right you know switch you know I'm
totally convinced that you know all
these arguments about bon cours a joke
it's not necessary blah blah blah like I
was convinced as soon as I started using
the 1x and so I mean I'm less worried
about you know the the speed and the
power of these things and I am about
who's gonna win on the battery life
front and especially in a quad-core
space and to me that's that's a much
more interesting question well certainly
um I think you know the battery life is
definitely an issue but as devices we're
at 720p devices now as we move it to
1080p devices we might see some issues
with the current dual core chips pushing
those graphics so I think that's where
we might see an advantage on the quad
core end in and then hopefully better
battery life with the newer quad core
chips of course right does that make
sense anybody yes I think that's yeah it
makes total sense to me total sense I
but my gig for this podcast is that I'm
going to believe anything the dances
cool that's my that's my role here Chris
I oh you have the wrong idea for what
hazing means I think it kind of goes the
other way which is anything anything
about said dan says we need to just slam
it into the ground to pretend like it's
completely wrong but you don't know that
would be a real
by the way I want to point out that if
if you're listening to this later you're
not watching us live I strongly
recommend that you watch the video
version of this podcast yeah not just
listen to the audio version because the
images of lad that are going up on the
site as he speaks are stupendous because
if anybody's getting hazed here I really
think it's vlad and not me which is
which is hysterical I think we're my
burrow Maggie City segment or aspect of
my show just no video feed from Vlad
just pictures and I just I just released
biceps of air biceps um do we want to
talk about the these rumored galaxy note
2 specs I mean they're pretty much in
line with the stuff that we've heard
before and looking like a 5.5 inch
screen and you know the rest is you know
1280 by 720 3g and 4g radios and a 1.4
gigahertz quad-core Exynos processor
none of that is strikingly different
from you know sort of where we thought
they were headed so it's probably I mean
we're going to know for really real as
soon as samsung announces it and like
I'm the resident like stylist fanatic
but for some reason maybe it's the the
fact that the you know we saw the the
note 10.1 review from Neil I I'm just
not excited about the note 2 at all you
know I wasn't a believer in the original
note and say I also prove me wrong by
selling millions and millions of them
the note to like I just I have a hard
time believing that anybody is waiting
for this device so the specs are told
how many symbols me but that there is
one thing that I want to point out which
that we're hearing all this talk we and
we've talked about recently on the show
we're hearing all this talk about
devices getting this 5 inch LG 1080p
display possibly prevent of the year I
think there were some HTC rumors
recently so that really makes this
galaxy note 2 potentially look lame
pretty fast if it's coming to market
with a 5.5 inch 720p at the same time
that we're seeing device 5-inch 1080p
screens on the market so that that's one
thing to consider yeah I was going to
say I'm in the same boat as the SD to
read so far as yes I find the specs
perfectly in line with the galaxy s free
and perfectly in line with world samsung
has churning out of its other vertical
companies so it makes sense and I
respect and I was also in agreement with
detail when it comes to him about the
original Galaxy Note I mean I was he
ready for when the original Galaxy Note
launched and to me it was a case of the
guys step 7.7 is an amazing device and
this galaxy note thing is a gimmick and
I was like okay they're really trying to
push the note to us but the tab 7.7 is
the thing that I find exciting
interesting so the first way the first
thing to say is samsung mobile pack
tomorrow need not only be about the
galaxy note 2 there may be other devices
that we just completely no heard about
that's one thing the second though is
that evidently whatever market there is
for these notes is I mean the terrible
pong coming up I apologize in advance
but it's so striking the right note with
us but it is with a whole bunch of other
people and my theory only theory is if
you look at like seven inch tablets like
the original Galaxy Tab if you look at
the net Nexus 7 and then consider
shrinking that down to like 5.3 5.5
inches the no form factor maybe that
makes sense to people whereas all of us
just keep considering the note in terms
of expanding a smartphone up whereas if
you think I'm 7 inch tablet which is
kind of a one-hand device and then
shrink it down stick a stylus on it
maybe dusty people I i took that
argument or looked at that argument when
no first came out and the problem that I
came up with was the like the Nexus 7
runs tablet software with tablet apps
the note does not the note runs phone
software with phone apps and there's a
couple well hey gasps there's a couple
of unique apps from Samsung that's
pretty low
but like for instance if you were to
grab you know or just look at the gmail
app the gmail app is the phone version
instead of the to paint tablet version
so I that's why I think we think a lot
of it as it's a phone going up to a 5.3
or 5.5 inch screen as instead of a
tablet coming down to that size then the
other thing that I kind of have a theory
about is that it's a very popular device
but Samsung's not saying we're all those
sales are happening I think it's really
popular among Asian cultures because the
stylus makes it really easy to input
their languages and their characters
that's not really it's a lot harder to
write in English on it with a stylus
than it is say Korean or Japanese or
something like that yeah I mean the
thing much I don't forget but the note
is I desperately want it to be awesome
for a whole bunch of apps so stylus
support and every time I go and try it
it's just not there and so maybe you're
right that it's just like the the
default use case of it for inputting you
know language is what's making it so
popular but I have to disagree with you
about the nexus 7 running tablet apps
because I I use nexus 7 every day and
like ninety percent of the apps are
basically just blown up phone apps it's
just less annoying because it's only a
7-inch tablet like the android tablet
still just isn't there yeah i mean that
that problem is that but that's an
android tablet problem but like if you
look at google's apps like the gmail app
there's a separate tablet version versus
the phone version because you get to
pains with the tablet version a little
bit different UI that takes a better
advantage of the larger screen yeah i
wish they would do the same thing with
their google reader app because oh my
god no google reader does does have a
different tablet UI than it does on the
phone if you flip a if you flip
landscape you get more you get a to pain
view uh really yeah okay i'm gonna try
it no i don't know if that you got on
the nexus s concert theater you just got
well i always use it in Lance Aaron
portrait right and it's completely
annoying I wish it had to pain in
portrait because that's how i'd like to
read because i need you know
volume of headlines um yeah i don't know
i mean the note it's just not a new
thing anymore right and so i don't know
if it's going to catch people's
attention the way that the first one did
against all odds but you know i have to
like i said at the outset i have to
admit that it could and that I'm you
know being a skeptic for skeptics sake
instead of not actually you know
believing ah do we want I what the S
three colors i want to point out that
the brown one looks really cool to me
and i totally would buy a brown galaxy
s3 yeah I kind of love it as would I
yeah the brown is gorgeous the brown is
absolutely fantastic so the only
question is which US carrier or carriers
plural are going to carry which of those
colors because I'm sure that there was
some consternation on the part of
verizon and others that 18t picked up an
exclusive color so I just wondered who's
going to bite yeah I can't read right
yes 1818 to you got the red eye could
see a US carrier picking up the black or
the what do they call it graphite gray
or something like that I find it really
hard to believe that any US carriers
gonna pick up the brown as depressing as
that sounds I just can't see it I also
just to mention that there is no red
galaxy s free I just walking down the
record there is a burgundy guys get free
which is so closely that I don't
understand any self-respecting
heterosexual male using it it just looks
like a lipstick all over but there is no
red galaxy s frame would also do they
call it go hours or something yeah
that's like you know I mean they're
brown is amber brown amber is not brown
they're just different colors man and
get give it a program and also I have no
idea what the brown one looks like
because I was on the flight when Samson
said to announce this thing so I'm just
taking your word for it it's gorgeous so
it's it's a glossy now touch it someone
I'm sure touch tomorrow somewhere yeah
I'm
wait for Matt well Samson needs to go to
Matt yo that would be one table well
they should just they should just sell
the backplates individually you know and
they could they could mark it up three
hundred percent and I would you know I
would buy like four different colors you
know just have a black front and then
different colors for the back plate I
would be all over that but they're not
there and that's soup are you talking
about Matt back plates any back plates
but we I don't know why civically when
you start mixing when you start mixing
to see this was this is what was great
about dumb phones back in the day is
that you know like the Nokia Xpress on
covers like it would it would replace
the entire case and that entire concept
is basically gone now right and and I
guess it's partially replaced by the
fact the people just you know the
majority of people seem to get some sort
of protective case with their with their
phone and that's what they use to
customize and style they're at their
device but if you want to style the case
it's like the actual phone case itself
that I mean that concept is just gone
well oh hey that was a nice podcasted
sorry glad news so news broke looks like
Isis is going to be debuting its mobile
payment solution in September possibly
they're gonna they're going to introduce
in salt lake city in austin texas next
month according to a verifone CEO which
so verra phone is going to be providing
that payment terminals and it looks like
they're definitely you know gonna be
requiring NFC which is I don't know I
feel like NFC shouldn't be a requirement
for this sort of thing there should be
some sort of you know backup option
because there's just not that many NFC
phones out there but we're finally going
to see Isis actually happen all these
carriers working together it's actually
like a real thing I feel I got is
amazing for like forever it we have been
but i've been using i've been using
google wallet that you know the latest
version of google wallet on the Galaxy
Nexus is
good enough now and you know you can add
all your cards to it so that it's you
know I'm just happy with the way it
works I don't need anything else I I
want everybody else to stop development
efforts on mobile payments I'm done this
is good everybody has a PayPass terminal
I have my phone I'm happy dude you're
one of like 80 people that lives that
life nobody has Google Wallet a few
people didn't have access to Google
Wallet on whatever their devices don't
know that they can use it it's like you
are the one percent of the one percent
that has a mobile payment solution
that's reached some level of ubiquity
and actually know was that they use it
and actually uses it dude it's like you
and one other guy that's your the other
guy you are the other guy dieter no i'm
not i don't have Google Wallet on my
phone but to chris's point you know if
developments east on the other things
and you know Google Wallet was able to
be brought to more devices then you know
more people would have it instead of
just kind of like this mishmash of
various protocols and standards and all
this other nonsense so you know
everybody wants to throw their hat in
now we actually got an email to a mobile
podcast email address which is pretty
amazing a mobile show at the verge calm
pointing out that NFC isn't actually
necessary to mobile payments that Apple
solutions passbook and we just turn you
know looks like NFC is not likely to get
in the next iPhone that there'll be some
other you know way of doing it and that
we don't need a single universal
standard we just need all the different
standards to work together and there's a
little bit of hope for that since
there's that mobile payment committee
that Isis and Google and everybody else
are all part of now but I still am NOT
optimistic it's going to happen you know
in short order i think you know we
talked about this a million times and
it's whatever Apple decides on that's
going to become the de facto standard
what I mean google wallet is progressing
they you know will let any card in now
and I guess they're going to add loyalty
passes and
uh you know loyalty cards and ids and
whatever to it so it's opening up a bit
to look a bit more like pay pass on an
iOS so like these things are all
starting to offer all the features that
they need to the one feature that they
don't have is anybody using them except
for Chris I'm I'm using it and that's
all that matters there are mobile
payment systems that are used like every
day all the time but there's different
starbucks right yeah square starbucks
they're limited to those proprietary
systems right and of course I just kept
call me when is widespread whatever it
is whether it's a mishmash like these in
Muscat just call me when he's wise bread
I'll join in until then just it's just
noise its corporate noise to me okay
thank you what call me when it will work
on any phone without verizon or you know
some carrier or Isis deciding which
phones are going to have it call me when
it's not a differentiating feature for a
phone and when it's just the standard on
a phone when I buy a phone I know that
mobile payments will work on it whether
it's Android or iOS right or Tizen or
whatever hopefully I lovely oh man never
but I'm gonna have to call you from
Europe if you don't have verizon Regency
involvement it's gonna have to come from
Europe really what we're waiting for is
we're waiting for it to reach the you
know Bluetooth ubiquity Bluetooth
exactly the same on every single phone
no matter which one you buy these days
now Vlad i do want to point out that
AT&amp;amp;T because i've seen it on google
street view before AT&amp;amp;T for some reason
has an office building in belgium I've
seen it and I feel like it's some sort
of like super secret skunk works like in
all the stuff that they don't want any
anything anybody to know anything about
they do in Belgium and then they import
it to the US but I prefer to go Jim to
investigate that anomaly I mean then
again vodafone has an office in silicon
valley so i guess it's not that strange
no i think it strange i think i need to
travel over there and try out some of
the boat
and delicacies on our way there and just
you know really digging into that story
sure sure I think you have a report
bring but now I mean let you know mobile
payments I mean we've talked about this
ad nauseam over the past few months but
the the problem with them which is never
going to really get resolved to
anybody's satisfaction is the fact there
are too many people who want their palms
greased to make it happen right first
and foremost the carriers which is why
Isis exists in the first place Isis
would not exist if it were not for the
fact that three of the four US Nationals
believe that they are entitled to a
percentage of this of this you know what
they perceive to be a a an entire new
economy waiting to happen in fact really
they have absolutely nothing to do with
it other than the fact they are selling
phones so if it were up to me carriers
would not even I mean it it's almost a
net neutrality thing right like carriers
really should have absolutely nothing to
do with this mobile payment should be an
a it should be um you know some secure
hardware on the phone it should be an
app that you can download from any
market and that's it that there are
enough people involved in making these
transactions happen securely as it is
without the carrier is getting involved
so to me Isis is I'd like lat said Isis
is noise and they have absolutely no
business being involved in this next
topic I love that it we you know close
this one nicely let's next up sorry I
had to move and close the window it is
in ridiculously insanely hot in San
Francisco today and so I had the window
open and there is a truck backing up
outside my building which is in a
perpetual state of construction which is
awesome next topic we finally have got a
Nikon announcing the s800c which is an
android-powered camera and Samsung is
also rumored to be introducing a galaxy
camera at Aoife and I am wondering why
it's taken this long for this to happen
it seems like a really natural thing to
just
you know have the cool photo apps that
run on these platforms well maybe i
think i had but i think i have the
obvious answer which is that with you
know with like proprietary firmware
camera manufacturers are able to i mean
it's it's almost like the nasa argument
right we're like you know if you if you
develop your own proprietary forum where
you can do it very tightly and in a very
very small amount of rom and and the the
UI is fast you know exact you know it's
um it's what's what's the term it's
formally verified so that you know
exactly what's going to happen in every
possible use case because they're firmer
thank you that much whereas you know
with android it opens up a potential can
of worms and it becomes a much bigger
project to to test this firmware and
test the camera in the same way into the
same degree that you would a traditional
like closed system so i think i think
this this cool pics actually boots up
into something proprietary so that it
can just start taking pictures right
away while android gets you know
finished loading in the background so in
Justin you know so just in case android
is taking too long it'll let you get
your big pictures right away and then
it'll let you jump into android specific
stuff once it's ready and as clever as
that is it's kind of messed up that they
have to do that yeah well yeah like but
yeah but I mean this was always the idea
with Android right like it's an open
system that anybody can use to slap into
anything you know we were expecting to
see you know consoles and cars and now
cameras and I don't know toasters or
whatever running this OS because it's
open source you could just plug it into
anything and like we really haven't seen
it be like you know it could have you
know replaced win siiii in in some cases
i mean i guess it's not really exactly
the same thing as that but i would have
expected more consumer electronics to be
running android like I'm still livid
that there are a lot of very good after
my
get android-based car stereos for
example so like putting it in a camera
makes really good sense to me just
because there are photo apps that you'd
want to have to react have direct access
to good lens and so this make sense like
I I would I don't know if I buy this but
I buy into the idea of android running
on a camera I mean Dan am I crazy I mean
you're you're more of a camera dude than
me no I I think that you know just like
you said the ideas is great I don't know
if this particular model is the answer I
would I think I feel like I would love
to have this on a higher-end camera
maybe that you know could really some
person that's using a higher-end camera
can maybe really take advantage of the
connectivity of Wi-Fi and things like
that and the various android apps that
they could upload it to you know a
dropbox account or something like that
very quickly and easily if they're
working with a team you know things like
that that really would make it quite
awesome because when i look at this like
this particular device you're paying 350
bucks for a hundred fifty dollar camera
to get the android functionality and i
don't know how many you know people that
would be normally be buying this camera
would buy into that yeah else to me they
were kind of hedging their bets a little
bit and saying well we're gonna we're
gonna try this but we're gonna start
with uh you know as a mid-range camera
and if it works out maybe we'll expand
it to the rest of the range cuz i
totally agree again if they had been
able to do this in a cool way on the p
7700 oh yeah then then that would be a
different story but i'll know if you
guys remember kodak uh didn't try to do
something like this like a decade ago
they had um they were using there was a
third party company whose name escapes
me that developed a camera an open
camera OS and I think codec was only
major OEM to use it but it had app that
you could install it was like a whole
thing and I mean it was still it wasn't
anything like truly open it wasn't like
an Android kind of thing but it was you
know as a platform that you could
actually pay to get a you know get
access to the API within the develop
apps for it and it just kind of died off
but at the time I thought it was a
really cool idea for the for all the
same reasons you could have your own
uh you know your own filters that you
add and all these things and now that
you know the objects are much better the
electronics are so much faster I'm
pretty excited about what this means for
the future of cameras and it really kind
of validates that the whole nokia
pureview way of thinking which is that
camera phones and point-and-shoots have
gotten so close to converging on each
other's territories that they're just
about the same thing out and that's 800
is I mean it's bit for all practical
purposes it's a it's a camera phone
without the GSM radio right which is
what i was saying over the past few
weeks is what the peer review should
have been they should just taken out the
gsm radio I'm not actually ever I'm not
telling Chris somebody on Twitter a
couple of months ago maybe pointed out
to me that two years ago while writing
for engadget i wrote a post where I
rather mockingly addressed what aunty
van jockey who was still one of the
leading guys at nokia said he said that
this allows are soon going to be
obviated by camera phones which you know
24 years ago whenever that post went up
and whenever an sees words were spoken
did seem like a really absurd thing to
say and I still feel like these of us
have a role to play there synthesizes
cannot be duplicated you know I mean the
other way POV tries and look at how
thick of a phone it is even though as
you say it's more of a camera than a
phone at this point but definitely a
severe shock his words were informed by
the technology the POV technology which
was now seeing in the market way back
then and his vision is one that as you
say Chris a lot of people share a lot of
people want to see come to fruition in
some sort of a mentally compromised way
where you see where you get something
approximating DSLR color quality while
bringing it together with what then was
saying the app ecosystem of a fully
developed software platform like Android
and this is over that is bug me for the
longest
which is a camera software is just
really really dumb it's like Oh bad
there are two aspects of it like one is
there's a really clever stuff which is
auto focus in judging the proper
distance and metering which sometimes is
really perfect and sometimes it's
horrible again so like these these
cleverly automations of processes and
the speed of which are they're done so
that you press the shutter and all these
automatic fingers kick off and do their
job those are doesn't really like the
indistinguishable from magic kind of
software technologies the camera makers
is a great credit for but then when it
comes to the software that you interact
with as a user the UX of cameras and is
absolutely utterly atrocious and this
displays that pad they've grown they've
increase in resolution and it just being
wasted I mean we're looking at something
that would be embarrassing for
blackberry to toe tap you know just text
your menus and then nightmarish and
they're written by people whose native
languages and even English I mean it's
it's just it's just a train wreck it's
horrible and absolutely nicole has
nothing to lose in just you know dumping
Android on one of these cameras and
saying hey guys it's an Android camera
honestly I'm kind of disappointed in
everybody else that they didn't beat
nickel to this because of this point
issue that nickel is bringing out is
running Gingerbread and yeah let's go
even mediocre specs as far as the phone
aspect goes so am ii it doesn't excite
me as much as the idea well I mean we
kept on excites me this particular one
doesn't yeah that's important thing is
that there be there be api's for all
these these settings that you that you
talk about the camera needs to be open
to having Android apps be able to adjust
all the different settings that there
are on a modern DSLR and you know if
someone were just like publish a spec or
not gonna tell you like here's all here
it is it's Android we slapped it on to a
camera but now here you can write an app
here's all the stuff that were opening
up we've done a couple of things I think
people would really go crazy on that and
you could you could write a lot of
really interesting
you know apps to control the camera and
do interesting things as long as the
android OS has got full access to all
the settings on the camera yeah and you
know this is that one's going on here
the only company at this point that can
do this thing and do it justice and I'm
kind of surprised to be saying it is
Samson so this rumored Samsung camera
phone with android has good potential
and the reason for that is Samsung is
already making lenses for its mirrorless
cameras so even though camera lenses are
a really new thing for samsung the
couple is I mean it's partnered with
some lines of acres so other optics
makers come remember the name of the
company this point but it has some
experience of building lenses that
sounds the building cameras and I
experience is growing and it absolutely
has the hardware that can underpin a
really really appealing camera phone but
as I say this nickel one is great on
paper but it doesn't excite me is an
actual product at the end it is just so
much room for somebody to do something
better and just like create their own
market like this is this is what Apple
does write like this room for device
this room for something new and an apple
takes it and then suffocates the hell
out of everybody else but I really
believe that Android is the great
platform the public platform to do this
which rules up well and as sounds like
as a big player but then everybody else
doesn't need to be sleeping like sony
has a press conference tomorrow why do
they give us one of these things mean
we're gonna go gaga I know Bruce Miller
just like you know he's gonna rip the
show off his back he's gonna go nuts you
say you sony does something like this
but do you remember glad i don't know
well any of you guys i don't know if you
remember this but when sony first day
bude the vita which was not called the
vita at the time it was whatever the
original term before it was uh thing
yeah yes thank you
they said that the herb maybe this was
actually this actually happened after
that but regardless they said that they
could repurpose the Vita OS for other
devices now i don't know if that
philosophy of that guidance has changed
as sony has kind of metamorphosed in the
past few months but that's something to
consider as well I wouldn't be surprised
to see Sony try to do something with a
you know I'm sure that it continues to
rub Sony the wrong way we and sony has
always taken pride in creating its own
proprietary you know accessories every
standards and platforms yeah and and and
I'm sure that they would love to get
back to their former glory to the point
where they can do that and get away with
it and maybe Vito as part of that
strategy I think that's a long shot but
we could always bring them uh just real
quick I do want to point out that the
sam byford has put together a really
nice roundup of all the next iphone /
iphone 5 rumors all in one place so you
can see everything the larger screen the
smaller dock connector the slightly
changed design all together in one place
and it's really funny that like we're
you know we're talking about you know
Aoife we've got all these different
announcements that are coming up we've
got a whole bunch of stuff next is it
next week already that we're gonna have
motorola and nokia oh my god yeah i am
moving way too fast and so we're sort of
like just in the run-up to this thing
getting announced but like does anybody
feel like there's something we don't
know about the the next iphone at this
point like are there any like we know by
and large what iOS 6 is going to look
like we've got enough parts leaks to put
together a whole phone we know that the
screen and the dock connector and like I
I don't feel like there's anything that
is going to really surprise me right now
I mean I'm under estimating Apple that
the romantic uh tech nerd inside of me
really
wants to believe that Apple has been
fleecing the entire world for the past
several months and has been seating us
with fake parts and is going to just
completely blow everyone away with some
some totally different design in in
September but I just don't see how
that's remotely possible i think that
the reality is that they have been
thoroughly scooped and are probably not
too happy about it and are kind of
resigned to the reality that this is
just how the world works now and it is
basically impossible to keep stuff
secret and you know what that says to me
that says that the phrase double down
officially means we're not going we're
not going to do it we're going to fail
at it anytime anybody ever says I'm
going to double down on X what that
means is i'm going to utterly fail to
achieve X it's just like in real
blackjack we're double doubling down is
very rarely the right move wasn't it
every person read is the said rim would
double down likes everyone has said
everyone has said they're going to
double down on something at this yelling
right but i love it i double down on
secrecy I mean it's like it's it's the
kiss of death if a CEO says Double Down
it's all over I know whatever it is mr.
fetus was the guy who said that tone it
would be so perfect if he was indeed the
first CEO to start talking about
doubling down because what is followed
since then it's just excellent he's just
like uh who was it um it was dumb money
John Rubik's gene was it him or or was
it uh what's his name the other HP guy
the expo Ithaca know Oh badly tog rappy
yes uh Bradley out one of those guys
said that they were doubling down on oh
yeah my parade Mike heard up the guy got
five markered I think mark hurd yeah but
it could be right by the way it is I
think it's a dad yeah
uh I guess as long as we're talking
about Apple we should also mention that
they basically won the case against
Samsung the the big court case in San
Jose there's of course other ones coming
and this is gonna there's going to be an
appeal and there might be an injunction
on the galaxy s2 and we don't need to go
deeply into this because there's a whole
special edition verge cast that was done
basically live as as you know the
verdict was coming in actually literally
like as the final verdict came in they
were already doing the podcast because
there had to be a couple little
corrections to it but I mean you know
it's a mobile show bears on mobile it's
interesting I think the fact that we're
going to see some possibly someone
junctions on the galaxy s2 that might be
uh you know a real world effect on this
but I mean I think Samsung had already
sort of changed its game so I don't see
you know I don't see this exact sort of
case playing out again over and over and
over again you know the Apple just going
after every Android manufacturer with
the exact same stuff I think they felt
Samsung as a special case now just a
note that we deserve special credit for
going for most of this podcast without
banging on it on about this lawsuit
because I pretty much guarantee you that
makes us unique in this week's video
audio any sort of industry commentary
because everybody has some sort of
opinion some sort of an angle I've
actually read somebody right it's too
early to describe Samsung as clear-cut
winners of this like something was so
convinced that Samsung one just by being
associated with Apple's products which
is some validity and you know for a lot
of people the effect of this lawsuit is
going to be just glancing over the
headlines and saying the samsung is
having to pay damages for essentially
copying Apple hardware and a lot of
people go to start doing the math in
there
and well doing the maths in their head
for a UK business yeah it's topically
hey hey I'm a second these guys are
producing macbook airs and what not and
you know I phones slightly different but
not differ enough not to be legal and
the G put on the iphone Obama be ripped
off by Apple I'll just going by the
cheaper stuff but I don't know I know
how much of an impact is gonna have on
Samson's business I don't think that's
going to be significant in fact also I
think to a great degree it has been
overblown and this being a great degree
of our reaction to how much of an impact
the ruling itself is going to have
another samsung business because as ET
were just mentioning if Apple gets an
injunction against the galaxy s2 what
does that match the samsung samsung is
heavy heavily trying to seven promote
the galaxy as free it's not even her
trust boost mobile but yeah this is a
little bit of sake um Sam so i'm not
selling anymore galaxy s2 from this day
forth until the end of the world is not
even going to be a rounding error a
currency you know I don't know if I
probably agree with that though because
I think Samsung easily positions the
galaxy s2 as a you know entry-level
model compared to the galaxy s3 just
like Apple does with last year's iPhone
4 that's still selling for a hundred
bucks if you look at the US carriers at
least every single one of them that
carry the galaxy s2 still carries the
galaxy s2 and they run deals where it's
like buy one get one free and it's a
hundred bucks instead of being 200 or
250 you know so there's a huge market
for that you know one hundred dollar
price point smartphone level and if
you're going to buy the samsung line no
doesn't see and actually the other thing
is like it would have been Samsung's
high-margin product you know it's that
they've been making it for a long time
it's the best selling Android variant
Android handset of all time as far as I
can tell and so they would have been
able to just you know keep trying it out
as you know by last year's model still
quite good and it's you know a little
bit cheaper but
I mean how much will it affect Samsung
you know in the US because i don't think
the galaxy s2 took the US by storm
because there are all these different
variants and so there is less of a
cohesive sets of branding to it maybe I
push my point a little bit too far to
the extreme but what the Jessamine so
that the entire impact of the lawsuit
including the damages including
potential from lost sales a due to
potential injunction from Apple coming
further than the line in September it
would be something like four percent of
Samsung revenue that's so much of a
thing Samsung might take whereas in the
first day of trading immediately after
the judgment samsung stop price fell by
ten percent which is you know there's a
potential impact potential like an
absolute max a four percent of the
samsung's annual revenue whereas the
company is at a price fell by
temperature so people clearly
overreacted and the other thing to say
is it's somebody tweeted this and it was
pretty much perfect perfectly spot on
and the tweet was unlike everybody else
with Twitter this weekend I am not
actually a patent law expert yes if
everybody has some freaking
interpretation and some freaking
forecast about this fact whereas the
only thing we really really know for
sure is that the lawyers on either side
have one massively and will continue to
win like they'll have generations in
their families secured because of this
crazy crazy losing above all my might be
ques- out of this is what is Apple going
to do with this dude is Apple think that
it has like a I don't know about a moral
authority but like if they've got a you
know a what's the word with with
elections when someone wins by a
landslide they've got the people behind
them they've got a mandate it I'm so
hopped up on sudafed right now I don't
know the mainland and a mandate like
they have a mandate to go out and file
similar lawsuits and go after everybody
or if this was
sort of a one-off thing to set an
example of Samsung and you know they're
going to deal with their other lawsuits
with motorola and HTC and where else it
is that they're suing but like now that
they've won this they can start wrapping
up and start getting the settlements in
motion and we they will act with this
lease Apple will absolutely continue to
pursue litigation against a variety of
OEMs leading eventually to Google proper
ad nauseum mark my words they they're
not going to stop they are going to I
mean they are taking a jobs famous
statement that you know he's going to
spend every last dime of apples bearing
Android it that they're taking that as
gospel and they're going to continue to
pursue it doggedly to the ends of the
earth I'm absolutely convinced and and
I'm not saying that I disagree I mean I
think that Apple made many excellent
points during this this Samsung trial
and I can't say that I really agree with
many aspects of the verdict but that's
not to say that that every single a
lawsuit that Apple has filed around the
world has been completely reasonable and
we don't know what forms those lawsuits
are going to take going forward by the
way I just want to point something out
which I don't think Apple realizes and
it this just occurred to me but I was
doing some research while you guys were
talking the droid charge the the samsung
droid charge for verizon is one of the
devices that that that Apple is
attempting to get an injunction against
which I I mean I don't even know verizon
still sells it right it's actually my
early right on the front page of raw if
you go to verizon's website it was
highlighted are you serious yeah it's
like that's hilarious free on contract
right there trying to move stock before
it gets injunctive me let me
double-check that but yeah well so US
cellular is really going to hate me for
pointing this out but the the Galaxy S
aviator is basically the droid charge
and Apple failed to take notice of it so
Apple just FYI you might want to get an
injunction against the aviator as well
because the aviator is definitely still
very much for sale on us tell you
well so I mean thank you for if I'm
Samsung do I say oh well I can't sell
the galaxy s2 I'm going to change one
thing about it and give it another
ridiculous crazy name and start selling
it again and it'll take apple two years
to get around to getting an injunction
on this like that's one of the apples
big complaints is like they hate doing
these lawsuits because they can't you
know get them through the court system
fast enough to have a real effect on
sales you know so I mean like I yeah I
just don't see Samsung significantly
changing their game I think they already
have and we saw with the galaxy s3 yeah
I think that long term it works out to
it works out to a mandated royalty rep
which is what frankly I've been
advocating all along where Apple's just
going to continue but potentially could
continue to win these kinds of lawsuits
for decades to come every few years and
they just pocket a billion or two and it
works out to being a force royalty on
these patents that they hold well let's
also kind of try and differentiate and
split them out a little bit the first
thing is that Samsung is ruled to have
infringed on software patents or runs on
one side and the same rights on the
other side and the point of data raised
about the galaxy is to rename it give it
a new design and style setting it again
well you know if that would be facetious
with that by the way I was that's fair
enough actually like if if the guy says
to offends the design rights of the
iphone and you tweak its design where
are you offending this side like that I
mean Apple can't get this through the
cause because then it's like what are
you suing for now now you're just suing
for the fact that Samsung is selling
phones we no longer look like your phone
but you know the most significant ones
and a more intriguing ones I think are
the software patents you know things
like pinch to zoom what was it the
bounce back when you're scrolling and
there's one other one there were three
major ones pre-major software betas
time to the bridge captain zoom bounce
and pages and I I'm forgetting a third
of my P yeah it's it's not quite
pinch-to-zoom it's like the instance
before you get to pinch to zoom
recognizing two fingers versus one
finger something like that Neela I can
explain that way better than I can but
it's not Neela is very adamant in saying
that it's not pinch to zoom but it's one
of the steps before pinch to zoom and
I'm very anime same I really don't give
a um no seriously it's like on the one
hand I feel like these things shouldn't
be playing civ words oh and all of their
countries that don't have software
Peyton systems in place it at oh and for
whatever reason software still be made
in those countries like people must be
crazy or hooked up on something but ok
so that's one aspect but then on the
other hand I just kind of feel like well
you know things like pinch to zoom or
the moment before pinch-to-zoom that
moment of anticipation can we recreate
it in other ways and the perfect example
of me is the scroll back bounce right
the one that you have are so familiar
iOS yes it works great and it looks
great and it's really functional but
there are so many other ways in which
you can be creative and inventive and
not copy it and a great one for me and
this is probably the only thing I'm
going to praise about HTC Sense for is
the weather AC does it there and it's
the same way that so many does it with a
PS Vita it's just the way that the items
on screen the list items just kind of
stretch out and and then it just
collapsed again kind of in an accordion
sort of way it's very natural is very
instinctive it conveys the exactly same
as at the same point thing we know it's
gone does that as well right I'll i love
the way windows phone does it the square
and yeah yeah we're just follows yeah
squishing rather than pinching it's you
it's crazy conversation we're having yes
they the same message but differently
and also whole point of creativity well
do it evo not even though i hate the
software patent system I just feel like
these companies
lazy if they are literally just going to
copy Apple well to do so if you look at
the the grid we had a post earlier today
about the the changes that says
Samsung's making to the software of the
phones that are supposedly infringed or
have found to infringe and if you look
at the grid of the patents that were
infringed there are certain phones that
infringe all three software patents and
then like a slightly newer phone that
doesn't infringe any of them because
Samsung had already worked around and
figured out a workaround for the the
bounce back and this pre pinch-to-zoom
and the double tap to zoom so it's
there's definitely like you were saying
there's definitely workarounds available
and on those devices where the work
round was implemented from day one I
don't recall anybody complaining from
the phone's launch that it didn't have
those particular features exactly the
same as an older Samsung phone maybe the
bounce back people certain people didn't
miss that but I don't think the other
ones were terribly missed yeah i will
say that HTC's work around in the sense
for for for the bounce I just can't
stand it where it separates all the
items in the list like like the kind of
accordion down and then they could
reconnect back up together I just I
could I never liked it i it always
looked terrible to me III line I like
the windows phone one the best that's my
favorite the squish yeah windows phone
looks good even stock Android the way it
does it with like the global the yeah
the glow I don't like that because it
feels like you're coming to a hard stop
like you're scrolling and then yeah it's
best tracks I like it's like living with
with the glow yeah you're scrolling and
like where you move effects what's
happening on the screen that all sudden
that stops working it's like wha so I
mean so I mean apples implementation of
it is really really good and so you can
see why it's tempting to copy it because
it it lets it still feel tactile but
also like it shows you it's at the end
and so I mean the way the way android
doesn't what the glow is fine it's just
sort of aggravating if you if the glow
should like grow down as you move your
fingers so there's still some tactile
response or visible response if you
really love that bounce back
feature ironically the Firefox browser
for Android whatever the latest versions
are has bounced back all over it no
matter if you're the ICS or jelly bean
or an older version of Android and I
have no idea how Mozilla gets away with
that because it's like very obvious
bounce back and to the side and
everything like that that's just
something I observed yeah I get to use
if I I haven't used firefox on mobile in
a long long time so maybe i'll check it
out um do we want to talk about these uh
there's a cup we usually skip these uh
like company a patented feature X and
what does it mean because you never
really know how long it'll be before our
patent turns into something but Nokia
got a couple of patents on designs that
look like unreleased nokia phones
basically there's the Lumia arrow which
looks like a mid-range or maybe a
low-end phone like looks basically like
an iteration on the 610 and then there's
a the fee or is it the Phi pH I how
would that be pronounced I mention pi
phi probably five which looks like a
basically a very slightly iterated
version of the the 900 is it even an
iterated yeah it's a slightly iterative
version of the 900 it most amazingly
stations the colonel is Peggy edge
that's it yeah yes yes and and that is
big people are expecting it to be 4.7
inches inside so like a big one yeah I
mean what is the problem the problem
that Nokia is going to have here as much
as I continue to love this industrial
design that this this design DNA for
them the problem they are going to have
with consumers is that they have now
been exposed to the 900 in the u.s. I'm
talking about of course they've never
exposed to the 900 for several months
this new device is going to come in say
october november so or in that time
frame it's going to be on AT&amp;amp;T shells
looking basically the same as the 900
how do you convince people who've been
around the 18 teapot folia for a while
that this is a genuinely and thoroughly
new device I don't know how you
municate that to them well it tied the
child's man tiny little tiles oh wait no
that'll look like that on the the
current phones as well I mean apples got
the same problem between the four in the
4s I mean yeah but the difference is
that every single person tech sep we are
not in the United States knows exactly
what iphone is i mean i get i get text
messages from my least tech-savvy
friends but i can make fun of on this
show because they definitely don't
listen to me hey i get text messages
from them saying when is the next iPhone
coming out because they they like the
iphone is pop culture right it's not
it's not even talk anymore it's just pop
culture no it's not true so so does not
have that vonage little point of order
since we've got into the judicial sphere
today earlier on you said mark my words
I don't think we need to do that because
you marked him yourself we're hanging on
disabled oh yes this is true yes but
besides that I mean perfect example
exactly what you're saying Chris on my
flight over from London today some guy
dropped his phone on the take off and it
brought back and this girl tried to pick
it up but it kept rolling back any role
on way to the air hostesses and she said
to him he was about to get up why would
the plane was taken off she said to him
no no it's fine they have your iphone
and it struck me that she didn't say
they have your phone she just saw a
rolling thing falling down the aisle and
she knew it was an iphone and that's
exactly to your point it's it's beyond
just being a brand and the unjust being
apples product it's it's a thing now
it's like a whole other category phone
so yes just because it looks like the
old iphone does really matter to a book
but it might matter to knock it okay be
right on differentiate yeah I can see
that point I think it matters more to
nokia that it does to apple right uh for
the reasons you guys have all stated
basically now what they can do is offer
some hot new colors give me my orange
a bruh man I'm telling you my burnt
sienna orangewood I hundred be hot yeah
or it would be pretty great I would even
take the what the amber brown I forget
what the the color was the brown samsung
actually know a brown lumia 900 would
look pretty terrible now that I think it
would the only the only way Brown works
is if it's double shot like the old zune
or if its way they can do something like
with with the brushed look or something
but yeah Matt Brown is just not good it
would look like not good at all a
chocolate bar you um yeah but the leak
for this knock if I was of it with a
yellow outfit yep and we've already
discussed how Nokia be inspired by the
CMYK color palette in the fact that it
already has cyan magenta and black for
homes as I have a yellow one why doesn't
have a yellow one yada yada yada but the
latest leaked the one that we've seen
and the one that seems have been
confirmed by referring sense of the
nokia fine was it with a yellow outfit
so if you're into yellow you can get
excited I don't know great I mean we
will find out on the fifth and that will
be but the move it now the fifth we
talked about this last week is motorola
we're expecting what the razr HD
basically but then there's also now this
razor am which is like a mid-range II
kind of razor but it's qhd man at 4.3
ats island that's how that's pretty ugly
what's interested in the diac way is it
super amoled and which makes me think
that it's probably the same super amoled
screen that was in the razor and there
the razr maxx which was absolutely awful
display yeah okay i'm using it stop
begging on your end about it lasted have
you charged these black dude the razr
maxx with ice cream sandwich and that
crazy battery is a kick it's a killer
phone for a trade show like this because
i can't rely on
the 1x2 last beautiful day where is this
thing I can rely on it loud to last me
tomorrow there is something you can't
compete that I mean it's a bad display
yes but I can read stuff on it tell whoa
dude that's fine yeah I am jealous of
that battery and then the other
mid-range phone that we had rumored
actually more than the rumor this is a
exclusive to us was the ACC proto Chris
you want to talk about this I would be
honored and delighted to talk about the
HTC proto so so this is um this is a
device that bears a striking resemblance
to a phone that HTC released earlier
this year in China we wrote about it
richard lai of engadget china chinese is
actually the one who pointed this out to
me it's the T something something
something w and I wish I had a link to
give you guys right now I don't but
point is this this phone already exists
in China looks like they're expanding
its scope globally may or may not be
known as the desire x at this point
we're not sure but it's very much a
mid-range phone kind of in the same vein
as the 1v but without the chin and was
slightly upgraded specs looks like we're
looking at a 1 gigahertz dual-core
Snapdragon s4 you know like the s4 range
is very very broad and this is on the
lower end of the s4 line but it but
Qualcomm does technically categorize it
as an s4 so that's an upgrade from the
single core 1v this isn't going to
replace your 1x but it's a pretty smart
looking phone so we'll have to see how
it actually I'm guessing that we're
gonna see this editha and if not then
shortly thereafter sorry I was just a
diet see it's the new desire v that is
what they call it in China aka the HTC
vtt 328 t for china mobile rolls right
off the tongue that's sexy yeah it's
right out the time yep i will say i'm a
big fan of the vertical HTC logo on the
side of the phone instead of just
centered in the middle i think that
looks a lot cooler yeah much more than
fitting was there ascetic
I think yep great oh that's it boom so
let's get ready to see that one in the
next day or two I suspect yeah this is
this is what I'm going to do when we do
a video hands up that's how I'm going to
kick it up be a mid-range android again
yeah it's not Scott's gone Tenten
attends eka hands-on video just there
it's not stuff why do you thing is to me
ah oh if I laughs I'm going to hock hock
up along right now okay with that I
think it's time to end the Virgin Mobile
show it has been lovely having you all
with us if you want to follow us on
twitter you can we are at verge I am at
background Chris's at Z power vladas I'm
glad say Bob and Dan it was amazing
happy with us and as DC SI es a TI fer t
