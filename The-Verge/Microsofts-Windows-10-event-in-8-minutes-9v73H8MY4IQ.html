enables innovation across this broad
family of devices we were inspired to
bring more personal computing to the
home and the workplace to enable our
customers to do great things so I'm very
excited to announce that for the first
year after Windows 10 is available we
will be making available a free upgrade
to Windows 10 to all devices running
Windows 8.1 we will also be making
available a free upgrade to Windows 10
to all devices running Windows Phone 8.1
and last but not least for the first
year after Windows 10 is available we
will be making available a free upgrade
to all of our customers still running
Windows 7
in fact with Windows 10 we think of
Windows as a service are y'all ready
would you like to see a demo yes demo
yeah all right so for the first new
feature I'm gonna show I need a little
help I know she's here somewhere
luckily I can simply summon to the stage
hey Cortana
hey that's not news yet
just so you know I didn't say anything
yeah I wasn't suspecting you Cortana
we're excited to welcome you to the PC
alright hey Cortana what do you know
about me well I have my notebook so I
know what you know you've let me know
you know yes
exactly we wanted to educate Cortana
about PC kinds of things hey Cortana
show me PowerPoint slides about the
charity auction show me photos from
December no look at this I'm getting a
text right in the middle of my demo
that can't be a coincidence can it we're
gonna be doing work to detect these
skype capable endpoints and
automatically move to Skype so that
users get the richest possible messaging
experience using that will communicate
with the widest range of people we are
building a wide family of universal apps
that will roll round out the experience
on phones small tablets and PCs or Excel
and PowerPoint will be included in
Windows 10 on phones and small tablets
we think it's the right time to build a
new browser for the modern web which
will empower our next generation of
Windows users on Windows 10 so today I'm
excited to introduce you to code named
project Spartan it has a new look and
feel which you see on the screen that
it's fits right in with all this family
of Windows 10 applications this article
comes out you could imagine all of us
are simultaneously horrified and kind of
happy I saw this and I said ho ho baby
you know sometimes you guys don't get it
right but sometimes you do I can then
share that whole page or save that whole
page for myself with my markup and now I
have a
canvas for not only expressing my
thoughts on the web but for sharing them
with other people as well we also a
reading list right into the core
browsing experience and of course this
will show up on whatever device you have
we'll take the content in your reading
list and save it offline there is one
big app experience that I didn't talk
about will show you how gaming on
Windows 10 will be more social and
interactive by bringing together the
best of the games you love to play the
people you play with and the epic
moments they create all of this comes
together in the Xbox app on Windows 10
my friends list connects me to all my
friends by gamer tag wherever they are
and wherever I am messages keeps me in
touch across all Windows 10 devices Xbox
and the web and the heartbeat of Xbox
Live is the Activity Feed which lists
all the important gaming moments for me
and my friends as I'm able to voice chat
and text chat across platform with all
of my friends on Xbox Live I'm here to
announce that with Windows 10 we will
enable streaming of Xbox one games to
any Windows 10 PC or tablet in your home
later this year so we've built a new
device to unlock the power of the group
in a workplace I am delighted to
introduce you to the Microsoft Surface
hub this is an 84-inch 4k display with
integrated compute it has built-in
sensors that actually detected me when I
came to the screen we're dreaming beyond
virtual worlds beyond screens beyond
pixels and beyond today's digital
borders we're dreaming about holograms
mixing your world
welcome to Windows holographic we need a
more than just software to make
Holograms in our world a reality
I'm incredibly excited to introduce the
aircar soft hololens
hololens is real in this will be
available in the Windows 10 time frame
so we invented a third processor a
holographic processing unit the HPU
gives us the ability to understand what
you're looking to understand your
gestures to understand your voice it
gives us the ability to spatially math
the entire world around us and to run
without any wires all while processing
terabytes of information from all of
these sensors are you guys ready to see
your very first live holographic
experience all running on Windows 10 and
look how well in pantera is play nice
work Windows 10 Oh freaking hologram
with holostudio
anyone can create personalized speedy
creations in just minutes
as Lorene starts building you notice
that everything is as easy as tap then
gaze then tap again then go go with a
bright yellow put some of that here and
there get this right on top Oh too low
resize
what do you think Alex I'm getting a
good area 51 vibe this was made entirely
in holostudio
what do you think Lorraine sorry take it
for a spin do it ironically our windows
holographic laboratories are located
directly below this room in that very
secret space we've had the great honor
to partner with one of the most
innovative organizations in history our
plan is to deploy on-site to Mission
Operations this summer and to be
controlling Rovers on Mars with this
technology in July these are the kind of
magical moments that we live for these
are the experiences that make Windows 10
that more personal computing environment
that people are going to love</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
