Internet of Things is that normal stuff
is becoming Wi-Fi connected like this
Brita pitcher and this is a regular non
Wi-Fi connected dumb Brita pitcher and
it pretty much works the same that's not
true this one is smart and it's more
convenient I can't wait to hear about it
officially this is called the Brita
infinity smart water pitcher this is
just a Brita it holds 8 cups of water
this holds 10 and it has these
electronic light indicators on the top
here because Tec this one's pretty
low-tech and it still has a light
indicator on top ever the best part
about this one is that it's Wi-Fi
connected weight with Wi-Fi can do you
mean like WH Y as in Y Wi-Fi connected
because it works with Amazon's -
replenishment service oh you mean
Amazon's - buttons which are these
little things that you're supposed to
stick around your house and push when
you want to reorder more garbage bags
but it's too hard to go to amazon.com
and push Add to car so you're supposed
to use this thing like that it's similar
to the Amazon - buttons but it's not the
same thing the Amazon - replenishment
service works directly with appliance
maker so it's built into appliances and
in this case it works with the Brita
pitcher and that means that every time
40 gallons of water passes through this
Wi-Fi connected baby it automatically
knows it and then Amazon automatically
reorders more Brita filters for me okay
so rather than occasionally remembering
yourself then it might be a good idea to
replace the filter in your Brita pitcher
the internet will remember it for you
what a time to be alive I know it's
pretty great also how much did that
super smart Wi-Fi Brita infinity picture
cost you just $45 this one cost me 35
bucks
are you guys fighting over your Brita
pictures again because you know it's
pretty great is a regular old tap water
especially if you have access to clean
tap water which as you probably know
some people don't
so that Internet of Things things you've
got there it's pretty cool but maybe we
should figure out a way to solve that
problem first she just Mike dropped you
yeah I can't argue with that especially
who if you below this the best blue spot
so far la la red leather yellow leather
another thing about that y friend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
