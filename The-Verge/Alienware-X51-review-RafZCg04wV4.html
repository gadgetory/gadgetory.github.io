and we're here with the Alienware x51
desktop gaming computer that isn't much
bigger than a standard game console you
take a look at the back here
you can see we've got the dual DVI and
mini HDMI ports of a GTX 5 5 v graphics
card take a look at the back panel it's
a full array of ports on the h61
mini ITX motherboard including full
audio pair of USB 3.0 ports 4 USB 2.0
ports Gigabit Ethernet HDMI and even a
pair of digital audio jacks here optical
and coaxial both to connect it to your
home Media Center you'll also notice a
tiny port down at the bottom that's for
power in order to save on space
Alienware included a giant power brick
instead because the Alienware x51 is
designed to take a place in your home
Media Center the crew wood Alienware
made it look like a video game console
too you can see we've got the matte
finish on the sides similar to the Xbox
360 a nice big diagonal strike through
the center like the Xbox 360 slim and
this shiny coat in the front like the
PlayStation 3 along with this
slot-loading optical drive right here
just like the PlayStation 3 in place you
should do before you can turn the logo
right here you've got it horizontally
Alienware x51 is actually one of the
most upgradable miniature pcs we've seen
in a while one screw in the back push
off the frame hair to the side detach
the wire here get at the cards this
particular one connects to the lights on
the side panel and you can see all the
insides and as you can see here both the
DVD drive and the GPU rack are modular
you can pull them right out and upgrade
them now to the inexperienced PC builder
this may look like an impenetrable
Fortress of metal but aliens where's
actually designed these internals to be
completely modular you can remove any
one of them at a time for the
entry-level price of $6.99 the Alienware
x51
comes with a core i3 processor 4
gigabytes of memory and nvidia
Sgt 545 graphics card and a DVD Drive
what you're looking at here is the 1200
$49 version which upgrades the optical
to blu-ray as a gtx 555 graphics card
and a core i7 2630 point 4 gigahertz so
this is the alien FX app that comes with
the Alienware x51 and it's got pretty
much one purpose it lets you change the
mood lighting of the computer on the
front and on the sides to one of these
colors in the circle if you go into the
Advanced Mode you can actually set those
lights to different system events or
applications for instance if you get an
email we can set the alien head to light
up red at that point to give you a
notification so now we're going to take
a look at the performance of the
Alienware x51 and first mission of
Battlefield 3 it's not too bad can't
really do this on ultra and high is a
bit of a crapshoot but I'm medium
settings battlefield 3 definitely
playable similar to battlefield 3 The
Witcher 2 isn't comfortable on Ultra
settings or even high settings on the
x51 and it's 1,200 $49 configuration but
it does pretty good job at median last
but not least we've got just cause to
set on the island nation of now and
we're running here with maxed out
everything except we're only running 8x
anti-aliasing instead of the 16x
possible it runs well over 30 frames per
second and looks pretty great as long as
you're not using the most demanding
latest PC games and got a slightly older
title like Just Cause 2
you shouldn't have any problems with the
top spec x51 unless of course you don't
know how to drive
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
