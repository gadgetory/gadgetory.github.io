on the Apple Campus in Cupertino apple
just released a new line of MacBook Pros
which are super cool they take a lot of
inspiration from the MacBook the super
small and thin MacBook and now they
brought it to the pro size with pro
horsepower but the big feature is the
new touch strip on the mid-level 13-inch
MacBook Pro in the 15-inch MacBook Pro
so here you can see I'm just going to
find her then what you've got is kind of
like the classic function keys shown up
on the screen but if I press right here
you see this opens into the classic wall
and I can close it i can press right
here on the volume keys and instead of
that I get a touch display that's
controlling the volume that's the that's
fine but the real action here is that
this is context-sensitive to apps so I'm
here in this message I want to type I
want to send it emoji I push the emoji
key and now I have a full access to
emojis in a touch display just like you
would on a phone the move here is really
bringing a lot of touch elements that
we've seen on phones and tablets to the
Mac without putting in a touch screen so
here you can see the keyboard is going
to make typing selection suggestions
autocorrect suggestions as I type which
is pretty neat you can see it's just
letting me type right with a keyboard
just like the smart Keyboard on an
iPhone but instead of touching the
screen I'm touching this touch panel
here there's all kinds of other things
you can do this I can open QuickTime
this is a video you can see I can scrub
in the video just by touching the thing
I can hit play
I can scrub back and forth that's pretty
cool they've got photos here so I can
switch over to photos so photos is open
here I can scroll through all the photos
I have I can press the edit key right
here I can click filters and now I can
bang through photo filters right on the
keyboard without having to go to the
screen and use the mouse over here I can
push this button I can
so the cropping I can do I can rotate
the photos right with the touchpad or
I'm sorry right with the touch bar right
on the keyboard without lifting my hand
here so a very interesting way of
bringing touch controls to the keyboard
without actually bringing touch the
screen apples also showing off some
third-party apps so here I've got word
you can see word has a bunch of editing
controls I can hit bold mount typing in
bold we can hit italic all the classic
stuff that you would see usually the
menu bar brought down right in front of
your screen when you open Safari you get
a bunch of favorites the new tab window
it also remembers all your tabs so you
can switch tabs just by touching the
screen you can also hit search right
from the bar when you hit search it
brings up a bunch of your favorites here
I think it's really funny that Apple has
given itself the biggest button with its
own name spelled out that nobody else
gets that button on screen so that's
pretty neat and then out of system level
you can hit the Siri button you get
serious here can barely hear me right
now what's going on Siri she doesn't
understand because it's super loud in
here and over here on the touch bar you
have the touch ID sensor and the power
button so that's just a regular power
button here he's just trying to listen
to me so if I hold this down it's
actually a button over here if I hold it
down you can see I get I get a bunch of
things happening and it's touch ID so if
I try to buy something or bad Apple base
set up I could just touch right here and
it would be touch ID and either log me
in or approve an Apple pay purchase so
that is the big touch bar you can also
see this trackpad is absolutely massive
it's 2 times as big as the previous
track pads it's four stotch it doesn't
move it just has the taptic engine
underneath it the keyboard is really
much shallower than the current MacBook
Pro it's not quite as shallow as the
MacBook but it's definitely notice a
shallower it feels really fast I like a
shallow keyboard so it's fine but you're
gonna have to try it out and feel for
yourself and then along the side heyo
there's headphone jack it's my favorite
and then you've got for what Apple is
calling Thunderbolt three ports either
actually the use same form factor is USB
C so you get two on this side and then
two over here all of these are also
charging ports because they are in fact
the same form factor as USB C so you can
plug in any charger all four ports will
charge they'll be Thunderbolt 3 and then
all of your docks and accessories can
plug right in so just the four
Thunderbolt 3 ports that are the same
form factors USB C and a headphone jack
nothing very special on the bottom this
whole thing is very thin in light it's 4
pounds it feels incredibly light to me I
even current 15 inch MacBook Pro user
this thing feels great the Retina
display is thinner than before 65
percent brighter all in all a really
solid update to the MacBook Pro with a
really new interesting UI convention in
the touch bar that it seems like
third-party developers are going to take
a lot of advantage of as they create you
eyes for touch on the Mac that don't
rely on a touchscreen so the new MacBook
starts at $14.99 for a model without the
touch bar that's 13-inch with 2
Thunderbolt 3 ports and no touch bar
just regular function keys and it goes
up the 15-inch model here the quad-core
processor goes up to about 23 99 there's
a million custom configuration options
in there sure you can make this thing as
expensive or as it expenses as you want
but the cheap ones starts shipping
really soon like tomorrow these bigger
ones with a touch bar start shipping in
two to three weeks and we will have a
review very soon so the new MacBook Pro
is really cool but there's one thing
that's sad the Apple logo doesn't glow
anymore which is incredibly depressing
because I love the glowing Apple logo
it's super shiny now and you get a touch
bar like that which is cool there's no
more glowing Apple logo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
