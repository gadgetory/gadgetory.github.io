finally know what's happening with
Android P company's focusing on three
things a simpler interface and
intelligent interface and this thing
they're calling digital well being
what's that all about so the new Android
P beta should be available pretty much
right away on a whole bunch of devices
like seven or nine devices it's on the
Google pixel to excel which I have here
you can also get on a one plus six Nokia
phones etc etc anyway I want to show you
the most obvious thing you're gonna see
on this beta of Android P because oh my
god they took the home button away so
what you do is you give it a little
swipe up and that takes you to the
overview screen all of your apps are
listed horizontally here and you there
even live so you can like long press on
something and have it do a search for
that thing or copy the text or whatever
which is kind of cool if you give it a
longer swipe up or a second swipe up it
takes you to all of your apps and it
lists your most used apps or sorry the
like AI detected app so what they think
you're gonna want to use right there at
the top and that's also in this half
swipe up down here at the bottom which
is pretty good there's a little tab also
for your work apps and if you really
want to you just turn those damn things
off because it wants work apps one last
little clever thing with that button if
you just slide it over to the right you
can get to that list of your most recent
apps to jump into them so it's a really
quick way to switch between apps and
then of course when you're in an app the
home button is there to go home you can
just tap it to go home and the good old
back bug is there too if you want the
back button notifications things are
basically the same but there are some
really nice updates so if you start
dismissing stuff a bunch eventually
it'll ask if you just want to stop
seeing those notifications you can long
press on a notification instead of
remembering that weird little swipe over
to get the settings and then there's
just a plain old manage notifications
button at the bottom when you tap on
that it takes you to a list of your most
recent notifications and then you can
just turn those things off because
they've been annoying me lately so it's
a much faster way to handle
notifications now this is just some of
the stuff in Android P there's a lot
more there's all the stuff about digital
well being there's a bunch of AI stuff
and so I want to talk about that stuff
now
now because this is Google because
Google can't string more than five words
together without saying the words AI
we're talking about AI again AI is built
into Android in a few different ways
there's a new machine learning kit so
that you can make your own intelligent
apps and that works on both Android and
iOS actually but in Android itself AI is
gonna watch what apps you use and then
shut them down intelligently to save
battery life it's also gonna adjust your
brightness automatically for you I don't
know saying that that's AI feels a
little bit buzzed wordy and a little bit
overkill but it should hopefully give
you better battery life in the end what
are some of the things that are more
intelligent and happening on the phone
right and so I mean is the whole premise
of this is you know we think smart gold
smart phones but you know what they
could be a lot smaller and it could be a
lot more intelligent and and you know
what does that mean well in our case
it's really we think the phone should
adapt to you one area that we've worked
on which I like a lot is what we call
adaptive battery it's a project we did
with deep mind it uses on device machine
learning to figure out which apps you're
gonna launch next and which ones you're
not gonna launch for a couple of hours
which you may not do till evening we've
got all that's one example
another is auto brightness now you know
pretty much every modern smartphone
today we'll look at the it has a light
sensor and it'll adjust the brightness
depending on the light but it doesn't
take into account your per your
preferences right or or your environment
and so what we've done it'll actually
learn how you move the brightness given
different lighting conditions and then
it will do it for you so one of the
things that Google is doing in Android P
is they're introducing these new terms
there's a slice and there's an action
and they're basically deep links which
means that an app has got something you
want to do deep down inside the app but
you want to do it somewhere else in the
operating system so if you do a search
for lift it just surfaces a link to just
go home and it jumps right into the app
to do that or if you want if you are
opening up your app drawer there's a
couple little things inside the app door
at the top that lets you jump right into
some action you do all the time like you
know call your significant other or open
up seamless when you get home because
let's be honest you're gonna open up
seamless when you get home you're lazy
as hell those are all the whiz-bang
features are gonna make you more
productive with your phone and use your
phone more and they're all great but
Google's doing this whole other thing
that's designed to get you to use your
phone less digital well being for us
theme is a set of capabilities we're
putting into Android to help people
become more aware of how they're using
their device and then be in control have
a set of controls where they can decide
how they want to change that baby so one
of the ways you're doing that is you
have this thing is it anybody call the
dashboard yeah there's a dashboard is it
just it's just a lot more checkboxes for
people to have to look at like are you
finding that people are actually finding
value in this thing the first step is
awareness and that dashboard is pretty
straightforward it shows you how much
time you spent on your phone each day
what apps you spent that time in how
many times you unlock your phone
how many notifications you've received
and then unless you drill down on those
things and then the next piece of it is
okay so how can the software help me if
I want to change but my behavior and so
that's where we have we're putting a
bunch of capabilities we're calling you
know user controls so you can set a time
limit on the amount of time you want to
spend in an app and so I could say for
example I only want to spend 30 minutes
a day in YouTube or an Instagram or my
favorite game maybe subway surfer right
and another situation that we find
people really talk to us a lot about was
trying to be fully present for something
and the phone
perhaps not helping with the hat so do
not disturb being improved where I can
like turn on do not disturb
now all the visual interruptions go away
so it doesn't show notifications on lock
screens it's done not only does not
vibrate doesn't know vibrations you know
basically no interruptions so after that
really brief look at Android PE what do
I think well I'm kind of hopeful I
really love the idea of exploding apps
out into the rest of the phones so that
you can just do a search and jump right
to the thing you want to do and I'm
really intrigued by the idea of using
apps less because I don't know I use
Twitter way too much if you take those
two ideas together what's really
interesting is Google's trying to set up
a system where you think about your
phone less both because it does stuff
for you automatically through AI and
because you just use your phone list and
maybe we could all stand to do that but
even though I'm hopeful that doesn't
mean I'm naive Android has a huge update
problem it always has and the theory is
that this new treble system they
developed is going to
on more phones sooner we're making a
good step here it's gonna show up on
like seven manufacturers in beta right
away and we should have it on a bunch of
phones not just pixel phones by the end
of the year but Google has to execute
because every year we see a great new
version of Android and then we'd have to
wait to get it on the phones that
everybody buys Samsung phones I would
really like to see them fix that this
year with Android P thank you so much
for watching if you like this video
there's another video over at Virg
science you should definitely watch it's
about pie charts and are they actually
useful for helping you see if revisions
any good why they're always all the same
you should go check it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
