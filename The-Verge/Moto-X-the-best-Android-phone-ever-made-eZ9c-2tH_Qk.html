and this is the new Moto X yes that's
right just moto X naught X plus 1 or 2x
or anything like that it looks a lot
like the original moto X but it's bigger
and better and faster than pretty much
every way imaginable they moved up from
a 4.7 to a 5.2 inch display and it goes
from 720p to 1080p on the new X on the
back they have a 13 megapixel sensor and
you'll notice that they've done this
cool thing with the flash where there's
a ring surrounding the lens and there's
two LEDs inside of there so when the
flash pops it sort of diffuses through
that ring and surrounds the the sensor
below you have sort of that trademark
Motorola dimple that that is from the
original Moto X and they've carried it
carried that through their entire line
and you'll notice that there's this
curve here that's very familiar to
existing Moto X owners and on this phone
it goes to a much narrower edge than on
the original and this is very important
the new model is metal around here
instead of plastic so that gives it a
much more premium feel now they've kept
going with the configurability of this
device through moto maker the review
unit that we have here is bamboo but
you'll be able to get a variety of woods
plus a variety of colors one new option
for the second-generation X is a number
of leathers there are four colors to
choose from and that is of course an
upcharge but it's kind of an interesting
feel because it has some pliability to
it that you don't get with something
like plastic or wood compared to the
original X you'll notice that the new X
is considerably bigger but because it's
so much narrower on the side or at least
it feels that way
it still feels fantastic in the hand I
think that the most amazing magic trick
of the original X was its ability to
feel very small even though the screen
actually wasn't that small and the new
ax manages to do basically the same
thing even though the screen is a full
half inch larger now you'll notice you
can't see it on the black version of the
new X but on this white one there are
these dots along the bottom and there's
also one at the top and these are
infrared sensors if I put this phone
here and I want to see the active
display which is one of the trademark
features of the original
motox that they've kept for this device
I can just wave over it and that will
turn on the display so I can get my
notifications at a glance I can see if
there are any text messages or emails
that have come in and if there were
notifications I could tap and peek at
them without actually turning on the
phone and because this is a Super AMOLED
display it doesn't actually power on the
entire display to do that it saves
battery life now you'll notice this
looks a lot like stock Android and
that's because it basically is just like
the original X they've kind of sprinkled
in a few Motorola custom features but
overall it looks and feels like just
standard Android without any decorations
or frills on it it's running KitKat Nell
get an upgrade to Android L when it
becomes available later this year
overall it's a much more premium feeling
device than the original X which I think
was probably Motorola's biggest
challenge was that even though the X was
their flagship it kind of had a
plasticky feel they solved that here
with this metal rim and of course the
leather choices are going to add a
premium touch as well for those who
decide to upgrade to it so that's a
quick look at the second generation Moto
X</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
