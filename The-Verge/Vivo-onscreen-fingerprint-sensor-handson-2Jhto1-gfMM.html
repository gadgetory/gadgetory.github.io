the phone I have in front of me is the
first one to have a fingerprint sensor
integrated into the display and it
actually worked so there's the first
phone to have the fingerprint sensor
integrated into the display so it's
right in this area down here which is
available to use as you would with any
other smartphone display but when you
lock the phone and you want to unlock it
it turns into a fingerprint sensor it
works exactly like the capacitive
fingerprint sensor you might have seen
on Apple iPhone or Samsung Galaxy S or
whatever but the difference is the
advantage now is that you have these
ultra thin bezels top and bottom on the
phone but you still have the fingerprint
sensors right at the front where it used
to be and where for a lot of people it
should be if you have no bezels we have
nowhere to put it
so a lot of companies have to come up
with compromises Samsung's solution was
to put it on the back for way over here
on the side which was terrible
ergonomically apple solution was to just
forego touch ID entirely on the iPhone
10 neither of which was really ideal
there were many reports the Samsung an
apple trying to integrate it into the
display itself under the OLED panel and
that's exactly what vivo has done here
with the help of synaptics people is the
first company to introduce this it's
very likely that there be others
following on for the rest of the year in
2018 and it's really impressive it's
exactly it works exactly as the usual
capacitive fingerprint sensor does but
it's just integrated into the display
and it feels a little bit magical
because you're using display as you
would on any other phone but when you
lock the phone and you're trying to
unlock it you put your finger on it and
it authenticates you it does the usual
biometric authentication its optical
like the previous stuff now this only
works with OLED panels because it's
optical and there's a synaptics sensor
down here the bottom which looks through
the OLED dots this wouldn't work with an
LCD because that requires a backlight
which would block that recognition so
you only be able to find this on
smartphones with OLED displays coming up
in the rest of this year the only
difference relative to the usual
fingerprint sensors is this one seems to
be a little bit slower it isn't quite as
lightening for us there's something like
you would get on the previous iPhones or
the one plus 5t and so on but it's
tolerably slower it's not something that
really slows you down even though it's
not terribly well known globally Bebo is
actually one of those biggest smartphone
manufacturers owing to a lot of success
in its native market of China this is
this company is the first come out with
this synaptics integrated fingerprint
sensor solution but I'm confident that
there'll be a whole bunch of others
joining it as we go for the year 2018
the phone are we looking at here at CES
is very close to the final product it
has an aluminum unibody no fingerprint
sensor in the back because obviously
it's integrated into display itself and
I'm liking the fact that it has a
headphone jack so a thumbs up for that
but I'm noticing Brenner's a headphone
jack this is micro USB port which
doesn't make much sense to me USB C is
the standard of the future it's
reversible it's better in almost every
single way and this being vivos next
flagship and having this brand new kind
of futuristic technology it makes sense
that people would give it the full
top-spec treatment so this might not be
the phone you end up buying but a
fingerprint sensor integrated directly
into this display but I'm confident of
the technology itself once you try it is
something that a whole bunch of people
are going to want and like in part
because it's so futuristic feeling you
know it's a technology that used to be
on a discreet separate piece of hardware
now integrated directly into the display
is seamless and it's kind of beautiful
so for more technology like this follow
us here at CES 2018 on the verge comm
