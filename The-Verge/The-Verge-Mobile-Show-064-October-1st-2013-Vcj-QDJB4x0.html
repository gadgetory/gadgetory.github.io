show actually I should say greetings
mobile composters damn it hi thanks for
watching this is the worst inch rubber
I'm dieter bohn however that's have oh
I'm dan seifert and i'm chris sigler the
moral of this story is don't ever try
and multitask the second in that in the
10 second countdown to the show going on
air our esteemed producer evan has given
me authority to click the button to make
this happen and I just screwed up every
time so the big red button the big red
button it's still there it's it's still
red but I'm looking right at it I'm not
going to click it we were a little late
because I was ranting about email
clients and everybody else joined in
because we feel very passionately about
email clients so while we have a million
things to talk about on this our 64th
episode for october first 2013 ah like
Samsung Sony all kinds of stuff the
reason that i'm not using an iphone
right now chris sigler is I want to have
my gmail experience work very
effectively on my phone and I don't want
to live in a world where I've got to
manage it twice and gmail on the iOS the
app is way too slow and the way that the
mail built in mail app works with gmail
I'm not super fond of yeah and I don't
believe since they had that bug that any
email app does proper background updates
yet unless mailbox like turn that back
on am I wrong mailbox is not turn that
back on you yeah there are a couple apps
that I think purport to still do it but
they're not very good apps but chris
says he has a advice for me a clinic
actually yes so I promised going to the
show that i would give our listeners to
but more my esteemed colleagues a a 101
an email 101 like a real clinic on how
to manage their email yeah we don't
actually care about educating any of you
we just know about one of each other
yeah right so it's all one of the trip
here so there are two and only two
tenets you need to remember when it
comes to email 10 is number one email
dad haha attendant number two actually I
would have never remembered this app had
Dan not said it moments before the show
started but way too much meaning that
you don't use it no I like I haven't
installed on my iphone but I don't I
usually don't think of using it and like
my my email situation so hopeless right
now that uh like it like it would take
me even if i was using triage the waves
meant to be used it would still take me
like weeks to get back on track but
triage so that you know the concept of
triage which we wrote about several
months ago is that it's just like a
never-ending stack of of your unread
emails you swipe left to archive or
delete your choice you can configure it
and you swipe right to leave it in your
inbox it's already excuse me yeah up and
down so you know it's great if you have
an enormous amount of like garbage email
that you just want to be able to quickly
delete and you know our press release
situation in this industry is such that
that is a very useful kind of
functionality for us so when i when i do
when my email is less desperate than it
is right now I do find triage to be a
useful tool right now is just kind of to
the point where literally my only option
is to just go full email bankruptcy so
if you've emailed me listener uh and
you're expecting response I apologize
odds are very good i will never see it
because i'm about to click select all
and archive with it so why might I mote
note uh Chris does this at least I see
yes it's true but hang on a second your
advice to us Chris we just have a big
bone for five minutes about how hopeless
you hey my situation yeah more or less
yes okay because the thing is i mean we
could all do that right because of that
it's been like okay I'm just gonna clear
up a few evos and then I'll go and get
on with the rest of my life or I'll go
and have a meal and as soon as I'm
finished with one their son then another
one pings up but then it just carries on
and carries on and it's like I say it's
like press releases I gotta go to press
release from the guys were running cute
remember those guys this
I think it's the Biggio digia they
bought cute from Nokia and I was like
back from the dead that was the most
exciting press release about this
morning honestly but on this topic just
to make quick mention i got a hold of a
Lumia 1020 here in the UK recently and
took some photos with it amazing amazing
camera I kind of have to take back my
complaints about the software it's just
a lot of fun to take pictures with it
but the windows phone email situation is
it's just getting worse no game yes yes
it's just so atrocious and you know it
had been like 15 minutes after i blanked
out my inbox because i actually do that
i know chris you only dream of achieving
that but i managed to do that and we're
in 15 minutes I had like 18 18 emails I
was like what the hell was going on
internet it was just mostly reply so
same thread and the thing is Windows
Phone is treating every applies a
separate email which is just like that
because we do I can say we try email
kind of like instant messaging we sent
far away emails all the time
particularly in people's birthdays you
know max if it's somebody's birthday and
trying to sort IMO with Windows Phone
it's just a nightmare so that's how I
was this one yeah this this triage
method like it like just archiver or
keep isn't quite enough for me like I
need to be able to do a couple more
things and relatively quickly in order
to manage my email on my phone and one
of those things is mute and sometimes I
like like a quick to word reply will do
it and if I just feel like something
like that triage app is just a recipe
for me to do a little bit of you know on
my phone and then have to do it a second
time once i get back to well yeah so
that's the philosophy at least that's
how i use triage when i when i use it
and again i'm not i haven't used it
lately but the idea is that you can do a
very quick cursory pass to sort out the
obvious garbage up front and then you
can go back without your desktop client
or an android phone or something like
that and take care of the remaining
emails whether they need to be muted or
replied to or whatever chris's ultimate
email clinic is use an app on your phone
to do an initial pass on the iphone and
then go get an android
and do it properly is that good but but
you're forgetting you're forgetting the
first tenet which is you said right so
really this entire conversation is moved
I guess that always email dead but I
don't want anything to replace it I
don't want it to be replaced I am or
ping or anything else i justjust stop
emailing me and I don't want to talk to
you I will I RL communication is back
and it says I've got a manifesto to
write okay is he I've got a cabin
and like me okay we could actually wrap
this up really neatly by noting that the
gmail for android application has been
updated to go update like a week ago but
it's only now rolling out to a couple of
us which is why snoods so theta and I
just got the new gmail for android app
and it looks rather different and it's
buggy it like the scrolling like I get
like I get weird like twitchy blinky
things on my screen when i scroll really
quickly oh no that's just android no but
I'm telling you it's weird I like where
the app is going design-wise um no no
comment on its performance but gmail
improves the performance on the native
app and does background updates on iOS
which they need to do both of those
things that would be so clutch yeah
there is a very high degree of
possibility that i will put down this is
this moto x for a long long time and
switch back to it i've got the Moto X
camera update by the way did I complain
about this yet like no better and i
agree with brian klug and josh that it's
better but it still can't handle right
backgrounds like there's a like I like
look here here it is I like I'm showing
this here you can't really tell I tapped
on the person in the foreground here in
order to take the picture and
theoretically it should expose and
adjust for the thing I tapped on but no
you just see a shadow in the front and a
big bright side on the back like this is
a picture that the iphone would have
gotten and I would cherish for the rest
of my life and instead all I get out of
it is a rant on the Virgin Mobile show
something that's have a man who I you
have going on there that's all Z you've
gotten you know you've gotten better
motorola nice job i'm very
I heard someone describe it as it moved
the camera from a four to A six yeah
basically yeah well so speaking of
cameras i just want to i'd want to dwell
on this but the the the 5s what is
important to me about that camera i mean
obviously it's a great camera but what
really is is a game changer for me is
how instantaneous it is you can you know
if you're on the lock screen you swipe
up boom you're immediately at the
viewfinder same if you press the camera
button from the home screen and to me
like in terms of how you use a camera
phone throughout the day that capability
is much more important to me than the
actual quality that I'm getting out of
it god I do not want to buy a 5s Chris
don't make me do it you're gonna buy a
5s it's a question of land you know you
don't want to see the pictures I took
over the weekend by 5's then because not
only is it really fast like chris says
and and that is you know paramount to a
camera phone being an awesome camera
phone but it also produces really
amazing results all right if three
things happen one someone buys my orange
iphone 5 to everybody promises to never
email me again so I don't have to wait
for gmail to update their stupid iOS app
and three somebody gives me five hundred
dollars I will buy a 5s well if you sell
your out orange iphone 5 there you go
hey one is always open once all three
what it what would happen if you sent an
orange iphone 5 to gazelle do you think
they would reject it I don't know I'm
curious a virgin mobile show no no I'm
not I'm not going to try some my phone
over them original which oh that's
terrible we have got like a ton of stuff
a surprisingly large amount of stuff to
talk about so we should actually not
just complain about our own personal
gripes although they're incredibly
interesting and I can't imagine why
anybody would ever want us to stop
totally all of it so we had some galaxy
reviews go up two day three in fact all
at the same time and relevant to this
show uh oh my god thanks for that to eat
crisps
let's talk I like selling stuff even
when it's that mine um yeah so dan dan
tell us about your experience with an 03
uh so the note 3 I reviewed it and it's
a you know it's a great big phone if
you're looking for a big phone and you
really want the biggest screen that you
can get and still have a great phone the
note 3 is hands down the best phone on
the market for that uh and it took like
everything that was good about the note
to it included that it took some things
that we really didn't like about the
note 2 and improved upon them so you
know it's a very iterative version but
it is overall a better experience
there's a lot of things I don't like
about the note 2 what what did it fixed
number one the greasy slimy glossy
plastic back has been replaced with a
textured finish but you make leather
with admitted leading your plastic right
it's still plastic it's very much
plastic yeah on the inside it is very
much plastic but the things yeah it's
it's fake leather and it's got this
ridiculous fake stitching that's not
fooling anybody and it looks so stupid
but when you're holding it like this in
your hand it feels a million times nicer
than greasy slimy glossy plastic so it's
a step forward for Samsung's design
department um which you know they're not
they're not at Apple's level they're not
at HTC's level yet but it's better than
before so we have to give them the
credit for that and then the other thing
is this screen is actually larger on the
note 3 than it is on the note 2 but the
device is thinner and ever so slightly
narrower so you don't have you have more
screen and less phone so the whole net
result is the phone isn't any bigger
than the note 2 but still giving you a
bigger display it's also really fast and
really snappy and performance is great
and the battery lasts all day and into
two days if you're not a super heavy
user so there's a lot of good things to
say about the note 3 it's not the device
for me it's way too big and I can't use
it with one hand which frustrates me to
no end but obviously Samsung's selling
these hand over fist so there's a lot of
people that are really into these well
that's maybe hand with fist because it
takes two hands
hands over fists it's the stylus the
same as wasn't the two as far as I could
tell ya it's got a slightly different
design it's got this kind of like so you
can see that you can see this like
knurled kind of ridged edge to it which
makes it a little easier to pull out of
the holster and it's actually
symmetrical now it's not the other the
old stylist was slightly curved at the
top but the experience of using it is
pretty much the city and the big
difference is this software here that
they added which is called Air Command
you pull the sinus out this thing pops
up and then you can see if I can do this
you can hover over it my close enough no
depth perception there we go and you can
hover over it and choose a couple of
different options and you can take notes
and launch apps and things like that
with it which is a lot better than what
the note 2 did which when you pull the
stylus out it's shifted you to a
completely different home screen which
is completely disorienting read
everything like that so that that's a
definite improvement in the overall
experience but our they are the SAPS the
S apps any better like I you know me I
love the styles we're talking about this
a little bit before the show but like I
genuinely want to believe that like a
stylist can be awesome on a phone but I
dont still don't trust Sam so I can do
the software right uh the apps are still
not nearly as good as I think they can
be there so like with the with the
action bar thing or Air Command excuse
me so you can like pop open a note and
then you can I write like a name and
phone number in it and have it
automatically add to a contact which is
great and cool and smart but I can't
like write lunch with dieter at noon and
add to my calendar like there's no
option for that which blows my mind
because that seems like something that I
would actually use this function for on
the apple newton managed to do right
yeah so like for for things like that it
still seems like um it's not fully baked
and there's still lots of room for
improvement on functionality there if
you're into drawing and using your note
for like artistic stuff there's a couple
of apps included that are really great
painting apps and stuff and you can do a
whole heck of a lot of things that i'm
not really capable of taking advantage
of because I
zero or just a bone in my body but that
is part works really well the
handwriting recognition on it is really
fast as far as determining what you
wrote down and it's pretty accurate from
the most part even though I've terrible
chicken scratch but it still functions
like you've given a big box you write a
word in the box it takes that word puts
in a text field you write the next word
it takes to that word puts it so you can
write maybe like four or five words at a
time and then grabs those and puts those
in the text field which isn't very
smooth it's easier for me to just type
things out on the keyboard you know say
I'm song like you went so far as to
steal blinkfeed from HTC like you will
little literally take anything from
anyone you'll take the thing that nobody
cares about but just because another
phone happens to have it you'll throw it
on a samsung toys they took blinkfeed
that is insane yeah I couldn't believe
I'd like to take blinkfeed then why not
just take graffiti just lock stock and
barrel just take it just do it it's not
called graffiti anymore right it's
called graffiti too and then they change
it i don't remember they were there were
weird lawsuits i forget yeah that all i
do not bad so it's food by xerox at some
point so that's a note 3 if you want if
you really like the note 2 you're gonna
love the note 3 if you weren't into the
note 2 or the note one you probably not
going to be into the note 3 um it's the
best big phone oversized in between
tablet smartphone on the market see I
still think that the whatever that giant
Sony is is a sexier looking phone that's
the Xperia Z ultra and that's actually
bigger that's six point four inch but I
haven't used that so i can't speak to it
glad you have right if Vlad was still
with us I'm sure he'd say yeah we lost
for that ah where'd he go he just went
away Google had enough of him yeah no
he's off of our chat as well he's he's
fully disappeared from the internet he
got tired of us hi he raged with the
internet yeah it would maybe he switched
to nevermind maybe he very suddenly
decided to go full Paul Miller and we
won't hear from him until October gran
2014 oh boy um what
done talk about the note 3 though
because we have to talk about the this
benchmarking thing yeah so as I did with
I believe it was the international
version of the galaxy s4 yeah the one
that's powered with Samsung's processor
right so Samsung is due to the numbers
again so ARS technica did a really great
takedown well not like a smackdown but
they they went in and they verified that
Samsung is telling all four cores of the
Snapdragon 800 to max out whenever it
sees certain apps and the apps that it
happens to max out the the course for
are all benchmarking apps like they
managed to grab like the actual file on
the JavaScript or the java java java
java code not script got him an idiot
and it's like literally like boost
packages for boost all adjustments and
the packages are quadrant quadrant
quadrant GL benchmark GL benchmark
Samsung benchmark Nina mark pass mark
smart bench benchmark p I chainfire
bench what's it wednesday what's
significant about this is like if you're
using the phone to do say play a game or
something like that or do something
intensive it will you know get its
processor up to go you know these fat
that fast as fast as it can go but after
a while it hits a thermal limit and then
as the thing heats up it will start to
throttle back and it correct me if I'm
wrong dieter but when it's using these
cheats on these benchmark apps it
essentially just ignores that throttle
limiting and so it runs full throttle
all the time no matter what temperature
or thermal it limiting excuse me well
I'm not positive if the thermal limit
applies to this sort of thing but I can
say that one I think you're recording
broke down you should check that and two
um sorry is going so diffused it yeah
the main thing is like the way that
these processors is supposed to interact
with software is when software says hey
I need power handy power the processor
say yeah
I give you some power I'm gonna wrap up
to give you this much power and what
Samsung is doing is it's not letting
that natural flow of the software saying
handy power it's just saying oh for this
software we're giving you everything no
matter what it's possible that a
benchmark might not ask for all that
power just like an applet and the really
crazy thing is when they actually like
they manage to like get around their
fakery of the benchmarks and the note 3
still wins it still does better than the
Optimus g2 which has got the same
processor at the same clock speed like
they didn't need to do this thing that
they did they just did it but also at
the end of the day like if you're if
you're making a purchasing decision for
a phone based on a benchmark scores yeah
I need to reevaluate pretty much
everything about your your your purchase
dis line making but your help us about
your entire life yeah I you know I mean
like I can't think of a phone that's
come out in the past 18 months that
would not meet the needs of the
overwhelming majority of the population
there are like a few edge cases where an
insane processor helps right but frankly
like the gaming especially in Android is
not to the point where this kind of
stuff matters anyway so and we've talked
about it before I think that the you
know we've all kind of agreed that the
bottleneck at this point is not a
hardware but Android itself which is
still stuttery despite OEM strong just
insane hardware at it yeah um sorry I
was just trying to look up the process
hey can you guys see me my god we can't
see you quite uh yeah you can't save me
because of them free G now my home
connection though went bonkers I was
just going to add to chris's point um
and like the Moto X is going to get beat
on pretty much every single benchmark
app by every other high-end phone on the
market but when you actually use the
device you know it's just fat it's
plenty fast and responsive and right
usable in everyday use so it's the thing
that the benchmarks do not translate to
experience experience does not
necessarily translate to
marks and the it's like like you were
saying nobody goes into a store saying
you know this phone scored three hundred
more points on uh that that benchmark
app that's the one for me so right why
bother well people don't go into still
saying that but they go websites on the
internet and they start having easily
don't even buy the thing like 20 page of
conversations about it when was the last
time you got ridiculously true that much
is true yes I so know Vlad I'm sorry my
liking uh yeah I believe you are oh yeah
you're liking terribly okay well I'm
your correspondent from across the ocean
so that's probably to be expected okay
well let me let me just give you like my
thoughts on the milk free can I do that
yeah I'll just do like a continuous rent
and then we can stop the big butt well
on the performance part i know they you
know fluff the benchmarks and whatever
but i think none of us as he could
really care about it I found it really
quick the not free in terms of a
preparation the camera I think Samsung
keeps making good cameras but with not
free it's like crystal saying it really
is that you know you take the picture
it's there you review it's all very
quick so very fluid one thing i noticed
button up free was his display it really
impressed me and I thought maybe that's
because I've forgotten how good Super
AMOLED from Samsung look but I think it
was one of the websites do like really
in depth display comparisons they looked
at it and apparently it's a much
improved Super AMOLED so my eyes weren't
crazy there is actually a major
improvement at least an improvement in
Samsa congee with this new screen so
that's one of the things that we stood
out to me performance has always been
strong with these flagship devices or
pseudo flagship provides from sams but
the screen is really improved and I'm a
big fan of the milk free I'm with that
if you're going to buy something that
free test based phone isn't
denote freeze the one to get I agree I
wonder how long until adheres that I
agree with hopefully soon I was just
gonna like go back to rap on the
processing what was the last time you
guys got like deeply excited about a
processor bomb like like you're like oh
my god this is going to change my life
this is I remember thank you so much to
me I remember thinking that the jump
from dual core 2 quad core would be a
significant difference and then every
limb innate Android lag and then it
didn't happen and I got over it pretty
quickly there was a time when Chris Ely
refused to own any phone that wasn't
quad core I don't remember I think
you're making that up no it's totally
dude it's in the it's in the Virgin
Mobile show archives I swear to God I
actually said that I went by any fun
that was in quad core yes did I did I
demand a commit a companion core no I
kind of camera with the phone was that
you're like no I have to own this phone
because its quad-core than he had it for
a week I like I don't know if I've ever
been more excited for processor bump
that I was for the visor platinum again
with the handspring not Elizabeth his
jump through 20 megahertz dragon bald
with 33 megahertz Dragon Ball that's uh
that's impressive that is a when
motorola was still making that's a
65-percent jump yeah look I mean if I'm
gonna if I'm gonna troll you for 4
quad-core I'll troll myself with the
visor an affair no I I think for me it
was I mean isn't it also kind of crazy
how this piece of advanced concert eyes
is like I'm joining you guys that I'm
really enough but he's like running
around the streets of London are you
riding on the streets of London right is
this a remote this is just like I
honestly I'm on this train because I can
get no reception at home so I need to
step out into the street you know to get
some free wheel like you're in the blair
witch project right now you're about to
be murdered whoa and i love video puts a
mother to 1000 this
there's a light immediately above me is
it's not terribly flattering is it okay
that's amazing all right so i can just
be you know a pretty face now I guess
the ballot is you you're always a pretty
faith to me yet I get soaked through
tall you vote speeds speeds and feeds so
seriously um well I'm not typically
we're talking about two point three
gigahertz quad-core process with these
new Snapdragon 800 and it's actually
kind of shocking to me because at the
beginning of this year when Qualcomm was
soaking up the Snapdragon 800 I thought
that would be one of those really SH
really high-end parts are you going to
see in tablets and things like that but
not really in flagship phones whereas
never got it in the LG g2 we've got it
in the galaxy note that i'm talking to
you from and we'll go to in this
experience at one so quite a few
companies have managed to get these
chips in there and it's kind of
surprising to me that's power efficient
enough to be in a phone well I mean
Samsung has never seen a processor speed
bump that it didn't like right and it's
just like if they're doing it everybody
else got to do what I mean LG catches
wind and LG can't not do anything that
Samsung does so i guess i'm i'm not
totally shocked that they've managed to
cram them into phones i am totally
shocked they've managed to do it and the
battery life isn't completely terrible
well it should be noted that the g2's
got a 3000 milliamp hour battery in the
denote three he's got 3,200 million
power battery so it's like a big phone
big battery big battery life um so let
if if your connection manages to hold up
and you look amazing right now and the
portrait is pretty cool too I gotta say
you're just so dark and like the shadows
on your face it's incredible um can you
tell us what the galaxy gear because you
reviewed that and I think universally
everybody agrees with you on this thang
product yeah it's
trying to find the right adjective to
summarize it i don't think the single
one committee can really do it I mean
isn't such an emotional rollercoaster
the first day I got the gear i can say
that i felt in and out of like with it
because actually started liking it
because of the camera on this thing and
maybe i can like demo it i'm holding
back okay I've got the gear on my hand
and I'm holding the note yeah okay I
don't got two hands so this should work
okay there it is so you go to the camera
that's attached in the strap and this is
for me the best thing about the gear
because it takes some fun photos it
takes some decent photos surprisingly so
I thought it would be just kind of like
a front-facing camera on the phone but
it's significantly better than that and
the thing can make take phone calls you
know your focus stay in the pocket and
you can carry on phone close with the
gear and that's where the list of post
is pretty much ends it's a big clunky
it's overpriced every time I go to the
bathroom he gets too far away from the
phone and it vibrates because loss is
Bluetooth connection which then
basically means you have watch you have
digital watch with a camera and because
two hundred ninety nine dollars which is
just crazy to me I think how much is an
ipod touch like you can get a pretty
decent ipod touch for that amount of
money aren't you yeah i think you can
get the top on my catcher either the
middle of the top one yeah BRB buying an
ipod touch and i'm pretty sure you could
probably buy like a cheap washing
machine or something like that i mean
there's so much you can do with that
money if i had numbers i have no idea
who would want to waste it on a gear by
two pebbles one one for each wrist you
can buy a 32 gigabyte it that's a
beautiful comparison yeah 32 game at
high-end ipod touch 4 yeah so okay the
pebble is a beautiful comparison from
them because what the gear actually told
me is how many good ideas that pebble
actually has and how could it actually
is because i've seen a lot of reaction
at least on twitter where people are
connecting the gear to apple and I
saying samsung want to pre empty
i watch imaginary or real and hurry the
product out before it was ready for
market etc said sure what a strategic
coup by Apple and that's just really
tenuous what I really think this tells
us about industry is that the pebble is
a right way to go you know II displays
more power efficiency because the gear
it lasts a day if you use it properly
okay you might lasts like 24 hours and
then you start recharging again it's
just like the smartphones and the thing
is you had to do a little convincing to
get me to switch to a smartphone from a
feature phone because I actually liked
having fun the last like three or four
days between colleges I mean Chris will
recall when we took in when i was
talking about wanting to know them to
knock it East 63 yes I do remember this
very house I wasn't I was an ill-advised
youth and Chris did all really happy
okay he told me to go and do it I did
but yeah I think it's the same way with
these watches they don't really provide
that much extra functionality so they
should at least try and retain some of
the strengths of a basic normal watch
that you can have and that's what level
does so well it's pretty light it has
much longer battery life whereas the
gear tries to give you apps in the app
so just a freaking joke because they're
like no you can see okay lion the
Japanese messaging app it's quite
popular internationally now and there's
somebody walking get us at extreme Oh
God okay but with the line messaging app
i get a message from Sam my colleague in
Japan and I can't reply to him on the
gear I can just send him a sticker so he
can talk to me I can't talk you can see
sticker stickers from the galaxy gear do
not buying it come on that's yeah so
what exactly glad was reviewing it i
also had one to use with the note 3 for
the past few days and everything of Lana
said is a hundred percent on point and
his review is entirely accurate but I
will say that the the number one thing
that drove me nuts on the gear was the
fact that it would buzz my wrist and
tell me that I had an email and it would
show the gmail notification and that's
all it would tell me it wouldn't give me
a subject and wouldn't tell me who it
was from it wouldn't tell me if it was
important or not the only thing I could
do
be tap the screen which would tap the
icon and would then go to the phone
would then open up the email app and
show me this stuff I need you to know
which means that I had to pull the phone
out of my pocket every single time so it
was just like you know there's a lot to
be said for the fact that like something
like the pebble or other watches don't
let you respond to notifications but at
least they give me enough information
that I can make a judgment call if it's
an important thing or not so literally
every PR email would buzz my wrist and
then I would have to look at my phone to
see if it was important enough to take
action on which was like I'd rather not
have the notification my rest at all
yeah that's exactly and I think a lot of
the commenters on a review got the point
about it it's supposed to be a companion
device supposed to be a device that lets
you not take the phone out of your
pocket but if the scenario the damage is
described is exactly it makes you have
to take the phone out ok you know so you
could you could maybe justify the price
if it really was the kind of thing that
saves you from bringing the phone out of
your pocket out of your clutch or
whatever man purse you have going on you
know you can keep that device in there
and do a bit of triage with your watch
that would be brilliant if you could do
it but you can't so the other thing is
something tries to you know make this
into a stylish device into fashion
device a fashion accessory etc but it's
not pretty enough to justify how dumb it
is and it's not smart enough to justify
how ugly it is well and like that is
really exact work the pedometer you said
does it work very well and the modesty I
haven't used that many parameters so
maybe do kind of shitty but this one was
just atrocious like some of them are
okay you wave your hand in the air and
you gain eight steps and it's like well
that right you know well the other thing
is like the isn't there's a hassle with
it actually like displaying the time
right yeah ok so the pebble has a
beautiful wrist flick like it works all
the time and it's immediate well over a
mistake screen is displaying this it's
displaying it all the time at the wrist
flick only turns on the backlight
right exactly exactly great point but if
Samsung to just recreate the exact same
Rick I'd be perfectly happy it's just
that it doesn't it wants you to raise
the arm rather than flick your wrist and
then there's a one or two seconds like
well not to second but like almost a
one-second delay before it shows you the
time which is ridiculous because when
you want to check the time you want to
do it as quickly as possible or not
think about it well not let anybody know
you're doing that's the whole reason I
wear watches I want people to know i'm
bored so i can just glance at it without
anybody knowing yeah yeah as wide noted
the delay is is killer on the gear like
I would the he explains this in his
video but you you gesture as you lift it
up like this and then it turns on but
you lift it up and then be 120 there we
go that's the time which is like
absolutely insane do not like all right
the only thing about Samsung I guess is
they released a gold-colored s4 which is
like golden pink gold and pink cool job
guys but we should we should we should
talk about that just momentarily because
Samsung had to clarify very explicitly
that they announced that it's a for like
over twenty seventh and got into stores
by September eight so Apple clearly
obviously patently so please answer I
would just like to get that on the
record on samsung Seahawks how many how
many gold the s4 is did you buy Chris
zero and I'm gonna I'm gonna stand by
that number because it's it's a an
affront to to all that is is good and
pure and anyone who buys or considers
buying a gold 5s should feel bad about
themselves five srs for ya es force oh
sorry I have the 5s on mind I definitely
didn't buy any galaxy s coordinate if
and what color five of us did you get
the slate gray which by the way I was
talking with Josh about this the other
day I think there was a lot of like
consternation
about the fact that they went from black
to a less black black with the 5s I
actually think it looks better because
it's like gunmetal now it's pretty
disagree I disagree completely the thing
the thing with the original iphone 5
black is it looks so cool like it was
like murdered out I remember we've all
first thought we were like oh my god
that looks amazing all murdered out
black and it had like the chamfers had
just like that just right enough like
catching the light bleeds and now you
look at it and it's just a great phone
and it's like it may be more durable I'm
sure it is they will chip and we're off
as much but the murdered-out iphone 5
black iphone 5 is still better-looking
might be until you get to like day three
and it's now silver instead of black
because it's all of the chamber has been
shipped away right yeah that being says
how do you manage to get back to talking
about iphones again even though it
always happens my only initiative and
renews and with my only goal on this on
this show and on every show really is to
turn the conversation to the iphone guy
i just wanna I need to point out that
some some account retweeted my tweet
about Vlad broadcasting from the street
and I got insanely excited a second ago
until I actually clicked through that it
was not in fact the real justin bieber
who retweeted me but i just saw the
alert justin bieber retweeted your tweet
so that would have meant that justin
bieber would have been following you to
see that well he was would've been
following the verge let's yeah let's be
very clear if Justin Bieber had
retweeted that tweet it probably would
have brought down the verge I understand
we have we have terrific infrastructure
powering our site but Justin Bieber has
like a 7.5 billion Twitter followers we
would not have been able to stay up I
just would have quit I mean I just like
the yeah you've kind of it just you just
think about what that would have done
for your Klout score oh my god did you
guys see the amazing picture of Justin
Bieber being carried up the great wall
china
no no so apparently he was at the base
he's in china on unto her he was at the
base of the great wall china and he's
like I want to go to the top of the
Great Wall of China but I don't feel
like walking up there so he had his
bodyguards literally carry him to the
top and and then set him back down and
there oh my god I'm internet it's
amazing oh my god this ridiculous anyway
we don't have to spend too much longer
time I jointed like use just a beard
going up pretty well China as a segue to
something but I got nothing um we should
talk about we were complain about
cameras earlier we should talk about the
xperia z 1 z 1 and mostly the big
feature the big thing is the camera here
and this is another one yours in the
plan yeah tell me about the third one
yeah I think I just launched another
rent so we don't do the whole BBC
correspondent from the other side of the
world thing those interviews actually
quite brilliant you listen to the radio
and it's like so tell us about any other
person interjects and then the other
person poses and then first person for
this anyway the z1 ok well i think i
think a big part of it is kind of talk
to you by the name because it still has
experienced that name of the phone that
came out six months ago so at least on
the outside is almost identical with
just a little bit bigger and sometimes
done a few upgrades but really is taken
the phone it already has and just tried
to an has to try to make it better and
it's cool posturing again so you don't
feel like such a creep just hit smug but
you know i am mobile and this is my
name's rosamma passing myself one of my
neighbors some mobile so technically
this is like how the first mobile show
should be happen alright so the said one
so it has a 20 megapixel camera and the
first complained i would have about any
20 megapixel cameras why wasted nobody
wants way megapixel pictures you can't
even do 20 megapixel pictures that are
good enough so don't do that and I
Sony preempted that complaint and what
it does is it all samples and does a
megapixel photos using the 20 megapixel
sensor which gave it was like for me so
it's kind of a pure vu PureView ask so
fed to some degree yeah yeah i mean
nokia obvious a 41 is like two times
20.7 but nokia the only thing locate is
left to do nowadays just talk trash
doesn't have a product so I mean anyway
I don't want to bring showdown talking
about nokia so I mean the camera the
camera is actually I kind of complained
about its inconsistency last week which
I still think it's fair is inconsistent
but having spent more time taking more
photos with it it actually can do some
really impressive things ages I don't
know I guess you kind of have to work it
a little bit more you kinda have to get
used to the new UN's because the other
thing with smartphone cameras is that
every one of them has its strengths and
weaknesses depending on how the guy
structure the software and sort things
out so over time as you get used to your
device you might notice oh that your
photos improve you know so you might get
used to samsung strengths and weaknesses
you might get used to so many strengths
and weaknesses cetera but I can see how
you know if people versus the time with
this experience at one that can get some
really nice and satisfying folks I mean
female say is if you really really just
want an awesome camera should go to the
Lumia 1020 and azita says abandon or
email that will probably resolution but
said I think it's a good phone uh five
inches is still too big for me and no i
didn't i'm very picky I've engine still
too big to me and I think so is going in
the wrong direction by making it thicker
and taller and things are that the
display out of a disappointment to right
yes it is but well it is to everybody
else it isn't to me because more for me
to be disappointed by sony mobile
display i will need to
I should be good and I reviewed every
Sony flagship over the past I know what
it's for years and every single time my
complaint has been if they could just
put a good display on this is they just
put a goodness wearing this would be in
business research I think the only so
many smart phone that didn't bother me
with sony ericsson xperia mini and i was
because I had like a fringe displaying
it didn't really matter anyway the
Xperia mini is a finer points raising
the boys out on every show because his
beautiful shell it deserves up an enemy
depot yes it approached yeah um but
funny thing i wanted to say about these
everyone is that it continues the whole
waterproof phone thing from Sony which
I'm a big supporter of I want everybody
to follow that trend and also sony has
improved by opening up the headphone
jack so now you no longer have that
pretty pretty annoying plastic cover on
top of it so it's a waterproof phone an
Oakland headphone jack you can use it in
the shower this one I didn't try in the
shower but it is it's good you know you
don't worry about what you have to worry
about thus you can actually give it to
you builder friends which I have a few
of and they all say I can't use a
smartphone because I'm your reference
I'm sorry whined that a bit your what
front of friends people who work in
constructions it was so let me get this
right you're walking around the streets
of London in the middle of the night
right now you're giving phones to build
her friends so something sounds a little
shady here are you in the mob Vlad well
I look like I am don't I write a little
bit I could make a hoodie joke here but
i'm gonna let it pass um yeah that's
what I'm saying oh my god don't don't
there we go see now I almost look like
Aaron Harrison yeah you're uh what yeah
you're getting chilly it's over now yeah
well it's also the middle of the night
serious concerns about your safety Vlad
is all I'm saying now dude I'm the most
dangerous thing in this area which is
legit which actually tells you how safe
it is is this is why I'm happy to live
here it's Oh mommy's with strollers and
things like that it's like the one nice
area London I'm are alerting you by
better I think they already beat you to
it ah I don't know yes I beat you vs and
by the way I'm carrying on every mobile
show from out here on the street from
now on it's together you should turn
your phone sideways they'll give us give
us the landscape you there okay can we
lost care couple yeah i just broke
hangouts go hang out ah um dan have you
played with the the cyber-shot the qx10
the qx100 these crazy anna i haven't
played with the qx10 i played with the
qx100 which is no no I got that
backwards I didn't play with the qx100 I
played with the qx10 which is the one
with the big zoom right in the smaller
size sensor and you know David review
them this week and they show a lot of
potential a lot of promise ah because
you can get great photos with them and
you can actually get photos with them
that you can't get with your smartphone
camera but the execution on them kind of
everything just falls apart on that it
just takes too long to get the thing out
of your bag or your pocket or whatever
connected to your phone get the app open
and take your picture at that point you
know your moment is already long gone
and read the picture with a regular
camera or your smartphone so so kind as
always in their defense so sorry within
the defense i've also used the qx10 and
i think everybody seems to be making
that mistake of calling the cue extend
the qx100 it's kind of a mess but it's a
lower-end model the cheaper model i also
use that and i have to say you know no
disagreement with the issues of the guys
had in the US but it's just a lot of fun
like practicalities set aside everybody
who used the qx10 or
all saw it or played around with it they
smiled it made people smile I mean Tom
Warren Microsoft's loving colleague I
mean he he was just grinning you know he
was playing around with it and it was
grinning is really enjoying it and is
this thing that everybody emphasizing
their marketing which is to delight the
user and everybody wants to do it but
it's very rare to see that and I really
enjoyed playing around with it maybe
that maybe that's like a knob booty a
sensation that was off all the time I
don't know but everybody has seen play
around with these lenses is really
enjoyed the whole experience so I think
as a gadget and as a thing to play
around with it can be a lot of fun it
sounded from our review like David
actually I can't believe he did this but
it sounded like he actually threw the
lenses in the air and took pictures
while they were spinning in the air
which I like I would not trust myself to
catch it again without damaging it but
it sounds like a lot of fun yeah the
remote the remote viewfinder thing is
really really cool really that's a nice
a point it up and improve the software
on it that's the problem like I I'm
really into this idea if they executed
well and what's the point I was going to
make earlier is like we've been talking
about camera sensors like off and on
this whole show and it seems like nobody
has any complaints about the sensors
themselves anymore and obviously the
sensors on these things are amazing but
just like the software I've ranted about
this last week you like stop everything
and just fix the software and this time
it's not the like processing software
it's the actual like can you get the
viewfinder up to take a picture fast
enough software right well what's
surprising to me I didn't expect this at
all they're using literally the same app
on the phone that they use with the the
next series and the RX series which is a
really featureless app like I expected
that the app for the QX series would
have you know like all the traditional
controls associated with like a decent
point shoot camera but in reality of
PlayMemories mobile or whatever the heck
it's called is just a viewfinder and a
shoot button and like flash on off and
that's it it's really basic
right and if you're an iPhone user and
you're using it and you're pairing with
the lens it's because the iphone doesn't
have NFC it has you have to manually
jumpstart that connection to do the
Wi-Fi ad hoc thing so it's it like
another step that it takes to get the
thing to talk to your phone yeah and I
bought an X 6 on Dan's advice and I love
it but I never used the Wi-Fi features
more than once because I'm going through
that process was such a fiasco that it
just wasn't worth my time right
especially when there's way better
controls on you know the camera itself
oh did you guys look at this picture the
nexus 5 that went up last night I did
and what do you think it looks nice
looks fine it's got matte finish on it
I'm really curious what this giant
sensor lens on the camera this big huge
circle around it that means anything
maybe it's just aesthetics but like for
all intents and purposes this is it this
looks like it's just a g2 right that's
what it seems though the rumors or
whatever the the FCC leaks that have
come out thus far put it at having a
smaller screen than the g2 which is
right a good thing yeah and fewer fewer
back buttons also yes most importantly a
distinct lack of back buttons but like I
said would then review the g2 if you
know Google just takes this thing fixes
the button issue and keeps most
everything else the same and then
installs Android 4.4 KitKat with no
embellishments on it then it would be a
really great device now oh hello John
career just posted a link to your Galaxy
gear review congratulations um you got
firewalled yeah so I mean we're
expecting this in October right the
nexus 4 is basically sold out everywhere
i think google said the google is not
bringing it back Google's not bringing
it back KitKat they've announced KitKat
it's android 4.4 which I still am kind
of bummed that it's not five but
whatever
so we're looking like we're like this
month we're thinking does anybody else
think it's October I think we're gonna
get pushed in november this year
together will certainly make sense
there's a plane flying orange wire Vlad
is now at Heathrow no I am in London I
wrote an entire report about this London
is the most nice polluted location in
Europe as far as airplane noises concern
you did write a report about it and it
did very well we got a lot of interest
and commentary on that and that post
yeah I mean I it certainly would make
sense to see the nexus 5 get announced
and even released this month there do
they don't have an another phone that
they're selling right now except for the
google play editions unless last year
what actually over a year from where the
nexus 4 was originally planned to be
announced because it was originally
scheduled to be announced an event that
happened to coincide with hurricane
sandy uh all right new york city so it
actually ended up getting pushed back so
that was the end of September so so
we're a full year on from the Nexus
force originally planned announcement so
yeah we're definitely do for something
yeah wow you know that actually reminds
me when they will announce in the Galaxy
Nexus I think that yeah that was a time
when Steve Steve Jobs side and they
actually bumped their event back by two
weeks so they seem to have really
unfortunate track record of planning the
next Nexus and then something horrendous
hat so thanks for sitting something bad
happen yeah and then two weeks from when
that bad thing happens new Nexus right
well we just had the government shutdown
so there's that uh oh good point um I
don't know what man there's so much crap
that we could talk about that I don't
know we need to um well we should let's
talk about blackberry we got to get into
the so they they had their they made
their q2 results official they wrote off
a billion dollars on the z10 they wussed
out they chickened out of having
the investor call where people could
actually asked Orson Hines questions
directly they just put out the results
in a press release and that's it they're
probably going to get bought or not
bought but go private with this this
weird company forget his name but then I
think it was who was it Globe and Mail
yeah in paper yeah they wrote a big like
super long report on like some of the
boardroom drama that's been happening
about every within blackberry basically
since like since we wrote our big long
history of what went wrong at blackberry
like what's been going on since like the
shake-up with both silly and lettuce and
and that and dan I know you've got a lot
of feelings and thought ah well I first
want to say that you know out of that
report there was some really actually
interesting stuff that came out that the
fact that this wasn't known before but
apparently uh Balsillie had a plan to
take BBM to the various carriers around
the world was kind of no replace their
SMS service Lisa wasn't known to me and
we I guess it wasn't was talking to some
people but we didn't know the depth of
what it was he was planning and this is
what's so interesting is like he wasn't
just gonna release a BBM app on all the
platforms he wanted to like partner with
carriers for it and call it SMS 2 point
0 which is what's so hilarious it's like
you know BlackBerry's solution is to to
like the app explosion is to take their
service and I thi more tightly with
carriers instead of flat left because
we're talking about blackberry I don't
blame him to like partner with the
carriers and like try and like get a
revenue stream that way instead of like
going directly to consumers and then
like he basically got like run out based
on this plan like it we knew it was we
kind of a suspected it was like that and
there had been some Hinson reports that
it was related to that but it's like
really like he had a pretty ambitious
plan that I think could have done
something interesting for them and they
like nope goodbye were we're gonna you
know try and sell the consumers again
one last time and it cost him a billion
dollars and the company yeah I just felt
like this whole this whole report went
really easy
on both silly and Lazarus and really
hard on Heinz who has been CEO of the
company for a year and a half now prior
to that the coat they were co-ceos for a
decade or whatever um and pretty much
the entire thing pins all the blame on
uh on Heinz and all the things that he's
done since 2012 and blackberry is I just
find it so hard to believe BlackBerry's
a Titanic and Lazarus steered it into an
iceberg and like you know what you don't
get to be captain anymore you kind of
steered us into an iceberg and then
Leslie it's like no no you shouldn't
release the z10 first you should release
the q10 first because our brand is built
on physical keyboards and that stupid
not to do the other thing like no no we
were wrong and like plus we just might
have been right about that like him
saying they should have released a black
keyboard version of the keep the the
blackberry 10 that the q10 instead of
the all touch screen version is like him
saying you know that deck chair it
should go over there it's exactly over
there that's exactly right the deck
chair looks way better on that side of
it I don't even know that it does
actually write tonight in that case
though because you know the q10 isn't
exactly flying off the shelves ah no you
know it's like it's not it's not a
galaxy s4 selling device or an iphone 5
selling device or whatever it is like a
blackberry hasn't told us exactly how
many cute ends its old but there's been
lots of anecdotal evidence that nobody
is buying them just like nobody was
buying the c10 uh terms of capitalizing
on what little goodwill you have left
like that's how you do it that's how you
get a little bit of life jump back into
it and I don't like the q10 I think that
it feels the kitchen took a long time to
get to market as well didn't it yeah it
did is it took a while and it was easy i
think it took like a few months after
announcement and there was some there
was some drama going on there too that
we never really heard anything about but
we were given the review unit for the
q10 literally I think months over the
ATT version of the q10 literally months
before was released on 80s and I
I never understood or found out why that
was I don't know if it was held up if
there was like a verification bland 18
tease network or if there was some other
like business related drama that we
didn't hear about but something was
holding it up well beyond a burger with
like ready to release I know exactly
what was holding it up the the guy who
was in charge of giving final approval
to the q10 at 80 was trying to triage
his email on a keypad and just couldn't
do it and lost he can you please make
this thing live email in his eyes
because he was using the q10 I honestly
I honestly wonder if now that we know
for sure that the c10 is at was
absolutely not selling I honestly wonder
if 18 he was like we haven't sold any of
ec tens why should we be selling the q10
yeah and that that could have could have
delayed it but I think back to the
global mail thing you know I if if you
read through it it's so easy on las
Sirena's that I it's almost as if he
goes throughout the report I mean it's
like it talks all about how you know
there's all this innovation that they
had and all these great things that he
did and stuff and then you know they
pass over the company to fell apart and
is like well it didn't really happen
that way because it was falling apart
really quickly really for a long time I
waited until 2010 to invest in a
competitor to the iPhone the iPhone had
been on the market for three years
already well lettuce was almost
certainly a primary source for that
piece in fact he he may have gone to the
globe and mail and said hey you guys
should be writing like a real story
about what happened cuz you know keeping
my little is well Oliver let me tell you
the real story right i mean less Rinus
leather eNOS is like very interested I
mean he's like a pretty big figure still
in and around Waterloo I'm sure that he
has a lot of interest in like setting
his legacy and I'm sure that he thought
that like you know helping to inform
accurately or inaccurately this 10,000
word feature in Canada's I think largest
newspaper i'm not mistaken what was a
good start on that you know there was
there was just some really strange
things all throughout it like it said
that you know that when the iphone was
released in 2007 to blue them awakes
ahead to processors
which unless you're counting like a
modem and a pry the actual like
processor is two different things I
don't understand and they also said the
iphone launched without email which
again I don't really understand and then
it said that they launched blackberry or
BBM messenger for iOS and Android which
never actually happened because they
screwed it all up and and now it's
delayed and nobody knows what exactly
it's going to watch so there's a lot of
things that report that that made me go
hmm hmm yeah um I don't know about you
guys maybe it's like a thing to do with
my lag over here but the entire
blackberry story just bores me to tears
Thank You Ike I can't even get excited
about it I mean we we kind of know that
he was complacency from those top guys
that drag things down and now we just I
mean it is it's a sad story as well
because we spend if you remember this is
episode 64 you remember one of our
running things with the show was we'll
say something positive about blackberry
one day and I don't think that's ever
going to happen so now coming back to it
and like looking at the CEOs and how
they trying to cover up their
reputations or rebuild them or whatever
is yeah I guess I guess I just fluctuate
between being bored and being sad but
just very briefly while I have the leg
advantage over here and on the topic of
dying companies I just wanted to remind
people that no key is also holding an
advantage of Tober and hopefully
provided they allow me to get over there
I'm going to go and attend it and look
at what Bucky has to show not a week
it's no everyone everybody pretty much
anticipates that yeah it's a nokia world
i mean that basically tells you nike to
stop doing knock it was like a couple
years ago and now they're just branding
this event nokia world because pretty
much going to be their last big event
you know that is anticipating this
enormous lumia 1520 Abu Dhabi that's
right daddy I don't know why we
mentioned in the location like people
gonna go to him something oh yeah I'm
just gotta grab the
papo launch events usually happen in
specific locales that are relevant to
their markets that they serve and and
generally they're in big western cities
I don't I can't think of any other tech
event that we've been invited to or
covered that's been in Abu Dhabi so I
mean that's kind of a welding note to me
I mean you know it is it's sort of it
may be that Microsoft is gonna have to
pay this bill eventually so damn the
torpedoes we can spend whatever we lie
let's just a counter a counterpoint to
that the Galaxy Nexus which we were
talking about earlier was was launched
in announced tin in Hong Kong of all of
all places without that was that was
delayed it was supposed to be announced
it yeah but that's right but that
doesn't mean you know like that didn't
mean that you need to send the entire
world technology press to Hong Kong
although there was an event was there an
event in Hong Kong that it coincided
yeah there was a no things the up right
there that's what it was yes so I guess
it means and they decided to coincide
with it Yeah right hey born with that
eventually should I give you guys in the
inside a story in there yes please do I
don't think we have a choice okay lolu
okay well with the Galaxy Nexus because
I actually went to that event and what
happened is that it was just as the
verge was setting up to launch was like
a couple of weeks ahead of it and well
basically everybody thought that we had
an exclusive on the Galaxy Nexus because
I just turned up to the event really
early and they just had the phone out
and they'll take me some professional
photos of it and I just grabbed some
photos and some video of it and yeah Wow
everybody else was scrambling later on
we just had all the stuff in advance and
we just look pretty smart and
professional warriors kind of like I've
had breakfast of got nothing else to do
just go to the event and as usual it was
disorganized as the messy and we
profited from that glad you were
supposed to let our viewers believe that
we were given an exclusive on the Galaxy
Nexus is blue car before before the
village even existed it was like hey
Google flag was the flat dozen football
you don't give glad exclusives he takes
six
by force uh yeah so glad I have a very
important question for you when you're
in Abu Dhabi are you going to reenact
the scene from a mission impossible
ghost protocol where they're there
they're like outside the the Burj
Khalifa isn't that Dubai are they the
same place by being that ignorant I have
a more important question will you see
nirmal when you're there already made
that joke on Twitter yes take that back
all right I think Dan's right about
Dubai and the Burj Khalifa and yeah I
don't anticipate I'll be rappelling down
any skyscrapers if anything myself until
more my share a hot tub but that's
probably gonna be the most adventurous
thing with you oh yeah you're right Bert
yeah burj khalifa is in dubai not every
day huh my dad just stuck with the
normal joke man that ladies and
gentlemen is the verge mobile show we
want to thank you so much for watching
if you want to follow us on twitter you
should you can you will I am back on
Dan's TCC for chris's said power vlada
sweats a bob we are all advert on this
post right now on the verge calm and
