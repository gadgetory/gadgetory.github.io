automotive industry was in the 1890s
okay in the 1890s have you remember your
automotive history cars had tillers okay
steering wheels took about 15 years
we're in that period where the phone the
core design of the phone the innovation
isn't done yet increasingly experiences
and also user interfaces will be free of
the full operating system plumbing I
think that's something that the industry
doesn't follow so that means that you'll
see more and more experiences and also
changes and innovation and experiences
regardless of platform and what we did
the work we did on the n9 what we've
already publicly said elements have that
come in to other products and continue
including the swipe interface including
cute
including the design language of physics
on language which is here in the Nokia
Lumia it starts with better design on
the glass actually what I've called
sloppier gestures so that you can just
use something without having to
completely pay attention to it I think
the live tiles are a perfect example
already of a much more glanceable UI
than for example iOS 5 where you're
basically looking at a grid of icons
requires quite a lot of attention and
immersion to discern and find right and
so these are much larger visual cues
that you can can look at I think voice
will be important but I think there's a
lot more innovation in that as well I
think a lot of interaction off the glass
will be important I'm not so interested
even while speaking to you about specs
I'm interested in perceived emotion and
perceived value I think definitely size
is driven by the American market right
now and if you look at our scale which
really takes in the world and Asia in
particular I think there'll be a counter
trend which is smaller thinner closer to
the skin I think in the future we'll be
seeing many more smaller things that are
actually the main deal of interaction
when we met we looked at what what's the
best design that would sit with that UI
that we had already going and then we
looked at the principles we used to
design it in both teams again and there
was such a match we said hey
this just works it's really it's just
better together when you put them
side-by-side okay I understand
here's Metro here's the design language
we used and put them together if you
really look out there it's gray and
black rectangles with rounded corners
right now and this is something
different</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
