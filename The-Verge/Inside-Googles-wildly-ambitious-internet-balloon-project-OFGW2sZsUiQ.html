federal airfield Google is attempting to
do something that balloon experts deemed
impossible deliver high-speed Internet
access to the most remote corners of the
globe the first 60 or so balloons we
launched all burst when they got to
altitude which was very sort of
disheartening this is something that has
never been asked of balloons before to
be reliable and to do what we expect
them to do before it was just sort of
like a vehicle to gain knowledge now
we're trying to make a business launched
in 2012 the first two years of Project
loon were a process of rapid iteration
the team had to prove it was possible to
deliver reliable Internet access to
specific locations in the most remote
parts of the globe they began with the
simplest possible approach Electronics
stuffed into a Styrofoam beer cooler
floating at the edge of outer space when
that didn't fail they kept moving
forward
wait Google X works as we try to prove
it can't work so the first thing we did
was took a router food on a weather
balloon up to 10 kilometers and see if
you could still get a signal and that
part worked and since then it's been a
continuous process of trying to stretch
the envelope a little bit more every
time to see how far it would go
last year the team made a critical
decision switching from a wireless
router to an LTE antenna we are just
like a cell phone tower but in the sky
and the same way that their central
office of the telco interacts with all
their self towers they will interact
with our balloon another way to think
about it is if you drive down the
highway on a phone call you will switch
between cell towers what we're doing is
kind of flipping that on its head so
you're standing still in the ground with
your LTE phone and as one balloon goes
overhead another balloon comes in range
and you're switching between one balloon
to another without dropping the call the
balloons today can cover five thousand
square kilometres on the ground you can
get 15 megabits per second to your phone
or if you have a little MiFi device you
can get 40 megabits per second from the
balloon but have you guys considered
just selling this is like a toy for
children's parties and stuff yeah some
hash tell me where it is we're seeing
here what are you seeing here is a test
of our next generation balloon we are
doing a ground based inflation trying to
mimic what is happening in space I
remember when we were building balloons
it would take us a week to build them
and they would go up and pop and come
back down when you first launched it was
a pretty nerve-wracking our balloons
were lasting anywhere from a day to day
and a half maybe two days if you had
like a five-day balloon it was like
Eureka but as we went along
one of the first objectives was what is
a goal or target is 100 days ideally for
us to have a very commercial business
here I have a fashion design degree it's
a lot of working with textiles flat
patterns working into three-dimensional
space we do a lot of different tests
with balloons built in different ways
they might be a different shape they
might have an extra feature we might
change the dimension of a feature and
try and figure out what works and what
doesn't rather than wind
and starting all over from start we were
looking for industries where we can
actually leverage information from one
of the areas we looked at was food
packaging industries agricultural
industries even down to the condom
industry and so where these are the
places where we need to actually figure
out even the tiniest pinholes that
matter can actually limit the lifespan
of the balloon by like 15-20 days our
longest lasting balloon is was up for
173 days until we brought it down now
we've gotten the point where most of the
balloons will last over a hundred days
go and we're awake
ha don't put your fingers in there yeah
what you're seeing is a balloon inside a
balloon we have an unique way of
actually adjusting the altitude in these
balloons this balloon has a constant
volume and there is helium in it right
so the helium brings the balloon up and
now if we want to change altitude we
have another balloon inside the balloon
that we fill with air and as we add more
air in there the mass is going to
increase and the balloon is going to go
down okay this is called Haun's and we
named it that because there was a
Saturday Night Live skit which was Hans
and Franz is going to pump you up and
what it does is it's a little fan and it
pumps air into the balloon it's easy to
steer the balloon by picking up
different winds in different wind
directions at different altitudes by
doing small change with altitude you can
do something like this you go up use
this wind then go down use this wind and
go up down up and down
so this balloon has straps holding the
apex up and that balloon did not right
which is why it's sitting down there
yeah because yesterday when we were
filling it up I got in a twist to the
point where it just did that
that's what happened there you go
so the but we just popped the Ballon a
because it was twisted that was the test
here over the last six months Google has
run tests with Vodafone Telstra and
telef√≥nica utilizing their networks to
provide connectivity to customers who
normally live with little or no internet
access loon believes that it can provide
service to these remote regions at a
fraction of the typical cost
communication satellites are typically
pretty expensive hundreds of millions of
dollars to build and 100 million plus to
launch whereas the balloons are an order
of magnitude or two cheaper to operate
on a sort of daily basis it's too
expensive to build wires and cell towers
and fiber optics out to all these remote
rural regions but the balloons are very
cost-effective so the this gives the
telco a way to reach everyone in their
country with a cost-effective way right
now loon mostly operates in the southern
hemisphere where it's had better luck
securing over flight permissions but the
project has potential applications for
developed nations with widespread
internet access as well because the
balloons live in the stratosphere they
have a unique advantage over terrestrial
Internet infrastructure there's no
weather in the stratosphere which means
if there is a hurricane or a typhoon
that knocks out power or Internet
connectivity to people on the ground
even in places like Japan or China or
other places around the world
the balloons provide a very exciting
ways to immediately let people have
connectivity 10 seconds after the
natural disaster curves as long as I
have a battery-powered phone in their
pocket people will be able to instantly
get access to the balloon network
sometimes people think of Google X as a
research lab that's not necessarily a
business but that's not true all of the
projects on Google X have to have a
business plan a business case and the
business case for Project loon is really
exciting it's still early stages in our
project in terms of figuring out how big
it can grow it's great for bringing
Internet to four billion people on earth
who don't have it and bring all the
benefits education medical information
or weather reports but it's also a
business in itself a very good business
if many of these 4 billion people even
paying what they can afford one or two
percent of their monthly income can now
afford to have Internet
and it's a very good business in itself
increasing the internet penetration by
10% in a country will increase the GDP
by about 1.4 percent per year
so in many ways technologies that can
increase internet penetration of 10 or
20 percent can double the growth of
standard of living of half the countries
in the world but this thing yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
