Bluetooth speakers are surprisingly
subtle gadgets you don't think you
really need one until you've tried one
or in my case about ten of them but once
you start bringing a speaker with you to
the beach in the park and yes even the
shower you'll be shocked how much you
enjoy having crisp clear music at a
moment's notice
pretty much every consumer electronics
brand with an audio department has slept
or logo on a tube shaped speaker and
there are hundreds upon hundreds of
super cheap ones with subpar sound
finding the best one one that will last
and sounds good and basically any
situation that involves a little bit of
research and maybe a bit of compromising
at around a hundred to two hundred fifty
bucks for a decent Bluetooth speaker
it's not a trivial purchase but there's
good news your choice isn't all that
hard
two years ago we said the best portable
Bluetooth speaker you can buy with the
logitech ue boom you wouldn't be too
disappointed if that's the one you
picked up right now today but there's an
even better choice
it's the logitech ue boom to the boom -
as you're now familiar so intrical
design but that gives a great 360
degrees sound plus it comes in a series
of neat color combos as for the upgrades
the speaker is now more durable and more
importantly it's waterproof that means
you can stand it up on the side of a hot
tub or even take it to the beach without
thinking twice that's not to say the
boom - is the best sounding portable
bluetooth speaker it's a bit lacking in
bass response and tends to sound best
friend pumping bright pop music or
really busy electronic but considering
its other perks the boom tube performs
well and enough genres and situations to
please most people you can also pair it
to another ue boom to really fill the
gaps it also gets about 15 hours of
battery life which is pretty normal yet
its range is stellar I walked about 30
feet away from it in a crowded part
before the sound began cutting out at
$200 it's one of the more expensive
options in the field but if you're
looking for the most well-rounded
speaker with really good sound you can't
go wrong with a Logitech UE boom - a
close second is the Bo play a1 it's a
$250 speaker that kind of looks like an
aluminum water canteen but it's still
attractive and it's really well made but
its looks aren't just what make it
special it also sounds incredible the a1
has full rich omnidirectional sound for
pretty much every genre of music
classical jazz hip-hop rock the a1 can
do it all and it's loud like really
really loud this link and fill your
entire apartment with crisp audio to the
point of competing with a surround setup
and a subwoofer there are trade-offs the
a ones range is on the shorter side and
it charges using USB type-c which can be
pretty annoying unless you happen to
have a few extra type-c cables lying
around
luckily the a1 has 24 hour battery life
to tide you over for long weekend trips
another downside it's not very durable
nor is it waterproof it could get pretty
beat up like mine did if you throw it
into a bag with your keys there are
countless Bluetooth speakers to choose
from but here are two lay you should
skip right away the beats pill plus is
just overpriced if it were a hundred
Reed
50 bucks cheaper it would be a better
deal instead you're paying two hundred
and thirty dollars that's 30 more than
the boom - for a device that doesn't
sound anywhere near as good
then there's the Amazon tap this speaker
has enormous potential but right now I
don't recommend spending your money on
it it has the Alexa voice assistant
built-in except you can't talk to it
like you can the echo instead you have
to hold down a button on the speaker to
activate the voice control oh and one
more thing it sounds kind of bad so the
bottom line here Amazon may have a
killer bluetooth speaker on its hands in
a few years with a second or maybe a
third generation model but not right now
the truth about Bluetooth speakers is
that they pretty much all do the same
thing connect to your phone and play
music if you're not a stickler for sound
quality you can just get one that looks
cool and doesn't cost you much but if
you want the best one the one that isn't
gonna bum you out when you turned it on
two years from now
logitech's latest model is the way to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
