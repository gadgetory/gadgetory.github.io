together a little video kind of a
montage and we want you to take a look
at it so check this out what a CES was

more time in Vegas before turning 21

goggles we are looking at the razor
blade this is the MakerBot replicator

about to ride the board of Awesomeness

whole pie

making a skateboard you Phil definitely
made it with the badge and this is the
inventor soul away and i'm getting off
right now everyone hears timing i don't
look at now for Justin Bieber they don't
know what they're talking about are you
taping this by jump I actually jumped

buildings over
when you are never to get into the
turntable room brianna 2 1 go that's
right
thank you did anyone get to see a
million volt vessel coil at this CVS yet
it's a lot of these people doing kind of
like in the trenches looking at porn
it's nonstop weird i don't have any tiny
where gets done right here you know you
want some of this bad man it is the one
place that you can go and deceive pretty
much every insane gaddy's possibly they

how freaking fun does that look I
thought it obviously is not as much fun
as it looks we're working so hard I
don't look at any of that I'm like let's
go back yeah no she do it egg oh yes we
should just want to i live in a trailer
now no it's really it's but we sleep
like three hours at night but that makes
it look like the best time they were in
there there are like amazing moments
there I think it's weird that I've
chosen to wear the same shirt and tie
today yeah that's wearing I think this
is your sat wave asking for a raise yes
you're like I could only afford one
jacket I don't wait on fancy consider
close yeah one fancy set wait so like
now that we are a month away is there
anything that like looks different to
you in hindsight anything sticks out now
I feel physically cleaner because i'm
not in the trailer tonight RV yes the
last night we went to the Cosmopolitan
which we were told was like the newest
fanciest hotel in Vegas no no wraps here
from the cosmopolitan Vegas are there
well I would just like if they are here
i'd like to say the inside of hotel is
very fancy it still looks like a 1920s
process it's weird it's like really
great that's the night please go to the
Cosmopolitan it was like this I'm stuck
into a flapper like a bar in Vegas it's
ferret there's a lot of weird stuff goes
right but the technology it kind of
there's not a lot of stuff that I walked
away from going like that was incredible
you know I'm still in that I'm still on
the TV thing really yeah cuz I you know
I your remote trip the remote trick I
think well you know I had a theory to
yes he was like Roma bubble change like
forget about the TV's changing the
remote has to change I think unless you
change how you interact with the TV you
can't change anything about the TV
itself and so I still think this is the
year when that has to change you have to
change like how you push the buttons and
if you're gonna yes or Apple all right
it's gonna cause is that what you're
saying and then what you're trying to
say it's nice fanboy I mean you're in
your shake that wasn't solved at the
show no I don't think so at all right I
come away from that you know that was it
was like we've already say they're pre
acting to Apple whatever they're going
to reacted proactive reactors we should
covered in my aura tira pre-action com
yeah that bitch you know but I think
that unless you figure out how to solve
the interaction problem you can't do it
i'm waiting that's your theory with the
remote has to change but you were
actually impressed by a TV there right
dude
8k sharp TV I just like I keep on
thinking about it how I want what is the
exact resolution of that 8k do you know
the exact resolution 8000 just eight
thousand things I don't know eight
thousand yeah it was a little apples in
a row I i I'm my I will say this like I
walked away I we talked to the CEO of
Nokia Stephen Elop stephanie lowe as we
like to call him and he was a kind of
fascinating guy he was really smart
really selling it I don't know when you
get in front of him june and and you
don't know what happens and like at two
hours later you find yourself like it
what he's claiming all right Tom Thomas
Ricker interviewed him chris ziegler
interview and then like they're like
glowing I think he might be doing I
think he might be a vampire and he's
like what do they do on true blood they
somebody knows here come on glamour p
Wow Steve you too fast whichever one of
you that was your glamour somebody it's
like you look at them deeply than they
like forget what's going on and they
like you tell them what's to windows
phone yeah right by a windows phone I
was like whatever you want stupid when
you when you're done talking to Steven
were you wearing any clothes uh not from
the waist down that's so that's a good
sign I didn't something what i have and

lot and it's two hours later
