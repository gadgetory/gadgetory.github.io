critical darlings and pop producers
playing the biggest festivals and still
driving a dance floor at every nightclub
in town in this top shelf we're looking
at the equipment that makes it all
happen and what an amateur needs to get
in the game so here's what a basic DJ
setup looks the core is the music and
while some DJ's still use vinyl most of
them are playing it straight off a
laptop controlled by software like
trackers a rock if you want to play with
loops or scratching you bring in a
turntable or a CD jet which plugs into
the program as a controller and then
there's the mixer which keeps everything
sounding sweet and gives you one last
layer of controls as you send everything
out to the speakers we headed to a
popular Brooklyn nightclub to check out
some DJ setups in the real world
verboden opened up in Brooklyn last year
and it's become one of the city's most
versatile nightclubs hosting everything
from burlesque to deep house yoga
alongside the usual dance parties
production director Michael Roche showed
me around the space including the
massive sound system three walls of
video projection and one very big disco
ball the first I asked Roche just show
me the gear that makes it all happen
you've got a lot of bells and whistles a
lot cells and listeners so why don't we
start at the very beginning and kind of
start with the workhorse of the mixing
Nexus which is the pioneer djm 900 this
is kind of the central hub of everything
the mixer is what all of your playback
methods are going to be going through
before it hits the main system so your
CD players your turntables your computer
your sound card any of your outboard
effects or anything are all gonna be
controlled by this desk here it has
multiple inputs so you could put digital
inputs analog inputs and phono inputs on
a single channel so it basically gives
you almost 12 to 16 channels on one
mixer with just a flick of Oh having two
knobs let's talk about turntables now
yeah this is the Pioneer PL X 1000 bian
ear is now one of the few companies
making professional direct drive
turntable x' direct drive turntable
basically ensures that the speed that
you want the disc to play at continues
to play that way so this is the
top-of-the-line gear you know we're in a
nightclub but what if I just want
something as a hobbyist DJ this gear is
gonna be out of my league right I
wouldn't say that it's out of your
league but there are so many different
types of mixers and there are so many
different brands out there
that it's kind of important to do your
homework to find out what your actual
needs are ten to fifteen years ago you'd
only be working with the turntable byun
ear Allen &amp;amp; Heath Rane all these
companies have different models of
mixers that have come out through the
years at different price points that
will help you kind of find and narrow
down where you want to go the things
that have come out over the past few
years have given people a lot more
options on a consumer level that allow
you to do more with less
okay I mean that sounds like that sounds
like a great first step
absolutely mixers and MIDI controllers
are a good start but that's not all
there is to DJ you need to move the
crowd forge a connection between the
sound and the person who's playing to
learn more about that we met up with DJ
shifty at his place in Brooklyn my
friends this will be my greatest
performance shift he's one of the best
DJs around a two-time DMC world DJ
champion and a master using the tools of
the DJ to connect to an audience
I come from a battle DJ background where
you're really trying to push the
equipment and push the technique the
physical technique even the turntable
yet was not meant to be a scratch tool
the whole idea is almost like hacking
the equipment and seeing how you can
almost like push it beyond what what it
was meant to do but I'm always trying to
take the technology old and new and see
what I can do to sort of push myself and
push what I've seen other DJ's do so
walk me through your setup okay so first
I have the classic technics turntable
here the 1212 10 model this has really
been the industry standard for
turntables for 30 plus years I'm sort of
emulating what it would be like to use
vinyl but using it yet control my
software cuz well yeah when you say
emulating that sound we heard my C isn't
on the record that Oh a sample that's on
your computer that's a sample that's on
my canoe what's actually on the record
is this which is one of my favourite
songs it's not it's not for everybody
but what's happening is that signal is
getting sent to the computer and the
computer is sending the sound back out
changing the sound in the same way I'm
controlling the signal so if I go like
this what we'd actually hear was so it
lets you scratch her mp3s and this is
what's called a MIDI controller it just
gives me more ways to access features of
my program which is Traktor but rather
than clicking or hitting my keyboard I
do these sort of things on here and so
that's a much more natural comfortable
analog way of controlling digital sound
and then in the middle here we have the
mixer and this controls the sound from
the different decks this is sort of a
fancy mixer that I also have MIDI
control to jump around my song so really
all the sound is coming from the
computer and all this stuff is just to
give me different ways to control it in
a way that feels better than like
checking email yeah exactly
if suddenly I took all this away and I
was like okay just make the same sounds
with the software you could do it but it
wouldn't really be the same right for
the sort of stuff that I do
very active so I'll be like that you
can't really do in a computer and so
there's some sort of beauty to the to
the classic technics where you get this
level of control that I personally
haven't seen yet in in digital so if
someone's looking to get into this kind
of a bare-bones set up DJing their
cousins wedding what do they need how
much money is this gonna call first let
me say that DJing cousin's wedding is a
very important DJ gig so don't don't
take it lightly there's a lot of there's
a lot at stake the whole marriage is it
stay tuned yeah they may not talk to you
again one thing that's great about how
DJ technology has progressed is there's
always new tools available for you to
sort of figure out how you can improve
what you do so I have here the tractor
DJ app on my iPad rather than trying to
emulate turntables it's sort of a new
way of interacting with the sound and I
do know a couple professional DJs that
DJ with this and one other piece of gear
just one small mixer I'm so the audio
quality is good going to a system yeah
but there's a lot that can be done just
with your iPad in the end it's not about
the tools at all it's about using music
to connect with an audience that basic
skill is the same whether you're using a
thousand dollar controller or a two
dollar iPhone app of course an
entry-level mixer will help it sound a
lot better and a basic MIDI controller
will let you throw in some moves but
none of that will matter if you don't
have to write songs for the crowd
because it's so easy to produce music on
your own and get it sounding at a level
and you could really play in a club a
lot of DJ's our producers a lot of
producers are DJs and really you kind of
have to be both in this day and age
anyone can get equipment and learning
how to take a track and mix it into
another track what is gonna separate one
person from another is that person's
musical world that they create and
curate if you have skill sets to really
make it your own and manipulate it and
make it your own kind of performance
that's where you bring everything
together so if you can create this
distinct musical world which is
excellently performed with technique to
me this is the pinnacle of DJing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
