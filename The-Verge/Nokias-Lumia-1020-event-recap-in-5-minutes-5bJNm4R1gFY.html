1020 with the Lumia 1020 you will see
things you've never seen before we've
done this with sensor innovation and
technology we call oversample an
entirely new ultra high resolution 41
megapixel backside illuminated sensor
the 41 megapixel sensor can capture 34
megapixel and 38 megapixel image files
it is also simultaneously saving a 5
megapixel oversample image right at the
same time every pixel in the oversample
image is created using up to 7 pixels
from the sensor and this causes the 5
megapixel image to have the maximum
amount of detail theoretically possible
what we've also done is taken this over
sampling technology to the taking of
video as well could we combine our
floating lens technology with a giant 41
megapixel sensor can we do it now using
a series of ball bearings around the
housing and very small magnetically
driven motors to automatically
compensate for the movement of the hands
his same stabilization technology we've
also brought into video I'm in a moving
boat through the waves taking an image
of a of a sailing ship but notice how
the whole image is incredibly stable and
blur-free
another advance to support the taking of
really clear pictures includes the
addition of a xenon flash Lumia 1020
with a super-fast
xenon flash can freeze the motion take a
look with this device we have reinvented
zoom this image even after you take the
image zoom in same image you can read it
live down 11 away yes and here we go
the exciting thing is that I can zoom
out after taking the photo we
capture one image but save two versions
one is a full resolution image for
endless reframing opportunities the
other is the over sample image that we
save for sharing it takes a little bit
longer to process the image than with a
standard camera but no other cameras can
achieve what we achieve now we've made
this really easy to accomplish using a
new camera application for the Lumia
1020 called Nokia pro camera now what
there is with this camera application is
really easy access to changing all of
the camera controls for example exposure
values shutter x ISO settings manual
focus and white balance he can bring all
of the controls out at once the ones
that he adjusts are manual the rest stay
auto so it gets the best combination of
capabilities we have also added to the
Lumia 1020 rich audio recording
so that was just using the 1020 in that
room with that loud audio beautiful
audio experience I'm pleased to announce
the new Nokia imaging software
development kills CNN they're bringing
high-resolution zoom to their eye
reporter application VY clone Yelp and
Foursquare a new application from path
Flipboard a David Hockney inspired
application called pantograph a new
photo book app called snap camp
Hipstamatic will have an exclusive
application they will launch their Auto
Pro app with the Lumia 1020 we also are
working with hardware partners like
monster and JBL and even retailers for
wireless charging we will have a snap-on
wireless charging shell I'd like to
introduce the Nokia camera grip it also
has two steps shutter control for
increased control it has a tripod mount
on it and it adds an extra one thousand
and twenty milliamp hour battery built
into that shell we will be bringing the
Lumia 1020 to people very soon here in
the United States we plan to bring the
Lumia 1020 to people first with AT&amp;amp;T
