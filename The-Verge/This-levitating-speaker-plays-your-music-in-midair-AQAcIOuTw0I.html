verge and your eyes are not deceiving
you this speaker is levitating so this
is the Mara speaker it's by a company
called crazy baby
it was crowdfunded about two years ago
and now you can buy it for three hundred
and twenty nine dollars which is pretty
expensive but it levitates not many
speakers can say they do that there are
two pieces to it there's this big bulky
base on bottom and on top is what's
called the Mars craft so this is
actually a standalone Bluetooth speaker
you can pop it off and take it with you
so the Mars craft has a six hour battery
so you can take it with you take it out
of the house things like that just like
any a bluetooth speaker that's pretty
handy when you pop it back on this is
the subwoofer so the audio quality steps
up a notch and it sounds pretty decent I
mean I wouldn't say it sounds better
than any $200 Bluetooth speaker so the
hook here is definitely that it
levitates for what reason why who can
say so it stays in place pretty well to
pick some light bumps you can kind of
spin it and kind of mess around with it
and there's a button on the bottom that
actually turns this on I'm gonna be a
search around for it you do it makes
some really dramatic sounds so you know
you've turned on a three hundred and
twenty dollar levitating speaker very
dramatic so this piece is actually
waterproof up to three feet which is
pretty nice we can take it toss it in
the pool not too deep but if it falls
into like the shallow end you should be
okay take it to the beach take to the
pool pretty handy but again the audio
quality is not too much that's not
really why you're buying this you're
buying it for the stunts of impressing
your friends and family freaking people
out that kind of thing so the motors
uses magnets to pull off its tricks and
actually at this part can be stuck to
any metal surface so your fridge shower
so if you want something like this in
your life its $329 you can buy it at
Amazon and also Brookstone because of
course Brookstone would sell just this
kind of thing and that's the Mars by
crazy baby it's a floating levitating
speaker so take some bumps pretty well
it'll stay in place and just kind of
hang out
oops there is a limit to it but uh okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
