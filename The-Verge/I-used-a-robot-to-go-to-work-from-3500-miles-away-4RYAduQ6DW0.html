British
from Brit land and actually I'm still
there right now my boss has decided that
I should get to know people in our New
York office so they got me this thing
it's a telepresence robot the people who
make it say it's going to be all the
rage in the offices of the future so we
thought we test it now it's perfect now
telepresence robots have been around for
a few years but they've not yet caught
on this particular model is made by a
company named double robotics and it's a
good template for the genre
they're basically screens on wheels that
you move around either with an hour or
in a browser you log in basically just
like a Skype call and then you're good
to go in this thing I can move around as
we're doing now kind of shakily I can go
up with the screen like this and I can
also go down as well and I can also turn
around I can do the slowest pirouette
you've ever seen here we are still
happening and there we are we're back in
hey but our telepresence robots actually
any good when it comes to being in
office well yes and no the times I did
work using the bots like talking to my
editors about a story for example we're
great we sat in a room together and I
got to do the whole reading facial
expressions and interpreting tone of
voice thing but I never have over email
but this was just a face-to-face
conversation we might as well have been
talking over Skype and when it came to
actually moving about the office like
now things were a little less smooth for
start it feels a bit weird to make
people talk to a robot like it's a
normal conversation you know everyone's
just thinking wow this is deeply deeply
silly but they have to pretend like it's
not and the bot also has the motor
skills of a toddler which is good in
some ways because people felt
sympathetic for me they'd pick me up
when I fell over and they made sure I
didn't roll into any walls order however
I'd hate to use this thing as a boss and
try and tell someone off it just
wouldn't stick
so this is the thing about telepresence
sports they're just not serious devices
and you wouldn't want your whole
presence in an office to be based on
using one that fun yes and they're
satisfying to use but I don't think
they'll ever be more than a nice product
they're for emergencies or special
occasions if you want to work remotely
you've got a wealth of options and you
don't have to wait around for people to
open doors for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
