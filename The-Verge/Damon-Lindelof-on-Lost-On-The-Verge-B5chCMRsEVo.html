think the danger there and for what's
frustrating for people and I think that
with lost I think a lot of people feel
this way is that it ambiguities can
sometimes come off as not like hey
here's something for discussion but you
didn't know sure
or like you didn't have the answer right
right it's very frustrating to feel when
you when you're very attached and I
think alien is franchise obviously
people are very very attached to lost
obviously people are very attached to
and it's frustrating when you when you
love something and you really care for
it and you want there to be real answers
you know especially for comic book fans
and like like fanboys mm-hmm
getting the answers is really important
sure and so I think that the the fine
line you have to walk it with it with
being ambiguous is was it ambiguous
because the person you know doesn't have
the answer or is it ambiguous because
they want you to ask the question right
and and I think that that that's what's
that can be that's what can be
frustrating I mean I I told you I was
going to ask you about this I might as
well just get into it now I miss you I'm
a person who watched lost all the way
through again and thought the ending was
extremely disappointing okay
disappointing because it felt like if I
felt like the praat there was a promise
of something much more and not profound
maybe not more moving certainly not more
moving in my opinion but something
smarter right and it felt like it ended
on this in this way that was like well
so what was the point
uh-huh and so there the ambiguity was
not I mean there was there stuff that
was specific and stuff that was
ambiguous but I think there was it felt
like well they didn't have the answer
right this was the neatest way to wrap
it up share without having to answer any
of the questions or you know avoiding
some of the question right do you does
that now haunt you like that kind of
sense of people being of needing the
answer and not getting it and you having
to answer for it i mean i know you
tweeted about mass effect the end of
Mass Effect 3 sure you said I wasn't
involved in the ending of rewrite has
people been disappointed with some of
its ambiguity and sure does that feel
like it's haunting you and does it haunt
you with this
I think haunt is probably not as
accurate a word
as I think haunt sort of implies like
it's it's it's something that creates a
tremendous amount of stress and sadness
and fear for me as much as it is
something that I accept as a part of the
legacy of that show and do I embrace it
I embrace it in the same way that Matt
Damon embraces Robin Williams and Good
Will Hunting like under duress and
wanting to punch it too so like it is a
it is a it is a deeply conflicted
ongoing battle that I have but I have is
obnoxious and entitled as the sounds I
also have no regrets about it
like so in order to be haunted by it
like I think regret is part of haunting
where it's sort of like you know I if I
could go back in time I would do it
differently and for me I just sort of
feel that and again my own authorship
and lost I have to say there were a
bunch of other writers on the show there
was Jay Jay at its inception that was
Carlton all the way through there were
amazingly talented writers in the
writers room but I take responsibility
an authorship for lost in in terms of my
own feelings about the ending and I make
no apologies for it I do feel like that
was the ending that I wanted to do and I
was always comfortable with the
ambiguity of the show and I think that
that there were times over if there was
one regret that I had there there were
times over the course of the show where
in interviews I said the answers are
coming but if you I challenge you to
look at any interview that I gave post
the middle of season three which was the
turning point when they said we you can
we can now give you an end date to the
show because up until then there was
there was a degree of improvisation that
had to occur because we didn't know how
many of these things we were going to do
or how long we were going to be around
to be doing them once we said there's
going to be 48 episodes left at that
point a firm plan
had to come into motion then from that
point on I think that I started saying
publicly if you are watching the show
for the answers to your mysteries you're
not going to like the ending and I will
I will pull you know at least ten
instances of Carlton and I saying this
in interviews and major publications in
on television and I'll say hey you know
if if you didn't do your due diligence
and listen to what we had to say you
were warned right and I just it's not
that I didn't care about the mythology
of the show I just feel like many shows
have come and gone that are very focused
on their mysteries and their mythologies
and their ambiguity and there is no were
seen in the history of genre then the
architect explaining to neo everything
that happened in the matrix I wasn't in
touch that with a ten-foot pole that is
a particularly awful instance of over
explanation of like feeling like you owe
it to the audience right okay so we have
the architect and then we have lost and
the lost lost is not enough and the
architect is too much and somewhere in
between is just right and I'm going to
always be closer to lost than I am to
the architect because that is just not
interesting to me right and I think like
I my own storytelling the things that
capture my imagination and make me want
to re-engage are sometimes frustrating
and challenging but for lost it was like
by the way I will actually answer any
questions that you have about the show
but I won't say oh here's what it was I
will actually refer you I'll give you
the required reading if you're worried
about what the numbers were all about or
what was Walt's purpose or those aren't
the things that actually bothered me I
was sitting here I've just been sitting
here listening you talk about it I
realize I wasn't disappointed with like
with lost not giving me answers at the
end what I was actually disappointed
with the answer gave which it felt like
the answer was all the things that just
happened didn't really mean anything
they kind of didn't happen that was that
my takeaway from it what do you mean
they didn't it was like all the things
that happened all these things that were
set up as you know you've got to stop
the man in black because
X Y &amp;amp; Z sure uh it didn't matter right
Willy because it wasn't real is it was
well but not really and it was like it
was like a shared fantasy I mean it
didn't seem like there was like I mean
what No so so so the things that were
gone on the island were happening in the
actual world yes I cannot believe we're
talking about this by the way because I
had no plans to get into a detailed
conversation about it so they were
happen in like our timeline correct I
mean yes I mean there's no oceanic
Airlines in our no no I mean but but in
the real world not in it's like kind of
like moment before death fan they say
world where everybody's trying to find
each other so they can go to heaven know
correct
um so at the end of the show the last
frame of the show
Matthew Fox closes his eyes closes his
eye and dies you know that happened like
in our context of happening like that
happened that's all so it's then from
the moment that he closed his eye all
that other stuff that we did in the in
the sixth season of the show the flash
sideways where nobody knows each other
and the plane never crashed that is
whatever your interpretation is I'm not
going to talk about what our intention
is but that's what you would define is
not having happened or happening but
everything that we ever showed you
anything that takes place on the island
and lost happened you know absolutely
100% the plane crash those people
survived everything that you saw
throughout those six seasons like some
the whole struggle between good and bad
that's like a really meaningful thing
that actually occurred yes that would
have threatened the universe had not
been the Dharma Initiative Israel the
island is real all those Hurley right
now right now at this moment in time
Hurley and ban and with helps them with
with some help from Walt are actually
running things on the island maintaining
it this is the or the ending good thing
about this for the for the movie that
could have potentially happened no I
mean I what well look III again I don't
want to ruin the mystery and ambiguity
of the show in terms of talking about
our intention but I do feel like one of
the things that we always wanted to do
and we're very passionate about
doing was exploring the idea of
purgatory both figuratively and
literally and this was so obvious to the
audience that within three or four
episodes of the of the first season of
the show they were like it's purgatory
right they're all dead and we kept
saying we swear to god they are not all
dead this is really happening but the
audience is telling us that they really
want some sort of clinical evaluation of
an afterlife right and purgatory is
about judgment and this show has never
really offered up what I would call
Christian Judeo judgment in terms of
there's a deity it's always about self
judgment so the idea of like and you
know does Jack think that he's worthy or
Sawyer can Sawyer forgive himself for
his sins or did Kate kill her stepfather
justifiably so I always felt like if the
characters can forgive themselves then
they can then then the show's over
show is called lost it's not because
they're on an island it's because
they're lost so right so how are we
going to creatively demonstrate that
self forgiveness we're going to we're
going to do this idea and so there was
an interpretation I think largely a
large part of it came from ABC's
decision to run footage of the plane
wreckage over the end credits of the
finale and we publicly got out and said
oh my god that was not our idea right
don't don't it that was kind of like
well it did almost a race a lot I think
that that was the feeling but we also
anticipated your reaction in terms of
and here's the thing is I can't logic
anyone who is disappointed in the finale
and is suddenly being undisciplined with
it right you have a visceral reaction to
things you either like them or you don't
like them and I honor your your your
feedback among and the feedback of other
dissenters
that is to say though that in the fun I
think that in the final scene of the
show that proceeds the church where
basically Jack's father Christian
Shepherd says some things to Jack one of
the things that Jack says is like wait a
minute hold on is this is this real like
did any of this happen
like because josh is going to be busting
Damon's balls about this and Jamie's
going to near eight years
after the famines gonna need to say
something we edited that part out
because it would have been weird for you
uh-huh like you would have been like oh
my god this is strange but then his
father says it's all real it all
happened everything happened you know
and so I was like that's going to make
it pretty clear but yeah I wasn't clear
enough I have to say it's been so it's
been I mean when did the show and how
many years ago was it two years two
years ago which seems like a long time
lost exactly like it ended yeah it ended
May 23rd of 22 the 2009-2010 sorry I I
mean I am distant from it now but I just
remember that that had that feeling of
going well this nothing matters that's
interesting now I want to go back and
watch it having heard this from you let
me now that I've got you on the couch
they'll be here I've actually I've
actually got you on the couch but that's
fine I find this refreshing because I am
actually really interested in in gate
few people will engage me on their level
of disappointment because it's an
uncomfortable thing to do yeah well it's
like telling somebody works out so I
yeah but I like it and what I would say
to you is coming into the finale the
night that the finale is going to air
like before you even sit down to watch
it can you honestly tell me that you
felt optimistic that at the end of those
two and a half hours you would be
satisfied or were you already like this
no I think that something could have
happened rather than really satisfied
right you up until that point in the
show you were like I love my because you
guys had been your faith had not wavered
prior to oh no no my faith had wavered
plenty and there were three whole
seasons that I was like this is why am I
wasting my time watching this show
because it was just very disappointed I
have a quest and I actually want to ask
about that because I feel like to me
lost felt like a show that was meant to
be fewer seasons than it actually was
and you even said there was some filler
there oh my god sure I mean to me it
felt like and this actually gets to it
so let me be before I get into this
question and we will talk about
prometheus at some point I was look if
you guys had had revealed that the
entire thing was some thereof in space
it was part of an alien experiment had
been going on with thousands of other
groups of humans that they'd been
plucking off the planet yeah I was
riffing by the way I just
I've been like okay this is like some
weird philip k dick stuff that's how
it's going to end it's going to be like
slaughterhouse-five and I could get
totally behind that right because it was
like it would have made sense to me that
a lot of things didn't make sense and it
would have also been a really upsetting
ending share sort of a nada
I feel like the onion was almost like a
happy ending mm-hmm which to me I didn't
see coming or kind of didn't want right
by the way I'm one man amongst millions
and millions or shows people I mean
admit I know there are millions of
people who love the end and are very
satisfied by it
sure but but yeah there were things that
I think that going into and I felt like
if there had been I wasn't my mind
wasn't set against there being a
conclusion that I would have been happy
with if Bob Newhart had woken up and it
had all been a dream that he was having
which I talked about for years as a
ninja with my wife I would have been
completely satisfied with that ending
and would have thought it was the most
brilliant thing that was ever put on
television sure we wouldn't be having
this conversation right now yeah I mean
I guess I'd be I we resigned ourselves
either correctly or incorrectly fairly
early on to the idea that whatever
mythological construct we came up with
for what the ultimate ending of the show
was and I feel personally speaking like
one of the most unsuccessful episodes of
lost is this one across the sea which
basically tells the origin story of
Jacob and the man in black and it's just
kind of rife with like fundamental
explanation it's as close to the
architect scene as we got and it also
needed to set up like here's where the
end the end game of the island is going
to play out that that's sort of like I
wasn't really emotionally invested in
that episode because it didn't feature
any of the people that I had been told
to care about in the preceding hundred
and fifteen episodes it wasn't that
Jacob and the man in black weren't
interesting characters they were but it
was sort of like wait a minute I thought
the show was about any time you say to
people what's lost about it starts with
like well there's this plane crash and
therefore that they don't say like well
centuries and centuries ago in fact
millennia ago if they say that you go
like I'm out so I always just felt like
the the show that the ending that we
were shooting for was going to be one
that
the dealt with sort of the emotional
reality of the characters and gave some
fundamental explanation for why what did
these people get out of Flint this plane
crash right and the answer as corny as
it sounds
was the one that appealed to me the most
which is each other that's what they got
they were all up sad individuals
who were lost in their own lives and
hated themselves and somehow they found
some fundamental community amongst each
other if they hadn't met each other and
spent all that time on the island then
they would never have been able to
forgive themselves for their past sins
and break through to some sort of level
of self awakening and forgiveness
it is new agey it is cocaine but it's
the story that I wanted to tell it's
interesting because I feel like now my
the alien ending that I just talked
about seems very cynical and
mean-spirited in comparison to what you
were talking about you like I wanted to
find each other and be happy well what's
my eyes like they are doomed in space to
go through alien experiments but the
thing is went when you go for anything
there's going to be some fundamental
polarization so that like life on Mars
for example the American version I will
not spoil the ending for anybody who
wants to embark on it but the concept of
life on Mars is that basically a
detective played by Jason O'Mara and the
British in the American version
basically he he he is without
explanation suddenly finds himself in
the 70s as a cop and so the series is
asking he gets in a car crash and then
he wakes up in the 70s as a cop and so
the series starts to ask the question of
like well how is this possible and they
did 13 episodes the show was cancelled
but they did resolve the the ending of
the show well there was a resolution it
was an explanation for how that happened
and I would say that it is very much in
the wheelhouse of what what your
solution was and there were some people
who said that that was great and clever
and there were a lot of people who said
that they didn't like it right and if
there is a perfect ending out there for
a long form sort of mythology serious
the Newhart ending doesn't apply because
it was a sitcom they just did a very
clever last scene right
the entire series but well that's
extreme that one is really like but
there are no more question right but
it's almost like saying elsewhere like
they did the crazy snow globe ending but
this but it was just a hospital show it
didn't even require that right if I said
to you like let me ask you something
do you like the x-files are you asking
me that round asking out I love it what
happened at the end of the x-files in
the last episode
I'm just anything that happened so loose
you remember Airy last episode yeah I'm
trying to think it's been years uh I
don't remember
right so it's at least um I have I
remember the universe I kind of remember
with the resolution like what happened
to the warring alien fat boy ler alert
whoever's watching yeah it's been long
enough screw you you should have seen it
yes uh you know I remember that you know
what happens the smoking man oh is he is
he I don't know I feel like I am go
spoil it for people but I kind of
remember what happens but you have a
question here what is your question it
wasn't a question it was at least you
remember being really disappointed in
the way Lost ended and you have very
specific memories of why you were
disciplined - right but you know it's
it's what had an ending that was very
clear yeah I will say that it wasn't
anything that I particularly liked yes
but it had an ending it had an ending
yes it definitely had and something you
could you know say specifically happened
to the characters right and I feel like
at the very least no matter what your
interpretation is you do know that
everyone that you ever cared about died
and and that you got treated to some
version of an epilogue how it is they
died and how that all fits together
discuss amongst yourselves I feel like
we were pretty clear in it
but one of the things that I didn't want
people to do is like well when's the
movie coming out right sort of like when
the Sopranos ended and people were like
I hope there's a Sopranos movie I'm like
if they do a movie it completely
nullifies the brilliance of the cut to
black yeah and there were people who
didn't like the cut to black because
they felt like they wanted more
resolution or that there was a promise
of more resolution and at the end of the
day like they didn't even understand
that a movie would completely and
totally erase the boldness of that
decision it's just like that's it like
that's the last time you ever will see
Tony Soprano is eating onion rings in
that diner with his family that's
you get I also imagine that ends by the
way that's an alien experiment yes I
know some and guess what spaceship no
one can prove you wrong that's right
even David chances well that's why it's
so brilliant right perfect so so so
actually let's bring this back around to
what you're seeing right we're talking
about alien space alien spaceships but
but the the creating something that goes
on for six seasons or longer seems like
a kind of a challenge to on the creative
process of telling a story I mean it
seems like a finite you know a book I
mean you do have books like you know the
game of Thrones books that are obviously
they're going on and on right and that
works yes but it does often feel like in
the creative process you want to have
some you want to know there's a finite
amount that you can you can say right I
feel like dark shows that work really
well because they're like you know the
office the British office for instance
yes they said we're gonna do two seasons
and we're done yep and it isn't special
and a Christmas special right where they
answer a bunch of questions wrap ups and
absolutely we finally understand we know
what happened with made the operands
KITT yeah yeah sure uh is it more
satisfying to you in some ways to work
on something like Prometheus where you
have you're like look I've got two hours
to deal with this thing there's not
going to be any filler I've got to tell
the story succinctly and answer
questions in a relatively short amount
of time is that more satisfying them to
you now you you know you've obviously
done both things what do you get more
satisfaction out of and do you think
it's actually I mean because I I'm sorry
I'm gonna let you answer that question
but I have a follow-up good yeah I mean
it is very satisfying to to do a movie
that has a beginning middle and end and
you know exactly what you're getting
into when you start the job television
you don't know what you're getting into
you don't know how many years it's going
to be on for you don't its hubris to say
I have a plan for the entire second
season of the show because no one's even
watching it yet they have to like it for
you to get to that point so they're you
know and I talk about this often so I
won't belabor the point but the two
things that sort of came up all the time
during lost where question number one
are you making it up as you go along
and the answer to that question is no
like that's what people want you to say
no we absolutely have a firm plan and
there's a binder over there and that's
where our plan is and we've got it and
you're in good hands mommy and daddy
know where we're going don't worry about
you a map that's question number one
question number two how much input does
the audience have and the answer to that
question is a lot we listen to you guys
all the time we want to know what you
like and what you don't like and we will
adjust accordingly
are these your actual answers these are
the answers that people want these are
the answers that people want yeah you
know nobody wants to be told you don't
matter like the audience like we
don't care what you have to say about
the show we're doing it the way we want
to do it and nobody wants to hear we
don't have a plan we're kind of winging
it and whatever feels right we're going
to do like the true those the real
answers they are not the real answers
the real answers I've given an is
politic as they may sound the real
answers are there is a plan and when the
plan doesn't work we change the plan and
the other answer is yes we really listen
to what you have to say but norm like
98% of the time we agree with you before
you've said it because the episode that
you've just hated we hated six months
ago when we first wrote it and we
started fixing already so there's a
space between the seasons where you're
where it matters a lot because we
haven't started writing the next season
of the show yet but while the show is on
it's we can see the iceberg that you are
telling us to not hit but we can't turn
off the ship we can't turn off the
engines in time to not hit it we've
already written those episodes so those
are the those are the true answers but
the bit the inherent contradiction
between those two ideas of you you you
want to listen to us but at the same
time listening to us would require you
to deviate from the plan that we want
you to have it feels like it's a
catch-22 which is exactly what it is but
I love being in that catch-22 like I
love doing that dance and I do feel like
I there's a lack of safety and
television that's so exciting to me and
that's why I watch TV because I sort of
feel like anything can happen it can
sort of go off a cliff and the more fast
and loose and dangerous you play the
more exciting it is to watch and
sometimes that means creatively and I
I I sort of embraced that idea</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
