what looks just like an iPad air 2 but
it is in fact the new iPad pro 9.7 it
has all the new internals that don't
have on much larger iPad pro but in a
smaller body so we have four speakers we
have the a 9 X processor actually we
have some technology that isn't in the
new iPad pro for example the screen has
got this true tone screen that will read
the ambient color in the room oh and
adjust the color temperature of the
screen to match so that you know in a
yellow room your white should look more
yellow because they're reflective like
paper same basic idea here the other
thing that is new that the iPad pro
doesn't have is this right here it's the
12 megapixel camera the same one that
you'll find in iphone success or the new
iPhone 5 or iPhone se excuse me and just
like the 6 and 6s there's a camera buff
come on guys get it together since it's
an iPad pro it also supports iPad pro
style accessories so on the bottom here
we have the smart connector which lets
you connect it up to a keyboard and thus
awkward setup somehow there we go we
have a full size keyboard it has a few
like standard Apple shortcuts so you can
command tab which is kind of neat angry
you know typing on it is fine most
keyboards that are designed for the iPad
air or in this case the iPad pro end up
being okay for some people and a huge
bother for others I'm like right in the
middle you could get used to it the keys
are well separated it feels pretty good
not too clacking so it's a decent of
keyboard and then of course you can also
use the Apple pencil with this device so
you are able to draw and draw some other
stuff I'm not a very good drawing in any
case the iPad pro I guess we'll call it
the iPad pro 9.7 starts at $5.99 and
it's going to be available on March 31st
if you want to know more about this or
about anything else that happened today
