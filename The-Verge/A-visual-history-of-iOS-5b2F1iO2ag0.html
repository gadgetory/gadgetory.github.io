first introduced the iPhone and the
first iteration of Apple's mobile
platform iOS the next version is coming
this fall but how did we get here let's
go back to January 2007 the Mac world
keynote this is Steve Jobs today we're
gonna show you a software breakthrough
software that's at least five years
ahead of what's on any other phone when
the original iPhone was introduced it
was actually well behind the competition
in a strict feature by feature
comparison Windows Mobile Palm OS
Symbian and even blackberry were all
established systems in 2007 with a wide
and deep array of features instead Apple
focused on the core experience as Steve
Jobs put it the iPhones three things a
phone web browser and an iPod it had a
capacitive touchscreen with
pinch-to-zoom
and inertial scrolling it had a Safari
app that nearly matched the power of a
desktop browser although Apple famously
refused to support flash and it also had
the best Google Maps you could find on
the go but big changes came with the
iPhone 3G and the iPhone OS 2.0 it's at
that point in 2008 that Apple opened the
doors for third-party developers to
create iPhone apps critically the app
store existed both on the device itself
and within iTunes where users could
easily browse and install apps let's
talk about what's next and that is
iPhone OS 3 o with version 3.0 and the
iPhone 3GS Apple focused on cleaning up
any little messes that it made in its
previous versions it was released in
June of 2009 and like the 3GS itself it
didn't necessarily have any single
headline feature instead Apple filled in
all sorts of gaps with a massive list of
functionality and app updates touching
every corner of the operating system
these included cut copy and paste
spotlight search across multiple apps
and push notifications for third-party
apps even if they did get annoying and
then of course version 3.2 brought iOS
to Apple's newest device the iPad June
2010 marked a major turning point for
the iPhone legacy if only because they
changed the name of the operating system
to iOS iOS 4 was mainly about one thing
adding features for power users the
headline improvement was multitasking or
rather Apple's version of multitasking
developers could now run portions of
their app in the background like music
GPS navigation and save States for fast
switching iOS 4 also added FaceTime
video chat and some
work for the retina display all of which
went to showcase the companies
redesigned iPhone for iOS 5 came with a
lot of personality and she was named
Siri yes sometimes she was unable to
connect to the web perform either voice
recognition or transcription and other
times she returned with strange results
but still as a natural user interface
she was one of the more promising things
we'd seen on a phone in iOS 6 Siri and
Notification Center got upgrades and
Apple also introduced a potential dark
horse with passbook but the big headline
was at Apple took out Google Maps had
long been considered the benchmark an
online mapping but it's also made by one
of Apple's biggest rivals with iOS 6
Apple dumped Google and introduced its
own Maps app it had turned by turn
navigation a 3d flyover mode and well a
lot of embarrassing issues it also nixed
public transit directions entirely
something Apple still hasn't managed to
bring back as part of the follow-up for
the Maps debacle iOS VP Scott Forstall
left Apple with lead industrial designer
Johnny I've taking over for the quote
human interface efforts and with iOS 7
we saw the fruits of his labor gone were
the famous glossy icons the rich
textures and for the most part the
skeuomorphic apps replaced by flattened
graphics colorful gradients and
transparencies it was a stark visual
change Apple also use this chance to
clean up and add some new touches to its
core apps like photos and cameras iOS 7
also added some features like a swipe up
control center an iTunes radio its
Pandora like music streaming service all
of us brings us up to today with iOS 8 a
refinement on the design iOS 7
established the most impressive new
feature is what Apple is calling
continuity basically it's a seamless
pass of information between your mobile
device and your Mac so you can start on
one device and move over the other or
even take calls from your desktop the
most exciting parts of iOS 8 won't be
made by app they'll be made by its
developers pulp kit and home kit our
major pushes into the healthcare and
smart home industries touch ID can be
used by third parties in lieu and
password and for the first time apps are
going to be allowed to talk to each
other and thankfully there's now widgets
and third-party keyboards and on top of
all that Apple has also introduced a
brand new programming language called
Swift this new Apple is definitely
catering to developers in a way it never
has before and in a very real way
they'll get to decide how the next
version of iOS
work and if the rumors of a bigger
iPhone pan out those developers will
have a much for your canvas to work with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
