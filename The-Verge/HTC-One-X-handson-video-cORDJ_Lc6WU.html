HTC One X this is a brand new freshly
announced 4.7 inch android 4.0
smartphone it runs ice cream sandwich
with sensible point 0 on top it has all
the usual sense features although it
doesn't have the carousel look anymore
you're only limited to I believe one two
three seven home screens canvas usual
there's a new multitasking overview over
here it's it reminds you of Windows
Phone you can just swipe away the apps
you no longer want to have active just
like so and it features pretty slim it
reminds the Galaxy Nexus pretty slim
design polycarbonate unibody it's matt
and it feels very nice little touch in
the United States this will be available
on AT&amp;amp;T with LTE and a Qualcomm
Snapdragon s4 processor Joker in Europe
and the rest of the world it have a
Tegra 4 quad-core processing now here's
a neat feature that HTC is showing up
today which is a media link is this
device right here connects with an hdmi
cable to your AC TV and that connects to
the phone via DLNA and the really neat
thing about it is that HD has made it
extremely simple once you pair the two
devices to send media over to the
television it's just a free finger swipe
up when you do it the phone flips in
landscape mode so it's only like so
there are two modes there's a jew
display mode where one picture is
displayed on the TV and one picture is
played on the phone or there is a mirror
mode where the same thing is displayed
above devices just going to try and show
this off right now maybe try and play
trailer
alright so go to trailer playing on the
TV coming direct from the phone we can
go back home and you know maybe check
out 90 be listing on the browser for
this movie or whatever else we can just
carry on using the phone ages playing
via DLNA invite me your leg on the
agency V and if you want to disconnect
the connection it just free fingers down
and it's gone and the phone should
return back to portrait mode as it does
so this is the HTC one x 4.7 inch
android 4.0 smartphone just announced
here at NBC 2012</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
