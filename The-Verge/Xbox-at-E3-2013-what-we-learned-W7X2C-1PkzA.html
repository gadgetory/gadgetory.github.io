Xbox III event here and what I think is
USC's basketball stadium it was huge and
Microsoft in addition to its event from
couple weeks ago talked all about video
games this time game after game after
game and a big booming bass and big
demos and lots of people talking about
games and the games themselves look kind
of like you'd expect they look like
video games the graphics on this new
version of the xbox aren't particularly
different from what we've seen before
they look like good or great pc games
but they're not anything particularly
special but one of things we did see
that is really fantastic about this new
version of xbox one is really how
dynamic these games are instead of just
doing one thing at a time and you have
one enemy coming at you every game seems
to involve 40 different things in 40
different people we saw a battlefield
demo where like a hundred different
things are trying to kill you all at the
same time and you have to use one to
kill another and it's just so immersive
and dynamic and there's a lot going on
in every game we played a lot of these
games are also using the cloud and
really interesting ways Forza Motorsport
5 which actually brought out a McLaren
car for some reason also talked about
what's called a drivatar it's basically
your character in this game and your
driver will actually drive without you
being there so if you're playing a
multiplayer game you can play against
your friends drivatar without your
friend actually driving so while you're
not playing the game your drivatar who
knows how you drive and how you work is
actually playing and racking up points
other games use SmartGlass do really
interesting things there's this great
game called dead rising 3 where it's a
big open world zombie game where you
basically just have to not die that was
most always all anyway I'm sure there's
more to it but you have to just not die
and you can use your phone or your
tablet you can use SmartGlass to call in
artillery to help you and there were
other games that uses it to set up
multiplayer games others that used it to
do all sorts of different stuff it's a
much bigger part of the actual gaming
experience as opposed to just showing
sort of secondary content so that's
really the big difference there's a lot
more we're gonna see this week obviously
but the graphics don't appear to be
anything spectacular on the Xbox one
it's better it's great it's fun
everything played at 60 frames per
second and everybody got very excited
about that but the xbox one graphics
aren't what's really interesting here
what's interesting here is everything
from how immersive and big these were
our to just all the different ways you
can actually play the game and so will
be out looking for more but that's what
we found at Microsoft's event</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
