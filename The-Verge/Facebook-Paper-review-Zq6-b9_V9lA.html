verge my facebook newsfeed is a bit of a
mess especially on my iPhone we're
digging through updates from friends
news sites and ads just isn't that much
fun anymore
Facebook thinks it is the answer with
paper an iPhone app that's part newsfeed
part newspaper and it's totally ad free
welcome to paper paper started as an
experiment to make Facebook look better
on your phone there's no Chrome and the
place of buttons you navigate with
swipes and other gestures perhaps most
noticeably Facebook's iconic newsfeed
has been flipped over each story takes
up the whole screen and you browse them
horizontally like in facebook home this
means you can't swipe through your feet
as quickly as you can on say Instagram
but that's kind of the point a lot of
the designers on our team have a
traditional graphic design background
and so we started looking at it like you
do like a printed book with a baseline
grid going horizontally across all the
stories and as you flip all the text
stays aligned the photos stay aligned or
if you're going vertically like this
everything has to pull out a frame and
it's a little bit more disorienting so
as you're going horizontally it's just a
lot simpler transition the updated
newsfeed is terrific pairing a slick
interface with super responsive gestures
it's easy to keep track of stories as
you swipe through them since profile
pictures text and photos are always in
the same place no more swipe tap swipe
tap swipe tap like in vertical news
feeds as much as I like the new newsfeed
however it still won't make your friends
Spring Break pictures anymore
interesting so the company didn't stop
there by swiping over you can reach the
apps news section a completely new
effort from Facebook that blends Twitter
Flipboard and RSS the section collects
posts from top news sites like CNN the
New York Times but also posts the
Facebook's editorial team wants to draw
more attention to tapping on a story
unfolds at Flipboard style into a
full-screen article view people are
sharing more and more things on Facebook
and they're coming to Facebook for more
and more things so they're not just
coming to see what their friends are
doing they also get the news or they
follow that restaurant that they're
interested in or an athlete that they
like and so as you get more and more of
these things it's it
you want some breathing room to get
space and be able to know that if I want
to know what happened in the Australian
Open last night I can go to the score
section it's gonna be their papers new
section isn't as good as Flipboard or
dedicated news apps like circa but it
should provide plenty of stimulation for
people who already rely on their
Facebook feed for news paper is gorgeous
but feels like an odd fit for Facebook's
current ecosystem of apps paper includes
notifications friend requests and
messenger there's also a new Timeline
view that presents a far prettier
flipbook version of your life versus
Facebook's main app setting aside events
and groups paper does just about
everything Facebook's main app does it
feels like the app Facebook wanted to
build but was afraid to push too it's
hundreds of millions of mobile users the
main Facebook app is one of the most if
not the most popular app and lots of
people really like it and so we don't
want to tell people what they should use
we don't want to come and rearrange
people's furniture we just want to put
out this app that our team thinks is
really great and hopefully anyone who
agrees can use it how they'd like back
in the old days of web portals an era
which Earth's Facebook having everything
in one place was valuable but not
anymore
especially on mobile where people want
tightly packed intuitive apps that do
one or two things well paper still does
a whole lot of things but it's
explicitly built for a mobile world and
it's also great for news readings
something many people have come to rely
on Facebook for especially on mobile the
screen is like the size of a business
card and like fitting like a whole world
inside of a business card is like a
challenging task it requires like design
innovation as well as engineering
innovation to make it so when you're
looking at something that small you feel
like you're looking at something really
big and expansive paper might be too
intimidating for many of Facebook's
billing users but there are some great
ideas here this is the mobile Facebook
I've always wanted
