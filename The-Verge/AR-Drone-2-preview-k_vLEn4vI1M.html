before so we also learn a lot through
the drone one yeah you know and what we
learn we try to change it this don't you
it's not only the way you fly it all
these stability that we put in this one
it didn't have it was very stable but
this one is like one thing that we learn
is you have the kids that we knew that
well they will love it well what was a
big surprise is all this man from 27 to
47 there are buying there's like crazy
when you have the camera and you're
looking at your phone useful a you're
sitting up there flying with it right so
that was the big surprise so also in the
design we did a more aggressive a little
bit more interesting and more adapted to
this crowd too so you can appeal to them
from the design standpoint with the
application I can make it fly 10 issue
but if someone is like a super pro they
can change the settings and make it you
know super cool for him to go back to
how it was absolutely absolutely
the way we put the application so you
know all the photos and videos you're
able to immediately share with the world
everything that's happening in YouTube
and Twitter and Facebook everything is
this is where the drone lives</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
