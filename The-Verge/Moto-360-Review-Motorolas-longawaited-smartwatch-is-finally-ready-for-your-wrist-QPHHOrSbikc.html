this we've seen countless different
ideas about how a SmartWatch should look
how it should work
what it should do but we've gotten these
teasers these glimpses of what seemed to
me to be by far the best answers to all
those questions a SmartWatch should be
first and foremost a watch it should
tell the time it should feel good on my
wrist it should look awesome everything
else is secondary I've been waiting for
the SmartWatch that understood all of
that and now I have it on my wrist this
is the Moto 360 the 360 feels different
from any other SmartWatch from the
moment you put it on it feels later than
it looks it's smaller than it looks I
don't have big wrists by any means and I
don't prefer large watches yet the 360
was comfortable right away of course
this isn't just a watch it's all about
the 1.6 five-inch screen the round
Gorilla Glass display that's ringed only
by a tiny bezel it has incredible
viewing angles it's easy to see even
outdoors and although it's an insane
magnet for finger prints it's at least
easy to keep clean it's round but it's
not a perfect circle not really there's
a tiny black cutout at the bottom where
all the devices innards go it does take
away from the appeal a little but
Motorola's other option was to make the
bezel bigger and it made the right
decision it does stick out above the
bezel though and the angled glass
catches light and gives off this ugly
Moorea pattern and honestly it's just
not high-res enough to really look crisp
and perfect the screen is good enough
but it's not as good as the rest of the
hardware here it comes in two colors at
launch silver and black with a couple of
different strap colors as well there are
more straps coming though including two
metal straps that cost an extra $50 I
can't say it enough this is what a
SmartWatch should look like there are
small changes I would make aesthetically
like to drop the screen flush with the
case and maybe make it ever so slightly
smaller for my own wrists but compared
to the blocky rectangles that adorn
every other SmartWatch on the market the
360 is in a class completely of its own
but for all it can do to differentiate
its hardware motorola can't escape the
fact that the Android wear on the Moto
360 is the same as the Android wear on
the Samsung gear live the LG G watch and
countless other devices coming to market
that means the Moto 360 is primarily an
inbox for everything all the
notifications and information on your
phone Google now tells you when you have
a calendar event coming up or that your
package is being delivered you'll get
notified about emails and calls and
texts and you can do quick Google
searches take notes and set reminders
Android wear is still best used when you
don't use it much when it's just an
occasional add-on to your life
the 360s heart rate monitor and padam
or both work as well as any other device
and I've grown to love Android where's
integration with apps like runtastic
apps are getting smarter about using
your location to deliver handy quick
useful information and it giving you
easy ways to find information or control
basic things on your phone in most ways
using the 360 is identical to other
Android wear devices in a couple it's
much better Motorola's watch faces are
the best classiest options i've seen by
far even if I would like a few more
choices
it also has really impressive range it
stayed connected even as I walked down a
floor in our hotel and down a hallway in
one key way though the 360 is much worse
Android wear might technically work on
round or square devices but it's clearly
designed for rectangles you're basically
getting a rectangular interface with the
corners cut off sometimes that's fine
others it's a huge pain all that I can
live with though
but the 360s worst feature is almost a
deal-breaker its battery life is rough
motorola says it'll last a day and is
fairly explicit about the fact that you
have to charge it every night and at
least the charger a black wireless dock
you drop the 360 into sideways works
well and looks good on my bedside table
but I got battery life more like 12
hours even less with heavy use getting a
day or a day and a night if you forget
to charge it seems basically impossible
I don't need weeks or years for my
SmartWatch but I don't think 2 days is
too much to ask and the 360 doesn't
deliver right now if you're buying a
SmartWatch buy this one this appears to
be the best a manufacturer can do with
Android wear the best thing available on
the market for $249 the Moto 360 is
definitely the best of its kind but
right now that's still faint praise I'm
still waiting for a manufacturer whether
it's Apple or Samsung or HTC or Motorola
itself to come along and make us dream a
little bit bigger about the devices we
can wear on our wrists pretty is a good
start it's a really good start but it
can't be the finish line
