here at Amazon headquarters in Seattle
where they just introduced a ton of new
hardware and our favorite thing they
showed up today might be this this is
the echo spot
imagine if the echo show and an echo dot
had a baby it might look like this a
tiny alarm clock with a two and a half
inch screen that is Alexa enabled what
does that mean well it can do something
that a lot of Alexa enabled devices can
do which is control your smart home it
can also play music it also has a
front-facing camera that means you can
use it to make free video calls and by
the way starting today you can now use
Alexa to make free video calls to
anywhere in the United States Canada and
Mexico but this device is part of Amazon
strategy to bring Alexa absolutely
everywhere this thing is gonna go on
sale today for pre-order and then we'll
start shipping in December and it will
cost you one hundred and thirty dollars
Amazon thinks that people are gonna get
a number of these for their homes maybe
you put one on your desk one in the
kitchen one in the bedroom that's
certainly where I plan on putting mine
it's part of their strategy of bringing
Alexa absolutely everywhere and so while
amazon showed off a ton of things today
this one well it might just be the one
we think is the most interesting I'm
trying to do a blooper farhad it's so
hard for me to screw up it's not gonna
drop we're not dropping it okay great</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
