friends this is a virtue where we talk
about things that are mobile and
apparently too fast in the furious
because we can't help ourselves I am
dieter bomb I am glad tsavo i'm dan
seifert and i am chris sigler and i'd
like to say that I'm in full support of
the fast in the future big guys just
don't get me started because I'm gonna
spend 20 minutes talking about fast and
furious and nobody wants that that's
order or do we do we want that it's
episode 35 we are a few minutes late but
it's still a Tuesday which is pretty
impressive I think someone on Twitter
said this makes three weeks in a row
we've broadcast on Tuesday nice why it
why I feel like this is like the third
or fourth week that this has been
episode 35 it so I'm playing a trick I
mean it's point like yeah I don't think
this is the episode 35 because we
actually have all four of us connected
at the same time the important thing is
that it's a week of februari for 2013
maybe that should be maybe that should
be part of our stick where like every
episode from now on is episode 35
because decide that right up for just
don't wanna pay thirty-six how does
kanga ya handle being in the late is 36
late 30s no that doesn't start to like
38 you can still technically count 37 as
mid-30s can't you 37 is still 29 in my
book you can definitely cut 36 I mean
I'm mid-thirties powered I don't feel
good about it at all you'll always be 29
in world I I am old old and gray and
answering business letters from sixth
graders which is awesome i feel really
we got i got a letter from a sixth
grader is donna doing a class project
learning how to write business letters
so are you going to go speak at a it is
real okay for male now it's i mean i
could a career day about it yeah yeah we
should talk about smartphones though
instead of snail mail and what's in my
inbox and obviously clearly without
question the biggest new
of the week is rim no sorry not rim
blackberry blackberry you know I I know
we've been saying for years that
blackberry has needed to do this and
it's a good thing for the company and
it's a good way to unify its brand and
because consumers don't know who the
heck rim is but when they did it in the
middle of the event and I'm live
blogging and I could not have hated them
more from something that is three
letters and about the easiest thing to
type because I've been typing it for
like ten years to something that is
camel case and ten letters uh while I'm
live blogging so yeah dan you're at the
event can you tell us what this is this
blackberry 10 like is it was we called
the blackberry 10 watch it was
definitely a device launched but they've
announced blackberry 10 so many times I
mean well they've shown blackberry 10 so
many times right in developer
conferences and things like this this
was their big launch of the platform and
they launched devices to go along with
it so they finally officially showed off
the z10 which is the all-touch model and
the q10 which has the proper physical
keyboard that everyone thinks of when
they think of a blackberry erection
corrections at ten this is it is
absolutely heroic deeds at ten because
this phone is actually available here in
the UK now it's in stores whereas you
American folks are still gonna have to
deal with your certifications of
verifications and carry objects and
torsten Hines referred to it as the z10
on stage is they're all all them
Canadians up them there so yeah I'm
totally comfortable calling it the z10
right so the z10 is the the first one
that's coming to market as what I
mentioned it's available the UK right
now it launched in Canada today actually
and it is coming to the u.s. at some in
order to time in March yeah we had a
rumor that t-mobile is going to have it
on the twenty-seventh March with a bunch
of other phones so rightly whatever the
carrier's launched in march to launch it
yeah and i think the only carrier that
in the u.s. that hasn't committed to the
z10 is sprint which has officially
committed to the cute
and we still don't know if it's going to
pick up the Zenta but right then I'll
stop saying z10 it's like I'm getting
into it now I'm like blackberry
blackberry z10 uh so I've had a z10 oh
my god Mecca what was the event like you
were there in hers yeah and Vlad you
were at the event in london right yes I
was in a sense of like what was the what
was the vibe leg so this was the first
event that i had been to since
blackberry world 2011 i think and that
was when they launched blackberry 7 and
the 9900 and whatever i'll say that sir
uh and and that was a really huge event
and if you remember that Ballmer came
out on stage and that was like the
biggest part of the you so this was this
was kind of similar it was a very big
venue a very big event there was lots of
people there lots of press blackberry is
very active in getting a lot of press
from all over the world to come to its
events and this was no different it was
a lot of pressure a lot of analysts
there are a lot of Industry people there
and then they did this thing where they
connected all of these other events
around the world so there was like seven
or eight other events in Paris
Johannesburg London where Vlad was there
was one I believe in Toronto as well and
others that are escaping me right now
and they kind of piped them all together
as with a video connection can I can I
just say that the the conceit of having
a reporter Starcher live event but I
like being on the floor the microphone
and talking to people needs to go away I
mean but I was very ever because he was
no way that the tiger room rim did it
and I didn't nokia do that with some
event last year where they had like a
pretend reporter pretend talking to
pretend people about pretend things
before the event started to try and drum
up a feeling of excitement and this is
an event feel like we have the structure
of the event in general was very suspect
to me because II you know that given the
audience for this event you should not
be spending I mean they spent a good 10
or 15 minutes uh you know playing up the
the fanboy angle and and you know going
to all these different events and
talking to people who are allegedly
excited about the phones
and you're not you're not fooling
anybody like it you're insecure you're
actually actively insulting our
intelligence by spent by wasting 15
minutes of our lives doing this like
shut up Chris I'm sorry I interrupted
you but I would say there were quite a
few more minutes than just the first 15
because I can tell you now I could tell
you nothing it was somewhere around a
half an hour into the presentation 40
minutes into presentation and I was
monitoring chat for our team and there
was just nothing it was dead and and the
thing we know during live events is we
always have some messages so is somebody
reacting to something happening on stage
to the announcements etc and I was just
like I wish to it here we still alive
the rise to connect to the web and the
guys are just like we're all just
stunned into silence but besides that I
do wanna you know rewind back to that
intro with a vampire ankle I am just
kind of freaked out and horrified by the
way they treated crackberry Kevin
because that do you apparently decided I
mean this is the so needs news to be but
he decided until blackwood 10 comes out
I won't have a haircut Yoshi this has
been this has been an ongoing thing
right so he's built up this nice you
know set of flowing locks he had a
ponytail going on and black bridges
decided to be like hey do you want to be
a good sport and let us cut off your
ponytail and completely ruin your
hairstyle and what was he ever going to
say like his name work his name search
box is prank for Kevin like that's his
thing is black for his biggest fan and
they put him in that situation I I think
he was very identity there I'm you know
we've all known Kevin for a while and
you know I'm pretty sure he couldn't
have been more related to be lived no
I'm sure you know featuring him was
flattering to his ego and all that stuff
I just kind of find it really weird for
blackberrys perspective to bring out you
know drag out your biggest fan and you
like
we're just gonna cut your hair yay I
mean what what sort of celebration what
sort of auspicious occasion does this
lead well he was he was growing he was
growing it out until blackberry 10
launch that was there the they're the
biggest you know a rally there's a rally
use like sports fans who are you know
growing their hair out until they get to
the playoffs or two they win the
championship or whatever but again this
entire stick is insulting the
intelligence and and it's a waste of
time for the analyst and and media who
are there show us what you hit what your
you've brought us there to announce let
us collect our review units and let us
go on our way I guess so haha well i
mean i was expecting big surprises out
of will not because i was expecting a
surprise at least and out of this event
based on you know everything i heard
that I was hoping that there'd be
something surprising and it seems like
like the biggest surprise besides
renaming the company from rim to
blackberry is that they managed to
secure a bigger list of big-name apps
than I expected they got whatsapp they
got you know a bunch of others they got
commitments from them and that's
something I want to talk about because
you know yeah exactly like they announce
these on stage and they really made it
feel like all of these apps are going to
be there at launch and stuff and they
talk about skype and they talk about
whatsapp and they talked about a bunch
of other ones but if you go into the UK
a UK store right now and you buy the z10
or z10 and you try to download any of
those apps they're not available yet so
I mean as far as I'm concerned the phone
is launched and they're not available
yeah i mean when i watch this when i
talk to them about whatsapp I spoke to
once i have been rim at the same time
and they basically like well you know
it's going to be out really soon and
it'll should be out in time for the US
launch and since it's a rolling launch
we're gonna say it's a launch out yeah i
mean i don't code i did fine i had fun
the whole app stick really misleading
because they came out and they were
really pushing the number seventy
thousand apps we're coming out really
strong right out of the gates and they
actually look at the break
and then a substantial proportion of
this is just android applications
wrapped up to play and to work on the
blackberry 10 platform another good
chunk of it is ported android
applications then there's html5
applications and then less than half
from what I understand of all these apps
are actually native bed with Tara
applications which are the ones that
have the most functionality the most
access to low-level resources and the
biggest chance to shine and you know the
three annoying thing is when you take
your z10 you start browsing around then
you look for big-name maps one of the
first ones that caught my eye was you
too but I don't yeah great these guys I
should have a youtube app right out of
the box I tap into it m.youtube.com it's
a web link and that's what I does that's
what Windows Phone did right is that
mistake thing it's examine the same
thing and I hate it because that is
BlackBerry's choice well like no it's
not i mean it's it's their choice too
okay it's their choice to have a crappy
stub out in there I suppose yeah yeah
exactly with the shortcut yeah yeah
exactly let me just add to this and and
it's you know it's something that dan
dance reaction after his first day or so
it was like they spent two years
developing this cetera et cetera and you
know a bunch of census stuff so he's put
on with that if you had this much time
there is a lot about the blackberry 10
software that is just unacceptable and
the two things that really really stand
up for me there are neat things which we
may end up eventually when discussing
about the software but the two things
that really annoy me are things like the
settings menu is still like a white
background with black text on it there's
just almost no effort being put into
making this flu particularly different
from blackberry menus from years and
decades past and secondly a
emails thinking is still not immediate
and to me that is using imap right
projects and maybe there's imap idle for
pushes is how they're pushing if they're
pushing I don't have one yet so no you
know how the platform has been so late
wit email sync as blackberry right I
don't know what the heck about 47 I
don't know what the technical backend if
they're using imap idle or not but it
receives emails push so for my gmail
accounts I'd automatically pushes to the
phone but the problem is my idol then
yeah I'll mark it read on the device and
then it'll be like hours later and I'll
go back to my desktop and there's still
all these emails sitting in my inbox of
the desktop marked unread unfiled or
whatever well yeah it is the whole thing
again yeah it depends on how they
implement the imap and let's be honest I
map in gmail is not played all that
nicely in general so I mean if you want
if you wanna knock it for how I'm
totally in defending blackberry but
that's fine if we want to knock for how
it handles email that's fine but it's
also like the same boat that everybody
else is in no state of no sink I
disagree I mean really I i don't know
all i can think of is that when you
think of blackberry if you're nothing
you have a keyboard you're thinking of
an awesome messaging an awesome email
support experience and right it does not
fulfill that at all for gmail okay by
default the conversation view is turned
off which blows my mind and so like you
have all these emails coming in and
they're not like threaded together and
that's a nightmare then uh if you are a
gmail user of any sort that likes
archive things or organize them with
labels that's a very difficult thing to
do which is obviously you know no
different than if L okay but imagine
imagine dude back up imagine gmail
wasn't available on the iPhone you'd be
in the exact same situation right but
it's but the point is it is available
and ran and the iOS is email client is
way better than a blackberry tenants
like this stock mail de Abba ebook
really okay I'm just gonna mail app is
better than anything at all ever I
really truly do yeah yeah good is
another good comparison but Windows
Phone guys see
I've actually been nitpicky enough to
run comparisons with how quickly it
sinks it sometimes even sings as fast
talking about gmail account here then my
android device it is about I member
exchange yeah when it's what exchange
they are see there you go yes sir yeah
okay fair enough fair enough but but
still I mean as far as just the end-user
perspective is concerned right you pick
up a blackberry 7 device I had the
misfortune reviewing that porsche design
frosty um so that means you go tonight
on house of cards on netflix has got has
got one of those the the bald dude the
is he in prison is that why he's being
punished in this fashion and just
bothers me on that thing he's a baller
that's what they have to united states
penninte e900 so so let's talk about the
other features of blackberry 10 uh
blackberries been touting the hub which
is like it's universal inbox for
organizing your notifications from
everything from messages to email to
social networking things like that which
is a great idea in theory in concept or
an execution i guess it kind of falls
apart on blackberry 10 for a number of
reasons um the one is that i don't
really always want all of my
notifications all together and it kind
of just lumps me into there and then i
can yes break down into my various
services to view them individually but
if by default it just kind of throws me
in there the other problem that i have
with it is when you get a notification
on the device unlike with iOS or android
where you can swipe down from the top
and see what the notification is more or
less you can see who the message is from
maybe even see part of the message and
then ignore it if you want blackberry 10
just gives you an icon so it'll say you
have new text messages or new emails or
new Twitter replies or whatever and then
I have to go into the actual messaging
hub and I have to look at each one to
see what they say uh instead of being
able to glance at it and then go back to
what I was doing which is like defeats
the whole purpose to me
so and then there's also other nitpicks
you can't actually go from message to
message in it you have to look at a
message go back to the list open a new
message go back into that back and forth
a lot of back-and-forth bouncing which
is very unkind and it took me a long
time to find it and actually I got a
little help from somebody on Twitter to
find how to mark all of my Twitter
notifications as red because I would get
you know however many in a day and they
would all be sitting there and I was
marking them individually so there is a
way to do that but it's very hidden you
have to long press on a thing and bring
up a hidden contextual message what
there's no distress in say it's not just
in the general like pulldown menu no the
way you do it is you long press on the
date so if you're looking at your list
of messages you long press on the date
which is tiny then it brings up
contextual message a menu that lets you
select marquales red that's terrible
it's it's a thin thing when a hub is
that february's just really branded than
notification area I haven't added or
well but isn't the easy idea of a you
know a notification aggregate to any
more than I mean there are step ahead of
Windows Phone because I shouldn't have
well yeah you know as far as the
notification systems in android and iOS
or our way superior as far as I'm
concerned but the other thing is the
lock screen is is also quite confusing
an intuitive grab reset because you you
get no engines for new tweets new
messages on there and it just looks so
inviting for you to swipe into them you
know you know you look at it it's a left
side of the screen you're like oh tweet
notifications and yet in trance wipe and
then try and impress you try and do
something with it you can't it just sits
there on lock screen but in the camera
icon if you long press it there's a
little animation and that brings you to
the camera and if you're dragging from
the top you can access you alarm clock
driving from the bottom yeah you unlock
the phone just like swipes from the
edges sometimes do you think sometimes
they don't do things and then sometimes
you have things that look tappa below
clickable or log pressable and then
not and it's just weird yeah it's a very
the whole OS there's a lot of instances
where it's just not very obvious what
you're supposed to do are you supposed
to swipe back are you supposed to look
for a back about in are you supposed to
swipe up you know and and you you have
to like learn all of that for every
single app that you do or every single
action that you want to do which is yeah
there never was anything but there's no
consistency and that's that's how much
of this do you guys think is just like
not having not having learned it not
being used to the platform I mean
honestly how much of it is that I was
not driving you're not a blackberry
person I'll give you an example so this
is like your your main home screen and
you swipe over and that brings up your
inbox of your notifications and so like
I want to swipe back to go back and I
can't I have to swipe up to go back and
it's like you just swipe back to come
back from your let me do it again yeah
dude single oh yeah i'm gonna use fight
back oh there it is you swiped their
other that's it so just wondering what
the problem it made a liar out of me
this um but I swear it's the
inconsistent in areas I just can't prove
it but they're already latest where a
black widow show up on the screen but he
comes back in a bottom in the example to
then was getting that was still take you
back to the home screen yeah right yeah
because only sahabas a nap if you
haven't there's a full review that Josh
wrote getting into a lot of these issues
and you definitely should check it out
what was the final score we gave it I
want to say give it a 77 yeah this seems
right and I like the big debate on the
verge cast which we don't need to
recapitulate in full is like is this
better than windows phone because that's
really the big question right and I
haven't used it so I'm not going to say
I suspect the answer is windows phone is
better but it feels like this had a
faster stronger launched out of the gate
then when da phone did back with windows
phone seven right I definitely a
blackberry definitely has more support
from carriers uh it's getting you know
global launching much faster than
Microsoft did with Windows Phone
personally I'd rather carry a witness
phone device at this point
because even the windows phone does not
have a strong an app ecosystem as iOS
and Android it's still a lot better than
what blackberry 10 is offering but I
think what the real question is in for
an average consumer for the person going
into the store that sees you know three
or four different phones priced at two
hundred dollars on a contract does it
compare with them and no I can't
recommend it over an iOS or Android
device that along the same price point
right although the real question here is
is Alicia Keys that in the jessica alba
in a brand ambassador state well she's
actually an employee right right is she
nice yeah i was on rims payroll
BlackBerry's payroll see ah and ears um
yeah that's what ever I don't even know
what to say like I saw will i have at
macworld he's also got a similar fake
job at Intel and I just have 0 patience
care I love the fact that every one of
these companies is completely inventing
the job the role the whole position is
invented just to satisfy their how we
being individuals by a co or formally
cool or some with people think they're
cool celebrity and holds the key word
Russell wrote a really smart piece on on
the this whole phenomenon of the
creative director and Lady Gaga and
will.i.am like you mentioned dieter and
your keys and and there's this there's
this idea among these companies that
they need to force some like you know
false sense of cool on their image in
order to sell devices and that's not
that's not what rim needs to be trying
to do two cell phones oh the fact that
they showed alicia keys on stage their
launch event is going to have zero
impact on their bottom line don't you
know what else rim rim you know what
else blackberry needs to not do to sell
their phones they need to not put up a
boring middling Super Bowl commercial
that
like they they basically took their
phone their z10 and they set it on a tee
ball stand like you sent a soft ball
when you play t-ball and they invited
everybody on the planet to just take a
huge swing at it whenever they feel like
it whenever they want to complain about
the platform because the tagline for
this you know this commercial was it
would be faster to show you what things
it can't do yeah there are so many
things that the blackberry z10 can't do
and there's going to always be thinking
right that does blackberry case
Samsung's was way better if if they're
going to keep pushing this angle on this
commercial man like so many headlines
are just waiting for me to write just
yeah waiting I think for me I have seen
other commercials that they plan on
airing that show more the devices
functions and the gestures and its
features and stuff so fortunate
hopefully they'll run with those in the
future instead of this kind of
conceptual thing that happened during
the Superbowl Samsung's was actually way
more clever and I think that it was it
was very important that they move away
from the Apple bashing which they
finally did thank god you're right but
as far as a product commercial is pretty
terrible because you didn't really see
the product at all yeah but it was it
was I felt like it was like it was funny
enough to that like it was a knock you
right it would cause you to look up
samsung galaxy if you if for whatever
reason you didn't know what says my
goodness if you about living in a closet
it's not even about that that commercial
wasn't about selling phones anymore it's
about establishing Samsung as like a
cultural as a brand basic brand building
again in that context I think I worked
really well I was just sort of oh I have
warm fuzzy feelings about Samsung now
ray right via the author the real
superstar that commercial by the ways
but was Bob Odenkirk ah I mean don't get
me wrong Paul Rudd Seth Rogen are great
but Bob Odenkirk is top notch might look
so hang on to you did you just know that
actors name off the top of your head you
didn't know that either mr. show dude
yeah
this is what people who don't watch fast
and the furious or remember oh yeah so
guys seriously we don't have that long
of a podcast so funny when I talked
about black break let's just make a very
quick mention because BlackBerry's
trying to talk up the sales for the z10
Wow let's also mention that the q10 has
no release date you know availability
information or pricing or anything yeah
actually the huge any show know the q10
I felt really like oh yeah it's great
q10 is coming everything's gonna be fine
but like after this launch event I'm
feeling nervous I mean it's going to
come in whatever but I'm nervous about
it the way that I wasn't before the
launch event anyways all right over
there I think that they are going to
have they're going to go through the
exact same cycle of agony that Nokia is
currently going through III think that I
I don't think that that this that this
device that were devices plural z10 q10
are going to do enough to pull them out
of their nose dive and I think that
they're going to do several more rapid
cycles Vlad you and I talked about this
on the show last week fact that you know
Nokia's failures have forced them into
this faster cycle and they're
comfortable with and I think we're going
to see that with with rim too and it's
going to be pretty painful to watch I'm
not sure how it talks about it when I
was in LA last week's book oh maybe I
said what did I talk about with was it
was a you Dan I don't know I don't out
of somebody I feel in any conversation
did I hit my head maybe maybe I know
this conversation happened I guess into
or participated I don't remember which
okay I would listen with a virgin mobile
shell everybody hey anyway I guess I
survived it's a crime so then I just
want to give them the opportunity to
interrupts as well because I was doing
like this quick wrap-up and I just kind
of spiraled out of control Bok very
quickly rim okay there you go actually
we did instagram instagram is coming yes
we know that big deal I don't give a
damn I i downloaded instagram to my
iphone and i can't use it now without
logging into facebook
it's really wacky and weird and I'm not
logging into facebook anyway so
blackberry is talking up the idea that
the z10 is selling out and selling
really well but we've had zero numbers
in terms of sales so this is why you
haven't seen us covering it as news
because it's a load of complete PR
because what I can say is I can take my
z10 review unit and if I'm successful in
selling it I could say I'm completely
sold out guys it's completely blown away
let's see did you expect a chance
totally yeah so if we don't know how
many they had in stock you know guys
like the carphone warehouse or phones
for you they're resellers that they
might they might have a limited stock
they might have low expectations we know
nothing about sales so far so the
situation with blackberry what's next on
our list of topics so moving on we've
got uh we've been talking about HTC for
the last seven iterations of episode 35
um but there's more to talk about
because HTC's big event has yet to
happen so there's gonna get more leaks
and things like that and so HTC itself
put out this teaser yesterday where it
teased a new sound and camera experience
at the end of a long time line of camera
technology which if you look very
closely at the original version of the
timeline you might see some errors
anyway um at them going after like I'm
going after nokia's pureview
implementation like yeah that was like
really uh nokia has been the one mobile
company that just keeps talking trash
but sit together on twitter and just
being you know snarky and being a
smartass his fellow competitors so there
is Fanta their own spot they are the the
610 620 wasn't it or 620 excuse me or
whatever was it did it pass with flying
colors the long-awaited nokia
conversations review of the nokia 620
but that went up this week ladies and
gentlemen so you
never see my internet the okiya
conversations is not an outside blog or
site it is Nokia's own site so but to be
fair they actually did respond pretty
quickly and changed it from a review to
a hands-on so how did they really yeah
yeah they did they updated it uh so HTC
at the end of this long timeline teases
a new sound and camera experience for
2013 which uh the exact same thing is
set for 2012 and also in 2011 when it
bought beats so you can read into that
all you want but it doesn't seem to me
like EGC is really changing it's a
narrative there and the rumors that
they're going to they're gonna stack a
bunch of sensors right or something ya
know there's a rumor yeah it's very
strange rumor that they were going to
stop calling things old megapixels and
call them ultrapixels um but well we'll
have to see what they do well I mean if
give you know they're if they're making
fun of Nokia if they might be able to do
something interesting here I mean I I
anticipate finding out on the 19th i
guess um yeah oh and i know which day it
happened but pizza ciao did run around
yelling m7 m7m seventh and frosting the
phone into the air so I'm pretty sure if
it were 19 is kind of a lot by this
point for us to see this new android
flagship yeah well I mean we've seen it
right with te we've got a picture of
peter chao holding it up taking right
what does he see it i mean learn about
it as well learn about these pixels and
all this other madness right just a
quick note i was taking a look just
before the podcast ed and i'm taking a
look at it now this is why i'm giving
these motions with my head on twitter
anyhow the z10 is actually in terms of
physical dimensions is actually not that
much smaller than the HTC One X which is
disappointing to me okay it's alright
considering his latest shorts or point
to which displays supposed yeah yeah and
I actually
and this 500 or 600 word rant about
sizes and saying that Android needs some
for to 4.3 inch devices which was trying
to also give voice to the same concern
issued that we've given voice to in
previous podcasts and think that Chris
has been ranting about previously but
what I would say with that is when we
demand these 4 2.4 inch devices we want
them to actually be physically smaller
to be legitimately smaller as opposed to
will put 4.2 in screen on there and
we'll keep it the same size as the 1x
that isn't really the point but anyhow
that that was a back to HC next big
phone ohh really i think we're done
talking about HTC yeah don't you talking
about it easy until next week until next
episode 35 right so microsoft confirmed
that a car dev and cal des support are
definitely coming to Windows Phone and
they got a little a little support from
google in that it is extending its
support of exchange activesync so that
Windows Phone users are not left in the
lurch come the end of January which is
nice to see so if you or Windows Phone
user let's go ahead Chris so so two
things I want to point out here one it
is it is patently obvious that this was
the plan all along that Google was going
to watch Microsoft stew in its own
juices for a few weeks before looking
the hero and and announcing that that it
was going to extend it for a few months
to I guarantee you that they are getting
this extension for free from Microsoft
they are not paying a dime for this
license until June yeah that's uh I I
agree with both of those points although
it's still the thing you wrote back when
this news first broke that there may be
dropping exchange activesync that what
was it you said that Microsoft is either
incompetent or lying right by saying
they were surprised by this news yeah
right yeah so I mean I that's good you
know if i could pay Google to get
I guess I am on for Google Apps right
then because they're going to continue
that for support for enterprise account
in google apps accounts so your eyes for
instance i am paying google to have and
they don't have any more free Google
Apps accounts as first I know so right
oh so my whole point was if i could pay
Google for that i would if i could pay
Google for that from my personal account
i would it should come free if you like
by the extra storage oh yeah if i'm not
mistaken paul who has no use for it say
he pays for i think that he liked his
personal setup is on google apps which
is always been intriguing to me but uh
huh I don't know if I it used to be for
google apps that you could have like
five or ten accounts for free or
something like that and they recently
changed I want to say like last year
they change it that there's no longer
free account option so yeah it also used
to be I don't know if this is still the
case but it used to be that that a lot
of like really cool google features
would be rolled out on Google Apps
accounts like long after they were on
like regular gmail accounts Duff yeah so
that's something to consider do I don't
know if they with that still the case we
also should point out that Windows Phone
7.8 is actually happening on nokia's
devices at least uh oh you know what
else is happening on the dell venue pro
oh yeah you do lie no I get up I'll
Genesis that's amazing oh it got some
point yep Wow an official it's official
to it's not a hat I want I want adult
than you Pro new again and as a fine
phone dude we just you just got finished
complaining about phones that are way
too big for their screen size I know
you're gonna praise the dell venue pro
10 consistency it's true I I have my
head in shame but yeah she switch up
before I UK audience goes to sleep like
me because I'm really sleepy is late
there's actually some really huge news
in terms the UK ltd market and it came
out about half an hour into the Super
Bowl it's like the company that
announced
wanted to bury or something any case a
midnight on monday three UK announced
that he will add LTE to its packages
without price for you and that is just
human with the massive I like I'm
reading it and I'm just trying to find
where is the small print where are these
guys qualifying this statement because
it so far LT has just been this super
premium EE only offering and you know II
is treating it like this especially
special thing even though it isn't on
the on the best frequency and it doesn't
have all the great building penetration
turns out that the thing with free in
the UK is that they've consistently had
the absolute best prices among the local
carriers particularly with London they
have sell the best free g coverage so if
you want data in London free is the best
value by I think the last time i was in
london i bought a three data only sim
because it was cheap and fast hmm yeah I
mean it's both it's both cheap and fast
and now all of a sudden they got a stage
keepo just go to LTE speeds I mean
that's brilliant everybody else is
either going to have to come down admin
price and completely free or lose a ton
of customers so this is a big promise I
don't know how the company's got to
manage it financially I don't know how
to working through that hump for that
hurdle minor details you know I'm our
free subscribe myself and I'm paying
like almost nothing so just getting LTE
on top of that is gonna be yeah a beauty
it's also news so yeah as we don't know
what it's gonna happen it will probably
be like November time or whatever yeah
but at least is you know it's something
really good and worthwhile to look
forward to so yay for us kawai you're
also and
you can't even see no I because we got
we got LTE you know without it
theoretically without price increases on
all the carriers in the US although
they've been messing around their data
plans so much probably part of that was
because of LTE I guess but the idea that
you would just assume you'd be paying an
extra you know however much a month just
to get LTE like people would be storming
the gates here if that were the case
well yeah but at the same time you guys
pay hundreds of dollars per month where
is that the UK subscriptions are much
much cheaper regular basis so the only
thing that I'm really bummed about is
the next time I go to London I won't be
able to use the LTE if three has enabled
it's cheap LTE because my device will be
capital boo yes tree oh do I talk about
the X phone from Motorola found it no
just do we know any specifics about it
out of them no we just this job listing
allegedly confirmed its name that or
that the pre exponent project is in the
works for sure which was reported by The
Wall Street Journal and the way Motorola
handle that after us leads me to believe
that it was not a fake listing right it
was pulled from it was originally a
listing on linkedin that included the
expo name and if you look for it on
motorola's career site you could find
the exact same listing minus the expo
name and then a couple hours later it
was gone from linkedin yes so well
speaking of pool the kinds of things at
again I don't know if this happened
before last week's podcast but there was
a Qualcomm document remember the one
pointing to a key lime pie coming out in
his oh yeah yeah huge document up slide
deck yeah yeah yeah and what Qualcomm's
thing is Qualcomm what has leaks that
happen seemingly every year and every
year issues takedown notices for them uh
and in the interesting part of this leak
was that there was one slide that said
android key lime pie I may tentatively
be launched in the spring of 2013 which
is like a very broad estimate and even
the slide itself said it was just an
estimate and if it does line up with
when Google i/o is supposed to happen in
May if we don't see key lime pie or
whatever it's going to be called then it
would be very a big surprise well I am
something that um there are some issues
with jelly bean particularly 4.2 which
people have been encountering so that's
something to kind of look forward to I
guess such as well I mean dita had
complained with a nexus 7 that he would
have preferred to keep it at 4.1 and I
did I did find it a like the one the
next seven the D the handle to me I do
find it bit more sluggish and behaving a
bit more ugly than stuck once I know a
bluetooth streaming is told us stop the
Nexus 7 oh yeah I mean yeah stop 4.2 but
I mean stock when you buy a 4.1 nexus 7
right or an exit seven 4.1 and no
expression must sit very well so I have
a crazy theory that I'm going to throw
out I I think first of all I think that
it's completely insane to believe that
Google will have the successor to the
nexus 4 ready in time for Google i/o I
agree but I do think that they will
debut the white Nexus 4 at Google i/o as
I betcha they'll probably give it to all
the attendees that could be but either
way I think that'll that'll somehow be
tied into the launch of key lime pie
secondly this is less a prediction and
more of a gloat I just want to point out
that the verge called the key lime pie
name like a year ago what I'll hold up
in we were first it could be a hold on
yeah I don't know I'm not googling the
pot salad I mean I don't know it's it's
nice out your klondike bars oh where is
that your yeah Clinton that you
could be Klondike bar that that's a good
one but but I do think that it's gonna
be key lime pie no you could have been
KO cake only for you Vlad not to anybody
else Aoki that is not a dessert in
anyone knows household except yours
that's like a punishment food that like
you know that's not a dessert that's not
a reward listen so I what about when I
luquillo cake and when I write my
reviews the way nokia does it's amazing
um man uh what else is there that
happened this week I feel like we could
we could go back to the blackberry well
some are but I know there's a rumor that
vertu might launch an android phone
which is kind of crazy if yes of course
they're gonna launch an android phone
what will there's a bunch of anything
they're not even open okie any more like
good business right but but but keep in
mind that vertu i believe i might be
making this up but i think that that um
that nokia said in the past that virtue
has been a profitable division for them
oh yeah and and that makes sense because
they charge completely asinine amounts
of money for the buy something they sell
one for one phone turn a profitable
quarter right I their cheapest models
are like 45 or 4,500 five thousand
dollars and that's for devices that
don't have any precious metal at all and
then you can do you know a hundred
thousand dollars for a solid gold phone
but uh what's interesting to me about
this is that yes I mean I totally agree
with with you guys that an Android
virtue is inevitable but Nokia does
still have a stake in virtue so you
could say you wouldn't be entirely wrong
in saying that Nokia's going to make an
android phone despite see my new offices
comedy the contrary no toe hod nokia
still owns like what ten or twenty
percent of her to something like that
mon okie should have had on to all of it
actually because it was recently i don't
know where i came across it but it was a
statement from virtue saying the day
they're actually growing in their
profits are expanding and improving and
things
and it I was I was just gonna exact same
questions then how are these guys still
in business where is their thriving
they're improving but I guess when you
made it measure things that are three
years behind the development circle a
cycle of everyone else it's it's pretty
cheap to do the one thing I mean
although it's not surprising that
they're going to android android route
you have to like you have to think about
the UM the clientele the people that are
using vertu devices don't really care I
mean they're the kinds of people where
you know instead of wanting to check the
weather on their phone they press the
concierge button on the side of the
phone which connects them to a virtue
concierge and then they ask what the
weather is going to be that's like the
ultimate weather app by the way yeah dad
yeah with your own about my weather
app collection and I'd be done there's
no sign of my predictions when we talk
about today we've covered all of them
but one I'm really excited which is I'm
not saying to see if you guys can just
come to it organically Oh God so the the
uh what I was going to say is that in
that respect it doesn't really matter
yeah I think it matters very little what
operating system of her to phone runs
compared to other platforms because
keeping my virtue still makes the
signature I think which is a dumb phone
it's like running s30 rs40 so and and
you know I mean gwyneth paltrow is still
buying him by the dozens so so it really
so a future yeah she's a huge 42 fan so
the M is so legal handedly keeping the
company so a future a future virtue
could very easily run Windows Phone to
stay in lockstep with its part owner
nokia and I don't think that its clients
would be any the wiser as long as they
can figure out how to make a phone call
and there's still the button on the side
that immediately connects them to a
concierge they would be all set I love
this concierge thing is is basically
like a real-life human Siri that's
exactly what it is but that's exactly
what it is it's a real-life actual
account
what virtue had this figured out years
before Apple and now all I want to know
is what deters last thing is that's
that's consuming me what why are you
thinking about it let's make a quick
mention about lenovo because this
company is really intriguing me this
week they reported their revenues and
contrary to every other pc maker
including Apple with its max they're
actually growing in terms of sales in
terms of profits they broken all of
their records revenues profit sales
shipments yada yada yada and their
smartphone division exactly as the CEO
promised less than six months ago has
turned profitable for the first time in
the last quarter so they're always
actually doing work which me is really
amazing I mean it's obviously all of
this growth is China centric and it's
the one area where all of us are perhaps
less informed then we should be so we're
not perfectly clear on what particular
part of it is growing but you know to me
or when I think the noblemen smartphones
I think misguided Intel devices so just
really up to me how this company just
keeps you know pushing ahead I mean do
you think it's selling all these inter
devices or do you think it's uh well I
mean we got to remember that the the
Chinese market where it lenovo actually
offers its products for sale is enormous
and there's a huge pool of customers to
tap into and even if they're only
tapping into a small fraction of it
there's something like uh there's well
over a billion cell phone customers or
cell phone connections in China had
something like a few hundred thousand
smartphone owners which is insane yes
all of the u.s. so uh you know there's a
there's a huge market to tap there for
lenovo and lenovo as i understand it is
a well-loved company in china so but i
was the other thing I should look into
that break down the growth wasn't just
in China is actually growing
pretty helpfully all over the place
probably latin america i would guess a
southeast asia right more or less
everywhere but here africa yeah i mean
uh yeah there's a huge market for four
devices in China and in Africa that very
few companies have really a solved right
i mean nokia that that's one of Nokia's
traditional strong suits and that's
something that they sell into a sash a
line and some of their very low-end
windows phones and that's obviously
lenovo strength to but but i don't think
you know I don't want to read into it
too much in terms of their ability to
penetrate into in to entrench markets I
don't see a lenovo phone launching any
time soon in the US I don't see one
really taking Europe by storm lease
Western Europe right I mean sure you
think that's going to happen what was
that a blab what was that that orange
phone with the Intel processor that was
not a lenovo right though no no it
wasn't but but I yeah the know that my
families are designed and won't use a
San Diego and you got renamed into de
San Francisco but yes yeah right oh
because of a Qualcomm right that's the
theory anyway uh then that was just an
Intel phone right but what's in a built
by like xolo or something like that Yolo
with an ex or is that the same chassis
you I think it's pretty much the same
design and device but the Xolo one
student like in the end yeah other
places that we're not anywhere near to
write so I need to run guys so damn do
you wanna do you want to do the wrap up
I think look sure can they can handle it
sure so I guess that's episode 35 for
this week which is a februari for 2013
if it's ever so 35 this weekend every
week this week at every week yes oh say
