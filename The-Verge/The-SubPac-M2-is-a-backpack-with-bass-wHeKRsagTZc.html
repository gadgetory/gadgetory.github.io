here to studio in Brooklyn taking a look
at the sub pack now what is a sub pack
exactly what's something that takes the
low frequency sound and whatever you're
listening to and changes it into
vibrations you can actually feel it adds
another dimension to the sound that
you're listening to now this is the m2
it's available starting this month and
it basically takes all that technology
that's crammed into the seatback version
and puts it into a mobile version that
you can wear as a backpack and bring the
experience wherever you want now it's
great about this being mobile is it
opens the technology up to be used for
all sorts of different sounds it doesn't
just have to be used for music or in a
studio I can think about using it to add
to a VR experience or even for being on
the subway and watching videos or
listening to music on your phone or even
for video games I just signed a deal
with Bethesda to optimize it for Fallout
4 this is the smallest and lightest
version that sub pack makes so you wear
this thing just like almost any other
backpacks or straps around your
shoulders there's a buckle here in the
middle to keep the fastened up front and
then you tighten some straps down here
to keep the actual unit up against your
back and it also comes with this unit
here that lets you control the power of
the vibrations and it also gives you a
line in the line out what's great about
this version is that it will actually
take the audio off your phone via
bluetooth so you plug your headphones
into the unit here and never have to
worry about plugging anything into your
phone the battery lasts about six hours
and it charges over a standard AC
adapter so what's this thing like to use
it's pretty cool if you're listening to
music you're gonna feel it in a way that
you probably never felt it before if
you're watching a video you might notice
sounds and the low frequency that you
never would have noticed it might not be
the perfect thing for everyday casual
use and sure there are a lot of ways
that you can improve the sound of
whatever it is that you're listening to
you can go by bigger and more expensive
headphones you can use software to
enhance what's coming out of your phone
or your computer but none of those
solutions actually do what this does
which is wrap you in that sound
now the m2 costs about the 400 bucks
it's a kind of big idea that comes with
a lot of potential and it's going to be
up to sub Pak it's commercial partners
and those early customers to see where
that potential can be brought</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
