now working to help inspire the next
generation of explorers my parents
exposed me to so many things as a child
from sports to creating Lego blocks to
building campers to to music I give most
of my props to my dad he was my mentor
he was my hero you know just really
really helped a lot sports was a really
big part of my life so this is a picture
of me catching or dropping a touchdown
pass in zone it my homecoming game when
there was a scout from the University of
Richmond looking at me drop this pass
and started walking out of the stadium
but he heard the crowd screaming the
second time my coach believed in me gave
me another chance to catch the winning
touchdown pass and that one pass
resulted in a full scholarship to the
University of Richmond I was finishing
my master's degree at the University of
Virginia and I went to a career fair and
a woman at the NASA booth said hey you
come work for NASA my feet I'm like mark
NASA and she just convinced me that I
need to come down check it out so I went
down I looked at it this is pretty cool
I worked at NASA for about I think about
seven or eight years and a friend of
mine who wanted Ben asked her I said
yeah you'd be a great astronaut I'm like
what are you talking about yeah you know
me astronaut and that same year my boy
Charlie Kamara he got in then I saw what
he was doing as flying jets
he was inspiring kids he was to be
flying in space one day and I said wow
that's the ultimate gig and so I applied
the next year I got in and it was just
just incredible to Train on the ground
you go down into a pool it's about 30
feet deep well let's try - letting me
down I realized that this little
styrofoam pad was not in my helmet
my end ask the test director to turn the
volume up in the headset and from that
point on I heard nothing but static
I went deaf the doctors from around the
world no one knew what happened to me
slowly started getting better hearing
came back still hearing impaired and
this year I went to Washington work in
education and that's when we lost space
shuttle Columbia seven of my friends
were in space shuttle Columbia that
broke up coming over the Texas sky one
of the mission specialists was David
Brown but I went to his parents home the
night of the accident to consult them
his father said to me with tears in his
eyes I said Leland the biggest tragedy
would be if we don't continue to fly in
space to carry on their legacy now at
this point I'm not flying because
they've told me I'm medically
disqualified but as we fly around the
country to go to the different moral
services the chief flight surgeon rich
Williams he says I'm going to sign your
waiver to fly this will be your
testimony to the world and today with
that you're clear to land
it's 17,500 miles per hour if I die one
planet every 90 minutes nothing to
prepare you for the views that you'll
see from the space station I mean it's
the colors are just so vibrant just
looking down at the planet and looking
deep into the heavens and the stars and
the planets it's just it's just so
stunning
connecting the dots with building
creating the robotics during the space
I've never really synthesized all those
activities to a final job or final goal
sometimes we don't believe in yourself
other people do they give you a second
chance and I think that's been a theme
through my life you know giving being
given a second chance and now I'm
helping inspire the next generation of
explorers my name is Lila Millman and
this is my story</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
