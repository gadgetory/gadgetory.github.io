we're looking at a pair of Audi's you're
definitely not going to find in your
local dealership one dries for you one
reads traffic light and both are kind of
amazing so ideas worked with the city of
Las Vegas to wire up all of these
streetlights so that they're actually
downloading information about the
programs that the streetlights are
running on the Reds the greens in real
time and Audi is calculating when the
lights are likely to change the engine
is currently completely off the car has
start/stop technology and because it
knows when this light is gonna change
from red to green when there's five
seconds left the engine automatically
turns on so we're ready to go normally
with a start/stop engine the only time
the engine turns on is when you you let
your foot off the brake and then there's
a little bit of a delay before then it
was ready to go with this by the time
the light changes you can press the gas
and you're good to go
and one of the great things about the
car being able to detect when it needs
to start the engine is that if you're
not paying attention the stoplights
you're looking around you can feel the
engine start you can feel it on the
pedal the brake pedal you can sort of
hear the engine a little bit so that
kind of gives you a reminder that you
need to start paying attention to these
lights about to change from red to green
the system is only live in a few
European cities right now and it's very
difficult to scale because every major
European city does their traffic lights
differently it's a little more
homogeneous in the US but it's still a
huge task to try to take in all of this
traffic light information collected in a
server farm in Germany and process it
and get it out to all the cars so this
is a slow process the Las Vegas
deployment is dis receipt yes of course
but over time hopefully we'll see this
later we took through the highway to see
what happens when you fall asleep while
your self-driving car is slugging along
in a traffic jam ok here we go please
watch the traffic around me because this
is pretty scary
there you go so it says driver attention
please well just switch you can switch
back off again uh uh something's
happened
that's uh that's a loud beep that is
it's hard to ignore it is absolutely we
want the driver to know that he's
supposed to tinkle right it uses a
variety of sensors both inside and
outside the car to make this happen
inside there are cameras that are
actually keeping on my face I fall
asleep the car detects that atomically
shuts off the piloted driving and if I
take too long to take control of the car
he'll actually bring it to a full stop
put on the flashers and call the cops so
there you have it just like last year
Audi's throwing a lot of new technology
at CES and neither of these technologies
are ridiculous notions that won't ever
see the light of day they're real and
there's good reason to think they'll be
in production car seat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
