pearson in my free time I like to go big
bird watching though most people just
call that Sesame Street this is 90
seconds on the verge the tech scene has
lost his cheerleader Bill de Blasio has
been elected mayor of New York City and
will take over for Michael Bloomberg on
January first during Bloomberg's 10
years technology became the second
largest industry in New York City behind
finance while de Blasio hasn't made
startups as large a focus he has
committed to expanding broadband access
throughout the birds as well as
investing heavily in tech education
Bloomberg's aggressive boosterism
meanwhile will live on in Chicago Mayor
Rahm Emanuel has vowed to double the
city's tech sector over the next decade
the long-awaited nail has finally
reached the coffin blockbuster will
close its last 300 retail stores in the
US by early January while blockbuster
streaming rental service will still
exist the company's fallen far from its
throne at its peak the rental giant was
operating over 9,000 stores worldwide
honestly my first reaction was
blockbuster still has 300 stores and
finally calm down everyone there is no
zombie apocalypse in what was called a
quote internal production problem Fox
News website appear to be two-faced
yesterday afternoon with headlines
referencing gold miners and yes zombies
Fox now says that the mishap was the
result of a prototype homepage
accidentally being published on to its
main site as for the verge we will
continue prototyping our homepage using
pictures of your dress is immodest
that's it for today's top stories coming
up tomorrow I continue my month-long
hunt for the perfect turkey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
