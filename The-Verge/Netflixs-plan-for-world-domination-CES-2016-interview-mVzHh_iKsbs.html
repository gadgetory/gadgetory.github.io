here at CES with Ted sir and O's chief
content officer from Netflix they made
some big news today when they announced
they were going global
adding 130 new countries and we're gonna
chat a little bit about what makes a
great show and what makes a show go
global tell us a little bit about who
you are and what you announce today
I'm Ted Saran doz I'm the chief content
officer for Netflix and today Netflix
went live in 130 additional countries
making Netflix practically global I say
practically cuz doesn't doesn't include
China yet but we're getting there and so
how much bigger is that than you were
before is that twice as big
well geography it's a lot bigger
broadband house knows much better it's
it's it's an enormous leap forward for
sure and so the countries that you're in
the people who are watching Netflix are
they gonna get pretty much the same
experience that I would in the US is it
gonna vary by territory unfortunately
because where we sit today with this
kind of patchwork of availability
because of existing deals and old
contracts and those kind of things
there's a patchwork of availability
around the world so Netflix today is
different from one country to the next
and what we're working for every year is
that it becomes less and less fragmented
and more global so all of our original
series as an example we released
globally at the same moment I'll more
and more of our licensing dollars that
say about 80 to 85 percent of our new
licensing dollars are spent globally
being buying content for the four that
we work where we have global rights and
lined up Windows but it's gonna be take
several years to do it
but every year think about it as less
and less fragmented and so a lot of the
shows that you produce are set in
different parts of the world is the idea
that you're going to begin producing
content locally in all these different
countries and trying to figure out what
would work on a global level and then
making those shows sort of you know the
Netflix 10 pulse yeah there's a version
of that happening today where like a
show like narcos narcos I think is
probably the purest vision for global
television we've seen yet and I say that
because we produce it with a French film
company the oldest friend you know film
production company in France
it's shot in Colombia it was created by
Brazilian stars a Brazilian who speaks
Spanish
the shows about 85% in Spanish and
people love in Germany so I mean it's a
real global show in almost every aspect
of the creation the production and its
consumption as well we are also doing
shows that are more locally focused but
we think we'll find a large global
audience for like Club de Cuervos is a
show that about a soccer team we film in
Mexico in Spanish most of the watching
of that is in Spanish and in Latin
America but we do find us Latino market
loves the show as well and it's that's
getting bigger we're filming a show in
France right now called Marseille with
Gerard Depardieu in French it will be a
great piece of French original
programming that people will watch on
Netflix around the world I've heard you
talked before about how house of cards
is really popular in China and I know
that's a major market you guys want to
move into when you say it's really
popular in China is that people pirating
it or getting it through a VPN who's
watching it in China and how are they
watching it so house of cards the rights
for out for house of cards outside of
Netflix are controlled by Sony and they
sell them off to other Espada and TV
suppliers in China so it's through
legitimate channels
ittsan watched an enormous volume in
China so you know that the content would
work there what are the obstacles what
are the roadblocks to actually getting
Netflix into China think it's a good
example of the exciting opportunity for
global television which is you wouldn't
think much about house of cards as
Chinese we see things like you know
since sense8 is a show that's kind of
architected to be a global show as
filmed in 8 different cities in the
state at the same time with local talent
in those cities with a big global
filmmaker you know the Wachowski is
creating the show but what's been really
exciting is to see things that are not
necessarily engineered to be global that
just organically are global we license
shows like suits is a show that you pull
off the USA Network that becomes
incredibly popular everywhere we operate
everywhere we launch one of the top
watch shows in that country is prison
break the old prison the old Fox show so
there's a lot of shows that are
unintentionally global but wildly global
which says that they are speaking you
know to the soul they're speaking to the
human condition not
regional biases or regional preferences
right and because you guys are freed up
as sort of you know it you're
distributed over the Internet and now
you have this big global footprint in
some ways are you now acting more as the
middleman the distributor suits is a
good example you had nothing to do with
its creation but you're bringing it to
these big new audiences
better call Saul is another example that
where Sony creates that show it
premieres on AMC network in the North
America and in most countries in the
United States it premieres as a Netflix
original show where yet we didn't
produce it but our licensing dollars
enable the show to be produced at such a
high caliber and so in all these new
countries are you gonna be able to do
the same stuff you do here at the same
price like in countries with you know
different economics with different
levels of broadband how are you gonna
sell Netflix and how people gonna access
it well we're gonna start off there
right so our Netflix is price you know
with near parity I'll or all around the
world today in our existing 60 countries
that we were operating
prior to this morning and I think
that'll be the case for a while while we
kind of figure out the market in the
market conditions and so are there
technologies that you're looking at you
know we're here at CES things like
virtual reality or you know live
streaming is becoming increasingly
popular are there opportunities are we
live streaming now we are live streaming
that so don't you feel are there
opportunities for you to do things that
are yeah a little bit different than
sort of you know the traditional format
of here's a show you can watch it
episodically here's the film you can
watch it in one sitting yeah you know um
VR is an example I think there's one
thing that I don't know yet how it will
emerge as a part of narrative
storytelling it's fun and there's a lot
that will come over the next couple of
years with it so we're not trying not to
get too far ahead of the platform itself
so that people will be able to watch
whatever we're producing for it so you
can watch Netflix movies and TV shows
with VR goggles and have that experience
but in terms of incorporating into our
production just on pure very very edge
case experiments on right now and we
produced as an example over the holiday
we released an episode of Marco Polo
called hundred eyes there was an origin
story of one of the main characters of
Marco Polo that we just dropped it just
one day jokes is on the site and
with no hype and no fanfare and a way to
bridge season one in season two we did
the same with the Bojack horseman but
Christmas episode last year and we are
experimenting with different forms
inside and outside of the series
themselves
Chelsea Handler will be our first talk
show which is a new format for us making
a murderer right now is kind of a
unbelievable sensation yeah and it's
it's our only our second documentary
series that we launched and it is in
talk about like in the zeitgeist I mean
that's what everyone's talking about
these days right and so that's a good
example is that something that was
data-driven you saw people watching a
lot of true crime they were watching a
lot of murder mysteries and you said hey
we know that our audience will like this
let's make this documentary or are you
making more decisions now based on yeah
your gut what seems like good creative
you know the meetings that you take it's
a little bit of both I mean I really
look at it as informed hunches so you
might have you have a hunch and you
either use the data to either confirm
the hunch or dismiss the hunch or the
other way around which is you start
seeing patterns in the data Adam Sandler
was an example of that where I was
looking through these you know reports
around the country or around the world
I'm seeing that Adam Sandler movies in
every window were performing fantastic
everywhere in the world and in some
countries Adams movies weren't even
being released and what we saw was no
there's a huge demand for Adam Sandler
movies and sooo much so much so that we
invested in the first window for his
next four movies and and he's in the
first one ridiculous six proved to be
enormous ly global and a real huge
success on Netflix already only in three
weeks as you look out you know into the
the future today was a big announcement
you know you've made a big change do you
see this doubling the subscriber base I
mean you're in so many more markets now
could this you know really help you
change your scale remember all these
countries are at different states of
developing in terms of broadband speeds
payment infrastructure all those things
that you need to be a really happy
Netflix subscriber so the potential of
the market is is huge
so for Facebook and YouTube and a lot of
it and most internet companies it's
80/20 international you know only 20% of
their business
is domestic and I think that represents
what the map could look like in terms of
most web-based companies now we're you
know if we do a really great job at
programming the site in a way that
people are excited about the programming
all over the world either look at the
global penetration of mobile phones and
broadband and you say that's the markets
at potential so right now the audience
is larger in the US and you're saying
you think internationally that market
could grow to be much larger than the
u.s. currently I'm sure that would be a
natural progression of the business I
think very cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
