checking out Spotify for iPad which
launches today so the app is universal
which means it's for iPhone and iPad
while the iPhone app largely looks the
same the iPad app is brand new
completely customized for a large
display so let's dive right into it
first thing to look at is just like
before Spotify is still very focused on
playlists so in the playlist view you
can tap Edit and you can remove
playlists but unlike on the desktop app
you can't rearrange things or anything
like that there's still no sorting
within the playlists you can just remove
things create new ones if you tap a
playlist you can go into it see what's
inside of it you can rearrange songs
within the playlist but you can't sort
them so as you browse through the
playlist you'll notice the pain
interface which looks just like Twitter
for iPad another thing that Spotify
wants to focus on for all of their new
apps it's not in the iPhone app just yet
but they want to move in that direction
is the long press instead of a swipe so
you can long press something and you can
star it you can add it to a playlist you
can add it to your queue you can send it
to a friend and it's kind of the same as
before because that works because if
you're swiping through your panes you
obviously can't swipe across to use
those commands so when you actually play
a song there's a persistent player on
the bottom of the screen at all times
and if you tap the band art you can
actually access those same long press
commands like add to queue at the
playlist if you tap the fullscreen
button you can go into full-screen mode
which Spotify is very very proud of
another thing that's great about the new
iPad app is that it brings it on totally
new search features so so you can see
I'm typing in The Strokes and as I'm
typing it things start coming up
instantaneously like The Shins and it's
a unified search experience unlike the
old apps so you can get playlists
artists albums and finally songs within
the search screen another cool thing is
that search now works even when you're
offline if you do want to download
something offline you can do it kind of
like how you used to within the
playlists screen and once you tap the
download arrow and select save to
offline you'll actually notice in the
bottom left corner of the app there's a
little pie chart with arrows that go
through it that indicates how far along
your entire download is that's a nice
feature that's unique to the iPad app if
you move to the inbox you'll notice that
every song that's been sent to you on
Spotify is actually nested by person now
as opposed to chronologically like it
was before so as you swipe through you
can see playlists and songs that friends
have sent you categorized by person the
what's new section is expanded from what
it used to be on mobile on your iPhone
but it's still not great especially
compared to RDO the carousel at the top
is nice looking but I don't know what
those recommendations even mean or how
they apply to me you can't really see
what your friends are listening to in
this app besides using the People Hub on
the left side here so you see a grid
just like you'd see on the Spotify
desktop app and it shows everybody that
you're friends with on Facebook that
uses Spotify so there's no friending
involved and if you tap somebody you can
see all the playlists that they have
published which is cool but I mean you
can't really see anything else about
them like what are their favorite songs
what are they listening to in the last
couple weeks the settings menu at the
bottom left corner of the new Spotify
app is literally exactly the same as
what you'd find on iphone app you see
crossfade which actually lets you adjust
how many seconds you want to fade in and
out between tracks and then you also
have gapless playback which is a great
new feature and this private session
Scrabble the last dot FM show on
Facebook you can turn that off if you
want to listen to some guilty pleasures
and then if you see stream and sync you
can actually now change streaming and
syncing quality all the way up to
extreme which is 322 kilobits a second
as a whole the new Spotify iPad app
doesn't tread any new ground it just
kind of takes what we've seen and
packaged it into a pretty fantastic
interface there's still such a focus on
playlists and contrast to RDO and other
solutions but as Spotify is convinced
that that's the way to go at least for
now
so that is Spotify the new app for iPad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
