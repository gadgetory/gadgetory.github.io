CES and I am holding the 0 which is made
by the company zero UI designer Oh is
actually two parts it's a series of
motifs that are just standard sort of
robot motors the kind of thing you might
find in a Lego Mindstorms kit and a
glove that actually lets you control
them this glove includes some flex
sensors right here and a motion sensor
here and the idea behind it is that you
use a smartphone app to map gestures
from the globe onto different motions of
the motor so if you want the motor to go
forward maybe you can put your hand up
if you want it to go backwards down if
you want something to turn 180 degrees
like this you might clench your fingers
there are about seven gestures and you
can map them to any number of motors so
if you have a four wheeled vehicle you
turn your hand and all four of them move
forward it's generally just a little
clever UI twist to a robotics kit the
kind that a lot of kids play with its
lunching as an IndieGoGo campaign in
January where four of these motors will
cost 199
you could also just add these to any
kind of robotics kit that you already
have you can see some variations here
there's this relatively complex robot
and there's actually really interesting
tarragon up there again this is these I
grow gloves and if you want to see more
