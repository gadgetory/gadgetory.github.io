Virg mobile show which we're actually
having on Tuesday afternoon this week
unlike we've had to postpone it or
moving around past few weeks but we are
here we are in force this is episode 34
for the week of january thirty 21st 2012
i'm dan seifert I'm glad Sam oh and i'm
chris sigler and you guys might notice
that a dieter bohn is not with us today
but we do miss him we are not in the
bone zone this week we're not in the
bone zone and I'm being told that I said
it was January 21st 2012 but it's not
it's January 21st you're living in the
past man I live in the past man dude I I
did the same thing I actually wrote it
in an article saying that the new kodak
microphone thirds camera is coming
quarter free 2012 and people were like
are we go back to the past which is kind
of fitting since codec is no dead codec
is a relic of the past Kyrgyz relic of
thank you it is being resurrected I mean
it's just branding exercise at this
point because some random company called
JK imaging which is just using the
correct name which is already be done
with polaroid news cameras oddly
atrocious but this is dope show you know
you know why that is flat JK imaging is
short for just kidding imaging there
they're just kidding about all these
cameras are there controlling the public
patrolling consumers you know it's
actually quite funny I was thinking
about that and naturally was that enough
the show today we would have massive
digression on the side but you know what
without DJ I don't even know what topics
are so low it's it's going to be a mess
but I was thinking about this with
respect to motherboards actually like a
lot of these Taiwanese and small Chinese
companies producing motherboards that
was a bit which was one of the actually
premier motherboard makers few years
back and a whole bunch of others
companies like albatron and whatnot I
was just reminiscing on that subject and
I was thinking how exactly companies
like this random JK imaging sometimes
lead and sometimes fail and it's just
it's just an oddity to me you know you
have these poor companies and some of
them turn into issues and just explode
into a massive consumer brand and then
some of them like biostar for example
shrink maybe it's cuz their name is
biostar yeah all i have to say pegatron
is worse than take it runs amazing i
kind of wish I own some pegatron product
I probably do it don't know right right
so let's talk about mobile stuff unless
you have more to say before me well why
I do I have many thoughts on pegatron
but no I was just going to apologize to
our dear viewers for my absence last
week my my imac uh so I've a late 2009
imac this is by the way completely
different tangent but I'm gonna go on
for the next 15 minutes late 2009 I'm
imac 27-inch that was eligible for the
drive recall they had a one terabyte
seagate drive recall that keeps getting
extended I think they originally put it
out in 2010 and I never bothered to take
it in for the recall and finally i got
my comeuppance when the drive began
failing last week so that's why i was
off last week also because i was deathly
ill i'm still recovering from that but
the reason why this camera looks like
complete garbage is because it is the
built-in camera on my macbook air hello
chris how far away is the the nearest
apple store to where you live about a
mile so so you had to transport a
27-inch my imac through downtown Chicago
about a mile yeah I was it believe me it
was a production I really I just would
love to I'm envisioning you standing on
the street with a 27 inch imac under
your arm hailing a cab that's exactly
what happened actually ah and I was
surprised that any cab was willing to uh
pull over and an intake but I yeah
particular uses you're wearing your bass
headphones at a time right I was welcome
to the imax listening to some music but
but the worst part was is that I get to
the apple store and I give them the
computer
and they take it out of the giant box
and give me the box back and I'm like
I'm like no you can keep that and
they're like no we don't have room for
it so that I don't take the giant box
back with me and now I'm gonna have to
take it back to the store to pick up the
computer it's it's a nightmare anyway we
can talk about from the walks of shame
that you have to go through for this
imac yeah as in this experience may be
tempted you to just say screw it and
upgrade to the extra slinky new iMac uh
yes and no I mean I said a few weeks ago
on the show that there's nothing like
spec wise there's nothing about my 27
inch imac that feels like slower
outdated it started getting really slow
lately and i finally figured i looked at
the smart status on the drive and that's
how I figured out that it was failing
but but apart from that it's been great
the screens fine so until either it just
completely gives up the ghost or there's
something about it that's like horribly
obsolete whether it be you know the
processor or the the total ram i can
install i think i'm gonna try and see if
i can make this one last yeah i'm with
you i agree but since the Justice
talking about extra skinny and new
things let's use that as a really flaky
segue talk about HTC so I feel like you
know as far as mobile news is concerned
we're in that annoying period where
there isn't going to be like a whole lot
of major announcements and everything is
just going to be kind of like leaks up
until Mobile World Congress like I kind
of I like this time of year but I also
kind of dread this time of year because
you see endless leaks samsung things
like at this time last year we were
seeing leaks of the galaxy s3 seven
different ways to Sunday and it was like
every other minute it was a different
looking device it is just a headache
would be you know be honest those one
technican leaks because most of them
turn out to be folks oh yeah yeah the
alleged leaks i should say um be ghastly
they turned out to be wrong but I think
the biggest news that's happened since
the last time we were on the air was the
htc's alleged m7 and
device that is expected to be announced
at mwc now um has has leaked or
allegedly leaked so yeah it's emerged
it's emerged it's like this is the
public it is now before our eyes and
it's still way too massive so I have to
say it's it's unusual to me that the m7
bears more than a passing resemblance to
the 8x because so wait let's let's wait
one second Chris because you know in the
time since our last show it's actually
emerged twice with two very different
looking to buy true right yeah so so so
the the exact same thing that was just
complaining about his Samsung what
happening last year happens with this
alleged HTC this year so we have this
first device that leaked that supposedly
was the the front of the new device and
it looks very much like a on the back of
an iphone 5 ha and then we have this
other one which is actual physical
pictures of a new device that looks like
the 8x right and and that's actually a
very good point there there's every
reason to believe that HTC has adopted
samsung strategy last year of encasing
its new flagship devices in dummy cases
and maybe they're doing something like
that here although the the device the
second device that emerged the physical
pictures but by all accounts that looks
like a real phone and looking at the
pictures now so it would be a very
elaborate disguise if it is in fact a
disguise but but at any rate what I was
saying is that the the 8x you know HD
both HTC and Microsoft made a point of
saying that the industrial design of
that device was kind of like designed
from the ground up to compliment windows
phone and now HTC if this phone is in
fact real appears to be repurposing
portions of that industrial design for
Android just I mean it's you know it's
it's a base we saw some of this design
on the DNA already in the butterfly like
if you look at the back of this well
sure the cameras in the same spot
it's got the kind of that matte finish
that with the the curve to it so the
front is is is a bit more like the 8x
but the back is very kind of familiar
for the DNA yep that's fair and it also
it's worth mentioning that anytime
anybody says the hardware and the
software were tailored for one another
that's basically BS dead touchscreens
guys the touchscreens the bezel like if
you think about your list of design
priorities when you put together an
iphone and android phone windows phone
even blackberry nowadays it's a case of
minimize the bezel maximize a touch
screen area do something fancy that
makes you stand out that's it it's not
software dependent at all and and in
fact the only device that I can think of
that had any sort of connotation of
being really connected on the hardware
and software front was no key as n 9
which is perfectly ironic because dn9
was put together to work with Nokia's me
go home town and you can kind of see the
curvature of the icons the squirrels is
Nucky's designers forum you can kind of
see which they took from the zune I
don't know if Microsoft ever called it a
squirrel on the zune but everyone else
did hmm i'm trying to think back to that
but anyway the zune Asia was also
another device the the zoom of this
control pad at the below the screen was
a squirrel and I think that's where
everyone started using that phrase
skwerkel that's as that's early as I can
remember okay I'm not quitting nokia
would invented the word but like the
point is that the industrial design of
the n9 and its curvature kind of echoed
the icons and just a consistency of the
UI and then Microsoft did not get turned
around and said well this is less
hardware with viva 800 for Windows Phone
yada yada yada the perfectly matched and
they weren't actually and it's just
marketing when when they said the 8x is
specifically tailored to windows for
it's not a like if you have a straight
line in any phone it specifically
tailored to Windows Phone because it has
squares do you remember the the first
prototype of the 800 that that Elop
showed didn't even have a capacitive
buttons at the bottom it was a it was a
virtual arrangement because they were
obviously just using an N 9 with
different guts inside of it so they
didn't have that that manufactured yet
that's right i think i think it was a
codename see ray was it see ya see worry
that sounds okay yeah you know set was
one of the most obviously self
engineered leaks in the history of it
was like it I mean that was about the
time when i published our and nine
review and everybody else which is
gushing about it people like what is
nokia doing not giving this device i was
just my future and then Stephen Elop and
company decided you know we'll just
shoot our own video oh god I remember
the video now that you're talking about
that yeah let that like internal meeting
event yeah and multiple angles any laps
like don't take pictures and then he
liked coming around if I can take
pictures let me just hold this up yeah
did you can you get did you not take a
picture of this did Eugenie I'll get
that shot what do you guys eat you you
should be using your flesh that's the
best way to take fiction I mean don't
take a picture yeah but but back to the
m7 I think that may be the bigger news
than the industrial design of the
hardware is this sense 5 yeah which is a
dramatic departure I mean going all the
way back to the original HTC was the
hero or the magic or no no it was a
windows mobile phone no no but I mean I
mean a rosy on Android 100k yes was that
the hero the first Qin device yeah the
hero yep yeah and I would say this is
the most dramatic departure for sense
since then if it is in fact real which I
think a lot of evidence has grown in the
past 24 hours to suggest that it is
because we found some rom links for
other devices uh what do you guys think
oh dude I need to I need to opine on
this I looked at it and yes it's a
departure but it's a departure in
basically the wrong direction really
well no it's it sort of in the right
direction but off to the side and okay
it's not far enough like okay I it's a
lateral boob is what you're saying yeah
yeah so his thing they've cut down the
chrome again yes so thumbs up for that
but is the same sort of thumbs up the
dam will recall from last week's podcast
that he was giving me and that I was
giving people at CES when they try and
you know pimp out a feature which is
completely you know tepid and
uninspiring it's like a well done you
took you took off some chrome so you had
crap in yourself to wear and you took it
out and now we're supposed to like
upload you guys well done okay so they
took two and crow they went to
more two dimensional look with their
icons they simplify them so again that's
kind of neat kind of good but at this
rate of improvement at this rate of
change it's really gonna be like 20 20
something before we have a sense that we
actually really want to use like this
might be dramatic by sense standards but
it still not like I can still feel
underneath this stuff that HC just
clinging onto just dearly clinging onto
and there's no reason for HC to stick
with us you can be just completely
revolutionary as far as I'm concerned
your sales are going down you need to do
something to kick kick start things
we've had this discussion a whole bunch
of times with one series where no
complaints about the industrial design
about the specs about the displays etc
the problem is in the software NEC needs
to face that and really make a leap with
its next version of sense I just not do
that it's just like yeah
what is it doing its messing around with
the edges instead of like fundamentally
changing the software again we've only
seen some screenshots so maybe I'm you
wrong it may be long you say that we've
before stuff very limited screen shots
we've got a shot of of what we put
supposes the lock screen the home screen
and then a couple versions software
version screens um but you know we don't
see what the launcher is like yet we
don't know what the notifications with
the notification part was like the
biggest I think pain point for me every
time I picked up a sense phone and we
don't know it's according to this device
it still has um capacitive buttons for
home back and multitasking and they're
in a really weird position on this
particular device that that has emerged
so it doesn't look like they're moving
to software buttons for those which is a
little bit of a disappointment but I
mean to your point Vlad it seems like
the only change is a very very surface
level as opposed to the the radical
change and let me just back myself up
here because I'm saying they're clinging
on things perfect example is you still
have that full screen whether animation
stuff going on do that yes this one
screen show we have a full screen of you
know starlit sky and the weather and it
just kills me I mean look I'm happy that
they finally accepted that they can have
a clock widget without the flipping
stuff going on and without the whole
animated thing just having numbers so we
can see this is the reading of time
without being bombarded with innovations
I'm happy with I just I just feel like
it's so very superficial I feel like
it's not pushing boundaries enough it's
not doing anything to excite me anyway
so Dan I'm actually going to challenge
your notion that it's a disappointment
that they're not going with soft buttons
I six months ago I would have agreed
with you but what I've realized is I
realize two things one on on Android
there isn't enough that they're doing
with those soft buttons to really make
them worthwhile I mean about all they do
is disappear when you're like
looking at a picture or something so all
you're doing is eating up pixels at the
bottom of the screen that could be used
for doing actual things with and two
were a year removed or more than a year
removed now from the from the google
edict to to get away from the menu
button so that becomes less of an issue
as time goes by well i mean III agree
with you there that they definitely
could be better used and i know like the
the whole android development community
and custom roms and stuff like that
there do is really crazy stuff with the
virtual buttons but knowing standard
manufacturer unfortunately is it google
certainly isn't doing anything
interesting out yet as far as the menu
button goes though but like for the big
x that matter it's still there and like
so facebook and twitter and these major
apps you still have that stupid menu bar
that's sucking up your screen real
estate anyways and and HTC like sort of
fixed it on the 1x would that want that
option that you could configure the bot
in the the capacitive buttons to hold
down the multitasking button to bring up
the menu instead so it got rid of it but
they didn't extend that across their
line because you don't have that option
on the droid DNA so i'm not confident
that it will be on any new devices
unless you know someone complains about
it and an HTC just puts it in there um
which is annoying but yeah I mean listen
guys I again I'm expressing
disappointment base of very little
information and I'm willing to believe
and I'm interested to hear actually from
Chris what he thinks is such a dramatic
departure that he's noticing in since
five or the local time go finish your
anchors and respect before before we do
that though um yeah I had a point in
that I lost it and cool story bro I
think it's because my pet peeves with
HTC devices and Android devices probably
in general now a 2-1 is sighs that are
too large and the other is the software
that they don't improve it and they
bloat it out
and with HTC that's the case of tuning
radio and facebook app and all of these
things that I can't even install right I
wish I wish glad had to use a verizon
phone one day what had to use I know I
look for a weaker would I know in a
teensy I know they load up crap as well
I mean the only reason we don't get that
in the UK it's probably cuz our carries
on that savvy you know there are savvy
enough to do that so you know screw
in the customer right and I'm quite
happy to level the same accusation at
Samsung in fact Samsung's Galaxy devices
are a guaranteed minimum half hour of
just cleaning stuff out cleaning widgets
of the home screens that's the other
thing I don't use seven home screens
with a million widgets on them so don't
preload them HTC has em so do that all
the time so my my puppies are the size
of devices there's no choice they always
wake too large and the software is never
clean enough to the point where now
there's enough room for Google to be
doing quote unquote signature devices
with it with the Nexus is where there's
no book where there's no whatever you
know the way max listing with maps of
signature Windows laptops and devices
previously so that's it so as far as I'm
concerned the m7 fixes none of that
stuff but now can handle with Christian
could tell us what it does fix so look
call me superficial so first of all I
will agree with with you Vlad and and
you Dan I mean we've seen very little of
this interface assuming it's even real
which like I said I think we can
probably safely assume it is but we
don't know you know how far along they
are in the in the design process how
early this rom is there are lots of
things we don't know we've seen very
little of the revised UI and UX but one
of my biggest complaints with sense has
been the amount of chrome like I don't
want 3d anything and that's that's
that's one of the most powerful that's
why i keep getting drawn to wind it well
one of the reasons i keep getting drawn
to windows found with each new release
at the play
form is because it is a very visually
appealing UI and that's something that
sense is not and even as google has
tried to make android more beautiful
starting with you know three really and
then for and 4.1 4.2 that's that's a
message that OMG she seemed particular
was sense of not really taken to heart I
don't think and this is the first time
I've seen an HTC android device where I
say yes wow they get it they finally
understand that that you I should not
have like you know artificial like lens
flares and like you know weird shadow
element's it's very 2d which is where
you know that is the state of modern
design is very 2d and very simple and
very monochromatic and it looks like
they're adopting those principles and
hopefully what we don't know the
unanswered question is whether that
principle will carry through not just
these superficial things like the the
you know the clock widget and the icons
but will it carry through the way the
entire UI works and we don't know they
that yet we probably won't until nwc or
sometime between nine mwc good grade
totally so I mean I guess it's just a
matter of how much of it up to mr. a
pessimist you are thing with me is also
I feel a little bit burned by sense for
because HTC said streamline everything
about sense for so although superfluous
things that you won't know by we listen
to you guys we got rid of them and then
a couple of months pass we go to review
devices settled in and they will figure
it out the sense for know wasn't all
that streamlined after all and well in
relative to sense 36 it was but relative
to it like that for that's that's the
point which I started off with if you
just go into every single year it says
we're trying off the chrome we're
trimming off the crap that we've added
ourselves I'm not gonna give you much
credit for that yeah yeah that's fair
enough and so I'm done talking about the
m7 I have nothing more to say Michael I
told announced yeah it's not over until
the next leak that we're
talking about exit right a couple quick
mention for I mean having to expect the
m7 to be is it a 4.7 inch with a 1080p
display I believe is what it's been said
to be six point four inches actually
with summer 5 inches they're gonna
one-up Saudi with a six point four five
inch yeah actually can is now a good
time for me to go on my weekly rant
about phone sizes is that everyone we
should I know that we weren't
necessarily planning on talking about it
but I have to invoke this absurd leak of
a sony panel that's allegedly for a six
point four four inch phone that would
probably be introduced in the WC if it
is in fact real I didn't I think I like
I totally get why every OEM right now
wants to ride on the coattails of
Samsung success with the galaxy note I
get it but that that is not a blank
check to keep going to bigger and bigger
like that is not there there is an
infinite runway to make phones bigger
and bigger like yes 5.5 might be okay
for some people 6.44 is not play with
them but I think it was you that played
with the huawei at CES right mmhmm yeah
I've later then Vlad played with it yeah
and it was insane right yes yes so and
and this is bigger no no good way you
know the problem I had with the huawei
was uh the first thing I did I put in my
hand and I'll put my nexus 4 and and my
nexus 4 I can I could touch my other
finger with my thumb so like you know I
can't be off that comfortably but at
least I can horizontally reach across it
and I could not do that with the the
huawei like I just could not reach
across in my palm and I was like this is
the worst thing ever oh yeah so flats
let's got a nexus 7 no this is a sin
ipad mini so I'm stretching my thumb to
try reach it is the thing you know how
they said the initially when the ipad
mini was introduced that you really have
to stretch your hand in order to grip it
in one hand and apples kind of pushing
it yeah that much is true but i guess i
have big hands i kind of do that but
yeah I mean the huawei does the thing is
closer to this
that it is to any phone in terms of
ergonomics well I mean there's the
gnosis and you know continues we're
going to be talking about a rumored
eight-inch phone by Christmas you know
the thing is it really doesn't actually
matter if the software is good enough if
it's a 6.1 or 6.5 you can just use it as
a good tablet but that is actually
Google's biggest problem because at the
moment i'm thinking the most exciting
industrial design isn't actually
happening with mobile phones just
because we're kind of stuck four
dimensions and every single millimeter
has been sliced off devices you still
need some space for camry sunni space of
batteries LT etc whereas things like the
ipod touch things like the ipod may ipad
mini rather have more room for those
things because cameras and lt are not
such big priorities as with phones or
they don't expect the same quality let's
say so industrial design innovations far
as I'm concerned is coming in other
areas so we mentioned the new iMac which
again is just really gorgeous to look at
if nothing else I agree with Chris is no
reason to upgrade the specs but it's
pretty nice the ipad mini and ipod touch
this new generation design the more time
I spend with it the more I love it I
think it's really real so and I'm really
actually excited by the Xperia tablet Z
that's only just introduced which is a
10 inch tablet is even thinner than the
ipad mini but then you turn the tablet
on and it's Android on a tablet and I
just like ah I just have a lot of things
gasm tablet p sony's tablet and built in
the peak with the tablet p it's been all
downhill ya know mi alone it is don't
you guys kind of feel underwhelmed when
you realize it's an android tablet yet
another android tablet yeah there's
something about it i've never really
been able to put my finger on it i'm
sure that other people have done a
better job of it than I have but there's
something fundamental about the Android
UI that is not conducive to tablet use
and and i think that the
that the nexus 7 came the closest to
solving that problem but the way they
solved it is by making the screen small
enough so that you can kind of handle it
the same way you handle a big phone yeah
not but not by making a really tablet
appropriate you I so I think that
they're really struggling between nine
and ten inches and and they don't have
an answer for that yet and of course the
way iOS solves it is two ways one with a
ridiculously simple and arguably
outdated home screen where that's just
literally like a grid of icons and a
great app design you have you know this
giant phalanx of amazing app developers
on iOS who are really obsessed with
design and have found ways to optimize
tablet UI on ipad in ways that frankly
android developers do not so between
those two things they still have the
advantage while we're on our crazy phone
sighs ramp can we talk about what was
announced in Japan today I didn't I
don't think we added it to our official
list but NEC is releasing the echo again
if you remember the commuter echo you
can I do yeah a date and they re
releasing well you say icon in their
attempt they're doing a to a dual screen
smartphone uh yeah you can connect
together into one giant screen but it's
their own design is their own product
yes it's a row design but it's the same
idea so so you can terrible TRO then I'm
terrapin yes notes2 it's not to 4.3 inch
displays that you can connect together
that are like one is on the front and
one is on the back and you can flip them
horizontally so you've got one almost
square display that you can do two
things at once or view the webpage on
the did the full screen as well which
which cracks me up our guy in Japan Sam
be who sam byford who uh who got hands
on with this seem to be pretty impressed
with it in the video but I just I just
kept thinking about that poor kyocera
echo and and the the death that it
suffered because it was such a poor
poorly executed idea
for some reason every time you say echo
dan I think a nod of e CH 0 but of ecco
the dolphin video game not a designer no
III don't know what it is I mean one
thing to keep in mind is that the needs
and wants and desires of the Japanese
market are still somewhat different than
they are elsewhere in the world and
maybe this form factor is going to go
over very well who knows we just know
that the echo was not received with much
love in the US but yeah actually that
reminds me there's something really
peculiar by the Japanese market peculiar
from Western perspective anyway which
again is about size and that is that
they sell drinks the so soft drinks in
different sizes so there's like 100
millimeter cans and then 330 millimeter
cans but it certainly the same price
from vending machines and the rate would
sell both because people in Japan seem
to have the self-control to decide what
do they need a hundred millimeters of a
drink or 330 and and like some people
actually buy a smaller portion because
they don't need that much either that I
do that flat or they're ripping off the
people that want 200 milliliter that
feels impossible there's like gas
stations here in the US where UK well
they'll say like you know any size
coffee is 99 cents and I guarantee you
that the vast majority of people by the
the biggest coffee they can get for
ninety-nine cents right i mean it does
does the whole idea that we have broadly
speaking and this isn't just like drinks
or food or anything else so tech devices
everywhere it's like more quantity was
more Valley most people think yeah
although by the same guy i don't know if
that analogy really converts to what
we're talking about here with phones
because it's not with these
quote-unquote flagship devices it's not
about value right it's about what makes
a flagship device and and there's a very
strong association with many OEMs and
presumably with many consumers that that
bigger is better and it's the exact same
thing that's been happening in the car
industry for the past 50 years
it more so in the u.s. than in Europe
and Japan but it yeah we talked about it
two weeks ago with someone I don't know
who I'm dying to find out who someone in
the verge trailer at CES have nexus one
and all those evan rodgers Oh Evan who
brought like 20 phones with him
including I get a tmobile galaxy s that
was glued to a tablet friend no no no is
glued to a battery pack that he's use it
is evan is insane evident if you're
watching i love you but you're in any
way so he added nexus one there and we
all picked it up and it it felt and
looked like a child's toy it was so
small yeah I'm sure I'm sure that if you
used it for a while you get used to it
you might even come to prefer it but it
just struck me like that for me really
um was the moment that I realized how
far we've come in terms of our
perception of phone screen size in the
past two years that here we look at this
nexus one now and just looks tiny yeah
so also announced in Japan is LG's
optimus g pro which was rumored this
week and that is officially unveiled by
a TT docomo which is a 5 inch version of
the optimus G that has a 1080p display
and chances are we will see the global
version of this announced at nwc so it's
just yet another 5 inch phone on the
market so that's what we've got the j
butterfly droid DNA the Sony Xperia Z
and the LG optimus and the ice instead
so those are all in the 5-inch 1080p
yeah then this ziti and then we got this
yup and the upper find 5 the upper point
five so I don't include the Oppo in the
same conversation is the rest of these
it's all day okay do you got you gonna
see the UI and the thing I wish you know
that's that's my problem from CES it's
not seeing the OP animations and madness
like if we think the Japanese is
slightly different from us the Koreans
and the software add a load on their
devices just like a whole other
do you guys remember three or four years
ago there was that fake Oppo phone going
around and they reverse letters it was
the poop phone like it was apple logo
but they just wish that piece and you
know presumably it was being sold in
China and presumably they didn't realize
what poop meant it was definitely one of
my favorite posts that I wrote at
engadget was this very special moment
for me we have to look that up I vaguely
remember that but yeah just googled the
poop phone and it'll come up was it
joke's on you own that you own the
Google juice on the poop phone yeah I'm
googling it right now I'm sure it'll be
on page one maybe they were faking dopod
as the brand because that was the way
that HT was burning his phones in China
for a long time I know the name but the
the dopod logo was different this was it
looked like the Oppo it was the apple
logo is the same typeface uh yeah shoot
i'm not on page one but but uh John
Biggs of big cheers like a crunch yeah
he's got it unlocked down yep there it
is the poop phone anyway uh sorry to uh
really conversation I just any time that
you wanted to rail the conversation to
talk about the poop phone is say okay
with me I just don't think that that
oppo has earned the right yet to be
included in the same conversation as the
rest of these brands you the gold
standard for me and I know that this is
a very American thing to say but for me
the gold standard is if you can convince
an American carrier to carry a device of
yours then you you deserve to be
included in that conversation otherwise
you're just a second tier OEM oh yeah
but yeah second tier is actually being
charitable to a pop yeah like yeah yeah
it was i got on an upward trajectory
that's what we can say they're going up
we're just jumping on that bandwagon
nice and early so like 10 years time
with a finally catch up and get this
stuff together and they're right there
with sense 15
then 10 yeah I co these guys about a
dozen years ago I covered it yeah I know
if since five if sense continues on the
same trajectory that we're seeing on
some incense 5 they're just going to
come a point in time where it's
indistinguishable from stock Android
that you know you know they'll brand it
in some way so that it sounds like super
advanced when it really I'm gonna say
about sense give us a freaking option
man total stock Oh sense make sense the
default that's fine i'll find the option
i'll dig up the freakin option and i'll
just toggle it and switch to stop it is
not gonna kill anybody i guarantee you
people will not die oh come on it might
kill HTC's engineers because that's an
entirely new round of validation that
that they need to go through to make
sure that they have you know the phone
working one hundred percent with stock
just as they do with with sense right I
mean like that's why it takes the
signage in guys so long the ship a
stable wrong for new devices is because
it isn't as simple as like you know
compiling uh LSP and dropping it on a
new phone like you eat there are drivers
they need to compile into the kernel and
you know it's a huge nightmare yeah okay
well I said I was the last thing I'm
gonna say about a song about anymore but
yeah quick mention go back to the LG
that then actually that phone was one of
the quickest to go from being rumored
which actually happen like last week or
maybe the week for the optimus g pro and
a boom it's announced in japan well this
is kind of funny kind of funny story
because the same exact thing happened
with LG in the optimus g last year
that's true like the japanese carrier
partners were like well we're shown
enough now so here you go and then LG
has its big event weeks later that
unveils for the rest of the world even
though everybody if you've been paying
attention had seen it already yeah
that's the thing i can just foresee the
event at mwc where this really
straight-laced korean executive steps up
to the stage and he's really nervous
it's like one of the biggest moments of
his life and he's playing it completely
straight and he's like do
g pro the five inches today's if you
just play IPS it has an RGB is no
 I'm like oh excuse me you know
it's a real ideas hey guys this is
pretty awesome over like yeah soda in
Japan last month you just took our you
just single-handedly took the Virgin
Mobile show from a g-rated podcast to a
pg-rated podcast web while quoting a
future I think that's okay that's about
uh look I still don't think I know that
droid DNA is a pretty baller phone I get
it I still don't believe in the 5-inch
1080p panel I I don't literally gay I
don't need that that dot pitch and I
don't mean a five inch device and I've
tried people keep telling me oh just
carry the the note to around for a week
and you'll love it well no I will I just
returned my note 2 review unit I
couldn't I couldn't wait to get that out
of my office yeah I I hear you you know
what's really funny to me is that
Samsung you know there have been these
rumors of the galaxy note 3 moving to
6.3 inches which makes a lot of sense if
the if the galaxy s4 is going to be a 5
inch or four point nine inch 1080p
device right and here they're going to
probably announce it at Eddie fuh just
like they normally do and they will
already been bested by 76.4 4 inch
device but they're just gonna look like
complete Buster's you're not going to be
able to give you know Samsung the the
Korean manufacturers samsung LG for
years and years and years have been
known for really pushing numbers as
being very mean or you know the world's
faster the world's biggest or the
world's brightest those kinds of
superlatives are very important to their
market right and if that's not something
they're going to be able to push with
the Galaxy Note 3 at least in terms of
styles if it is in fact 643 in fact I
bet Samsung is going back to the labs
right now and and make get to creep on
the evidence to do that before is 6.45
yes Samsung did take their first the
10 inch Galaxy Tab they saw the iPad get
refreshed and they were like actually i
think is garbage it's a good thing then
I yeah so we'll just ring to use it they
have done that in the past but the same
time is such a meaning listen random
thing to claim is the biggest it's the
biggest until the seven ish devices
cover rape honestly it's like and as
somebody once again tweeted Samsung's
display Samsung's coverage of the
display range display platypuses like
2.8 3.1 3.3 3.7 3.94 cetera cetera I
mean if you notice and if you follow
that there's a giant gap between 5.5 and
seven point 0 so I'm tired I'm tired do
it man but the sad thing is you'll
probably so again because people are
people and we don't understand them
it'll sell like gangbusters man did to
use a term from the 1920s because I
don't know better what to use and anyway
we won't get it because we just don't
get it then we took a good but there's
so many dissidents I show about size the
last thing I just want to mention is I
do want to cast doubt on the idea of a
4.7 inch 1080p display on the HTC m7
because nobody has done 1080p at 4.7
inches that's the densest we would have
had mmm but it known as shown a sample
not to my knowledge hmm nivin there's
playmakers I'm challenging your notion
on the googles right now all right what
why do that we can switch it up and did
you talk about rim yeah so the speaking
speaking of leaks um you know obviously
Rams got its big event next week we
talked about this a little bit last week
and more stuff continues to flood the
internet with what the device looks like
what the operating system looks like and
things like that we just saw this past
week we saw
Verizon's promo page that leaked that
was talking about the z10 over the z10
that's what I would like to say and it
shows in white so looks like verizon
will be carrying it in white and we also
had a whole rash of screenshots leaked
earlier this week that go through the
whole setup of a new device and with
various settings menus on blackberry 10
so it's out there if you want to know
what it's like what are you thoughts in
and then look into the screenshots they
look very blackberry to me I the
screenshots really don't get me that
excited for a couple of reasons one
there they they're very much they look
like blackberry to me they don't really
look they don't have that that polish
and that design aesthetic and sharpness
that I see like even with Android 4.2
and certainly with iOS and with Windows
Phone which is always been kind of like
a bummer for me for for blackberry but
the other problem with the screenshots
is there just like a whole bunch of
settings screen shots and they're not
loaded with data or with information so
it's really hard to get a feel of what
it'll be like using the thing in
day-to-day use so I don't want to be too
judgmental based on those screenshots
okay Chris how's your search going I
cannot find any 4.7 inch 1080p panels
that have been shown at dude this is my
this is my realm is yellow in last town
well yeah well just plays I mean it is a
true though isn't it like this plays are
basically the one speck that remains
that matters and device to nothing's
like if you're going to get one thing
right get your display right first get
the dimensions right get the technology
right and then go from there yeah I feel
like we're kind of at the point now
where it's hard to screw up a display
because there are so many like really
good technologies out there for making
them gapless and you know for not having
like a really crappy like pentile
appearance that they kind of have all
their bases covered
oh yeah that wasn't necessarily the case
a year ago but we're at the point now
where like there's just no excuse and
and that's something that dan I think
you've probably had the most experience
for some reason with the razr maxx HD
yeah and and yet would you would you say
that that they've kind of gotten the
display thing figured out now save for
the maxx HD sure I can't look at that
display it just hurts my eyes really
it's just that the max hd's display is
so oversaturated it's like you're on a
mushroom trip every time that you look
at it it drives me nuts and it's it's
it's like over sharp like you know when
someone went into Photoshop with an
image and they just like way over did
the sharpness and it just hurts your
eyes to look at yeah that's exactly how
I feel about the razr maxx HD display
and and the razr m display to an even
greater extent funny enough as soon as
Chris said pencil the only thing that
pops in my mind was motorola I just
there's a pentile yeah that I was going
to say the funniest thing about that is
that pentile is literally a samsung
trademark like they own that trademark
and the technology behind it so it's
funny that Motorola's is the first thing
that pops in your mind well sometimes I
got something Association someone on
twitter is telling me that this NEC meet
me deus ex has a 4.7 inch 1080p display
NEC medias s x that's not Xavier so
somebody suites in the same thing at me
as well and that it's 10 0 7 d's is for
at ntt docomo or I Kevin Lowe that's now
that's old that's one like a year ago if
it's for it it's 4.3 inches 4.3 I don't
know sure that would have been 4.4 in
720 so yeah this has to be 712 oh you
know what I think I saw oh maybe not hmm
I may have seen this phone at seatac
when I was there well in case that this
actually drugs back to back Barry
because yeah there was really intruder
hilarious moment
that happen wood rim when those in hinds
noted that the company is willing to
consider selling on his hardware unit
and just becoming a software services
company and then it stopped price shut
up I mean that's that's how bad room is
doing that you see you say you're
considering selling off and you stop
right shoots up because people don't
trust you to manage your resources and
what you have properly yeah but I think
that's kind of always true it's it's
pretty common for a company to say that
it's exploring song off a unit and oh
yeah yeah goes up and and to be fair I
think it's like a universal you know
it's like it's a truism in in the entire
technology industry that software and
services are much more profitable than
hardware is which is why I be is except
for Apple Apple is like the one one
thing that proves that rule yeah that's
true um yeah but then Apple make stuff
like this and start you want to rub on
your face and so I see that side of this
sorry for that for this no.7 DIC I
mentioned in the text of 1920 x 1080 but
I think that might be video recording
anyway you just see the numbers in the
most of a bunch of Japanese aren't you
Chris yeah yeah yeah exactly oh no but
like to me it's it's a perfect score
mood room because it's a double whammy
of no confidence so room itself is
saying we're not confident that we can
continue operating the company that were
operating even though that's what we're
building up to and january thirtieth
hardware/software selling devices so as
soon as we launch this massive new
revolution which everything is big bet
on we're gonna start looking into
selling it all off because we know
confidence that will make
bility out of it so that's number one
and in the market itself says you know
we agree with you guys and we think if
you set everything up and split it up it
will be better than if you just keep
running it so it's like number two with
the no-confidence so basically the
market is doing the home Michael Dell
things they give the money back to
shadow to sleep yeah and the question is
who would be with all due respect who
would be dumb enough to pick up rims
hardware business and agree to shoulder
the cost of designing uh hopefully you
know revenue generating / profitable new
phones running black a completely
unproven platform in blackberry 10 I
just I I have no idea who unless it was
like it's just a complete fire sale III
don't understand who would pick that up
and why Amazon Facebook just for the
hardware designers I guess but if you
look at this and I'm already talking
about you Gus TRO designers because
we're hasn't done an industrial design
for I don't know yeah Kate z10 is not an
impressive piece of industrial design
but yeah you know this is the thing this
is the expertise that we keep talking
about with nokia motorola you know the
internal stuff the antenna engineering
the stuff under the hood that can be
valuable and the staff that room has can
be valuable somebody like Amazon try to
get a cell phone that's true yeah I can
see that I could see that only what you
would it would really have to be like
one of those amazon today's special
value discount sales you know thank you
by this hard way you did with it makes
our gold gold box sell rims hardware
unit basically yeah ten pieces please
yeah i mean i don't know what what what
hasn't uh uh Hines said that RIM might
sell I mean it's just yeah I mean it's
been the company line for the past year
like no options are off the table is
basically been his message so and I
think those cufflinks guys really nice
my wife got into for me last year their
silver you know so was coming back to
style
and I'm not saying that we won't sell
these yeah yeah I can't imagine that I
can't imagine this being the way that
RIM separates its its hardware and
software divisions I could possibly see
a cell or licensing of the software to
other manufacturers assuming that it's
able to prove itself on the market but
oh yeah I think room will be desperate
to license it to somebody some of you
signs up for a room would be like what
you want this stuff okay done they have
no interest in being exclusive on the
software they want to spread out as much
as again I just don't think that they
will i still think is really really
believe me as far as i was concerned
yeah well as far as we talk about apps
all the time with rim and indeed is
written 33 reports on rims getting apps
but it seems like every week ram
announces that they've got more and more
apps ready to go and more and more apps
are being ported to blackberry 10 so
they're looking it's looking like they
will hit their goal of 70,000 available
by launch whether there will be 70,000
apps you want that's another story right
that's that's the million-dollar or in
rims case the billion-dollar question
yeah so I'm sure we'll be talking about
rim a whole heck of a lot more next week
and probably the week after that once
their event hits mm-hmm uh what else do
you guys want to talk about today we've
got a little bit of exciting financial
news as I say very sarcastically Oh
Chris um this is up your alley about ATT
finally is letting face time on the
iphone 4s uh what do you do yeah this
this really comes down to is a
continuation of the efforts of public
interest groups like public knowledge
and free press to work with aging team
have CC to kind of like push back on
this notion that it's okay to just uh
you know fly in the face of the tenants
of net neutrality and to be fair that
the
the FCC's rules around net neutrality
I'm on wireless are practically
non-existent they're very very weak
compared to the rules that they're
trying to put there in court right now
they're tied up in court but the there
is an active effort on the part of the
FCC to impose some pretty reasonable
rules across the board on landline but
they are much weaker on mobile but i
think that 18t recognized privately that
this was a battle not worth fighting
considering our nightmare that it was
becoming for that because it was a very
arbitrary decision and and this all
being said even though you can do
facetime on the 4s now over cellular I
don't know if I'd want to HSPA still
stucks in many areas although although
for the first time ever last week I was
at o'hare at at a very very busy time
the airport was completely jam-packed
and LTE 18 tlte was slower than 18 th s
PA so I think that bike by quite a bit i
was on my speed test as only getting
about point O five megabits down on LTE
and about point five half a megabyte
down on a chessboard a yeah so via the
tide is turning in some markets at some
times of day I think and that's going to
create an interesting dynamic over the
course of the next year or two as more
people ditch their HSPA devices for LTE
but but yeah i mean the the practical
implication of this facetime move is
Pratt is virtually no but from a PR
perspective and the aggressiveness to
which they are being pursued by these
public interest groups it was I think
that it was the right move for them to
make I just want to say this entire ATT
and facetime Fiasco has been so
fragmented I've lost track of it a long
long time all I'm saying is our head
like I'm just giving you the across the
bomb perspective Oliver seen this
lines about agency allows facetime atg
doesn't allow facetime ATT is back ATT
change this one again now is the for
rest now is this something else I've
lost track I just completely lost track
and I think Chris nailed it in saying
it's really arbitrary and annoyingly and
knowing so yes annoyingly arbitrary and
I think when when the announcement came
that initially that they were going to
allow it on the iphone 5 but not on the
iphone 4s I just kept screaming in our
chat this is so arbitrary this is so
arbitrary and it is right because it
wasn't limited to LTE at that vine it
was strictly a model decision which made
nice because the iphone 5 could use it
on hspa+ if you were not on an LTE
network but the I / 4s cannot which
means absolutely no sense so right let
me also monopolize whatever that to the
podcast with some european news and
segue into the idea that ATT is looking
into expanding to Europe you can have it
which is very excited about american
telephone and telegraph being in Europe
flied to set does that make you happy uh
dude I think that the first saw can you
target is a UK right that's the it looks
like UK's everything everywhere and
possibly a Dutch carrier company so
everything everywhere is pretty big at
the UK right like they are t-mobile and
orange right so yes well I mean
everything everywhere the moment are
really trying to work out some sort of
cochin strategy toward becoming one
brand in one operation and killing off
the orange and t-mobile brands and
closing up the stores which they've been
doing etc in the thing with them and
I've seen the CEO as a beautiful
beautiful beautiful name name I think
it's Olaf Swantee or something like that
and that they got my memories and what
it used to be and
he I'll say I've seen him do a couple of
speeches a couple of presentations and
he looks like a straight man to be
honest with you guys and maybe that just
been reading too much into it I feel
like EE has a lot of money deeply
invested into being the first 4g
provider and beating everybody to the
punch and the company is trying as hard
as it can to get as many customers as it
can during this advanced period so that
he can stay afloat basically so Lucas
survived which is the essentially the
Sprint story of two thousand when did
the was a 2010 when the first wimax
phone launched in the US yeah yeah
another that's very good analogy
actually yeah the only thing is that
sprint survived screwing up so yeah
thanks thanks to softbank coming in and
scooping them up as yeah it does how so
maybe AT&amp;amp;T will be a ease softbank think
about that no because something isn't
evil blue stone now that now be just
another but yeah I mean what I'm trying
to illustrate is that it's a
make-or-break situation for EE they're
trying really hard and they might not
have the financial resources that you
might imagine with the big promotional
push that I do right now they might just
kind of be putting all the chips in now
and say we do grow big now or we fail
which creates the vulnerability for a
takeover by somebody like ATT so that's
this potential that I just see like zero
potential for consumer benefit fate
since he comes into the UK market
nothing particularly good is really
going to much but I don't think well
they could do it very silently just like
vodafone's presence via verizon wireless
is very silent that you know there's no
aspect of Vodafone that that comes
through in the way verizon presents
itself and yet Chris promoter is a
British company 80s American
Vodafone being understated natt not is
kind of to be expected yes but Vodafone
is correct me if i'm wrong i think that
by total subscriber account account they
are the second largest wireless carrier
in the world so yeah so in you know in
terms of you know the quote unquote evil
empire it's hard to dispute that that
vodafone is is up in that in that group
not to say i think any of these
companies are evil i just think they're
aggressively capitalist which is evil uh
but but it is mel garion like like this
an Associated political doctor bulgaria
like we spent some time not being
enslaved by somebody in order to have a
doctorate come on oh god this
conversation getting weird but i just do
just bring it back to e this week
they're introducing a couple of new
price plans so now there's a thirty one
pound per month entry-level price paid
for the LTE service but it's kind of
daft if you sign up for that because you
need to sign up for two years sim
wrongly so you don't get a phone with it
you sign up for two years you pay 31
pounds per month and you get 500
megabytes of data so it's like you get
really fast data if you're the right
area you have the right connection and
you get half a gig of it really fast
data for a very short amount exactly
yeah 500 megabytes is is criminally low
for LTE rights you know 500 megabytes is
like like when we go to Barcelona for
mwc and I have to buy prepaid SIM card
like and we're there for a week and I'm
like I don't know 500 megabytes enough I
always end up buying like a gig if I can
yeah whenever I'm in another country for
a week or whatever because I i I'm
afraid that just my using maps and email
and whatever is going to use up 500
voids yeah yeah if I gotta remember eyes
you just enough to get for you to a
defeat and
prove the gifs that Chris posts
premature when is when if i last posted
a Jeff on Twitter I don't know if I ever
have it's been a long time I think
identities happen more often I reject
your criticism of my Twitter account
this it was a flagrant accusation and I
withdraw it thank you with my apologies
thank you ah but yes also 2 p's the
power users they're also doing a 46
pound per month 20 gigabytes plan
weights so big yeah so you go from 31
pounds per month for 500 megabytes 246
pounds four months for 20 gigabytes
which is 40 times email right but that's
what they've done did they just
introduce more extreme version so now
they have the cheapest option and now
they have the most massive option they
still have price plans in between but
it's only a 15 pound difference between
the cheapest and the most expensive plan
yeah okay so just to give you a
comparison with ATT so 18 TS mobile
share plan I think that their lowest
cost ah a plan is ninety dollars for two
gigabytes and then that gets shared with
how whatever lines you add to it and
then it goes up to like two hundred and
eighty dollars or something for ten
gigabytes it's really good but there's
somebody coming around to your house
giving you a massage every weekend right
uh they're massaging your wallet that
was really really freaking good actually

five on that message on the wall on that
note I think on wallet massages we can
