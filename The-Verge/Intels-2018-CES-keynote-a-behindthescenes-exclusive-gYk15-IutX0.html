happen
let's say you're in town you make laptop
chips and server chips and they're good
but people don't really care about that
stuff that much anymore so what do you
do well you hold a giant keynote at the
biggest Electronic Show of the year to
tell a new story but let's say a week or
so before your giant crazy keynote
there's a huge massive security flaw in
every computer chip made in the past 20
years that could slow your stuff down by
as much as 30 percent well then what do
you do if your Intel you do this before
we start I want to take a moment to
thank the industry for coming together
for another purpose to address the
recent security research findings
reported as meltdown and Spectre the
best thing you can do to make sure your
data remains safe is to apply any
updates from your operating system
vendor and system manufacturer as soon
as they become available well that was
awkward but it was necessary Intel needs
to be honest about spectre and meltdown
but it also wants to tell that other
news story and when you're at CES the
only way to tell a story is with a
gigantic crazy light-up spectacle intel
decided to let me go run around
backstage at a rehearsal to see how that
spectacle gets made so we did that all
right so it's a couple days before CES
actually kicks off and we're here at the
park theater at the Monte Carlo in Las
Vegas going backstage to look at Intel's
keynote they're rehearsing right now
we're watching lots of crazy stuff
happen with data lines flying from a
piano to a RV our guitar players and
we're expecting a lot more so let's go
see what happens backstage at a CES
Keenan
so I am on the stage this is surreal
I've never given a keynote before later
on we're gonna see a giant helicopter
drone thing called the valo copter
takeoff
right here on stage there's gonna be a
car self-driving car that comes out and
man I don't even know until it's really
really motivated to convince you that
they should be part of your story of the
all the data in the universe and they
want to also remind you that you know
the chips are good and even though they
had to slow them down because of that
security thing they can do cool stuffs
that is the CEO of Intel Brian krzanich
we were originally going to interview
him about Intel's announcements right
after this rehearsal but then meltdown
happened and he decided that he needed
to cancel the interview but he did give
us this photo bomb so I guess that's
nice I wonder if he knew what I was
talking about when he jumped on camera
now Spectre is everybody's problem not
just Intel's
intel has a bigger problem you don't buy
anything from them you buy from Apple
and Amazon and Microsoft and sure
there's often Intel chips inside that
stuff but you don't care and why should
you they're not right there right in
front of you anyway there's so much more
that they showed us at their stage so
let's get back to that CES is when Intel
can get in front of you it creates this
massive production this gigantic show to
convince you to care to get you to feel
as connected to Intel as you do to your
phone that's why Intel's keynote starts
with sports it's directly involved in
the thing that you actually care about
Intel has these camera systems that are
pointing at football fields and with
them it knows where the players are like
characters in a video game so you can
see the game from the perspective of the
quarterback it converts everything that
these camera sees into these things
called voxels now imagine a Rubik's Cube
each of those cubes is a point in space
now imagine a rubik's cube that covers
an entire football stadium then imagine
you can see and
crack every single one of those cubes
intel is doing the same thing for the
Winter Olympics it's gonna let them
create VR experiences from the games
Intel's also getting into understanding
other kinds of spaces like roads so it
partnered with Ford to make better
self-driving cars all right so now we're
gonna go look at the Ford Fusion
self-driving car what's interesting
about this car is it's actually part of
a fleet they are rolling up on a hundred
or something of these things and they
actually intend to have them on the road
they say their level four yeah we wrote
in the car right there on the keynote
stage Intel's also trying to understand
where things are in the air it's helping
make the valo copter possible which is
this gigantic helicopter drone thing
that both companies hope will someday
become a self-driving vehicle like a
Jetsons cover we got to check out the
vallah copter up close and see it fly
during the keynote behind a giant glass
wall right there in the room
oh look at this
so this is the shooting star mini it is
it looks you know it weighs like next to
nothing you've probably seen a lot of
these you know little home drones that
you can get that just fly all over
creation like this this is much more
stable I think you know they had the
little light show going
there's obviously income chips in here
to power it
it seems yeah it seems like a good
little wrong until has tiny new drones
that can safely fly around indoors now
you can't go buy one but you can't go
buy a hundred and turn them into a
choreographed dancing star field it
doesn't look like much on the screen
that you're looking at right now but in
real life
seeing those tiny points of light moving
in a cyclone right above your head is
kind of amazing all the stuff happening
on stage is just bonkers crazy the floor
is a giant screen pillars and balls of
light descend and ascend from the sky
the weird of wild graphics on the screen
they ride the line of a dystopian future
hellscape but they don't quite cross it
there's acrobats wearing completely
crazy LED suits and helmets jumping
around on trampolines the spectacle of
it all the sound and the fury the
planning and above all all of the money
it's all designed to convince you that
Intel isn't just a boring PC chip
company did it work yeah the problem
here is Intel isn't actually trying to
tell one story it's trying to tell half
a dozen one of those stories is about
data
did you hear it's the new oil sure
they're also telling stories about
quantum computing and neuromorphic chips
and whoever else Intel is kind of famous
for making product demos that never go
anywhere the problem is Intel wants to
be everything to everybody which is
impossible so it often feels like Intel
ends up being kind of nothing to nobody
this year Intel's actually showing you
stuff you're going to be able to
experience which is refreshing the real
story here is that Intel can turn real
objects in space into data on your
computer
other companies know about pixels on a
screen but Intel is on a path
know about real 3d space but that story
it got a little lost in all the
spectacle and again getting lost in the
spectacle is the oldest CES story of all
