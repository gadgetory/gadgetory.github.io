we're looking at Apple's OS 10 10.8
mountain lion the first version of OS
tend to really integrate a lot of iOS
features
oh it's 10.7 lion integrated a few of
these features but mountain lion really
takes it farther the first feature that
really jumps out is coming from iOS is a
Notification Center which you can bring
up in a couple ways you can click the
icon in the top right of the screen or
if you have a trackpad you can swipe
from the right using two fingers
once you open Notification Center you
can see that notifications pop up from a
variety of apps that support it like
mail reminders you can also send tweets
right from the top of Notification
Center and when Facebook integration is
added in a few months you'll be able to
update facebook status as well there are
only a few options for notifications
just like iOS you can set a banner or an
alert that needs to be dismissed but you
can't set where their place they always
show up in the top right of the screen
overall Notification Center is a great
addition to OS 10 and it's something
that every operating system should
really have but if you're a power user
you're definitely going to be looking
for a little bit more also news about
Lion is iMessage which comes with an
entirely new app called messages my
messages is integrated with iCloud and I
messages show up across your iPhone your
iPad and now Mountain Lion but don't
worry messages still supports AOL
Instant Messenger Google Talk and jabber
just like I try used to apples also
brought some popular iOS apps right to
mat line reminders is reminders it looks
exactly like reminders on iOS and notes
is notes they've added in some folder
support and it'll sync across all your
devices but it still looks kind of silly
and it has probably the ugliest default
font ever shipped on any app for any
system Safari has also been updated in
Mountain Lion it's way faster it has a
new scrolling engine and a lot of new
tweaks that make it seem like pretty
much the fastest browser you can use it
also has a nice new unified address bar
much like the chrome omnibox you can
search right within it it has a cool new
loading indicator it has a nifty new tab
view that lets you see all of your open
tabs a lot of these features are
basically already in chrome but it's a
really nice to see them in Safari and in
Mountain Lion one of the best features
Apple's brought to Mountain Lion from
iOS is the share button tons of apps
have share buttons in them pretty much
anything you can quick look you can
share and you can just pick a service
like Facebook or Twitter and share
content directly to it you can even
right-click an image in the finder and
share it
to Twitter it's really simple and it
works really well but unfortunately the
selection of services is limited to what
Apple provides there's no YouTube for
example probably my favorite feature in
that line is airplay mirroring which
lets you send your display to an Apple
TV it up to 1080p resolution it works
perfectly it's pretty much completely
automatic the only drawback is it only
sends Tyria audio but that's fine for
watching web video you can also just set
the system audio output to any airplay
device which is great for listening to
music other third-party apps that offer
these features cost twenty-five dollars
so at 20 bucks upgrading the mountain
lion just for airplay isn't actually a
bad idea Apple is also brought to tation
a mountain lion it works pretty much
exactly as it does in iOS you hit
function twice to turn it on and then
you just talk normally and it does a
pretty good job of transcribing what you
say please kill all humans
it sends everything up to Apple's
servers so it requires a network
connection and doesn't work offline but
when it does work it works pretty well
one of the wildest features about line
is something called power nap which lets
the new Retina Display MacBook Pro and
the newest MacBook Air actually update
themselves while they're asleep though
backups a time machine they'll sync your
photo stream they'll download new mail
they'll download new software updates
they'll do basically a whole bunch of
stuff that you'd like them to do all
their asleep while they're actually
asleep that's just the surface of
outline there's all kinds of other new
features game centers been added to OS
10 there's a new feature called gate
keeper which is a security system that
keeps third-party applications from
running in your system unless the
developer registers with Apple and
there's api's galore that's just
scratching the surface mountain lion
there are over 200 new features in the
operating system OS 10 mountain lion is
available now from the Mac App Store for
just 20 bucks it's a lot faster and
smoother than Lion it has a few must
have features like airplay mirroring and
if your Mac user it's definitely worth
upgrading</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
