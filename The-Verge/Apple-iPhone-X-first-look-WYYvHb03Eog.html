here with the iPhone 10 which is
absolutely beautiful I'm just gonna say
it straight out this is the white
version it's got a glass back here it's
got a five-point eight inch OLED display
you can see the notch at the top there's
no home button so you swipe up to close
an app when you're in an app and swipe
up and hold to go to the app switcher
you can just bang between apps there
because we're swiping up from the bottom
to the control center you now swipe down
from the right side for control center
you swipe down from the left side for
the notifications try it is I mean I
just can't say enough there's a super
beautiful phone it's got a stainless
steel band it's got 12 megapixel dual
cameras on the back
they're both stabilized now this one is
F 1.8 the telephotos 2.4 and on the
front you've got a depth tracking system
the front that enables base because
there's no more touch ID on the phone
you look at the phone it protects 30,000
infrared dots on your face the iPhone 10
also has new camera modes F&amp;amp;A actually
has these camera modes - the most
important is called portrait lighting so
this poor gentleman from Apple you can
see them a slide over it's a stage light
and we'll shoot him it's going to
process and you see I'll show you the
photo it's blacked out the entire
background that's available on both the
ten and the eight these are new portrait
lighting effects in the iPhone tank
iPhone 10 it has no home button it's got
face ID it's not set up for my face this
gentleman from Apple it's set up for his
face you can see the slips at the phone
and automatically Imams so he's going to
look at the phone keep your eyes closed
so look at the phone it's still locked
now if he opens his eyes it's going to
unlock that is pretty cool that space
idea the other new thing is for Apple
pay the side button is a lot bigger here
so to use Apple pay you just double
click it it'll open it I'm gonna pointed
at this gentleman space cuz that's his
face and now you just wave it at the
reader for Apple pay I got to say this
unlock stuff is really cool but also
I've got this phone but by just pointing
to this gentleman's face I can unlock it
so obviously some security things to
work through there for apples because if
someone grabs your phone and they just
point at you you might want to keep your
eyes closed all the time
the front camera also can do portrait
mode now because of that depth tracking
system and they've set up a really cool
demo of snapchat doing really cool new
filters and snapchat
there's my face that's one of the new
filters you can see it looks way cooler
than regular snapchat filters the iPhone
10 starts at $1,000 for the 64 gigabyte
version there's a 256 gigabyte versions
more expensive Apple actually didn't
announce the price onstage got a look at
the web for that it is just an
absolutely gorgeous phone it's going to
come out in November there's also the
iPhone 8 which is a little bit cheaper
that's coming out a lot sooner so that
is a very very quick look at the iPhone
tank
