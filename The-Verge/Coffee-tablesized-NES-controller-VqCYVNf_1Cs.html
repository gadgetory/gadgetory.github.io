we're here with the retro bit mega table
at e3 2017 this is effectively a coffee
table shaped nest controller so it's you
know a normal coffee table but it also
has volumes built right in so you can
play all sorts of classic NES games it's
got a d-pad over here you got to start
and select button in the middle and you
have your AV X&amp;amp;Y blends over here on the
right it effectively plugs into a an
emulator box via USB it also plugs into
PC or Mac or you can plug it into your
original NES console as you have one of
those from there it just plays regular
games just like any of any other
controller the company that's making it
retro biz many I'm selling it via
Kickstarter they want to get a campaign
going in the next 1 to 2 months when
they're hoping to ship it in October for
five hundred dollars so we've seen some
things like this before some retro
controllers from old-school throwbacks
like it's a game developers conference
in San Francisco but never before have I
seen a coffee table sized NES controller
it is really fun to use even if it is
kind of clunky and weird and like you're
not going to be very good at the games
you're playing but that's it it's still
a really really interesting and
well-designed device so far I've been
playing this game vanishing racer it's
actually a game from Japan has never
been released in the US before they have
it on emulation here and it's pretty
pretty difficult to play with this
controller but once you get the hang of
you're able to jump over cars and you
know basically it's great for kind of
very simple controls where you only need
to move left or right or jump within a
button if you're into a retro video game
gear this is definitely something that
you might want to look into that's it
it's not a great game controller it
might be way better as a really awesome
looking coffee table for more e3 news
