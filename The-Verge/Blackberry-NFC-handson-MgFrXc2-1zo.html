we're here in the rim booth at CES 2012
and i'm with a new jawar who's the
product manager for blackberry 7.1 and
they introduced a new feature blackberry
7.1 called blackberry tag which takes
advantage of the NFC chips in the newer
blackberry devices and when he's honored
is just going to give us a little demo
right now yeah so a blackberry tag makes
it really easy to share content between
two blackberrys that are inter seeing
able so essentially any Content job on
the phone which is pictures or music or
files you can top two things together
and share those between the two phones I
have two blackberry bolds and on the
right I'm going into doc documents to go
you're going to open up a document if
you want to share this spreadsheet with
your friend you simply put the two
phones back to back fill pauses to let
you know that the NFC handshake
completed and then they create a
temporary Bluetooth connection and share
the file over Bluetooth and you can see
on the Left it's open up the file so the
nice thing is that there's no menus that
you have to go into simply have to be
looking at the content to share it so
I'll show you another example I'll go
into pictures let's say I want to send
over you know a bunch of pictures from
the weekend want to send three pictures
over to children with my buddy I put the
two phones back to back
he quickly buzz
so into the pairing request
so on the first on the first chair you
have to you have to accept
but it'll send over by bluetooth each of
the files that's a bit challenging here
on the showroom floor because we have so
many Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices that
sometimes the requests are it's a lot of
noise so they're bit slow but you get
the idea about how it makes sharing
really easy and the last thing that you
can do with NFC is actually add a BBM
contract that's right so what we've done
is we've introduced into maybe I'm a
barcode scanner that's an element of fun
so you can go invite to BBM and if you
scroll down you'll see a new option
that's called blackberry tag and when
you click on this you'll be able to
invite two friends over by putting the
phones back to die
so the phone on the Left I've gotten a
request to accept so blackberry tag
enable applications are all throughout
the device in OS 71 we've tried to put
them in places that will actually make
some of your task easier to do and as we
go forward we'll make more and more
applications blackberry tag enabled and
we've also opened up a whole bunch of
third-party API so you know the app
developers out there that want to add
and I see peer-to-peer functionality in
there they can do that and create their
own experiences with blackberry tag</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
