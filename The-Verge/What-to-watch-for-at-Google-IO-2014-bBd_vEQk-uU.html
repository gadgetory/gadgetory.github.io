on Wednesday it's the biggest nerd party
of the year but here's what the rest of
us should expect right now when you
think of Android you think of it on a
phone or maybe on a tablet or if you're
really crazy you think it on your face
this year Google is hoping you're going
to think of it in a whole lot of other
places the first place is on your wrist
Android wear has already been announced
but at i/o we should be seeing a lot
more of it the beautiful round Moto 360
and the utilitarian square LG G watch
should be taking center stage and we're
hoping to find out when they'll be
released and see how Android works as
aware Samsung and HTC have said they're
on board too and who knows they could
surprise us with new hardware but beyond
the wrist there's also cars Google
already has a partnership with Audi GM
Honda and more but hopefully we'll learn
what all that means this week one hint
something called google auto link which
apparently will let you control your
android phone from your dashboard or
steering wheel next up your TV Google's
had a really tough time getting the
living room right Google TV and the
Nexus key or notable failures but it had
a win with a chromecast and next up is
Android TV we're expecting an entirely
new interface that simpler cleaner and a
whole lot more like regular Roku's or
Apple TVs it's less ambitious than what
Google has tried before but for TV
simpler is better but what about those
phones and tablets it might be time for
Google to release an entirely new
version of Android all the rumors out
there right now are pretty difficult to
stitch together but it's a good bet that
we should be seeing a big visual refresh
and maybe finally we'll see Android and
Chrome OS get closer there's also a good
chance we'll see a new Nexus tablet or
two this week what else it's tough to
say we've seen rumors of a
touch-friendly version of Chrome OS and
that chromebook pixel is really overdue
for a refresh google plus seems to be
less of a focus than it was before
especially since senior vice president
vic gundotra left the company that
doesn't mean we won't see something from
the social network keep an eye out for
photos there's also that nest
acquisition to think about will expand
beyond smart thermostats and smoke
detectors oh one last thing don't count
out weird google this is a company
that's researching self-driving cars
internet providing balloons modular
phones artificial intelligence and even
ways to cheat death itself CEO Larry
Page once wished he could set up a
special part of the planet for
completely unregulated experimentation
and co-founder Sergey Brin once
orchestrated a live skydiving event
of a keynote basically anything can and
will happen at Google i/o and will be
there live to report it all</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
