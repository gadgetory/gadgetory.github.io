and i'm here at microsoft's bill 2012
conference while it may have been
raining a week Mike supposed to be
trying to excite the crowds around
Windows Phone and Windows the
opportunity to transform the kinds of
devices we build the kinds of
applications that we create has never
been better than it is today I've been
at Microsoft since 98 I moved to phone
back when it was Windows Mobile in 2004
you know 2007 happen 2007 was a sea
change for the industry obviously we
know what happened then with the iphone
shipping and you know we we were not
necessarily where we wanted to be at
that point fast forward to march 2010
when we released the first version of
Windows Phone you know a very different
product one where we tried to focus
first and foremost on the end-user
experience what you're seeing now this
has been an effort a concerted effort at
least as old as Windows Phone 7 to try
to move to one single underlying shared
core operating system and that's that's
the result of that is finally now
Windows Phone 8 users who buy windows 8
are going to have their best phone
companion experience by far on Windows
Phone 8 we share the same name we share
a lot of the same kind of applications
we also share the same name for the
storm I see is two efforts going on in
parallel one we want to build a share
code if people build new apps and invest
in Windows and Windows Phone we also
want to reduce their costs as they're
targeting iOS and Android cuz they're
going to target all of them and so we
make it very easy especially with native
code so you as you build a game or you
the gaming engine you can do all the
platforms including us on the same day
if you reduce the cost of coming to the
platform you reduce the time and then
especially if you get middleware Havok's
a middleware company we write middleware
technology which runs cross platform
from our perspective it was pretty
straightforward to get our technology
across for someone just getting into
development I would think Windows Phone
would be the easiest there's not a lot
to to really live
learn on the back end you can come in
with an idea and you can make something
quite good quite fast we won't been able
develop it so they can write out you
know as soon as possible we released the
sdk these really studios available now
they have you know the devices they need
to test and write those apps I've been
on an awful lot of platforms and iOS is
really the one to be on for making apps
at the moment hopefully with the changes
in Windows Phone 8 that there will be a
lot more potential to create great apps
people went that when they go in and buy
iphone aren't thinking about it feature
X they're thinking about cost and
familiarity as people see the surface
and as people see the windows it which
will be at their work and their new
laptops and the devices that they
normally have I think that people talk
about the helo effect that can happen
when people suddenly look at a windows
phone and it feels familiar up to now
Microsoft has had the quality in the OS
but they haven't had that the user base
to make it worthwhile for developers so
unless a developer is in love with the
platform itself they weren't really
going to invest time and money in making
a Windows Phone app we didn't have an
experience with iOS and Android and we
came from a kind of silverlight WPF
background so I'm the transition to
Windows Phone when it came out it was
very natural for us and we also found
that you know iOS and Android that are
already so saturated and so Windows
Phone was this new thing that it could
it could be quite an opportunity to kind
of make a name for ourselves in a very
small market developers need to make
money on our platform either by ads or
by selling their applications or they
own a service and they want to hit
customers so in some cases really by
just getting more eyeballs and with
Windows and Windows Phone combines our
ecosystem combines we believe we're
creating this very very broad market
where people are going to be your
customers are going to be on our
platforms and you'll get customers by
supporting our platform so I met it's
all about gat return you know on the
investment
we've had multiple developers that earn
five even six figures a month on the
windows for storm we've had some
developers that you know barely make
enough to you know buy a candy bar we're
a team of ten ten people doing windows
apps we don't do I a spindle downer we
don't build websites we just build
windows 8 and windows phone apps at the
moment our primary goal is exposure and
so we don't actually it's free our apps
are currently free on the marketplace
and the ecosystem isn't quite big enough
yet for us to be able to monetize we
have 46 out of the top 50 apps that are
available on Android and iPhone today
now that list is going to change in six
months some of the apps are really
popular out or may not be as popular
this is not a journey that ends I think
you're going to see games coming out on
Windows Phone possibly even before you
see them coming out on iOS and Android
the reason being that when you build a
game to run on a PC you're building it
with directx in mind so it's going to be
very fast to get again running on
Windows Phone everything that we've seen
so far speaks to a really strong
conviction into the platform and from
phone to surface to desktop we're on the
same train tracks now and so that means
that that we're going to hook our train
together and get to be one train they
used to always say Microsoft gets it on
the third iteration and and so if you
think about Windows Phone this is our
third iteration and I feel like we
actually have a product now that's no
compromises I think this is Microsoft's
first reboot and first in a long time to
placed where their their unifying
everything across the company I think
for the first time they're they're
realizing they have to play in a
slightly different space than they've
been working in so far and they're
they're learning a lot from apple and
they're building something that is
really nice but it's not derivative
which is also a nice change
