World Congress today we are in Valley a
new gallup smartphone with the powerful
software and services to manage every
facet or we are connected like a
smartphone that includes the news
Martin's app to provide a unified and
easy way to control all your smart
things devices a smart phone the lecture
images and videos across your smart TV
and family hub refrigerator and a
smartphone with Samsung health to help
you live a better healthier life we are
adding on advanced optic sensor to track
how hard your heart is working and we
are partnering with the University of
California San Francisco School of
Medicine for the first research program
to use this sensor to measure blood
pressure as Samsung we believe is time
for a new kind of fun not just a great
smartphone that takes good pictures
a breakthrough camera that sees the
world clearly in a new light
build around an amazing smartphone I'm
thrilled
Don Vale the first smartphone built for
the way you use your phone today and the
only smartphone with the power to help
you we imagine how you will experience
the world tomorrow and s9 +
when we release the infinity display
most people had never seen anything like
it it's groundbreaking design offered
more screen in less space and quickly
set a new industry standard with the s9
we've built on this foundation taking
the same immersive and to end display
and refining it even further we've
created a design so sleek and unified
you can hardly tell where the screen
ends and as always you know there's no
not the galaxy s 9 comes in four
stunning colors now once you have your
badge out make sure you take your phone
out - I know we usually ask you to put
phones down but this time bring it out
and open the unpacked app on your phone
there's a little button in the corner
says AR click that now scan your badge
facing you there with your phone and as
you do that what's gonna happen is your
badge is gonna transform into the galaxy
s 9 right there in your hands now in
case you haven't figured it out yet you
can flip over your badge and now you can
look at the back of the phone now when
you do this this is when you need to
check out all the colors so at the
bottom you can select colors pick your
favorite one of course you've got to
check out the lilac purple so from front
to back and outside in this device is
designed for the visual and social
generation and to create the s 9 we
completely reimagine the camera and
built an amazing phone around it to
create the ultimate tool for
communication and self-expression at
samsung we've always been committed to
leading the industry with our camera
technology the galaxy s 9 has a dual
aperture smartphone camera that's
actually designed to work like the human
eye it's bright outside camera will
automatically use a smaller aperture and
when it gets dark the camera switches
over to a wider aperture in fact the
widest ever included in a smartphone
with the S 9 we
integrated a dram memory chip directly
into the camera as part of our new
SuperSpeed dual pixel image sensor our
DRAM memory chip powers the s nines all
new super slow-mo experience with super
slow-mo
you can record videos at an incredible
960 frames per second video on the left
it's normal slo-mo the one on the right
is super slow-mo on the galaxy s 9
camera so you can set your slo-mo video
as your lock screen to give your
infinity display a unique personal touch
yes time plus comes with both a
wide-angle lens and the telephoto lens
and it has optical image stabilization
in both lenses so you can take clear
focus shots with live focus the s9 plus
lets you take beautiful portraits by
adjusting the blur of the background to
make the subject really stand out you
can use all these incredible new camera
features no matter where life takes you
because of course the s9 is protected
from the elements with water and dust
resistance dual aperture for amazing
shots day and night a new super speed
image processor for epic super slow-mo
videos and the powerful dual camera on
the s9 plus you can use ideo front or
back camera to map your unique facial
features and expressions and create
emojis that actually look like you
it's amazing right the really cool thing
is with a are emoji is that it's super
simple and easy to create them and
personalize them go to AR emoji create
my emoji and now use the front-facing
camera to take a photo it's actually as
simple as taking a selfie to remove my
glasses so it gets a clearer view of my
face
there we go now it's taking my image and
creating my AR emoji and there it is
nice all right all right wait wait it's
a bit generous with the hair so all we
do is open up the camera go to AR emoji
create my emoji and now use the
front-facing camera to take a photo it's
actually as simple as taking a selfie to
remove my glasses so it gets a clearer
view of my face there we go
now it's taking my image creating my AR
emoji and there it is last year we
introduced Bixby our artificial
intelligence platform that helps you do
more with your phone let's say you want
to translate a foreign language now
Bixby uses AR to show you search results
in real time just hold up your camera
and Bixby will automatically detect the
language and translate it for you live
so first open up the camera then I
choose Bixby then you select text search
no wonder what buckle out or no could be
you hold it up and big people translate
it for me live baked cod sounds good
your camera can identify what food is on
your plate and log the nutritional
information directly into Samsung house
so you don't have to end ages I didn't
it manually thanks for our partnerships
with leading cosmetics brands Sephora
covergirl and amore Pacific Bixby lets
you try on makeup virtually ds9 will
also be compatible with google air core
the s9 at five point eight inch and the
s9 + at six point two inch and they look
great too the s9 features speakers on
both ends of the device they're the
loudest ever in a galaxy phone Dolby
Atmos takes advantage of yes mine's new
stereo speakers to move sound all around
you in three dimensions so you can fully
lose yourself in the film you're
watching the s9 is powered by one of the
most advanced chipsets on the market
we're constantly improving the entire
multitasking experience when you get a
notification you can just drag it down
and open it in a new window right on top
of the current one so you can respond to
a message without interrupting the video
you're watching our home screen now
supports horror
on to orientation so when you're
switching between apps you don't have to
keep flipping your phone around today
