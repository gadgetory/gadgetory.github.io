the author of this most tender music
may he continue to hold as close as we
fill the world with our sound in unity
affection and love one people under
guard mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall
for the first time the GOP really wanted
to make this a convention without walls
Tampa is a relatively small city I guess
but we were kind of joking I think
there's some truth to it though that we
were kind of joking around that maybe
Tampa was chosen because people like the
fringe is less likely to travel to tampa
or be around tampa to cause disrupting
events so i mean maybe that was it was
it was said in jest but i think there's
some truth to it like it just it doesn't
seem like there's going to be that much
disrupted disruption in a city like
tampa in the summer when it's like this
when we're all you know melting outside
so basically I was trying to be an actor
in Hollywood and failing miserably could
not love no longer lie to myself when I
looked in the mirror and my pizza
delivery outfit that I was an actor and
I up and quit I taught myself web design
and video editing over the course of a
couple years
and then when 911 happened I decided I
had to do something more beneficial to
society with myself with my newly found
skills
when I was a young reporter covering car
crashes and house fires I learned from a
good assignment editor you got to get
out of the car and there's a lot of
reporters who sit in the car and they
let the photographer get out of the car
take the pictures and jump back in and
they don't really they'll call and get
the fax from the from the police station
later and I think you always miss the
story I wouldn't say that I was one of
those progressives that thought say
Republicans are evil aliens or something
and they're terrible people but it's
it's interesting to talk to these people
that I do still disagree with quite a
bit but we do have things in common one
thing that I found surprising was that
there seems to be more support for gay
rights among individual conservatives
and Republicans than I thought I think
that the Obamacare is bad for gay people
this is this is the biggest event ever
hosted by a gay organization at a
republic
you know not that size matters but ours
is the biggest the official RNC line is
it's all one big happy family marching
toward victory November that is not true
I think too often people do get into
silos and believe and echo chambers and
that's destructive because then they
start believing their own BS and it's
just sort of like a fish tank you need
to clean it once in a while otherwise
you're going to suffocate everybody in
the business is struggling with how to
deal with the internet and how to use
the internet effectively and I think the
biggest problem that everyone is having
is figuring out how to transform
yourself into an internet savvy company
which is very very difficult because the
you know the sort of bureaucratic
structures of those companies and there
are these notions of how you do that so
what we've got here on this screen is
five different web cams pulled up in
five different windows
each being screen captured and sent to
this program we got three other
actually for other streamers out in the
field and those streams get remixed and
sent to our mobile broadcast news live
stream channel
my purpose has been at times to protect
and serve
and it has been at times to be a
critical eye of social justice movements
so been a critical eye of status quo how
do you intend to execute this plan
because there's a lot of brilliant plans
and romance but without execution it
doesn't help hello on paper get people
signed up
I believe in the freedom and opportunity
and the principles of our Constitution
that have led us to become the greatest
nation in the history of the earth I
believe in America it's really hard to
be authentic when you have a team of 30
trying to speak for you and that's
what's happening with with any of these
campaigns you have a team speaking for
you how authentic is that so you know
the sort of random things drinking
tweets on the screen which don't really
see him to provide much con you know
added content to the viewer at all right
but that's sort of the compromise that
they've gotten so far I've gotten to so
far within their company and you know
they're involving but it's very slow
