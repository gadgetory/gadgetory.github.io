miller and this is the most boring 90
seconds on the verge intro yet twitter
today made some big design changes
across the board the service has taken a
page from facebook and added large-ish
header photos the new pics are visible
both on the web and across Twitter's iOS
and Android apps speaking of twitter has
overhauled its ipad app gone are the
ones innovative sliding panels in lieu
of something more static is basically an
oversized iphone app the cofounders of
massively successful game developer
Bioware have stepped down the doctors
ray muzyka and Greg Zeschuk announced
their retirement today from the company
they started in 1995 destination unknown
Bioware general manager Ehren Flynn paid
tribute to the two on the website and
revealed plans for more full games set
in the Mass Effect and Dragon Age
universes as well as something entirely

programs from 20 different channels
collected over the past three years
users can search captions to find the
choices lines with accompanying video

uttered 59 times that's it for today's
top stories and with that we have now
done 90 minutes of 90 seconds on the
verge that makes us feature-length
thanks for watching tune in tomorrow as
we begin production on the sequel
