in the Applied Sciences lab here what
are you guys working on imagine a day
where you know in your home one wall is
dedicated to being your magic wall well
where it can teleport you to another
world without really going anywhere you
can have a conversation as richly as
interactively as I am having with you
but at the same time we have this
digital augmentation that's happening
between us so the window of the North
Star
it's the vision it's the long-term thing
that we want to create because it's it's
you know it's the holodeck right in
something right you want to create the
holiday season sometimes this is the
holiday that's great in order to send
this light eq chai we develop a very
unique lens it's a flat lens and we put
it behind an LCD we replace the
backlight or the LCD with a flat lens
and we're able to shoot light out into
specific locations in space this is now
this which is again a solid piece of
plastic we have LEDs on the side light
travels throughout and we're able to
shoot that light it's like this is gonna
be like you're gonna say just I want you
to test this to see that it's solid and
then you're gonna have an assistant come
out here yeah no no no no sawing allowed
here okay uh and so so here we have an
array of LEDs if I want to send light
out here I can just turn this on right
this LEDs mapped all the way out here if
I want to send light here I just turned
that light off and everything I thought
if I put an LCD on top of this and I
know where your head is I'm able to know
what light to turn on and thereby I can
send an image to a specific location in
space and therefore to each eye so this
is the world's only a flat stereoscopic
3d display that's steerable have a seat
okay this might be hard to take a shoot
of oh yeah Jesus there are two strips of
light right there on the left and right
eye corresponding to each intimate I'm
going to think try to think it the best
way to describe what I'm seeing it is a
teapot floating in the middle of a brick
room and there are two biplanes flying
around the teapot and they're all kind
of spinning around in 3d
I'm seeing it in 3d in the sense that it
physically has depth to my eyes and as I
move my head in and out or left-to-right
the scene pivots or zooms appropriately
as if if I were walking into this room
and getting closer to the teapot or
getting further away from the teapot and
everything is kind of moving in a chord
I don't think there's any way this can
be captured on camera it is very weird
that I have to say no wait a second is
the teapot reflecting the room
no reflecting you yes it's reflecting
what it's seen me it's reflecting what
it would be reflecting in the center
this room yes it's very this is very odd
we didn't even know this was possible a
year ago now because we can send an
image to each eye and each eye sees
basically its own unique image we can
certainly send it an image to each
person you see a teapot I see a skull
your image is a lot more pleasant than
mine we are in fact finding where you
are in space and then shooting a cone of
light to each to each face and you can
you can do that so Steve if you move
your your set your head side to side you
can see that those LEDs are in fact
following you are they are - yes ensign
using the sensor that's lighting up the
bits that would make sense to display
base I believe and what that means if
you fool around you can't see anything
right it's like your own private view
yeah this would be great for porn yeah
it exactly right multiplayer halo
yes we're building a 55 inch version of
this how many years are we away from the
from the magic women you know that's
hard that's hard for me to me a number
I actually had to get I wish I could you
know five years I want you to make that
assessment by the time I'm done here
okay what's next if you want the
illusion of looking through a window or
a frame you have this function of that
the view is changing as a function of
your head parallel lights the parallax
like this right in fact you can see that
that image changing as I move my head
left and right if it was a standard
normal display this would only work for
one person which is why we need to
create a display that is multi-view
right now you need to display that can
see your hands in front of it you can't
just put a camera up on top and have it
look down because that's just too close
to the display I want to be able to
touch the display and even transmit
the image of my finger to the other side
as you saw in that video you had the two
children almost you know meeting like
this and that that brings a very kind of
intimate you know real contact is this
you know you and I are standing like
this and you know and you know I want
her you know like doing that like that
yeah right and right high five that was
cool okay pretty cool - and you know you
can't do that you cannot do that through
any type of technology that we know
nothing that the high five is actually
suffered because of digital technology
what do you think magical or do we pay
high fives are saying high five they're
emailing people photos of other people
high five yeah what can we do to get a
real high five going here alright so we
take the same light guy technology and
run it in reverse so right there we had
LED shining into it and projecting light
out in the space yeah now we're going to
put a camera here as is like your I was
looking down through here which is the
camera and we're going to look through
the display okay and there's my hands it
is an image of my hands through a
display while the display is doing its
business oh this is picking up the
displays taking it up yeah all right let
me try this let me see
yeah another thing yeah you can so your
the game we wrote to show you that you
know we can you can you don't have to
touch everything you know you have to
touch a display to have interact with it
this is the hover game and it's not
about touching it's about manipulating
this car come back next year I'll even
show you some cooler stuff will just
show to me now can't let's not wait why
postpone why put off or tomorrow because
then you will come back next year
let's move it one more level okay here
even further out sticky notes sticky
notes digital sticky notes sticky notes
are one of the hallmarks when you know
something is truly digital you see it if
there's a sticky note on it digitally
you're looking at something digital not
an analog clock things that need
approval analog okay this will have the
unique capability of not just seeing
infrared light but also visible as well
to show you that we can eventually get
to that that vision of two people
touching each other and giving each
other high-fives no there's no tracking
out here all through the display and
that's what the display is able to see
now I want to take this post-it note I'm
going to put her here and I'm going to
let go this is something that we saw in
the new surface right yes but
not quite like this because that look at
that that is right well that's the
actual that's an actual image that's
actually not of a color reproduction
above this but the new surface is able
to kind of transcribe from from that
sort of stuff so I've shown all the
pieces all you know in its own kind of
componentized concept right the idea
then ultimately to put them all together
to create you know a more ultimate
experience well this is incredible this
is awesome thank you so much for showing
this off and which part are you selling
me the whole package we have to do a
deal both we get your kind of oh really
discount okay cool I'll meet you in the
alley
we should high-five right that's so good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
