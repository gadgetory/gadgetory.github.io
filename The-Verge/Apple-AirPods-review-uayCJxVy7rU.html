connect to your phone over Bluetooth and
let you do things like listen to music
make them take phone calls or even talk
to Siri and it's basically as if Apple
just took the old ear pods and chopped
the wires off which means they look a
little bit weird when you're wearing
them Apple says it's stuck with this
design because it gave them more space
for a bigger battery and it also gets
the microphones a little bit closer to
your mouth but the weird design almost
doesn't even matter if air pods don't
stay in your ears and we need to talk
about that for a second because I had a
lot of trouble keeping air pods in my
ears and it's not just that they fall
out immediately it's that they never
really stay in my ears they'd slide out
to the edge of my ear and then basically
sit there and so anytime I'd stand up
for my desk or move around that's when
they'd fall out apples really playing a
numbers game here with air pods they're
essentially saying that X amount of
people aren't going to be able to keep
them in their ears and they're just
hoping that that number is a small
enough amount that it really won't
affect the way people look at this
product and that's a shame because
there's a lot that I actually really
liked about air pods for one Apple solve
some of the biggest problems with truly
wireless earbuds in the first place
thanks to the w1 chip that they built
into these it basically not only helps
optimize the connection to your phone so
that doesn't cut out all the time it
also makes pairing these really easy
that's one of the biggest headaches with
Bluetooth products no matter what they
are basically once you pop open the case
the first time you open up air pods
your phone recognizes them connects them
for you and then you almost never need
to pair them again they just always
connect every time you take them out of
the case you're someone who owns a lot
of Apple devices this is the kind of
product that's going to play really
really well with all of them the nice
thing about that is that if you don't
like air pods
apples building the w1 chip into some
other products namely Beats headphones
so that functionality is going to spread
to other things in the future now if
you're an Android user you should know
that these work really well on Android 2
you're not going to get that same magic
instant pairing that the W 1 chip is
really good and it offers a stronger
more robust Bluetooth connection than
basically any other wireless headset on
the market the case is another thing
that I really love about ear pods it
might look like a pack of dental floss
but there's a lot of really smart design
in here and if there's anything
learned when testing out other wireless
earbuds it's that they're only as good
as the case they come with and not only
does it give you a place to store them
it also charges them there's an extra
day's worth of battery inside the case
alone it goes on top of the five hours
of battery in the air pods it'll even
charge them fast it charges three hours
of battery into the air pods in just 15
minutes there's also some really smart
stuff going on inside ear pods
themselves that help set them apart from
ear pods one is that there's
accelerometers so that you can tap to
interact with things like Siri another
is that there are sensors on the inside
of the earbuds so that when you take
them out of your ear it'll stop the
music you are listening to and when you
put them back in it'll resume it that
brings us to the most important thing
about air pods and I can't even believe
I'm saying this but they actually sound
pretty good
they reproduce music really clearly
there's a lot of low frequency sound
which means bass and drums actually
sound good and all of this is really
uncommon for really small earbuds these
even sound a little bit better than ear
pods I test out a lot of wireless
earbuds and battery life is usually a
struggle but it's something I almost
never worried about when I was using air
pods and that's a huge deal it's not
just because of the case to these really
do give you the 5 hours of battery life
that Apple's advertising which is really
more than enough for most situations air
pods cost 160 bucks which is not cheap
but that price is competitive when you
compare these to other truly wireless
earbuds all of that is great but it
doesn't matter if ear pods don't stay in
your ears apples not wrong when they say
Wireless is the future I'm just not
convinced that a one-size-fits-all
approach is what's going to get us there
