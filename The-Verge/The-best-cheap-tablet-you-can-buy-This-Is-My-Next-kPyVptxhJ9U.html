your laptop if you want to do that buy
an iPad or a surface or a galaxy note
but be prepared to pay handsomely for
them you buy a cheap tablet because it's
great for watching Netflix or for
reading on the subway you maybe buy it
for your kid who's really not ready to
handle anything that costs $500
whatever the reason there are a few
things you want to pay attention to like
you want really great battery life you
want all the apps and games you need you
want solid construction as close to
totally unbreakable as possible and most
of all you want a good screen without a
good screen nothing else about a tablet
really matters a few years ago you
actually couldn't get all of that and
still spend less than $200 but now you
can and a surprising number of places
I'm actually really shocked at how many
good cheap tablets there are but one
definitely stands out the assumed mo pad
7 is definitely the best cheap tablet
you can buy the memo pad 7 is near the
top of the price limit here but it's
still cheap enough for almost anybody
but it doesn't feel cheap at all it has
this thin nicely textured body that
asu's modeled after a clutch bag it has
sharply rounded corners like a Lumia
phone and it both looks and feels a lot
more expensive than it is it has a brand
new Intel processor which is
surprisingly fast along with front and
rear cameras that are at least as good
as you'll get for this price although
that's not very good but the key here is
the screen the memo pad 7 has a 7 inch
1920 by 1200 display that is just leaps
and bounds better than almost any other
device in this price range it has great
viewing angles and it's plenty bright
oddly those are both really hard to come
by on a cheap tablet it's also just
really sharp clean and crisp and easy to
look at for a long time without feeling
like you're watching a movie through a
screen door or a dirty window adding the
loud stereo speakers and the memo pad 7
is a pretty great movie watching machine
it's not perfect of course it has these
huge black bezels around the screen and
a soos bundles some really ugly and
unnecessary customizations to Android
but the key thing about the memo pad 7
is that it's the only cheap tablet that
doesn't feel like you've got what you
paid for
I should actually also mention the Nexus
7 here Google's tablet which is also
made by a soos has the same screen
resolution and a slightly softer body
that I like quite a bit but it has an
outdated processor at this point and
it's actually kind of hard to find the
Nexus 7 is great but at this point the
memo pad 7 is probably going to last you
longer the only other one really worth
looking at purely because it's the only
other one with a screen this good is
Amazon's HDX 7 this is a pure
consumption device make no mistake
Amazon's app library is still also very
small but there are a few fun games and
a really solid selection of things to
watch and read if you're trying to go
even cheaper the one you should buy is
the Fire HD 7 you'll get a lower res
screen and the thicker and more
plasticky body but you still get access
to Amazon's huge library of movies music
and TV ships the HD 6 is even cheaper
but it's only 6 inches it's basically a
cell phone the rest of the cheap tablet
landscape is full of models that are all
essentially the same thing the assist
memo pad 8 has an 8 inch screen and is
cheaper than the memo pad 7 but it's not
as well made it's lower res and it's not
as fast Samsung's Galaxy Tab 4 7.0
Lenovo's android-based a8 EVGA z' Tegra
note all have bad screens and cheap
bodies they all I should mention perform
pretty well one thing you really don't
need to worry about anymore is
performance at least for the basics
dime-a-dozen processors can definitely
keep up now be really really wary of the
absolute cheapest tablets you can find
but not because they won't work well
it's often just because they can't run
all the right apps or because they have
such bad screens that you won't even
want to use them but the best thing
about cheap tablets is that they don't
have to be bad I'm actually surprised at
how good they can be but if you want the
best one though the one that no one will
ever guess cost you less than $200 buy
the Asus memo pad 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
