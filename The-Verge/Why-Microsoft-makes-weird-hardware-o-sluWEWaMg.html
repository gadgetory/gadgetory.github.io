hardware it makes the Xbox and it makes
weird computers in fact making computers
differently is kind of the whole point
but eventually Microsoft needs to make
other stuff now before we get there
though you wanted to see how Microsoft
makes hardware to see if there are hints
about what's coming next so we came here
to Microsoft's design lab and their
machine shop to look at everything that
they do to make hardware we've talked to
engineers and designers to figure out
what Microsoft's philosophy is for
creating products the occasion for our
visit was the design story behind the
Microsoft Surface book - weirdly enough
a lot of the design stories of these
labs ends up boiling down to hinges yes
hinges those little bend points are the
things that distinguish Microsoft's
hardware from everybody else's they make
these computers the Transformers that
keep Windows relevant when everything
else is basically a phone now so Ralph
green the head of industrial design at
Microsoft
spends a lot of time on hinges what you
see here it's it's a neat table because
it kind of is a great snapshot of how we
work ideas travel through these three
states from primitive you know you come
up with an idea you glue a kickstand on
a tablet in the car that's it let's go
you think you're almost done and then
when you go further you figure out how
hard it is to make it right surface book
we detach it it is in the end seamless
you go into like what we call clipboard
morons
you know if you ever get close to
product development process you will
find out that the bunch of ideas most of
the ideas don't end up being the final
product and and and understanding why
not and moving on to the next idea is is
essential in order to make progress
hanging out at Microsoft's lab I got the
real sense that the company has a pretty
set system down now here's the obvious
question why do they even need that
system in the first place well Microsoft
wants to sell you stuff but it also has
to make hardware to keep improving its
software Microsoft can't make Windows
better unless it understands how it
works on actual machines basically if
Microsoft doesn't push the envelope on
Windows Hardware nobody else will here's
how a Panos Panay the head of Microsoft
Surface division puts it you think about
Windows and how
thinking about writing to the steel how
we drive ourselves to increase
performance push battery life I think
that's what matters because it pushes
our innovation story forward but it
helps our customer do anything they want
and that's that's where we kind of put
our energy and I think that's where we
start seeing the fruits of it all
because people are creating such
magnificent things off these devices we
have customers that are gonna be able to
move in and out of their mixed reality
world move in and out of OneNote with a
pen and then when they sit back down
jump into office jump into machine
learning jump into Visual Studio like
push yourself where you want to push it
I think understanding where the customer
is going to take it's important did you
hear what he just said
Microsoft has to understand where the
customer is going to take it and we all
know where the customers already are
they're taking everything on their
phones now Android is the most used
operating system on the planet and the
best apps usually come to the iPhone
first the folks at Microsoft aren't
really willing to talk about making
phones again not yet but they are
thinking a lot about where computing is
going we think about how computing
evolves right and it evolves with
someone like such as setting us into a
direction and so there's the you know
the the aspects of being mobile where
where you want to do you want to make
you want to be in your profession where
and you choose where that is you don't
want to go to your computer your
computer should be with you and device
is connected across your assets not
living on one thing that's spinning but
your assets living in the cloud
accessible to where you know wherever
you go being able to participate your
assets or your colleagues right your
conversations and so this whole world of
moving from things in a box to providing
things that I around you in a very
digital seamless way that's that I think
that's what we what gets us inspired for
these it's it's not about making you
know pretty shells it's about connecting
people right and so that's something
who knows okay now yeah that is really
all Microsoft can say about phones right
now but there are rumors that something
new is coming sure they might make a
phone again in hell it might even run
Android but there's also rumors that
Microsoft might be working on something
completely new and I'm not talking about
the hololens I'm talking about a dual
screen tablet that's similar to that
courier concept that got killed off a
few years ago can they do it well the
hardware division certainly can
Microsoft has already shown that it can
make Windows work on a gaming console
and on all sorts of different computer
shapes but they couldn't make it work on
phones whatever Microsoft does next it's
really gotta be something totally
weirdly new the company has learned how
to make computers in all sorts of
different shapes but if Microsoft really
has a courier sitting somewhere inside
its hardware labs I know for a fact that
a lot is going to hinge on its hinges
