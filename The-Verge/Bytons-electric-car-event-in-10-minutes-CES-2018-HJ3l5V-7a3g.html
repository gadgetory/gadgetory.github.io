- Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Welcome to the CES Las
Vegas, welcome to Byton.
(audience cheering)
- (laughing) Thank you, thank you.
So hello everyone.
Very much welcome to Byton and thank you
for coming to join us today
for our world premier.
Now, this is a very
emotional moment for you,
because I'm going to tell
you a bit about our baby,
our first product, our first Byton.
We believe that this vehicle
will be a new design item
with high-tech details to
express our digital leadership.
This is a key priority of us.
We have to create new design semantics,
which replaces horsepower
with digital power.
You can see that traditional
automotive elements
have nearly disappeared to make way
for state-of-the-art symbols
of the new generation driving technology.
For example, rear
cameras, rear-view cameras
are replacing the side mirrors,
and the landmark facial recognition camera
integrated to the B-pillar of the car
is for user authentication.
The progressive design is continued
with the exterior lighting concept.
Driving lights and then
something very new,
what we call smart surfaces,
which are styling flourishes
with connecting lines and
support cutting-edge technology.
Because it will let, you
car will interact with you.
Your Byton will greet
you when you approach it.
Your Byton will signal to
you important information,
such for example what
is my charging status.
For all of you who love to know details
as much as I do, let's just
go through the dimensions.
The dimensions of the car
are four meters 85 in length,
one meter 94 in width, and
one meter 65 in height.
While in American measurements
it's 191 by 76 by 65 inches.
The wheel base is two
meters 75, or 116 inches.
You can believe me this a
perfect proportions for a car.
It's really perfect proportions.
Once you have taken your seat,
you will feel as if you are
in a luxurious living room.
Individually adjustable
front and back seats.
Then you have two side
ports under your arm rests
of the front seats.
You can store items like
tablets or E-readers
and it's all within very easy reach.
While those inward rotating front seats
are designed to stimulate communication.
We are the first bringing
this rotating front seats
into serious productions.
Many companies talk about it,
but we are the first make this happen.
The car features the world's first
coast-to-coast shared experience display.
It's a complicated word,
so we use an abbreviations
saying it's an SED.
The dimension of the screen
is one meter 25 by 25 cm,
or 49 by 10 inches.
Also here, we are the first bringing this
into serious production.
There will be no other car out
in 2019 having this technology.
Safety, of course, is
our underlying principle.
We have added side viewer camera mirrors
and placed them of the direct
field vision of the driver.
All systems of the car intensively tested
against driver distraction.
For example, if the exterior
lighting conditions change,
your Byton will adjust to
your needs automatically.
If face recognition which
ensures that your car
recognize you and adapts to your needs
to your configuration.
This personalization will reduce the forms
of input you need to control the vehicle.
Then the touch for the driver tablet
which is widely adopted touch screen
to offer convenience
directly at your fingertips
in front of you.
Voice control, which is
voice control brought
to the very next level with
the advanced integration
of Amazon Alexa.
I can really promise you in your Byton,
Alexa will be smarter than ever.
- [Alexa] I noticed your
next charging location
will be at the Byton house at CES.
To save your time, do
you want me to reschedule
your Whole Foods package
delivery to that location?
- Great idea.
Yes, please reschedule the
delivery to the Byton house.
Thanks, Alexa.
- In addition to touch and voice,
we are introducing intuitive
gesture control system
that will enhance your digital
experience in your Byton.
Everyone can operate it.
As you can see, there
are only five gestures
to control the system and
they all come very natural.
No menu ad required.
As I said, I promise you that
the Byton is as intuitive
and easy to operate as
any other smart device.
It's crucial for us that the Byton offers
the very best high speed connectivity
because it's very important to be smart.
We have an array of flat
antennas which is ideally
integrated into the roof line.
You see, there's no shark fin on this car.
No shark fin that
traditional cars would need
more than four shark fins
to achieve the same level
of connectivity this car will have.
It has the intelligence to see
what is happening in the car
and to respond to potential threats.
This intelligence grows over time.
It's amazing.
It grows over time because
it uses machine learning
capabilities to analyze vehicle data,
environmental conditions,
to diagnose and protect
the vehicle against both
failures and threats.
Our first Byton is designed for the age
of autonomous driving and shared mobility.
Therefore, it provides
full Level 3 capabilities
from launch and will go to
Level 3 or 4 ready from 2020 on.
We will not only update the
car through advance software
but also prepare the
vehicle's architecture
to handle upgrades of sensors,
cameras, and other elements
needed for advanced levels
of autonomous driving.
Finally another blocking
point is removed as well.
Your Byton will recharge in no time,
giving you and extra 150
miles in just 20 minutes.
In just 30 minutes, 80% of
your battery is recharged.
Our first Byton will be
the most advanced vehicle
in the market as of 2019.
The good news is that your
Byton will be affordable.
Based on a starting price which will be
just around 45,000 U.S. dollar.
- Your Byton is a smart
device that recognizes you
and it will improve your
experience the more it knows you.
Through artificial
intelligence, it will learn
your preferences and habits
leading to exceptional,
personalized experience.
To really further
enhance the communication
between the passengers, we
created a meeting atmosphere
in the car just rotating seats
which really creates a
very, very exceptional
kind of experience.
Another very essential feature
was really super important
for us was to achieve a very
intuitive navigation system.
As you can see, you can
input your destination
via the driver tablet at your fingertips.
Without even removing your
hands from the steering wheel.
In combination with smart suggestions,
based on your personal
profile your navigation
experience will be improved significantly
from what we currently know today.
Another very important topic is health.
We can see this topic, health
and fitness is becoming
ever more important and we
can see this especially here
at the CES 2018.
We swim, we hike, we workout,
and your Byton will be
the first vehicle that also
functions like a variable,
helping you to keep track
of all your vital signs.
With a heart rate,
weight, oxygen saturation,
or blood pressure.
Based on these insides,
your Byton will give
you meaningful advice.
It's important to us to
recognize what our users
would like to do with the time they gain
through advanced levels
of autonomous driving.
One important element, of
course, is entertainment
such as movies.
While for the driver this
is currently only available
while the car's stationary,
never-the-less highlights
what is in store for us
at the age of autonomous driving.
Today's obviously a very
significant day for Byton,
but we also believe it's
a hugely significant day
for the future of cars, in
particular for smart mobility.
- We do believe that
we are at the beginning
of something special
during a period in history
and we are radically transforming
the very concept of driving.
You will be happy to hear that
we already have a schedule
for the launch of our first Byton
and it looks like this.
- Yes, our production plant is located
the same place as our
global headquarter, Nanjing.
It's already under construction.
We are preparing for our global launch
starting in late 2019.
