on this show we bring you the best in
consumer electronics past present future
this week in a stunning twist we're
talking about the samsung galaxy s4 it's
probably the biggest phone launched by
any a company other than Apple ever and
I've spent a week with the phone now and
here's how I feel about it Samsung's
basically synonymous with Android now
people don't ask for android phones
anymore they ask for galaxies or the
galaxy phone now Samsung's out with its
latest galaxy phone the galaxy s4 and
this time instead of trying to take the
Android crown it's just trying to keep
it the galaxy s4 is almost exactly the
same size of the gs3 it's a tiny bit
thinner and lighter despite having a
larger screen in a bigger battery which
is impressive but the untrained eye it's
still pretty much exactly the same
device and next to HTC's gorgeous one
that's a bad thing the gs4 just doesn't
feel like a high-end smartphone device
it's still made of slimy slippery white
plastic with silver edges that just
don't feel good to hold the device is
ergonomic and does fit nicely in your
hand but it's just unpleasant as if your
hands are always dirty and sweaty as you
hold it lots of people didn't mind that
on the gs3 and it's not any worse here
but I wish Samsung had stepped up its
game in response to HTC's gorgeous
design from a pure hardware standpoint
there's really no contest between the
gs4 and the one or even a phone like the
iPhone 5 or the Xperia Z but in most
other ways samsung's new phone holds up
it starts with the screen a 5-inch 1080p
display that's absolutely gorgeous it's
a super AMOLED panel which means it has
slightly over exaggerated colors in
contrast but it's so dense and so bright
that it just looks great the camera 2 is
a big step forward this is the best
camera i've ever used on an android
phone period it's 13 megapixels it's
sharp and it's accurate with great color
reproduction and just fantastic photos
but where the camera really gets wild is
in its software features there are just
so many things you can do with the GS
force camera you can erase photo bombers
create gifts take panoramas and a whole
lot more easily and right within the
camera app itself it's not as good as a
dedicated camera especially in low light
but it's as good as any smartphone
camera I've used from a sheer things
this phone can do perspective no other
smartphone even comes close to the gs4
in addition to all the standard galaxy s
and note features there's some new stuff
here too air gestures lets you wave your
hand over your phone to scroll through
pictures or down a webpage which is neat
but the real use I found for it was
waving over the phone to answer it or
waving to change between songs wire
listening to music air view is the same
feature we've seen on note devices
before letting you hover over a calendar
date or an email to see a preview of its
contents without having to tap in but it
now works with your finger those two
things don't really change how you use
the phone in general and they do get in
the way sometimes they're nice to have
around when you want them but they're
really not game changers there are a
bunch of eye tracking features as well
most of which don't work all that well
smart scroll is supposed to track your
eyes up and down a web page and move
things as you go but it doesn't work all
that well smart pause pause this video
when you look away from the screen but
even when that does work it's sort of
obnoxious smart stay figures out when
you're looking at the screen and keeps
it on while you read or watch a movie
and it does work but you mostly don't
notice it that feature was on the note
as well and you also get the multi
window feature from some of the note
devices which is pretty happy I could
pretty easily do without all of the way
as Samsung wants you to interact with
your phone but the new software and apps
that come with the gs4 are actually
pretty great there's an IR blaster plus
the watch on app which together control
your TV and cable box plus search
netflix and other apps to help you find
things to watch I like the apple lot and
I found myself using the gs4 is my
remote control more often than not
there's also s health which gives you
Fitbit like tracking four steps you take
calories you eat your mood and more it's
cool but it won't be really great until
it's accessories come out in a few
months there are many many many more
apps to most of which you probably won't
use much there's group play and story
album and so on and so forth but Samsung
really does add a lot to the Android
experience and even with everything it
can do the galaxy s4 offers great
performance and surprisingly solid
battery nearly everything is fast and
smooth though there are a couple of
awkward jitters that make it seem like
Samsung hasn't quite worked out its
software kinks yet you'll get a full
day's used from the battery without any
trouble and with a little bit of
babysitting I could get well into the
next day as well I'm happy to charge my
phone every night personally and as long
as I did that the gs4 never gave me any
trouble the galaxy s4 is a very good
phone it's fast it has a great camera it
has a gorgeous screen and it has some
really useful software features it has
too many software features and can be
overwhelming and confusing as a result
but the phone super customizable and can
eventually be suited to your
but even with all that I just can't get
over the fact that I don't like using
this phone it feels cheap and
unimpressive especially compared to HTC
One and don't forget the HTC One has
plenty of impressive features to the gs4
is a slightly more powerful device but
the one is more enjoyable more
impressive more refined they're both
great options on carries around the
world but personally I'd rather buy a
one than a GSP so now that the Jesus for
is out basically the phone market for
the next several months is set
everybody's launch phones in the last
few months and really until the iphone
there's probably not going to be that
much more coming so I brought in Nilay
Patel I managing at her hello sir I'm
here and basically all of the phones in
the world yeah and like so these are the
phones that people can buy right and so
unless you should excite these are many
you should buy that's the stuff for that
one except for this one yeah well so all
right let's start with you so what's
your phone right now what do you use so
I have three phones you says and here's
and this is speaks to the problem that's
a thing that normal key in my pocket
right now i have an iphone 5 okay i have
an HTC One which makes sense that's what
you need that's what you'd expect me two
hundred I don't want to kill us so I
have these two and then i have an HTC
first and of them bizarrely the first is
like my go-to what I want to like use a
phone I pull the h2 facebook phone I
pull that out of it so this happened to
like a bunch of people in our office and
it was everybody was sort of not that
into Facebook and that suddenly was like
ah I love this yeah like it's not
Facebook that's calling to me it's that
it's a it's a it's the right size
basically it has LTE which the nexus 4
doesn't and I run stock Android which is
a pretty great combination she just
turned off all the facebook job I have
the lock screen turned on it's actually
nice I don't mind like looking at
pictures from face it some prettier than
what would be on your lock screen yeah
and I and I actually don't like sense on
the one okay so I have the one cuz it's
a you know it's a great phone I think
it's probably the best flagship Android
phone you can get but i actually prefer
to use the mid-range first and I
recognize that I'm a weirdo because I
have three phones but this I think this
is currently my favorite from that i use
interesting suit why carry three then
cuz you're a crazy person says I'm a
crazy person because the first has a
terrible can't waits it's all trade-offs
the first
a terrible camera so i used the iphone
for its camera and then they both have
small screens so when I want to watch
stuff I use the lights no one else
should have this problem and fair enough
uh I mean but they do and like that's
sort of the problem with all of these
right is like there are a lot of things
I like about every single one of these
phones like this is the droid razr maxx
it has a battery that lasts four hundred
years and that's really great but it's
it's huge and ugly and has weird salt is
extremely I will say we have to Motorola
phones here we have the razr maxx and
the razor end mm-hmm and the razr maxx
you can make a really solid argument for
this phone because of its benches last
forever if you if that is your primary
consideration you should get this phone
but you should immediately put it in a
case and not tell anybody that you ready
to see this because it's tremendous
exactly yeah that the weird Kevlar thing
that then it stays shiny I don't know
why motorola does the shiny thing this
one is the razr m which is kind of the
same size as the first which is great
and until the first came out this was
probably only small phone to buy but
this color this particular pearlescent
white to me is it's like the color of
like middle-aged like elder middle-aged
women like if you were like a 60 year
old woman you wanted to buy a Cadillac
you'd probably buy it in this color does
that make any sense to you know that's
not my almost none I I mean I just this
is the old motorola like this mineral is
going away this is hopefully all this is
obsolete and and this is a design
language that thankfully boy put them in
last place fair you're gonna in google
now the veil Motorola's gonna reboot the
only one to buy here is that the max
because the battery right well and
that's I mean that the thing that's been
arresting me is seeing with Motorola
stuff is they've come out and said like
we're gonna make phones that are a good
size and durable which seems like the
most obvious two things in the world to
say about your phone but everybody
freaked out the clue yes finally uh and
yeah it's just sort of debris right but
so it's what's if they're rebooting
their build quality I think it's
interesting to see how companies like
HTC with the one right have gone really
really far ahead with build quality and
materials this is one of the few phones
that showed two people were there like
that's really hot yeah particular people
who are very happy with their iphones
right everyone just wants to touch it
and yeah hold it is really cool the UH
just feel like curve on the back and
everything's just gonna feels great I
wish the software is better
that's why I'm using the first lengthy
this I mean so the first term HTC and
the white one actually feels way
different than the the black one feels
way different than the white women have
really house yeah this is more rubbery
and Matt this one's very matte look
smooth and this one's very rubbery um
but this is basically in poor HTC they
just settled their loss of Apple they
basically built in android iphone yeah
and you hold this in your hand it feels
exactly like the first iphone and read
some combination of the first iphone in
the 3g all the buttons are laid out in
the same place the headphone jack home
doing um i remember when we first saw
the leak of this phone everybody was
like nah that's just a bad render of an
iphone oh no it's rica i mean this this
micro USB slot is really Jenky and bad i
think it's super funny that it's just
like yours there's there's slot but this
is basically and I think the reason they
could facebook wanted this phone is
because all of those people who are
using facebook on the iphone they're
gonna pick this up it's gonna be
interestingly familiar where is
immediately familiar as hardware and
then you get to your sucked into the
facebook university or if you're smart
you turn off and just you stopped a
weird thing to me is like it seems sort
of natural that people would want a
phone more this size right think this
just feels good and seems great but then
the best selling phones out there are
gigantic and like increasingly
gigantically up the note to this is this
is comically humongous this is like an
SNL prop yeah and yet tens of millions
of people bought this thing like that
doesn't make any sense to me I mean and
it bloops it literally it just it's like
raindrops I so listen I don't understand
what what they're doing or why they're
doing it in terms of their hardware so
this is all plastic that is made to look
like brushed metal right so it's like
the worst design trend of 2013 made to
look like the worst design trend of 1998
and Samsung has literally been doing it
that entire and this is just yeah and
this is just their game and it's working
and actually through the screen on this
one is like very very green cuz it's a
Super AMOLED panel um but if you want a
giant screen this is the name of the
game and people seem to want giant
screens yes I mean I have enormous hands
and I'm not super into the Strand screen
but it's here I don't know if anybody's
using the stylus I saw a woman the other
day I was at a conference and she had an
iphone
case and the case had a stylus on a
chain on it and I was like you should
just get a note to like let's just let's
just move away from whatever that
problem in situation chain wallet of the
13 um I mean this is like this is
optimized for giant screen I don't think
anybody is buying this for its pen
features right I think they're there and
they're crazy I'm but I and so that
brings up like the whole debate I had
with the gs4 this terrible feeling phone
uh was like do people care about design
right because it's like a I'm from on
one hand it's beautiful there's like a
great screen it has a great camera and
that's the thing that kills me about
like eighty percent of these phones
right is the camera just sucks like the
first camera is miserable yeah that's
off and GV sure the samsung cameras are
bad and motorola's cameras are bad and
they're just like this is a great camera
and you know that's awesome but I just I
hate holding and using this phone and
then I constantly would just like put it
down I would get an email and put it
down and pick up the one and answer my
email on the one but like am I crazy do
people like these sell like crazy do
people not care I mean I think that
these have been i think if you look at
the previous HTC found the one x um for
whatever reason also really
well-designed phone uh actually i mean i
think it was less eye catching and less
pleasing I think it was well it was just
well put together it felt solid yeah but
compared to something like this with
such an enormous 5-inch screen that
phone I don't think it seemed as like
high-end okay I think the one seems very
high-end in comparison yeah um compared
to the gs3 which I see everywhere I mean
the gs3 i think is do you bit quetta
sandra yeah it's the one phone that like
I see constantly people using honest I
way and then to people with it this
morning and there's like no difference
here I mean now side by side uh except
there's a system update ya know the
reason I I remember seeing two of these
this morning it's cuz I looked and I
like I wonder if they have Gia's fours
but I spent like 10 minutes and was like
nope it's just three yeah I mean this
has a bigger screen so with thinner
before but this phone to me is Samsung
has two tests to take a reboot of its
design the same way motor oil has to
write and i have to say our flagship
phones need to compete on hardware
design and polish with HTC with apple
with nokia um because these phones are
all really great in terms of their
hardware
yeah and how solid they feel and the gs4
to me literally just feels slighted and
then you turn it on and I think
everything Samsung does to Android is it
looks like a cartoon yeah it's really
overwhelming like just in terms of like
visual noise and amount of features that
you can screw with and just using this
phone to me is it's it's basically what
did you do to everything that I know
right like why did you come into my
house and move all the furniture well
that's the thing they were like Samson
comes in with all these different ways
of doing stuff and it's Adamas I was
pretty good with all the current ways I
did stuff like I don't need you to
scroll with my eyes down a web page
right have fingers for that right yeah
but I saw I think the question is the
GRE is so popular that that is Android
people right and so when they switched
to a nexus 4 and they use stock they're
like why did you come into my house to
move all the furniture and I think
that's one of Samsung's big strengths
right now is that they've created an
alternate Android experience people are
very familiar with yeah i mean like tens
of millions of people have TouchWiz and
right ladies love the Wiz thank you
maybe they do I mean a big poppa joe is
a controversial reading this stuff huh
it's a reference from the verge cast for
the watching or if you missed it she'll
go watch um I mean look I think this is
a solid phone everything about holding
it look so the gs3 is really rounded off
right it's mentally fit your hand and
made a big deal about how it's naturally
designed whether or not that's true is
up for debate right with this film they
just squared it off so you've got this
incredible collection of like shapes
yeah that are in your hand you've got
rounded parts you got squared off parts
you've got weird textures you've got
this plasticky looking metal that is
still plastic or metal coated in plastic
God knows whatever is going on here
everything about this phone is kind of
haphazard right and it's really powerful
and I was great processor and a great
screen you know everybody is raving
about the camera mm-hmm the cameras
really good the software is really
interesting I think it takes better
pictures than the one in a lot of places
I think it takes pictures of rival the
iphone um but I don't want it you have
to hold it in your hand to use the
camera right and that kind of like sets
it away from me right and I think that's
really the that's where Samsung in
motorola like they're in the same kind
of place right uh their fortunes are way
different I think Samsung saw a lot of
these phones
keeps all on gs3 sure but if they want
to move up to that next level they have
to have to rethink how they're actually
making hardware right well in that kind
of like makes me really excited almost
because we're we're finally in this
place where hardware sort of becomes the
differentiating factor again which is
interesting because it's like most of
these phones run the same software and
we've seen phones with really good
hardware like the Lumia 920 here which I
still love and I love this blue like
every time its enormous that is
enormities yeah it's it's large like
compared to all the other friends here
it is you said comically you could kill
a human with yeah like there's no
question it's a break um and so but it's
it's beautiful it has a great camera but
it's huge and it runs windows phone and
like that sucks fine but no no for that
but now I mean it whatever I'm wreck or
soft but now we have you know the same
sort of beautiful attention to design
with you one but running software that
people actually want and so now it's
like oh maybe we can have everything but
then this camera isn't great and that
camera is great and so we're still in
this like I put a weird trade-off eat
place but I feel like we're getting much
closer I think ultimately that the line
is you're gonna look if you want an
iphone your bottom right if you want a
Windows Phone you're gonna enough with
bulimia yep I think those are pretty
clear yeah i think the HTC windows
phones are i think that has a better
camera than HTC windows he doesn't I
think that's important consideration I'm
well that's kind of the whole game with
Windows Phone right yeah I mean it's
like the rest got its got any windows
phone so I think that's clear I think on
the Android side it's you're gonna end
up probably with a gs4 or one and I
think that most of the JS for review is
yours included i read basically land on
that you're gonna end if you're buying a
flash your android device these the ones
are gonna buy um and the question is do
you want the one that look who's
software he want overlaying android
right and who's bad heart like who's bad
hardware decisions or trade off because
you want to live with right do you want
to live with a great camera and like
kind of slimy feeling hardware and then
this like cartoon software right or do
you want um HTC software which i really
mean shauna so i dislike sentence or do
you want HTC software in a great piece
of hardware right and a camera that's
really good in low light right but then
kind of not as good
is good and it's you know it's a really
good camera so I land on the one and i
think that's that's why i have a one in
my pocket even if i end up using the
first all the time because that's that's
the Android hardware I think that right
now is just leading the pack far and
away and I think a lot of people are
gonna buy this phone and I think a lot
of the tech press and tech reviewers
actually like why yeah why because you
know the one who's really HTC is like
big last stand yeah to prove itself and
I think it did I think if you look at
the one as HTC's like comeback
opportunity I think they've really put a
line in the sand yeah we can compete and
you know we didn't compete with a one
acts and they're kind of obnoxious about
it yeah and there's really I saw a bunch
of HTC executives like a retweet our
review nice because the last line yeah
you said you're gonna buy one well um
and you know wasn't just use pogin boss
rig like right down the line everyone's
saying you should buy one yeah whether
or not that's gonna have any influence
or facts on the market I think remains
to be seen I think Samsung if they're
smart they will look at what they've
produced with the s4 and they'll say
okay it's time it's time for us to take
a really hard look at what our product
is what we want it to be and yet we want
consumers to get out of it and whether
or not we're gonna compete based on just
our sheer momentum and marketing muscle
or whether we're gonna compete against
some really really high in players in
the part that worries me is I think they
can probably still win just based on the
marketing muscle but I want to come back
to the first real quick before we wrap
up I always want to so great well so
everything is why like there have been
rumors that HTC is making another one of
these phones with the same ultrapixel
camera is the one okay and that's I mean
it seems like at that point like the
hardware here is is good it's I like it
better than the gs4 it's not as good as
the one and if it just had a better
camera and was still this size it's
still sort of mid-range specs it's not
1080p well there's a fan maybe like is
that all people want like yeah what this
found proves to me is that the raw spec
race can kind of V over right this phone
doesn't have a 1080p display it's not
five inches there are times I wish it
was bigger but whatever like I use it
it's fine the only thing I wanted to
have is a better camera like the
processor is a little bit slower the
screens a little bit smaller but none of
that matters because what matters to me
is how good the software is and I think
Facebook and Google
like they're two of the best software
companies in the world and I think that
come behind they like made a phone
that's the cameras bad and if you fix
the camera I think you make a really
compelling argument for this as a
primary phone yeah um so may I don't
think and just to be blunt I mean like
Facebook and Google are the best
software company is worth I don't think
Samsung and HTC rise the level of the
best software companies on earth and the
fact that they keep on wasting their
software on top of Android is like very
problematic today but I'm just saying
that forever right well yeah and that's
why I hope like I don't know maybe it'll
be a motorola or maybe it'll be HTC or
somebody to come out with like you know
phones are getting bigger and bigger
somebody has to have noticed that like
hey there's this big gap back at this
screen size we used to sell 10 5
millions of devices at once let's go
back there it's a keyboards like is
there a market for these is there a
market for a phones with keyboards like
those things might have just gone away
people might just want vision aids I
mean I know everybody if everybody's
buying this phone I think the markets
really speaking to look I mean I think
phones are visual I think yeah um the
argument that i bought this does look
good on a shelf Oh spray it on a frame
looks just and when the phone interface
was all about pushing buttons to dial
and holding up to your face to make
calls made sense for them to get smaller
and smaller as they get bigger and all
they do is show absent play games it
kind of makes sense for them to get
bigger the question is you still gotta
hold it in a hand and so if you end up
in the note 2 and it's like that does
that make sense there's a reason they
pick basketball players it's a putting
that's right and i think that there's
there's a middle ground here i think the
one is actually a pretty good size I
haven't heard anybody complain about the
size of the one it's just Samsung's
relentless quest to build a bigger phone
yeah that I think is is caught people's
attention but I think we've settled on
it kind of 4.7 25 kind of range yeah I
think that's where things are gonna lad
I hope sound yeah cool well thank you so
much go back to your three phones I'm
gonna play with my first eyes on
facebook all the time each I'm so sorry
check it out there all of those reasons
look a girl I knew in high school just
had a baby so happy I know that so no
matter what of all of these phones you
buy they have basically nothing in
common except that they're all really
expensive and really still too small and
easy enough to lose and that could cause
huge problems so we went and looked
through the Android universe to figure
out how to
keep hold of your gs4 or whatever
android phone you buy this year of all
the things you can lose a smartphone is
probably the worst they're expensive
they're precious and more often than not
they have a lot of our personal data on
there also thin small and kind of
slippery pretty easy to lose their have
sold with us when things are really easy
find my iphone is part of the OS itself
and you're prompted to set it up from
the minute you get your device but with
Android things are a bit more
complicated display Google's love of
cloud services it doesn't actually offer
you a way to track your lost phone
android is open up and it gives the
company's a way to do even more than
what you can do with your iPhone and I
guess we're gonna try some of them now
lookout is really the gold standard for
this kind of thing it has tons of
features and matches all of apple's
offerings it can even take a picture of
someone who tried to unlock your phone
and email it over to you the only catch
is that for these features you're gonna
have to pay to ninety-nine a month or

unauthorized sim cards in your phone
where's my droid is also free but it's
more designed for when you've lost your
phone in your house or in the couch
cushions as opposed to when it's been

up to Google you'll be able to restore a
lot of apps and data to any new phone

get everything so look this may be harsh

sometimes my choice other times by
chance the most important thing as
always is to make sure your data stays
protected this is mine now
