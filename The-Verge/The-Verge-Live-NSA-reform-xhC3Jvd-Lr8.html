I'm the allowed to tell i'm joined by
Russell Brandon adi robertson you're
watching us right after president obama
gave a speech on NSA reform that I would
categorize is a very very strange yeah
riot at the dawn of a republic ya know
it's weird he was like you know
basically America was built on
surveillance what's the nature of our
country is that we're always watching
yeah that's what it's always been we've
been spying on since this whole thing if
you don't like the NSA what do you think
about Paul Revere yeah Paul Revere is
the original bulb like amazing I
expected them to name-check you know
obviously 911 but I was not really
expecting Paul Revere I was expecting
like Martin communism and you learn my
plane this is what I say when I'm drunk
and I'm yelling at people about why the
NSA's I'm like look you know our
greatest Americans were surveilled as
state enemies and like now the
president's saying that as he's talking
about well we're not gonna change
everything I know you're mad but
remember that like you know some of the
most important people of the of my life
time were you know the state was trying
to destroy them through these very tools
and so just can make the tools a little
bit weaker way yeah but add more of that
yeah exactly like or energy light so if
you were strong to spy on states like
the Soviet bloc so that they will not
spy on their citizens yeah let's start
at the top here so yeah this speech has
been it's been over a week or so that
you know yeah it's been leaked that he's
going to be giving a speech there was a
presidential directive about it what the
intelligence community can I can't do
with signals intelligence that came out
earlier today and we were expecting a
number of things to happen but we
weren't expecting we were excited well a
number of things could have happened you
know everything should have there were a
number of things could have happened we
were expecting maybe none of them to
happen that's true i mean like yeah I uh
and so about he came out and he he just
started he he started with this history
lesson he would have in total law
professor mode she referred to the
people of the United States as a US
persons
a number of times which just thinking of
candidate Obama just walking the
campaign trail be I love meeting us
person let me kiss this us person baby
that is strange days full legal
professor mode talk about the
justifications for for spying for
surveillance for intelligence all which
I think are known I don't think anybody
really disputes the need for like the
police and for intelligence in the world
yeah the problem is the significant
overreach that that intelligence
community just over each like he
actually did make a really good point
that the problem is now everything we do
is surveilling right well you may have
had at the very end but he in a much a
strange a full devil in here mention the
internet he's like and the Internet has
provided us with so many ways to
communicate a way for people to reach to
other people across the globe and for
the police to watch that interaction it
was like we are completing a lot of
things that isn't it isn't that the
policies of change although they have
it's that everything else around them
has changed yeah so they fall under the
policies like somebody made a really
good sort of comparison to copyright on
Twitter that we're just dealing with
complete know that too late we were like
now we have to deal with it like things
don't mean the same thing anymore
they're not the same anymore right and
so he started with this and he did start
with Martin Luther King was surveilled
caught you know during the with a long
Twilight at the Cold War we learned it's
like yeah you mean when McCarthy rounded
up America no chance like yes we learned
a lot of bad lessons like why are we
learning than the game and then he began
sort of his kind of he got into the meat
the heart of matter which was there have
been lots of leaks he sounded very angry
about the leaks Lily he was like we were
you know we were looking at it yeah but
then unfortunately now everyone's mad
cuz the leaks so I do it now I was like
I was on it trust me like was fine any
what she's been saying since the
beginning well he also was saying like
we're just now undoing the damage that
was done you're all so graciously
dealing with his men he said very
directly I'm not going to dwell on mr.
Snowden or his motivations yes like his
motivations were you giving the speech
yeah that's what
you decide it over and over again like
we need to start talking about
surveillance that's why I'm leaking
documents and I was like I don't know
what motivated him I just given this
speech who knows so he got into it he
made a lot of recommendations on some
which I think we anticipated so much we
didn't so you guys kind of just give the
high-level overview of yeah should I um
I mean so the super high level yeah yeah
well so the main thing was the bulk
telephony metadata recall records the
basically who you're calling stuff
that's on your phone bill how long the
call why I will say to the fact that the
President had state said metadata a
major policy dress today is like one of
those melon starts like work we took
over the world it's amazing people we do
know what meta to everybody knows it
that's incredible anyway so good but
yeah so I mean that was the main thing
he says look the 215 program that is was
the very first thing that came out is
not going to exist in its current form
maybe they're gonna move all that huge
quantity of data to some third party if
there's some third party that they trust
or they're gonna do more judicial
oversight when the data so weary there's
like something's what happens now what
happens later he has two stages yes we
have to transition away from this
program no one likes it but we need the
capabilities it gives us right like we
need to be able to search metadata for
patterns quickly quickly so well the
emergency yeah the whole justification
is that we have to be able to do it
quickly because this will produce a
terrible delay and if you have a bomb
then you can't call up verizon right so
he said we're gonna keep the existing
database but we're gonna make it so that
you need a judicial finding to go use it
weezer like again the president's day
said query a database if you don't
believe that like the internet that like
technology is like take completely taken
over the world like this is what we're
talking about when the government query
date a date a metadata database like
that's great wait and see but that was
also I mean not that he's like in a go
for walk in like the speech but it was a
little envious because in some ways
that's what was already happening right
like the the official legal
justification for the system before was
it's not surveillance when we take it
and put it into the database because you
know we're not getting a word for that
because we don't look at it we just
there and then once we once you know us
sort of crossing the Rubicon is when we
query the database which is why we get a
warrant for the query that we're doing
from the FISA Court don't think they
actually I'm not actually sure there was
a process my understanding what they
were like whether it was just you just
had to have a higher bar of a higher
standard a suspicion like well no I mean
there was sort of a challo clearly if
someone you would say to the judge you
know clearly if someone saying kill the
president in or I mean if they're okay
we know this number is a terrorist if
someone's calling that terrorist we have
a reasonable suspicion to and so that
was and they've also reduced the number
of so if a terrorist calls you then you
call somebody and they call somebody now
they call you instead they've reduced it
so they're get their tightening up the
way they can use this program i think
the essential part there was that they
were always saying metadata wasn't
really surveilling firm ation right it
was just records use this record
situationally is still not right but
they were saying its business records
being generated by Verizon ATT so they
can just collect them they don't need
any warrants and then to go and then
look track you specifically yeah that's
when they needed to stop and now they're
saying they're going to tighten that
process and then phase two is we're
going to stop collecting and stuff
entirely and either we'll figure out how
to get the providers to like harmonizer
system so we can query them or we'll
have somebody else do it and i would say
rightfully he said there are challenges
with both approaches like you don't want
I mean I don't trust verizon I say Scott
and I certainly don't trust like
Blackwater right Andy who are they gonna
hire like yeah you gotta hire the
healthcare.gov guys to build you a day
to the Federation phone records like
that's awesome there is a terrorist
attack like well I can't get through so
yeah whatever have a good time uh so
that that's 215 and that's kind of a big
one right yeah and that's the one I came
out first that's the one where I think
most the most well prison tits know that
specific thing I think that there's a
lot of stuff that sort of high-level we
are going to reform everything and
generate reports on everything I mean I
also think it's the one that Obama is
focusing on like I think he said in the
speech you know this is the bulk phone
records is the the program that has
generated the most controversy I don't
think that's true I think
lots of other stuff that wasn't really
touched on but that's the centerpiece of
his NSA reform whether it's the
centerpiece of the stuff that we should
be reforming is kind of a question that
same thing it's not just it has
generated the most controversy just not
among you know people who are talking
and is the thing that Congress has been
debating it's the thing that hearings
are on it's also the program that we
actually can do something about the
metadata right we actually kind of know
what it is like if we're talking about
something like prism or the giant email
database we don't even know what's in
that right we don't know like how it's
collected let's quickly go through the
rest of the reforms and we have some
clips for the speech um so National
Security Letters it seems like they're
getting the gag orders that people were
really mad about and briefly okay
national security letters are things
that mostly the FBI uses if you need a
specific piece of information generally
from an Internet company you don't have
to get a court order you just send the
subpoena and say you have to give us
this data and you can't tell the person
you can't tell anybody you can't say
that you received right and this is you
know Apple and Google and Microsoft
Facebook and Twitter have been non stop
complaining about this right that they
want to release transparency reports
they want to tell customers what they're
doing and they can and now it sounds
like they're getting the transparent
they're gonna get a little bit they're
getting the panel was proposing these
reforms that were saying you have to
Taylor the tailor the scope of it make
sure you can't just repeat you know
section 215 you have to create some kind
of judicial oversight for actually
granting them they didn't say any of
that Obama pretty much clearly said he's
not going to do it you know he'll work
with Congress but you have some kind of
situation where you will have to at some
point prove that the thing needs to be
secret and after he's going to talk to
the Attorney General and after some
point it's going to expire automatically
and less a court renews it the panel
recommended 180 days it's not
necessarily clear that's what it's going
to be and then they're also going to
give them quote more information than
ever before that they can publish Google
got was it's good low bar it is because
no currently googled up permission I
think it might be the only company maybe
there are more now
they can publish in ranges of one
through 1000 yeah but the transparency
reports that you see there had being
like move we'd seen transparency reports
with big black bars over the net power
National Security Letters and it seems
like that at least they'll have
something to put in that column on and
then the other stuff is there's the FISA
Court Razak chua Lee you know the
institution that's granting the warrants
to say you know go to verizon get all
their information that court is gonna
see some work so we're gonna see um a
new public interest advocate that is
going to be the one specifically uh sort
of pleading the public's case and saying
you really need this information is this
really important arm we're gonna see
that and we're also going to see annual
declassification reviews on all of these
programs so which has already been
promised more or less yeah so the first
thing so I want to go to a clip here we
have it yeah so what's really
interesting is he proposed these reforms
but after what I would describe as a
pretty full-throated defense of the NSA
right so this is there's outrage or we
NSA spying there's outrage over
overreach looking at American citizens
stuff and Obama began like we are saying
with this stirring defense of
surveillance now so we have a little bit
here if we can't we just go to that to
the contrary in an extraordinarily
difficult job one in which actions our
second guest success is unreported and
failure can be catastrophic the men and
women of the intelligence community
including the NSA consistently follow
protocols designed to protect the
privacy of ordinary people they're not
abusing authorities in order to listen
to your private phone calls or read your
emails when mistakes are made which is
inevitable in any large and complicated
human enterprise he's do they correct
those mistakes so here's the thing about
that quote mmm there's been all kinds of
revelations that NSA people are like
spying on their girlfriends is that we
haven't actually had we
and revelations that have been a lot of
people intentionally abusing it and that
love it it was the thing that they
released was for about 10 years and
there were maybe 20 violations which is
bad in like objective terms and
subjective terms that is very few people
the problem is that they seem that we
have all of these weird unintentional
breaches and that they probably aren't
telling us about lots of other stuff
rice's you can't point to anything so
our ability to understand what the NSA
is doing this is the balance I think
this is the this is the problem that I
think we face is we try to figure out
what the balance and Obama very directly
called the downstream security and
Liberty which it is right yeah we do
need the NSA to like look at things like
we do need the CIA to look at things and
like try to maintain our security there
needs to be a limit on that and there's
no ability for us to have a conversation
about that limit because every time we
examine everything they do they
immediately claimed that there we're
hampering their ability to keep us
secure it's not just that it's that
fundamentally the fact that they have
proven that they cannot be trusted with
this means that we can't have a debate
because they can't ever release
everything like we wouldn't want them to
but that that means that we're always
going to have to take them on faith
right and now they've proven that they
are totally incapable of like accepting
the trust although i mean the the way i
read that part of the speech was
partially that you imagine you're an NSA
employee and you're watching this beach
I mean really like it you know he's
managing this group of people right who
have just gotten their ass kicked like
every week for the last six months
everyone hates them and like it's just
morale and you see this occasionally
like I will come forward just like it's
rough out there working for the NSA
right now they're just going to work in
like a shitty office building every day
it's terrible I anything looked at jobs
at the NSA when I was a college student
and I feel I think there was a time I
think when like working for these large
govern it yeah government police
institutions was cool like James Bond
James yeah stuff yet languages you could
be the guys in the van in enemy of state
like I said but until I think part of
that was okay he's gonna do these
reforms but he also you
no a lot he's my manager I mean that's
like real right a lot of the audience
for this was public employees who want
to make you know who want to feel like
they're reassured and he's not mad at
them personally and he's they're not
about to like it's not just that I don't
be burned with my fam anybody who
doesn't agree with him this is his
classic move that he's like I understand
your point of view Republicans not
purely Republicans right there in the
back like they're holding like like nice
it's not smile everything he says you
know we under section is like petting a
blowback yes yes say my words like you
know it's like chuck schumer petting a
cat it's not even like it's not even big
changes this point it's sort of everyone
right it's that I think over and over
and over again especially at the end he
kept he came back to the theme that
we're being held to a higher standard no
and you get the sense that you know he's
in the west wing with like the
leadership or he's in the Situation Room
he's meeting with the Joint Chiefs and
he's like and everyone's like dude like
why do we have to justify what we're
doing like Ireland they just do whatever
the hell they want yeah like and he's
like yes and so we have it I don't we
have it quite yet um the Russia China
directly hold out China and Russia we
have um I wrote it down at one point
well I think we're gonna have it in just
a moment say part of it is also that
it's weird because I think we see this
as basically a policy thing then you
know if he if he wants to sort of if you
wants to make some change at the EPA you
can just sign a thing and then it's
change whereas you know the NSA is to a
large extent not just this abstract
entity it's this group of people and
whoever they choose to run the NSA he's
gonna have to come from a fairly small
group of people and part of what you
want is to change the culture of that
group of people and just constantly
kicking their ass suspecting of a
limited value you have to sort of say
well yes we like you it's okay we want
to motivate you we want to raise morale
but we also want to change it in this
slow way that's gonna gradually change
the culture of so it we have
yeah we have a text i'll just read this
off ready it may seem sometimes in
America is being held to a different
standard and that the readiness of some
to assume that the worst Meadows why our
government can be frustrating now this
hat who is that frustrating right if you
just read that sense he's talking to
government employees like that is
designed to reassure like I know you're
frustrated NSA goods no one expects
China to have an open debate about their
surveillance programs or Russia to take
the privacy concerns of citizens into
account we're better than China we can
go on the verge cast and say proudly
that America is more open and democratic
than Jen China monium to 10 yeah this is
such a strange burn it's like he right
before this he was talking about how we
need to work better with our partners
reassure them he's like I won't just spy
in the Queen I'll pick up the phone and
call her and ask her what she thinks
instead of reactor email and then he's
like but China we're better than you and
it's just it's such a strange the
audience for the speech I can't tell if
it was citizens I can't tell if it was
government employees I can't tell if it
was like other spies well I mean into a
large at one point he said we're not
going to apologize because our systems
are better than everybody else that was
the best call us a good job actually the
problem another thing that was
interesting that we the I I was
surprised by and I'm surprised by in a
positive way was to a large extent
there's a big section speech where he
the audience seemed to be people in
foreign countries like the citizens of
other countries that are not otherwise
you know are we going to just spy on
everyone in Norway and how do the
citizens of Norway feel about the
American surveillance program and those
that that has not been a big part of the
conversation up until now at least in
American touch targets yeah it's been a
thing that especially because all their
justification has been this only happens
to foreign people yeah well any exactly
so of so much of it has been shifting
the oh my god are we surveilling
American citizens when were surveilling
some random dude who runs a coffee shop
in Norway but I mean actually he did and
I thought it was a very positive thing
that he said look we want buying from
the citizens of other countries they're
like we
and part of it was america world police
stuff that but he really wanted to make
a moral case for America as the
surveillance entity of the entire world
that the entire world should feel good
about right which one is that the job
read the day after was it called dish
fire dish fire which is what incredible
you know you you take like two hundred
million cell phone text attacks yeah oh
yes text and you take out the American
stuff and then you store everything else
and then you let the GCHQ Britain's
Intelligence Agency look for patterns on
ya their citizens data yeah I mean what
what struck me about this whole speech
is that its premise thanh the notion
that's like some amount of spying must
occur right and you can buy that notion
you cannot buy that notion I I accept
like fine some amount of spying must
occur why I accepted both pragmatically
and that it probably does have to occur
no IIIi think that's interesting but
important but i think is actually
interesting is that there was a lot of
reference to 911 we're gonna we're going
to highlight that soon there was a lot
of reference 911 he opened with you know
after nine eleven we had to change the
way we did things and it was like or are
you sure because President Bush was
definitely handed a piece of paper
called bin Laden determined to strike in
in US and he was like yeah whatever
they're not gonna do anything right the
entire premise of section 215 collection
is that you have to identify patterns
that you have to have all this data and
then he references a specific number and
a specific case that they already knew
about right and could have just queried
right in a you know a lot of the a lot a
lot of what his justifications for these
programs existing came back I think
tonight eleven over and over and over
again which is crazy because I think he
also said we went too far and we begin
walking it back he said the previous
administration began walking back and to
think of George Bush and Dick Cheney
actually ever walking back there Patriot
Act proposals and their surveillance
proposals that mean like if he truly
believes that they being walking back
and he's carrot cared for that process
then we are nowhere near close
yeah I was thinking about this that we
have come pretty much full circle on the
Bush administration which we would like
they did this and we were totally
outraged and felt awful about it and
Obama and everyone ran on the premise
that this will never ever happen again
our here you know yeah some years later
so via that was the other interesting
element of it because ostensibly the NSA
is not a counterterrorism organization
right like supposedly and these things
are constantly shifting like the border
of who's in charge of what but like a
sensibly they investigate they get
signals intelligence when they find
something useful they give it to the FBI
department homeland security or the CIA
or sort of any any and part of the post
on reforms is that there wasn't up
primarily a counterterrorism
organization but the idea that the NSA
is primarily concerned with
counterterrorism is this is the first
time we've heard yeah president make
that case and that it's wildly like a
huge expansion of powers if it's true um
and then there were all of these
primarily domestic things that he was
saying look people are trying to bring
down our stock exchange with malware we
don't want hackers in your bag well yeah
but I mean okay these people if someone
robs a bank is that the NSA's problem I
thought we had a whole domestic law
enforcement framework for this I mean
it's very kind of cyber command which
they're not splitting off yes I mean
let's just never use that phrase again I
mean like I like you know let us down no
language that we use to describe these
years what I'm saying like cyber package
it's in to destroy Wall Street yeah I
mean these are cockers in your bank
accounts like I'm the head of sight it's
like you know what it's time for us to
just just open up and admit that the
Internet is part of our real lives it's
not like some other place where other
weird behaviors exist and you can't be
like well the Internet's different so we
have to give it to the NSA because they
understand how information travels a lot
that's what's so strange we just heard a
speech where he was basically saying
look someone needs to keep the internet
safe that's why we need an NSA yeah
which is insane that was never ever its
signals intelligence they're listening
and trying to figure i need it what
would securing the internet even me and
also by the way to the extent that the
NSA is in charge of defending anything
in cyber terms it's just government
infrastructure right there's no and I
mean we can say that various things are
like infrastructure that is important to
national security so the power grid or
something but the idea that they're
going to keep Chinese hackers off of my
laptop because I'm that they've suddenly
decided that as a virg reporter I'm a
target of interest the NSA is not going
to do anything for me and we saw this
with the new york times we see this any
time a third parties is attacked like
the NSA does not keep the internet safe
that's just insane ok also they've
argued this Lee the cyber packet Wall
Street thing is a keith alexander i
believe interview in which he
essentially compared it to a missile
saying that it doesn't matter where the
missile lands it is the job of the
department of defense to stop it right
yeah but i mean what if it's like a
hosting sir like Facebook's like
icelandic hosting server i don't know
it's just odd like I think they have the
capability we kind of a cisco fight you
know last year and that's what this was
all about this is what this is is sista
like that's the meeting between these
two okay so we actually had it's only a
little bit we actually had a supercut of
all design 11 references though Ghana 10
seconds long with but I mean it wasn't
actually mentioned in as much as I
expected him to uh I didn't expect me to
mention it at all because i think i will
say you know i was I you know I was in
college I just have a distinct memory of
where I was a 911 it is a meaningful
memory to me but it is so disconnected
from the NSA reading my email that I i'm
disconnected enough for it to be the
opening line of the decision that struck
down in that yeah that's where we're at
you know I anyway so let's let's take a
look at this dairy September 11th after
nine eleven in the immediate aftermath
of 911 after 911 911 911 911 911 911
yeah it mean it's ridiculous it's a
eight references and like over an hour
or just under an hour it to me that is
I'm not ready to to just I went through
that right like I voted against george
bush and like I didn't want there to be
a war in Iraq and I I remember very
clearly what my politics were because I
knew that saying 911 would let people
get away with bad
things over and over and over again and
it it's to me that's like it I've landed
it every time our government says 911 we
have to do something crazy because of
911 it's like well the terrorists won
and that's that's like the legacy of 911
to me so to ignore to ignore what I
think are really really clear civil
liberties issues and really really clear
like the NSA was never designed to
police the entire internet issues yeah
because something bad happened you know
a decade ago is crazy I think part of it
is just I mean it was a very historical
speech right used from the power of your
stuff on and I think you know for better
or worse this this defined our our
public policy for this whole decade and
I mean all it's impossible to talk about
the changing nature of like our national
security infrastructure without saying
you know we were kind of just doing
whatever we want it for a while there
and like all of the you know when these
days we're all put in place because of
it yeah and and now we have to we can't
just time machine back we have to
somehow you know it's going to be a
revision of the Patriot Act it's going
to be a revision of the thighs but act
it's it has to you just have to keep
going and this stuff is permanently
written in history now maybe as it
should be but to justify its existence
or to justified not walking back to
where yeah it should be or could be
because something bad happened because
there's this looming specter of terror
is all I mean for me anyway for a decade
has been the mistake yeah that we yeah
they're bad guys out there we should
stop them you know but yeah obama killed
bin Laden like good job there well I
think that's very relevant to this whole
thing I mean I think because we saw when
he came in I mean he was and it's this
was a while ago that everyone was
disillusioned by this but I mean he was
much more hawkish on all of this stuff
than anyone expected and I think a lot
of it has to do with he just really
wanted to kill bin Laden was clearly
like gonna be a political win and
something but also if you have a
national security one like yeah great
you know that's that's all there but
this continued reference particularly in
this speech where it's we're worried
that
you're you know you're sweeping up
American citizens emails and text
message yeah and you do have loved it
we're NSA guy yeah like what's my
girlfriend doing and like pushing a
button they can just get it without any
oversight without any anyone looking
over their shoulder and being like
that's illegal that's like you don't
need that to stop bin Laden again you
just don't yeah we have to stop
pretending that that's the necessary
evil of keeping us safe um so we have we
have some slides I believe of the four
particular he ended with I'm making
various you know oh yeah he's got
specific specific changes let him be
clear so I mean what precisely two
specific changes during that well that's
nice she said four so it's we got slides
of the first this is crazy first this is
first the same technological advances
that allow us intelligence agencies to
pinpoint al-qaeda cell in Yemen an email
which into terrorists in it Sahel also
mean that many routine communications
around the world are within our reach at
a time and more and more of our lives
are digital that prospect is disquieting
for all of us so when he said that there
is he was changing how we collect the
information hmm right so you guys I gave
you the task of creating his initiatives
yeah where's that one fall honey I think
that was yesterday that's the
presidential directive for signals
intelligence the email stuff we had a
big section on on email collection and
there wasn't really a lot like you can
see it on this site right now I mean we
have locked down the NSA email database
and we have 2 b's and addy and there's
blazer because honestly because a lot of
what we were grading is how does this
match up to the proposals like not to
even our ideal version of this because
that would be ridiculous and they would
all be asked oh yeah um but that they
didn't they basically just said reassure
them that we're using this for good
mm-hmm I mean that's which is kind of I
think reassure I mean so we have the
presidential directive if you're
watching this on our site right now
there's a big link to it right about
yeah live stream you can go look at it i
would say tremendously boring but you
can go against a lot alike prasad in the
first one is like I'm issuing an order
that signals intelligence must be
conducted in accordance with the
Constitution it's like yeah what was
happening before
like do you have to occasionally remind
the NSA that the Constitution applies to
them so that was one do we have the
second slide start driving rain so the
second one when we'll get this one is
we're going to reform the programs for
more transparency increase safeguards
for us persons which was my favorite
phrase so this is all preamble here but
the the actual one was we need more
transparency this is where Apple
Facebook Google Microsoft can all tell
people about what's happening to them it
is going to be very interesting to see
what they're allowed to say yeah
basically all of their transparency
reports thus far have been like and
there are a number of things we cannot
say well Apple did an interesting
Deadman switch in which I said we have
not received any to 15 orders but the
problem with all of these is that
they've consistently denied that any of
the huge amount of stuff that they that
is supposedly in databases is from them
so it may well be mood because we're
also hearing about you know the NSA
tapping into data links so it doesn't
matter how many orders they've received
yes they're also just getting everything
from links well and the other thing I
mean one of the interesting elements of
it is how we were talking in the
beginning with a focus on phone records
right and I think part of it is you
don't really see anything in this speech
that addresses stuff like breaking into
the yahoo and google networks yeah prism
a lot of that stuff is just it's
focusing on the phones and so my pet
little paranoid theory is if you have to
give something up you give up the least
useful drain and he seems along each
other and they have many times said that
section of 702 is infinitely more useful
they didn't say infinite but much more
then section 215 which they I think can
only pin point like one case that it
helped and it was terrorist funding case
yeah and they've said that most of the
things that they said initially the 54
plots were stopped by 702 well I mean if
you remember when the prison first broke
the yeah controversy was not about
metadata or phone collection it was what
direct access to networks right direct
access to Google Yahoo Apple it was
about whether there
checking into the backbone connection
and getting it that way where the
companies are helping them as far as you
can tell none of that was addressed
during this yeah no I don't that all it
is the thing that makes me wonder how
much we actually feasibly can do because
this is basically how much should the
NSA try to break everything which is
their explicit arrests lately less
slightly less breaking I mean I think
part of the weird thing to me it's
interesting like as a media story that
like people are broadly speaking calling
each other on the phone less and texting
sending email right so now if we need to
roll back this massive surveillance
apparatus we're gonna do the sort of
thing that's tailing off we're gonna say
okay less phone records less phone calls
yeah we'll just keep a huge we're going
to keep our surveillance tools on email
testing I maybe falls into the metadata
it's sort of unclear but I mean I think
digital communications of the kind if
the most like shocking revelation to you
was that the NSA can read your email
which for me it was then this doesn't
really do a lot I mean it's funny
because when you describe it like that
it's like this is exactly how the phone
companies are treating you yeah right
like well we're just gonna cap you an
unlimited voice because you're not using
anymore so you definitely to pay 10
bucks a month for that because you're
not using anymore and we'll just meter
you for all the other stuff and it's
it's the same thing it's we're not using
the phone's we're not making look if
you're if you're a bad guy like what
you've learned today is like don't make
a phone call which they already knew
right it's like this is you're something
else um we also already known use tor
because they have not cracked that yet
right um okay so we have one last clip
we should wrap up I think you guys have
I want to see the last clip here and
then I want you guys have been grading
it so when I get some overall grades
from you so let's run this last clip
here this is Obama talking about the
internet and how it's both wonderful and
a reason for the government to watch
every move that you when you come
through the noise what's really at stake
is how we remain true to who we are in a
world that is remaking itself at
dizzying speed whether it's the ability
of individuals to communicate ideas to
access information that would have once
filled every Great Library in every
country of
world or to forge bonds with people on
the other side of the globe technology
is remaking what is possible for
individuals and for institutions and for
the International order so all the
reforms that I've announced will point
us in a new direction I am mindful that
more work will be needed in the future
one thing I'm certain of this debate
will make us stronger and I also know
that in this time of change the United
States of America will have to lead it
may seem sometimes that America is being
held to a different standard and I'll
admit the readiness of some to assume
the worst motives by our government can
be frustrated no one expects China to
have a open debate about their
surveillance programs or Russia to take
privacy concerns of citizens and other
places into account but let's remember
we are held to a different standard
precisely because we have been at the
forefront of defending personal privacy
and human dignity as the nation that
developed the Internet the world expects
us to ensure that the digital revolution
works as a tool for individual
empowerment not government control
having faced down the dangers of
totalitarianism and fascism and
communism the world expects us to stand
up for the principle that every person
has the right to think and write and
form relationships freely because
individual freedom is the wellspring of
human progress when you cut through the
noise so that line individual freedom is
the wellspring of human progress I think
that is to me it's the key he said every
person has the every person has the the
right to think and write and
form relationships and that's great and
you know in real life the government
can't really watch you do that right i
mean they they're not here with us right
now i mean presumably some of the NSA is
watching this well yes very also hijack
your laptop and then activate those Mike
right but it ain't like bachelor what's
interesting is that when you start doing
that stuff online the government can
immediately in real-time monitor every
single thing that you do and they have
the ability to do that and that's that's
what all of the Snowden leaks have been
pointing at is that we're only
constrained by where we say with our
words in like our laws you have to stop
there and what we haven't done a good
job of saying is what are you doing like
what is it that you're doing and where
should you stop and this is like I think
a first step it's please stop looking at
our phones which is great it is not the
first step towards please stop you know
scouring our email please stop you know
jacking directly in the backbone to look
at encrypted I message or whatever the
hell you're trying to do yeah because we
don't know and I think until we actually
know the full extent of what they're
doing and why they're doing it then all
these justifications for we have to do
it because of terrorists and these are
actually good people at the NSA who are
doing a good job and they're Patriots
too and we're frustrated left on this
laptop is already said I mean the NSA
has been so deep in this laptop all
right getting worried about it um and
that's me that's that's the whole issue
is we don't I still don't know enough
about what the government is doing I
still don't know enough about where they
think the real limits should be and I
haven't heard enough of that debate and
I think you know I've got my issues with
with with Greenwald and was snowed in
and I think they made it a lot about
themselves and said a lot about what's
happening and that's fine but he's a
hero now I think that's great he's a
symbol um but he's accomplished only
half of what he set out to do he got the
President to make a speech about one
thing we haven't yet had a real
conversation about the whole totality of
what's out there and you were saying
right before I started there are
undoubtedly more leagues to come oh yeah
and I that how we react to the next set
of weeks you know if greenwalt smart I
think he's smart I think he's very he's
savvy he's holding on to something big
just to respond to a speech like this
and so I'm very curious to see what that
next step is like but so let's end real
quick you guys were grading the speech
in terms
proposed reforms real reforms what yeah
let's do some overalls where do you
think about landed um I'm gonna go see I
didn't get sassy and he started talking
about it that's like a good strong point
I think the phone stuff is a good first
step you know but I I haven't heard
enough so that's a seat for me yeah I
think um it's weird so the big story
this to me was we're putting a lot more
power in the judiciary like there's a
lot more court based oversight there's
not a lot of congressional oversight
there's not a lot of other parts of the
executive oversight um which is
potentially interesting but also there
was already judicial oversight and so in
many ways there's a lot of stuff that
hasn't we're using a lot of tools that
have already not really worked yeah so I
think c-minus yeah I'm a little bit
lower okay Abby to some extent it feels
a little bit pointless to grade this
because what we are doing is grading
rhetoric and that so much of the
rhetoric is essentially we will create
more oversight it is we will reaffirm
our principles it's things that they
should be doing anyways and that they
have been promising since I suppose it's
almost going on eight months now maybe
more maybe less but the problem is that
every time we do this we talk about okay
this is the thing that we've changed and
we did a report card which is useful and
I would maybe also go with CC minus but
it's that he is this going to actually
lead to anything meaningful and we'll
never know if it does right well unless
you work for the NSA yes some of you
that job yeah there's still I i would i
would ask sure they will hire i would
ask all of our readers to immediately
beam applying for jobs the NSA and then
leaking that information to us which i
believe is treason and i will be talking
to agent of the government soon and that
was the verge live everybody thank you
for tuning in we're gonna have lots more
i'll say is we have lots more NSA
coverage coming up these two are maniacs
you should hear them argue and the
cameras are off it's terrifying to be
honest to you so we'll have lost wearing
the essay in coming up probably later
today there's some news just from the
speech we needed to shorten alice's of
and obviously as the stories ongoing a
lot more so thanks Cian that was a
virtual I've
