verge mobile show this is episode 42 the
week of a plate we have got a lot to
talk about we are a day later than usual
primarily because we wanted to be able
to talk about the facebook phone HTC
first I'm dieter bohn humble and some
move i'm dan seifert i'm chris sigler
and how are you guys feels like it's
been forever but it hasn't has it uh no
we actually did a show last week so yeah
for me it's where you guys is yeah it's
been like three weeks for you Chris
Chris what have you done to evolve your
complete inability to broadcast audio
because you've been you've been the
worst is it is it bad this week no
you're totally fine and I'm wondering
how you fixed it uh I it's a little
embarrassing go ahead I have to say yes
i rebooted my modem oh my god are you
serious yeah it was like the one saying
on my ex months yeah it was the one
thing in my inner my chain of internet
that I hand tried I just I don't know
how you how you got away with that
because I reboot by mode of like every
three days no I literally haven't
touched it in like a year and my power
never goes as let's just been on for a
year and and I finally thought to do
that and sure enough everything's been
fine since then wow wow wow wow that is
crazy uh so anyway this is a virgin
mobile show we talk about smartphones
and smartphone software and modems and
the fast and furious and vegetables and
oreos I guess it yeah one occasion yeah
but today I think that the topic du jour
and maybe the only topic we might
actually get to is facebook home and the
HTC first so actually I'm sorry but
before we talk about that I just want to
mention one oreo related thing oh please
do last night I had a an artisanal Oreo
made from
to handcrafted short bread slices with
dulce de leche in the middle that's
that's some fancy into Missouri of you
that Chris how is that an Oreo yeah they
closed the restaurant called it an Oreo
that's all I'm saying they could get
sued don't name the restaurant okay
continually deliver Foursquare check-in
isn't it it's not black it's not
chocolaty what can be it can be Dan will
be the first to tell you there are
chocolate filled Oreos yeah they are
also an abomination and Ally and nobody
should eat those so okay as long as
we're talking about Oreos let me just
say that I am so freaking tired of
seeing Dan's picture of two mega Stuf
Oreos crammed it is the cover photo of
his Facebook thing and the way that
though I've enough yes the way I cover
feed works is if you just post a
text-only status update or a link it
still needs to put some kind of full
screen image behind the status update
and so anytime damn post a facebook he's
lazy doesn't post pictures doesn't post
anything he just posts little bits of
text and so I always see that fricking
gross looking horrible Double Stuf Oreo
on my home screen every day I turn it on
and how long does it take to update I'm
just ah it's very it's very fast like
super fast so my most recent update on
cover feed is the thing that's at the
top of my newsfeed right now it does
update in the background but it doesn't
suck that much data down and facebook
also said that they are very careful
about if if you're on Wi-Fi it'll do it
more often you're not in Wi-Fi it will
do it less often and then when your
battery starts to go down it doesn't
less often as well less often is really
nebulous though like what does that mean
I don't know less off so it's not it's
not adjustable it's just kind of a magic
thing yeah hmm so
there you go I also dinner you've done
the one who's gotten to live with the
HTC first you obviously yeah massive
reviews on the person and I've written
and I was gone mostly open us before we
get into a the actual nitty-gritty of
the Facebook aspect I think the primary
question that a lot of us have is since
you have the option to run a stock of
stock ish Android okay is is the thing
that most of us are going to do with
this phone if we use it for an extended
period of time is this a nervous be at
most you play around with facebook fair
i'm with home for a while to get rid of
it and then just from the stove android
option full time is that what we're
going to do yeah well i mean that's what
people that you know aren't huge
facebook people are going to do and i
fully recommend that it's great i like i
like the chat head sang though which
like we can get into a little bit but
yeah you can you can turn off facebook
completely and actually I was talking to
Chris about this the other day the
facebook home software either because I
didn't have time or because they're good
people at Facebook is actually really I
don't know the word is like respectful
of Android there aren't hooks everywhere
and all of the apps if you turn it off
it's gone and it's just Android
underneath they could have really liked
Ben dirtier about it and made it harder
to turn off and stuck their fingers in a
lot of other different places but they
didn't do that it's all siloed off in
that one little area and you can turn it
off the problem with running this thing
is like a replacement for say a nexus 4
is well it's twofold one it's 4.1 point2
so it's not android 4.2 and I have asked
HTC and not gotten a good answer yet or
any answer actually which means not a
good one either about when if it'll get
updated to android 4.2 and also the
processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400
it's clocked at one point 4 gigahertz
it's a dual-core processor so it's not
quite as fast as a nexus 4 or an HTC One
it's
it's probably safe to say it's got a
week or GPU in there too I don't know if
we know exactly what yeah I don't know
what the I think Izzy Adreno 305 we
should be pretty good yeah like then
actually fast and like it's not slow
it's just not like fast I mean in the
review I said that it's sort of like
you're using an iphone 4 and you're
totally happy with it and then you get a
4s and like oh wow this is really fast I
didn't know things were slow before it's
kind of like that where the where the
the first is the for the 4s the first is
the four and then like you know Gotye
should be I don't know maybe the nexus 4
I guess it's not quite that big of a
golf and speed but it's it's it's
noticeable if you like use a lot of
android phones which I have so there's
none of us that fish and then for you d
2 and for those of us who aren't big
Facebook users ah what I mean you
mentioned the chat heads and we should
probably get into those what in the
facebook home software would you say is
good what is attractive and maybe a
better idea than other software CC so i
gotta say like cover feed which is the
the home screen thing where you can you
know see all of your friends status
updates and swipe through them and
double tap on them to like is actually
really good if you like facebook and
even if you don't if you're not a huge
facebook person like me i still am like
i used facebook a lot when I was using
testing this phone like I went from like
check into facebook and see what's going
on you know once every 3-4 days to like
constantly looking at it and in fact
like I wasn't even using Twitter as much
like I would open up my phone like I
whoa I'm gonna go look at something on
my phone and then Facebook would be
there when I unlocked it they're like oh
well this is cool i'm gonna look at a
couple more facebook updates oh wait was
i doing again i don't remember so like
far as echoes facebook has got a huge
win if they can get it i also like the
other good thing about it is facebook
has done some really deep
hardcore like nerdy coding work to make
stuff move around very quickly to you
know if their little chat heads and then
you know all the transitions and stuff
you know more I'd like to see better
tools for developers and more developers
try to like do this deep coating to make
animations and like just transitions and
everything else as smooth as they are on
Facebook home so that's like the best
part of it if you want to keep using it
but I don't because app management is
terrible you get a grid of four by four
icons you can make multiple pages of
them but you don't get folders and so
you're kind of constantly like hunting
around looking for your app you get used
to it over time but like even a
first-time smartphone user can
understand folders i think i think that
like their its oversimplified so so for
someone like me who has like 200 weather
apps installed it's probably going to be
a headache to manage on you yeah you
would need a page for each of your
weather apps and you'd have to keep you
know going through them over you no
swiping over to get to them over and
over again now the chat heads feature is
probably the most intriguing feature to
me I think and if I turn off the
Facebook home and say I want to use it
like I say a pseudo stock Android device
can i still use chat heads you can on
the first I don't know what it's going
to do on the download version but all of
the settings for turning chat heads on
and off our inside messenger facebook
Messenger and facebook Messenger right
now will let you do SMS it like the
current version that's out there right
now so I expect that you'll probably be
able to do that both on the first I know
you can on the first because I've done
it and I expect she'll be able to do
that on the download version and again
like the only problem I had with chat
heads is that it only connects to SMS
and facebook Messenger I really wish
that they that they would copy webos and
do something like synergy where any
messaging app can plug into it and say
yep i'm going to use the default
messaging half of the default messaging
app is chat heads and so i'd be able to
get whatsapp and ravine i don't i don't
know whatever else you want google talk
but that tells you i think that jet
heads is a good implementation right
because you don't wish that other
people's messaging clients will plug
into a crappy messaging client right and
you know i haven't used it another think
Dan is usually either but from what both
of us have seen it's intriguing it's the
way that you can overlay your chat
messaging on top of what you're doing
but it's a browser where it's checking
the weather with Dan you know looking
for some new facebook profile picture
whatever it is you can overlay the
message you can relate a conversation
you can have multiple conversations
hence the chat heads hence the little
previews floating about on your screen
and I think it also just makes better
use of screen real estate you know i'm
so tired of every single app being full
screen and just dominating and having no
matter how smooth you make it you know
transitioning between a chat application
and your web browser let's say it's not
as moving just having the chat on top of
the web browser which is your facebook
because that right there are some custom
roms you know I think cyanogenmod does
this with its built-in SMS app that you
can have it like pop up like a little
window and then you can reply to a
message without actually opening the SMS
app when you get a new message in which
is really cool and that's one of the
features i like about that particular
rom but obviously that's not accessible
for most users whereas this the chat
heads feature is if it's you know you
just install facebook Messenger and turn
it on it's a little bit more accessible
but yeah it's the same concept and I
totally dig it on the cyanogenmod so
yeah but I mean the nice thing about
chat heads is like when you get a
message it doesn't just show you like
the message and then a reply you get the
full thread and you can go through the
full thread of your message or you know
your conversation but the thing that
that's really cool about it is you know
it doesn't interrupt which I mean it as
interruptive it's happy to switch over
to another app but like if i'm texting
somebody chances are we're going to have
like a ten-minute conversation we're
going to have some back and forth and
i'm going to be waiting for them to
reply i'm going to do something else in
my phone and this makes up way easier
because you just keep on screwing around
on your phone looking at Twitter
browsing the web whatever it is and then
it pops in
you look at it you're apply to it and
then you close it again and it's right
there you don't have to do whatever
multitasking there is wait for the apps
to load and and so on and so on the
other thing like and we should really
get into the the first like this here it
is next to it s 3 I don't have my wand
handy but like flat this is the size
phone you been waiting for right yes and
it's coming out as in oranges I have a
friend who works at HTC he's and here's
my big problem with facebook home it's
not really a technical one it's a social
one I have two people with whom I have
chat conversations of facebook to pee
this is like it might be useful if we
have really really developed our
relationship to where we constantly chat
but i am not sure that's going to happen
anytime soon one of those people works
for HTC and it looked like his his
reaction once everything was official
was mr. phony be waiting for isn't it
and he starts listing of the specs for
me and I was like actually yes Oh 720p
display oh it's a good one it's a super
LCD Daventry and it's like it's 4.3
inches there are no crazy camera bumps
getting in the way I understand the
camera sucks but I can live with it
because they have been a lot of sucky
cameras and phones but you know the size
is right for point free the display is
right it promises far as I'm cassette is
most likely to be good enough he has LTE
which I understand is very nice awesome
experience this is the thing I've the
u.s. I'll let a dealer talk more about
the hard works he's been actually using
the phone for days but I did hold it for
a few minutes yesterday vice and its
really well put together it's like a to
me it struck me as a mid-range nokia
device as far as hardware build quality
which is you know a pretty good
compliment because nokia puts together
really really good phones so it doesn't
feel cheap it doesn't feel really super
plastic even though it is made of
plastic or polycarbonate
the soft touch grip is grippy and stuff
and it doesn't feel like it's going to
fall out of your hand like so many large
devices do yeah the way to think about
it is imagine that an iphone 3gs and an
HTC One X got together and made sweet
sweet love to one another and I guess I
guess the one x is the female in this
relationship I don't know anyway they
have a baby together and this is that
baby so it's the the feel of the plastic
is pretty close to the One X it's a
little bit smoother but I mean tell me
this doesn't look exactly like an iphone
Oh totally oh I've been saying this for
days I've been saying this lee dude it's
a cheater turn it on and like a message
so buff no it looks at me it's like that
when I saw it and we saw discovered the
announcement stuff I was like that looks
more like an iPhone than any other non
iphone phone I've slow yeah I wish that
had a iphone 3gs here because I mean
here is it gets by my orange completely
powered down I'm playing five of the
forest dude dude dude look at an iphone
3gs and then look at this it's the same
thing look to me it actually looks
likely looking at a 20 but nice fact
yeah there's definitely a 20 this leg
beautiful coat in the room is actually
just the phone with the sides you know
oh the edges curved down so they're done
so that you can hold it up against your
head like you're just doing without
leaving marks itself yeah you genius but
ok but actually I won't have a little
digression here because i was getting
educated today i was watching this yay
or lecture on youtube and i have to
recommend youtube there's so much
educational stuff now that they post
like how long documentaries and stuff
I've grown addicted to it but would you
say there's a lot of stuff to watch on
youtube yeah thanks thanks for so
sarcasm then the seriously I've gone
through the neil degrasse tyson archive
and now i know so much more about
cosmology and our future demise but
besides that was what i was watching
this lecture about
the romantic love and social psychology
and things like that I like one of those
things one other one of the piece of
research that they found was on the
court on the causes all the things being
equal for people following a loved one
another and though they actually like
showed how lazy we are so you fall in
love with people who are close to you
you fall in love with people who are
similar to you and people who are
familiar t and that wasn't just readily
related to people it was transitive as
far as objects go as well so people are
more likely to fall in love with for
many things that's what I'm saying and
if this phone resembles the iphone if it
resembles every other touchscreen device
and it feels familiar then that just
makes it more likely for us to fall in
love with it as my decorator about the
noise there is that the first uh no I
think that was the one I've got
everything turned on right now I like
when I have a new calendar appointment
my entire office explodes and yeah I
know that feeling multiple times a day
my vibe rates uncontrollably and bursts
out in noise and you know some phones
have really really sensitive power
buttons particularly HTC phones I've
noticed us and sometimes I'll get really
freaked out because some old review
phone will just kind of wake up myself
and stop give me email alerts another
like what the hell exists every editor
off but in all of a sudden somewhere in
the ether you get an email notification
like to dance point about this like the
phone just being nice and not feeling
cheap and like a mid-range nokia found
like it's totally true like there's
there's nothing that's amazing about
this but there's just a lot of really
nice subtle things like the the earpiece
speaker you can't even see it it's this
tiny little slit that's just barely
there and it doesn't get in the way the
glass has a tiny little bevel into the
plastic it's got the micro gerald
speaker holes just like the One X that
are on the bottom it's just in the
buttons are nice so
it's not like like I know that there are
a lot of people saying you know there
it's not like a jewel like an iphone 5
right it's not like a finely tuned watch
but it's just like it's good except for
the camera so was it was it designed to
Facebook specifications or what did HTC
designed this and presented to facebook
I do not know what do you think uh well
I mean it's so I noticing I do know that
Facebook was involved in some of it
because I mean at least a claim they
were because i'm pretty sure that the
the three buttons on the bottom which
was just like a little arrow in a circle
and a line i'm pretty much facebook asks
for that but it's like it's like when we
were talking when you talk to google
about the nexus and like you can't tell
like they talks like they designed it
but really you know that LG or Samsung
did some stuff too so it's hard to know
just how much input they had I feel like
if if Facebook designed it it would have
a capacitive like button just you know a
thumbs up not not it would just be like
it would just be on the side of the
phone soon you're holding it you just be
like like yeah just redefine this
instead of a power button it's got a
light bug I don't know if you double tap
stuff too like and whatever but I wonder
if Facebook it's this thing they care
more about messenger than anything else
right now like when you got your little
chat order your saw your little bobbled
a little your little face down on the
bottom of the screen and you pop open
your shortcuts oh is that my is that my
little update for you dinner with my
Oreos yeah there there you are thanks a
lot man all I see all day it's my home
screen actually okay before we get into
this messenger thing like do you guys
read Ellis's piece you know what happens
you know facebook phone Facebook home is
beautiful but what happens if your
friends are not yeah like what if
happens if your friends are dating yeah
ok so the metaphor I think this didn't
make it in the review but you know your
inboxes to-do list that your friend your
that other people make for you you know
I've had to unfollow a bunch of people
since i started using this phone I've
had to like you know and then you can't
get rid of stuff quickly you got to drop
into the facebook app itself
and then I'm following their you can't
just get something out of your home
screen which is super aggravated yeah
that's that's really annoying and I
think Ellis made some really good points
in his post on this that like because
you can't control what your friends or
what your facebook friends they might
know you made real life friends it might
be somebody went to college with seven
years ago you can't control what they
put on their wall so they could put
something really offensive really
provocative really you know something
that you might not want someone to see
if they just happen to pick up your
phone i think the example that Ellis
gave was that if you hand your phone to
your significant other and then boom
there's a shot of you know somebody in a
bikini on a beach on your your lock
screen like taking up your whole lock
screen that might put you in a little
bit of an awkward uncomfortable
situation so it's and it's like III
could say from experience from my
facebook well it's all a whole bunch of
those like everyone seems to love to
post these these some ecards things
which are these like pictures with a
with a not very funny quip next to them
and there they got terrible grammar and
they're usually like full of foul
language or whatever so like if I had
that that's all I would be seeing all
day long I'm not seeing the you know
maybe my friends aren't that interesting
but I'm not seeing the you know the cool
vacations and the awesome world
traveling trips that Facebook advertises
that you might see on your home screen
with facebook well when Mark Zuckerberg
introduced the whole thing he did say
multiple times that it's personal that
it's almost intensely personal they
wanted to have a personal phone the
facebook experience to be personal
person person and personal is just
another byword for potentially
embarrassing you know the same way that
caring sharing social social do is just
another way of give us your data we need
to make money out of it you know every
time you share you the foot I said this
before the first person or the first
entity you share with is the service
provider not the rest of the world not
other people so I mean that's part of
the deal you know windows phone is more
personal in that respect than the iPhone
and iOS and Android that just the way it
is
android phones that give you massive
previews email previously set from the
web screen I more personal than other
devices and you know that's that's a
choice that you have to make I think oh
but I think there's a there's a distinct
difference when something is sent to you
directly as a message or email then when
somebody just posts it on their own
Facebook wall and then it shows up in
your feed because you happen to be
following them I think that's a very
distinct difference than something
that's sent directly to you that's a
message for you that yeah that may be
personal and it may be embarrassing if
someone else sees it but it is like you
know something related to you or we're
supposed to be related to you as opposed
right that is the same time you look up
your friends with actual friends on
Facebook so in the end in in the dream
sure but I think everyone knows that
like they are friends with lots of lots
unless you are strictly curating your
Facebook friend list a lot of people are
friends with people that they're not
really friends with anymore or that they
were just merely acquaintances uh that
they met pumped in two years ago or that
they used to notice chameleons that this
phone is going to drive you to redevelop
your web social landscape and I think
that's what dieter said yeah I mean
that's exactly a terse point when he
said it I had to unfriend a whole lot of
people or stop or stop following or hide
their updates from my timeline whatever
the the nomenclature is that Facebook
uses so yeah you're putting a lot of
trust in Facebook's algorithms for what
it shows you on the standard newsfeed
because remember they that used to be
that the newsfeed was just the fire hose
of every status update of every single
one of your friends and that was it and
they changed it and it made people
pissed because anytime you change
anything people get pissed at least on
facebook to be like algorithmically
showing you what they think you're going
to like the most and hiding a bunch of
the other stuff and then you you know
you've had a couple of controls for
unfollowing and following and like
seeing stuff more often but not that
much and so like you're trusting
facebook to get that right and it's
super important that they do and that
that algorithm works well because it's
your home screen now it's what you see
when you turn on your phone and was it
stopped
newsfeed could suck and so there's no
like down voting in facebook right you
can thumbs up but you can't thumbs down
and maybe it's time to start unlike ins
maybe it's time to start with what's
hate we need likes and hates he likes
and dislike yeah it's pretty strong
where the word exists is there is just
facebook it's usually i should get and i
bring us back to chris's question
because i do find it intriguing and
whether this phone was designed by HTC
presents to facebook or whether it was
facebook demanding the particular design
I mean my impression is that Facebook
has done as far as Facebook home goes
the software side of things goes is
played it safe in not trying to push too
many features they've pushed chat heads
like Jesus says because messenger so
it's important to the company and
they've done it really well and they've
tried to make the software work really
well which means surprising because
keeping things simple and functional and
smooth is the exact opposite of the web
experience of facebook at least to me so
that's odd and then and then looking at
the phone itself there's almost an
overwhelming feeling of somebody saying
from facebook to HTC give us something
really really simple I don't make it
work don't get too involved the design
make it said I think what I mean there's
been rumors going around of another HTC
device that did the one was called the
m7 originally it was its code name I
guess there's been rumors that there's a
code named m4 device which is a smaller
device that has a very similar spec list
to what the first has it's got 4.3 inch
720p screen same processor blah blah
blah but I the rumors say that it has an
ultrapixel camera so it's got a better
camera and of course it runs each GC
sense so my gut feeling is what happened
was facebook said went to this HTC
they're like we want to release a
branded phone or a phone to showcase our
software we don't build phones but you
do we want something that's you know not
too big
what do you have and then you know HTC
says while we're working on this and
Facebook's like well you know can we
make a couple tweaks here and there and
you know crap up the camera to bring the
costume whatever they come and and I
think that's really what happened to it
and that's where we where we got the
first from and if HTC actually does
release this this so-called m4 I think
it'd be pretty cool and pretty
interesting um you know as a smaller
device with with an acceptable specs
that's not a facebook phone yeah but I
can't imagine what you sense since six
whatever that what what ya said about
blinky blink feed sense um how that
would run on this processor I I would
worry about that the other sports
Android what if there's no sense oh
that's not going to happen yeah no
that's not going to happen and in fact
the HTC came out and said that they are
you know fully behind Spence 100 you
know that there was some boilerplate
statements and saying that they're
completely committed to sense you know
in light of the first the existence of
the first so that's not changing at all
so Facebook mostly and maybe it's you
see but Facebook mostly this also
deserves credit for not letting ATT put
a bunch of garbage on this thing there's
like the contact app is clean that
everything like the only that I can't
find any AT&amp;amp;T crap except for visual
voicemail because I'm sure facebook like
oh yeah we want to be able to say we
have visual voicemail and like the the
Wi-Fi auto-connect stuff that's it
that's which is really impressive yeah
well here's my mean here's here's
exactly what happened I mean facebook
shop this phone around two carriers and
maybe 18 he just haven't be the first
carry that they talked to and they said
hey we want to do a facebook phone and
AT&amp;amp;T is like where do we sign you know
because it's it's it's a it's a buzz
word and it's a buzz product and
obviously it targets a very specific
demographic that 18t would like to bone
up on and they had no they that they had
no good reason to turn down that
exclusive offer if if this has been a
device it was going to four carriers I
guarantee you'd be seeing more more crap
we're on that device
but um but you know 80 was I assure you
they were more than happy to take this
phone clean the problem I have with it
and I made this point on announcement
day and I you know even in light of the
review I don't think that the point
changes really is the fact that you know
because this phone is only sold on 18t
in the US you have the traditional
contract model ninety-nine dollars on it
to your contract yeah and the economics
of it I mean I that's great that it's a
solid phone but still at the end of the
day it is not the economics don't make
any sense because you can get a gs3 now
for ninety nine dollars on contract
which is objectively a better phone that
you can put a certified a facebook home
on this week right is it this week well
yeah well probably yeah so this friday
so i mean if you're talking strictly
about dollars and cents you need to be
putting this you need to be putting this
money into a gs3 not at first i would
rather have a first one gs3 period
there's no question I don't anybody the
bottom gs3 instead of a first needs to
be slapped with Jesus and it would hurt
too because that's a you know pretty
broad follow just I would well is it
okay so layout layout your reasons I'm
curious it is a round the same speed or
so the hardware doesn't feel cheap and
slick and plasticky a the camera the gs3
is better I will grant you but stock
Android dude and a better screen well
the putting stock Android on a gs3 is
not exactly rocket science I mean it's
on its don't you just use the custom rom
why no no no no no I'm just saying if
you're that no no no look if you are the
kind of person if you're the kind of
perseus Lee if you're the kind of person
who buys a facebook phone knowing they
want stock Android and those knows what
stock Android means they can put stock
Android on the gs3 even if you would
have a point there but
they will also appreciate the the first
a much superior screen what oh so you
guys are arguing so so wait wait wait
wait so let me back the train up for a
minute okay so you guys are telling me
that the best way an AT&amp;amp;T customer can
spend ninety nine dollars on a two-year
contract is on the HTC first god no I'm
not saying that at all but if you want a
decent android phone that's got you know
not insanely large that / has good
performance has LTE you know the faith
the first i think is a good choice yeah
i mean what you're saying if i say you'd
say the best way to spend on a nine
bucks nadine to use to get a gs3 i'd say
i take a 1 x plus or a gs3 over this for
ninety nine dollars absolutely i'm gonna
split it down the middle and send Chris
insofar as i really like the galaxy s
free camera and I wouldn't sacrifice
that for the first even though the first
has the better display and all those
other things we discussed but i think
it's close and another thing i would say
is that i am completely over the HTC One
I understand it's not even out yet over
in the US but I'm just over like as far
as I'm person if you're gonna give me an
HTC phone to phone over it will be the
first after you I mean I don't know glad
I mean I guess we can transition though
for tired of talking about the facebook
first no no this was not like a sneaky
segue I wasn't like expressing some
false passion for the first in order to
get us to segue to the one we can get to
that same way we can force it in that's
fine it's the first is actually the
thing we've been asking for for just so
freaking long is okay it's an option
rather than the default option having
stock Android and put is there and it's
just something you can flick on enough
whereas yes chris is right you can
install stock Android and pretty much
any android phone nowadays but I know
because I've tried and because i have an
HTC One X that is still pricked because
yeah minus 2i bridge but I broke my wall
acts a couple of weeks ago like I just
don't have the time to
it's an epic struggle yeah with a lot of
these phones and the other thing is is
it also completely sucks or Mac because
most of the methods you're getting for
unlocking look your bootloader getting
on your software done I sorted out of
windows-based but if you guys look at
the Venn diagram of who you're trying to
appeal to you've excluded everybody
because the people the people who want
stock Android want 4.2 not 4.1 they want
to expect out phone not a mid-range
phone so you're appealing to nobody by
saying that the first can run stock
Android outline on and my if my aunt and
my cousin or get into it experience yeah
but my father my cousin or anybody were
to come to me and say hey I want uh I
gotta want to spend a hundred bucks on
the phone I don't know anything that
fancy and I kind of like Facebook I
would tell them to buy this phone if
they're on 80 I mean the flip side of
that the flip side of that is how people
to buy an iPhone but like they're going
to be a ton of people that are going to
be into this and the thing we're for
people it's a really tough sell diesel
anybody man the thing is like if you
know somebody if you know deters aunt is
in the eighteen t store and they buy the
facebook phone pitch hook line and
sinker and they buy the thing and
they're using home and then like six
weeks or two months later they're out of
their return policy and you know
facebook home isn't really that great
for them they're not liking it that much
she'll call dieter and be like dieter
why did I buy this phone a deer will be
like go to settings turn off facebook
home there you go and like then you've
got a you know a standard Android
experience and you can access all the
Android apps and everything like that
and you got a decent phone to go to boot
can we can I just propose that we
permanently make deters aunt like the
universal like like example i have
several i'm trying to think which one it
is but you just one more one more
argument against least like to a lot of
people yes that there is that group of
people who want stock Android in a
conscious of it and who would be capable
of installing it on any android device
that's fine i'm longing with that but i
think that there's the other group of
people who won't stock android because
that's actually the best center
experience they can get
actually it's it's a it's a can do no do
it unless you buy this or no more crazy
or you buy a nexus in which case you
don't get LTE because Google uh
chickened out of forgetting advices get
a device's d to what I'm saying is if
stock Android is the best user
experience then much all of us want it
it's just a lot of us might not be aware
of it but that doesn't really matter you
know if stock is the best Android
experience which I argue that it is then
what you want is the best so you aren't
is actually a stock Android aficionado
deters aunt is like hunkered over a pc
with like a 1x cabled up to like a BB is
there is there a fake dieter say at
Twitter cuz i was just gonna let shoot
we did that you get here nobody get on
there oh my god let's talk about the LTE
version of the one because um you know
as much as I like the first I do kind of
I want a better camera and I want
something a little faster and I mean for
me um you know in in two months I'm
gonna probably be using the one or the
gs4 so Dan uh yes the one on ATT so I
really really liked the one on AT&amp;amp;T uh I
didn't get to spend a whole lot of time
with the HSPA a model that we reviewed
earlier but like I did spend a bit of
time with the LT model and you know it's
a really really impressive phone it's
really solid performance the hardware is
by far the best Android hardware that's
ever been like put together as far as
build quality and I think the design is
great I think it looks great um it's you
know still big because it's a flagship
Android device which is huge which is
always the case but performance is
really solid network performance is
really solid the screen is amazing like
we've said earlier um and you know
there's a couple of complaints with it
that we still have that are pretty much
the same complaints we had with the HSPA
model which is that
you know the battery life could
definitely be better and the camera
could be better but as far as a flagship
device if you're looking for the
flagship Android device right now i mean
the the one is is by far and easily
hands down the choice that i would
recommend for most people and would you
really would you recommend they go on by
the one would you recommend they hang on
and see how the gs4 turns out you know
obviously we haven't reviewed the gs4
yet because it's not out yet but you
know i have handled the gs4 and I can't
imagine using the gs4 after using the
one like the one just like feel so much
nicer when you're using it and like the
the hardware is just so much more
pleasant it's like I comparing the
hardware the only thing I can compare it
to is an iphone 5 as far as the build
quality there's like you know zero gaps
between everything it's a metal aluminum
device I mean it's it's great as far as
you know that is concerned and then like
the other features that HD is thrown in
as you know ignoring their stupid
marketing names but the boomsound
speakers work really really well um I've
actually you know I'll be like in my
living room with my wife will be
watching something on TV and I'll you
know fire up a video on the one to watch
suddenly and she'll like tell me to turn
it down because she can't hear what
she's watching on the TV and like you no
longer have to you know do the whole
silly dance of cupping your hand around
the phone to redirect the sound up to
you which is like the smartest thing
ever and I don't know why manufacturers
haven't done this before but I really
hope that these front firing speakers
become a trend because they work really
well uh actually manufacturers have been
aware of the fact that people do tend to
cut the hands around the phone so that
they can essentially exploiting that
fact yeah but it doesn't work as well
like you know my nexus for like i do
that and it still sucks like i have the
volume all over it and make them seeing
less ignorant no there I mean except for
HTC you figured it out with the boom
sound but you know the fuss about go
ahead it's not just the sound this crazy
on this vote the vibration function is
also yeah I mean that that's intense
arms come on with vibration starts
before the sound
the whole table start shaking it's like
you know I guess that's what coffee
machines do when they're grinding beans
oh no not chris is gonna have to
enlighten us but yeah the HTC One and
the experience dead from Saudi the
vibration of those things is nuts and
fun if you would is there just for a
quick digression is when you get a call
and you pick up the coroner you tap the
button on the screen to answer the call
the connection is made quickly but then
you still have to pause for like a
second a second half to let the
vibration finish because otherwise you
just gonna keep going right next to your
face they have these super powerful
vibration monsters I don't know why they
go into these necks but they do it you
know I guess we pause about about saying
yeah I'm getting the one forget the GS
or I don't care as battery life like
even if the gs4 has the same battery
life as the one it's got a removable
battery but with the one I don't know
like I'm getting better battery life on
the first than I that I have ever gotten
on the one and the first as LTE the one
doesn't like I wish that we got like
twenty percent more battery in the one
and then I yeah yeah that's it that's
what I'm getting I completely agree with
you dieter um but you know when we fall
into the camp of power users who are
going to bother with you know getting an
extra two what is for come on I think
that a lot of people will go into a
store and be towed be totally sold on it
assuming the you know sales person you
know cares to show it to them just
because if you just hold the to like
hold like you know right now you can go
to a store and you can hold the galaxy
s3 you can hold one and the three feels
exactly like the four so you can hold
them right next to each other and you
cannot tell me that like the one does
not have much more impressive feel right
right at the boxes yeah everyone that
I've shown the 12 who isn't in the
industry is just blown away by it which
is really saying something like the
hardware is genuinely like mind-blowing
the only phone that i can think of it as
in the same league as that device is the
iphone 5 not even the porn for exactly
the five right you know a when we when
the five came out
we said all these superlative things
about how it's got like a jewel like
construction and the fit and finish is
like you know immaculate and its really
really well put together about all those
things that we said about the five can
really also apply to the one as far as
I'm concerned because you know I I don't
have like you know complaints with with
the gaps on the thing and you know it's
just I don't know it's just really well
put together phone like I don't want to
sound like I'm gushing too much but it's
just I'm just really impressed with the
solidity of the hardware it makes me
wonder how battery life would have been
affected if they had used to 720p
display instead of at 1080p because I
guarantee you that none of you if you
put two phones if you put to one side by
side one with a 1080p of the one with
720p display you would not be able to
tell the difference unless you had like
a microscope with you uh yeah you might
be right um let's see if I can get this
to show up somebody has created the
dinners on parody Twitter what happens
oh by the way Vlad you will appreciate
this actually you won't appreciate this
I had a conversation last week with an
unnamed OEM I'm not at liberty to say
which OEM but n OEM uh and and we were
talking about the sizes of phones and
how they keep getting bigger and how you
and I have decided that phones in the
4.7 to 5.5 inch range really aren't for
us and we would like smaller phones with
flagship specs and the very blunt
response to me was the market has spoken
people want big phones like that was it
that was the response no it was funny
because just today Sascha Segan over at
a pc mag wrote an editorial about how
he's you know leaving the Android
platform because he can't get a decent
phone or a high-end phone with decent
with high-end specs in a decent size
that's comfortable to use in one hand
and he made a lot of great points and
he's been using a thing an HTC 8x
because it's a 4.3 inch 720p display
yeah that's much more comfortable to use
in one hand and you know all of the
things that you just said Chris where
exactly what the manufacturers told him
more or less to the point you know the
market has spoken a big phone cell
because big phones look better on a
shelf big phones
look better when you're watching a video
or something like that and because so
many people in North America or wherever
you know I spend so much of their time
sitting using the phone with two hands
is not so much of a problem they're
sitting at a desk they're sitting on a
couch they're sitting in a car you know
so they can use two hands to control it
but if you're sitting in your car using
two hands to control your phone I don't
want to be drawing near you well maybe
maybe we're not driving better than or a
passenger in a car sure Farah let's
first us really well there's one of
three lessons that that will teach the
rest of the world lesson one people want
a facebook phone lesson two people want
you know secret stock Android and less
than three people want a really decent
or really good 4.3 inch phone that's the
point of view I think the market is
spoken yada yada yada everyone has
invested is a chicken and egg thing I
don't think the market told everybody
stick all your money into 4.75 edge
devices like when Samsung introduced
their first 4.7 inch flagship they
didn't have a corresponding 4.3 inch
alternative so the market hasn't spoken
it's not like there was a 4.3 inch
alternative with the same specs same
camera same everything else so my
thinking is let's have the first okay
let's have more devices like the first
let's hit the 4.3 inch category as well
SPECT as nice a design I mean I and
you've got things I believe in 720 from
Nokia right really nice design things
like the windows phone 8x I think that's
your second 03 right so you have all
these devices when you have more of them
and when they're closer to the super
high-end ones when for example we have
this HCM for which might be an HTC One
but shrunken down and all the good
things are kept about it you know then
you might actually have a direct
comparison and a direct choice for
people to make I don't think the choice
is fair it about well I see your point
fly that like you know if if they only
make big phones and that's only
that you're going to be able to choose
and then people have no choice and buy
it but you know from the manufacturers
perspective if Samsung comes out with a
four-point aided phone you know HTC has
to put something out that's going to sit
on the shelf next to it right and you
know I can totally see why a company
would say well we can't have something
that's going to be an inch smaller next
to it because it just won't sell um no
but that would be a really stupid and
superficial company but that's how they
work you'll be a company life is afraid
to levy they leap frog each other all
the time that's how smartphones have
been for like three or more years now
since you know they just keep
leapfrogging each other and getting
bigger and bigger and nurse at any point
and I mentioned this maybe but it was
around mwc when i met the asa designer
and he was saying you know people who
make sacrifices to have bigger phones
they appreciate the benefit of bigger
phone because might be there on a device
cetera cetera so one of the sacrifices
of people make in those circumstances is
better life all right DJ just said it
first gets you more better life than you
get with the one and this floral display
is you know other folks I was with all
right thank you um but I think it's a
really fitting analogy for this which
actually comes from desktop side of
things because there was a period of
time when nobody gave a damn about power
efficiency of the desktop this was at
around the start of this century around
2000 2001 and what you had was everybody
just having faster faster processors
more and more massive coolers faster and
faster graphics class nobody came damn
about power efficiency and since then
things have turn right back around and
now the more power efficient the
computer is what people appreciate that
a lot more whereas previously it was
like I'll just put a bigger fan I just
put a bigger power supply in it and it
was ultimately point where all the noise
that was coming out of your desktop
tower or the heat set etc just got too
much and then people kind of wound it
back again so I feel like that's where
we're going with
we're pushing it to the extreme and then
we're gonna put it back we're going to
get it back we're just gonna take time I
want a fan in my phone hey I just slap a
screen on it oh yeah and you've got it
you've got phone or go to the fan Wow
yeah um all right what else we got you
guys want talk about babble it's coming
you proper proper messaging from google
yay yet another proprietary messaging
but moved away it'd be interesting to
see how that competes with facebook
Messenger if it's a unified chat
platform that all the rumors say that
you know this is going to give you a
synchronized notifications across your
desktop and your mobile devices even if
you have a bunch of mobile devices like
us nerds have um you know and it's going
to be a single continuous thread you
know it seems like a very direct thing
against well you know never never mind
facebook Messenger this goes back to
that you know the fact that Google had
beaten Apple to the punch with the
concept of synchronized message in
mobile messaging before I message ever
hit the market with google talk and they
just I mean they didn't do anything with
it they said on it to you know David I
do because I do i get google talk
notifications across four devices and
they don't clear it so it's like you
know i get a google talk notification on
my desktop so i carry on the
conversation there and then i go pick up
my phone and i gotta clear this stupid
notification then i go later on I go to
my tablet and I gotta clear this stupid
notification so right like totally
broken yeah it's never worked correctly
and they just they seem to have been
sitting on it for the past four years
and I guess babble shows that they're
finally waking up yeah I just hope it
has you know stickers man I opened his
wave I hope it a hella hundred emoticons
lock on John devoted to his memories ya
know I to complain about these his
introduction I mean he just sounded so
tired of it like how good or bad we've
known about his courageous for us
needing this morning I was actually
really buddy for the first time outside
like Jeff for my Japanese seem he does i
ran up
we really really get around them
overnight yeah and I should know I guess
I'm just tired because I'm tired of the
messaging space in general it makes me
angry that's the point it makes me angry
to the thing that made to be most
interested in this google babo idea is
that it can all be pulled together so
there wouldn't be a Google+ messenger
and a gtalk and a google hangouts it
would just one thing yeah that's great
for google what about people what about
skype messages what about whatsapp
messenger messages what about text
messages what about maybe ms what about
I message every single way that we talk
to each other now is owned by some giant
corporation and not talking to the other
ways wasn't there a court case like like
Microsoft and we're forced to
interoperate like in the late 90s for
they're just there IM messages are like
oh yeah i remember they they we're gonna
get sued or something I i want i want
the department of justice or whoever's
going to replace Janikowski in the FCC
to just slap down gigantic monster
lawsuit threats on every single company
that lets you enter text and send it to
somebody and say they have to work
together that'll never happen in the
u.s. moving this theta it's that back
major it'll never happen in the US so
we're gonna have to rely on the europe
european and it's like we've got jabber
like why why don't why doesn't you know
we just make jabber optimize it look I
mean I'm on the cosmic scale on the
cosmic scale wasn't that long ago that
SMS wasn't interoperable that's right i
remember having a sprint phone and not
being able to text people with a verizon
phone yeah so we're back in that
whenever message spread was the worst
they had their own custom proprietary
thing and yeah yeah i wrote the article
like oh my god you can send an mms from
sprint to verizon look at this you guys
it's a whole day oh nothing already this
how long she's shocked that you guys
couldn't tect between networks that
sounds nuts to me when what sort of
prehistoric age was this this is like
2006 2000 for we believe that may be
okay to the punch with we beat the UK to
the punch with
with foam port with phone number
portability I think didn't we probably I
don't know hey I think so so we aren't
totally in the dark age and oh by the
way we've had LT for LTE for like five
years now so screw you what's up
anything man but you guys were so
freaking look down it couldn't send text
messages between networks until like
2006 well and granted you know just to
play devil's advocate here it's a party
now when we prank LTE networks are
terrible so compared to like 3G service
in Europe our 3g services a joke so we
want our government to stay away from
our networks man we're free libertarians
right I I you know just like you know
it's funded extramarital late 1800s
built the trains I don't know are going
I was gonna make an Ayn Rand joke but
I've lost it um let's move actually
that's a good point though they're not
your networks their AT&amp;amp;T verizon sprint
networks but they use our natural man
they use our spectrum you're such a
communist Vlad I can deal with that you
know I mean that's not just funny thing
i have to express this because otherwise
i would just explode the whole
conversation the whole bread trick in
the US is about our rights and our
freedoms and our copyrights and then you
look at who actually holds the vast
majority of copyrights its corporations
so anytime you guys decide to keep the
government out of it you have a
different form of government it's just
cooperation so you might as well just go
with the elected ones that's what that's
what I'm saying who'd agree with you
what deters idea let's have the proper
justice get in on this and decide on the
ultimate messaging client / sir listen
yeah then that messaging can be as
effective as government cheese you can
run as yeah
bable just first messaging just for a
second the same Bible because my thing
is I can't get into facebook messages
because as I mentioned I have only two
people with whom I speak on that thing
and it also feels going to inform a one
way to you again personal it doesn't
feel like a great way to communicate
with our colleagues at work but and
deserve things like not everybody I know
has Apple devices or an apple email
address or uses that message so I can't
use that but pretty much everybody that
I know as a gmail email address right so
it's a gmail user and gmail can both
personal and professional is both
business and pleasure than in how you
use it so to me it's universal so if
Google comes up with a good
communication sky which does all the
voice in the video and all of our stuff
brings it all together then I only care
about the rest in the fragmentation
relative to skype or I'm message or
whatever if Google does that work
because then I can just have everybody
on gmail and communicate with them that
so this is why I'm actually interested
and not as bored of it as dangerous hope
you get bored with something for chillin
in existing released yeah that's fair
that's fair um well don't doesn't
somebody need to go do we need to wrap
up instead of a idea everything else do
I need to book well on the party poop
before before we end the show we want to
point out that the bird has been
