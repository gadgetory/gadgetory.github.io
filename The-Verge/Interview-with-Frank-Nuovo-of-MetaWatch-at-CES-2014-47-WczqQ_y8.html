Sabbath also with average we're sitting
here with Frank do OVO who is actually
the head of design behind the new
metawatch meta formerly of virtue
smartphones which you had a long and
illustrious Scalia career there so Frank
thank you for joining us today great to
be here down plaid thanks for inviting
me it's a pleasure yeah so so here at
CES metawatch is launching a brand new
branding and design ethos and it kind of
a new identity for the company
absolutely and you had a big part of
that yes before we get to that I wanted
to talk about how you got to metawatch
maybe just briefly cover you know you
spend a long time at vertu you built the
brand you built the company there you
build lots of different smart phones and
shares head of design there Absalom and
how does that take us to where you're
bringing the SmartWatch today well in a
nutshell which is usually difficult for
me to do but i'll try it really started
back at nokia so I was chief of design
at nokia actually starting designing
phones and technology for nokia back in
89 but as chief of design at nokia we
explored and brought technology and
fashion together and it was really one
of my main missions was to take take
this in a friendly way to to the people
technology that is but the next step was
luxury so we launched ver 2 in 2002
after several years of R&amp;amp;D figuring out
how to use materials like stainless
steel and titanium and leather and
sapphire because it didn't scratch not
because it was precious but because it
didn't scratch like had been on watches
for many years previously so in 2012
some complicated things happen and ver 2
was sold and I made a decision that I
would in a very friendly way move on and
do other things and bill guys are
wonderful bill geyser the CEO of
metawatch at the time came to me and
asked if I would join and work with them
and so that's where that story started
or ended up so as an independent design
studio nuovo and myself
work with Bill to develop all aspects of
product and brand and marketing of what
is now called meta and just something
that you mentioned to us earlier it was
a part of the foundation for vertu was
about doing the ultimate irrespective of
pricing absolute it wasn't so much about
luxury and gaudy things videos about
just making the best thing you can do
with the materials they were available
so how much of that has translated to
your approach with metal now so
harkening back to traditional watch
designs and movements that are usually
on the inside I wanted to bring that to
the outside something tangible something
visible that you could see and feel and
the first thing that I do when I show
the watch is I place it on someone's
wrist and I ask how does it feel make
hey this feels great and I can talk
about that for probably 10 minutes
before we even get into the tan so I
should point out the fact that having
armatures just by itself is a great
feature precisely yes and really the
thing that you're pointing out the fact
that you're looking at a flat piece of
technology is also the thing that the
pebble steel the brand new watch there
is addressing as well they're tackling
the exact same issue the fact that the
original pebble was too long for a whole
bunch of people and they're taking the
lug to lug distance and shorting it so
what you're doing is you immediately
addressing that exact same issue with
the new model yeah and we're starting
with you can wear this whether it's an
analog watch or it's a digital
SmartWatch it doesn't really matter if
you want it on your wrist that's the
first gate to open and that's what we're
trying to do and then we can talk about
the tech so do you think we're ever
going to see a time when a meta watch
maybe as a camera or or can you talk to
it and carry on a conversation I think
it's inevitable that when the technology
doesn't compromise the experience in the
way of wearability and management then
all of that can be but if this has to
grow by twenty percent to put a camera
in it and if we go right now we have
about a week of functionality between
charges if this moves down to two days
or three days because we've
added color and and all kinds of bells
and whistles then the experience is
compromised there are other products
that people have out there wonderful
products competitors and I guess in
various different ways but we see
ourselves more as a watch plus than a
strap on phone or a computer on your
wrist I just wanted to briefly talk you
mentioned to us earlier that the design
that you've come up with for the meta
allows you to use a variety of different
materials and uniqueness to it can you
just briefly talk about how that kind of
speaks to how watches are perceived by
people it's it's more of a personal
object right it's all about creating
icons design icons or products that
people can look at from across the room
and recognize I wanted to create a new
potential icon and I say that with
respect to if it's around in 10 years
the way it is then it becomes one but
you know you aim you aspire to create SI
humbly a new icon and at least an icon
for the brand and so in creating meta
the armatures and the changeable
armatures are something that can be
varied for the next 10 years they could
be ceramic stainless steel polished
against Matt and price point wise we
could achieve you know beautifully made
plastic or and and and rubber band
combinations in various bright colors so
you could achieve so much with one form
factor this design doesn't need to
change at all for the next 10 years and
we can do a thousand different
variations so in a few months we'll be
able to get some of these on our own
wrists right actually you know as usual
with most CES products they were showing
what's next and these are just
prototypes and various aspects are
functional some aren't but we're moving
very quickly and is in the spring we're
not launching when exactly but we'll
have the line it's a Frank just as a
designer who can't let you go without
asking you a couple of extra design
questions go for the meta as far as I'm
concerned is very close to the pebble in
terms of the competition so I was
wondering what are you thoughts on the
original pebble in the new steel model
how do you feel bourbon well let me
start by saying that metawatch was
around a long time before pebble and
this is quite an interesting thing and
it's a frustration that you know bill
and dave had been working on
metawatch at fossil several years ago he
contacted me back in 2010 but it's
interesting how the word gets out today
through various channels and it becomes
oh it started with pebble that's not the
case in fact metawatch through fossil
has had this technology out there in its
earlier form it's for years so I'd have
to say that they were looking at what
Bill was doing and decided to do it
their way with respect to pebble and all
of their you know the buzz that's
happened about them it's actually
something that bill and David we're
doing it our way so we have our way of
taking all of those applications and
allowing notifications to come through
and remote controlling and all of that
but the core of this is that you know
meadow was a meta watch was around for
quite a long time and so I love the fact
that pebble is there because it creates
a marketplace and there's no fear of
competition there actually has to be a
great handshake and a hug in my view I
look forward to their designs to attract
certain people to their aesthetic we're
working on our own and it's really one
happy family we're creating a new
marketplace and actually bill is very
open guy you know when when pebble came
out he goes his words were fantastic
somebody else is in this game doing it
you know in this way and let's just all
work together and create this this
movement so we embrace it but I do want
to keep saying that bill and Dave were
out there with us for years before
pebble even decided to do was a
Kickstarter campaign wasn't it that's
right but it's amazing it got so much
attention through that it's fascinating
how things come out to today and finally
since most of your career has been spent
designing and crafting smartphones how
do you feel about the present crop of
devices that we have wow that's a broad
question I feel that there's an
interesting thing going on with
smartphones today which is usability
wearability comfort so the trend is for
these huge screen phones they're not
really that friendly for walking around
there was a sweet spot a while back
where the phones you could still fit a
phone in your coin pocket of your Levi's
and that was sort of a moment now I grew
up you know
pioneering mobile phones at Nokia and I
would always get people saying look at
this and they'd always put their phone
in their jean pocket they didn't need to
carry a holster they didn't need to put
it in which fit right there and it was
great and that was kind of a measure of
true wearability well jean pockets are
going to have to grow a little bit today
the fascinating thing for me is that
there are phones out there today and I
won't name the brand that if you drop it
it breaks period if it doesn't have a
rubber case around it it breaks when I
was chief of design at nokia if i
designed a phone and if it was dropped
from three meters and it broke the
entire program would be rejected so it's
a fascinating moment where people are
accepting of large broken glass screens
it's a fascinating thing for me and I
wonder that when design actually is
about its longevity and the fact that
you could use it and it's in balance
with this functionality but things
change very quickly so now people are
walking around a great number of them
with a crack down the middle of their
display and that was totally
unacceptable in my day people are buying
them I can't say anything negative but
it's fascinating because we couldn't get
away with that oh the mail that would
come through if you drop the Nokia and
it broke back in time so I can get away
with that with a method no absolutely
not so what you see with meta is a
responsible package we're creating again
something made from very strong
materials whether it's glass or whether
it's gorilla glass or sapphire that's
all a price point thing but in any case
we want to make something which is
robust something which is reliable and
something that's beautiful it's
something that feels good on the wrist
before it even steps into the whole
wonderful advantages of the features of
forwarding and all the things that it
can do great so Frank we want to thank
you for joining us today thank you guys
are a lot of great insights and Johnson
and we're happy to have you here anytime</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
