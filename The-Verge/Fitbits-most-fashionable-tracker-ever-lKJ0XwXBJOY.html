and here at the verge today that Hawk
pup fitbit's newest products the Ulta
Tippett is billing this as their most
fashionable tracker ever at $130 it
comes in the mid of the Fitbit product
range and it includes silver and gold
options here as well as leather sport
and rush metal bands more or less it
does exactly what you'd expect a fitness
tracker to do at this point in time
contracept concert sleep the big push
that they're making is the fact that it
has an automatic exercise recognizer so
that if you are on the elliptical or if
you're running or if you're
cross-training it should know what
you're doing if you're doing that
activity for 15 minutes or longer the
other big push is reminders to move
which again is something that we've seen
in other fitness trackers and isn't the
most groundbreaking I really like how
slim this is I wish it wasn't quite as
tall here but I also do really like the
way that it closes we're seeing kind of
this trend of activity trackers sort of
closing a little bit more like jewelry
and I think that they actually did a
really nice job with this depending on
your band choice these guys start at 130
you can pre-order them now they ship in
the US in March and international
beginning April so that's the Fitbit
Alta for more information check out the
