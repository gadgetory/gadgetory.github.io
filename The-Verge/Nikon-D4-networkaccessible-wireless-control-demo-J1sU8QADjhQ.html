required in decreasing live you can
shoot photos and focus demo everything
for us right now Second Life sure
showing you how you can connect to the
camera we're using a d4 with the
Ethernet connector which is built into
the camera allows us to do a number of
things everything from empty please to
Direct Connect and what's called an HTTP
mode basically the camera has a built-in
web server which allows you to basically
browse the camera by if I actually have
the best thing about the Nikon said
they're very customizable so in the case
of this I can press my function button
and bring up the network settings which
shows the IP to camera speed Emil
this also works disable the TT violence
working with the access point so I come
into the computer here and I type in the
IP and I can tell the camera to serve up
a username password in this case I'm
putting the unity password
and it serves up a webpage the webpage
is basically if you're familiar with
camera control Pro which allows you to
control the camera over a specific
software over USB now we can do that
over here for that and do it with a web
browser so I'm browsing the cameras card
we're not receiving the images into the
computer these are the thumbnails and
fed to the camera I'll flip from the
camera to the computer so I can use my
thumbnails and a number of arrangements
I have where we can look at the pictures
we took earlier here at CES I have a
filmstrip moves mode where I can
actually feed up my pictures I can look
at the individual photos as a large
preview as well and this is really good
for people who want to do a live shoot
someone could come back to the some male
view another cool feature is if I go
back into the browser here I have the
shooting viewer mode I go to shooter
viewer mode now I could embed the
cameras information that field
in the camera this play now is also good
here everything from my controls from
exposure shutter priority after birdie
the program is here and I can change my
focus points on the fly
I can change my mode business I can
change if I want to shoot the DX mode or
any of the other modes I could do that I
can go into live view which I can then
see what the camera sees over the
Ethernet if you have a fast Network this
is great because the camera could be any
number of places or if you're in a large
studio you don't have to be at the
limits of USB which is shorter cable to
medium I can not only take a picture in
live view but if I put the camera in the
movie mode when the camera flips over to
the movie mode now I'm into I get the 16
by 9 crop factor and I can now have all
my videos and movie modes as well
including a record once I start chord
notice I get a report bike there I have
a green light on the camera indicating
that it's got some activity right into
the card and once I stop recording that
stops camera remotely and I not have
them so a lot of great things that you
can do it's very exciting and a law
degree
that's demonstration of a network para
syncing for the d4 and I believe this
technology will be coming to the iPad as
well you'll need to have to do that and
you can adjust to your web browser we
would have the IP address and do this to
your iPhone iPad so I made with the
verge mark icon this is the deform</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
