when you think about a Honda it's the
car that you drive for a million miles
it's study it's sure frankly it's kind
of boring and then sex was sort of like
this golden moment where Acura was like
the car that was worthy of a bedroom
poster so here we are 25 years later
with this new NSX and it's kind of
showing that a cure is still interested
in being in the luxury performance
sports car game and that's exciting for
people who love cars because it means
that you can experiment with them
sustainability and electric motors
technical performance
and still push the limits zero to 60 in
three seconds 192 miles per hour top
speed I mean that's a track car worth
its salt but it's also car that has an
electric engine which essentially you
know it's just hybrid so this is a car
that you can take to the track and then
you can do a quick change and go to work
you can kind of like thrash on this car
without feeling like you just like flood
in the environment with leaded fuel I
mean what we have here is 21 miles per
gallon part of that is the electric
motor at work part of that is just
really maximizing the capabilities of a
v6 engine
it's a car that makes me think about the
possibilities of what's coming and I
think that yes there's still some few
tweaks that Acura needs to work out as
far as you know just really giving us
the feedback that we want from the road
however this car can go toe-to-toe with
an re it can go toe-to-toe with it for
58 Ferraris have the romance of Italy
but what this has is you know this is
sort of like Acura
saying I'm still like I've still got
guts and I'm still a sports car and I'm
still capable of producing great
engineering and great performance and
choosing some new technologies that are
out there and available it's fishing
it's pushing supercars in a new
direction I think we need to see I mean
when you hear them talk about torque
vectoring and stability and even you
know and there are a lot of fun things
that you know like launch control on
this car driving this car is way more
fun
than being in an autonomous car and
sitting in the backseat this is what
it's about it's about getting the feel
from the road getting the response and
being out on a beautiful spring day
driving for fun
hell yeah right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
