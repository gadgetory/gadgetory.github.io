looking at the new Dell XPS 12 so at
first glance looks like you saw 12 inch
laptop it's actually a two-in-one
so you can just literally pull it off
and it turns into a tablet and talking
about the keyboard and mouse and it's a
full chiclet keyboard it's quite nice
actually to type on and which you don't
usually see with this sort of like
12-inch device you also got precision
trackpad there as well and in terms of
like ports and the specs and stuff Dells
on a kind of interesting thing here so
unlike like the Apple 12-inch MacBook
you've got two USB type-c on here so you
can charge and you can also attach an
accessory and also chuck in an SD card
there as well but that's pretty much it
in terms of ports and it kind of goes
back on on the base and there's no
additional ports on the base of here
either
I guess the most interesting part of
this is obviously the hinge here but
it's not it's not really a hinge like
you're not going to get any
adjustability here and set one set angle
which is kind of that's going to be kind
of irritating for a lot of people I
think and but it in terms of like
closing it like in the style of a laptop
you literally just put it down like that
and it doesn't it feels a little bit
shaky and flimsy almost like feels like
I don't know what I'm doing is it going
to go into place in terms of the
processor inside Dell was using an Intel
Core M 5 processor and so it's not
obviously not I 5 performance but it
does feel pretty good in this particular
model I've noticed too much lag it's
pretty speedy to go around and it seems
ok so it'll be available starting in
November and from $999 but you can also
go for a 4k option so you spend a few
more dollars in there and that was a
quick look at the Dell XPS 12</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
