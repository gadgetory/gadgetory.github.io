talked a lot about the future of
computers but honestly most of the time
I just end up going back to my Mac or a
Windows PC and I do that because you can
really customize the way that the
operating system works but here's a
question why would anybody bother doing
that in the first place so the reason I
like customizing my computers and I know
that this makes me sound really really
corny is that it makes me feel like I
have superpowers if there's something
that annoys me about the way that my
computer works I can just go out on the
Internet and somebody else is inevitably
annoyed by the same thing and there's
usually a utility that I can download it
install that fixes that annoyance and
I'm talking specifically here about
utilities and not app so I'm not talking
about stuff like one password which I
love and you should go and install or
even Dropbox which I also love it's my
favorite cloud utility app now I'm
talking about utilities things that
change the way your computer actually
works that kind of a deep level and so
in this video I want to talk about my
favorite Mac utilities we'll do windows
in another video later on so let's get
into it so one utility that basically
everybody who has a Mac tends to install
when they get into this thing is a
window manager and there's a million of
these but my favorite is called flexi
glass and it does all the standard stuff
that a window manager does so you can
hit a key combo to move your one or the
left or the right or fullscreen it or
whatever but the reason I like it if we
look at the preferences for it you can
see that it has this thing called a
window mover and what lets you do is you
can hold down buttons on your keyboard
to adjust the placement of your windows
so let me explain normally if you want
to resize or move your window you've got
to move your mouse to a specific point
like down here in the corner and it's
really hard to hit but with the window
mover you can just have your mouse
anywhere in the window hold down a key
combo and you can start moving your
window around or another key combo and
resize your window and so for 9.99 which
is the cost of flexi glass it gives you
a way faster way to move around or
adjust your windows on your Mac another
utility I really like especially if
you're on the latest update of the Mac
operating system heis here which you
really should be is it's got a weird
name actually
look it up here it's high sierra media
key enabler this is a free utility and
it puts a little dot in your menu bar
and what it does is it makes your play
pause next previous buttons on your
function bar actually work so normally
if you hit that it might start itunes or
it might pause video and safari you
never really know but with high sierra
media key enabler you can set it to
prioritize spotify so when you hit that
play pause button it's just gonna send
that command to spotify and it will
always work another utility that a bunch
of people install is a screen shot
utility now i know that you can hit
shift command 4 on a mac and it'll
record a screen shot but I use this app
called annotate it was recently acquired
by cloud app but it's still free and
when I hit shift command 4 take a
screenshot I can then draw on it I can
put a little arrows on it I can put some
text on it I can even like blur out
certain section of it and then when it's
done I can just hit the Twitter button
to tweet it I can save it or I can even
hold down the option key and drag it
directly to another app if I just want
to put it directly into another app it's
way more convenient than the built-in
screenshot utility and I really
recommend if you don't use annotate at
least some kind of screenshot utility so
the next utility you want to talk about
is when I've talked a ton about it's
called Alfred and I've made a whole
other video about it it's basically a
better version of spotlight you can hit
a key combo and when you do a search box
pops up and it's better at internet
stuff than spotlight is and you can even
do stuff like clipboard history and
snippets of text and all kinds of
customizations but the tool that I use
with Alfred is just as important it's
called carabiner elements which is a
funny little tool and it lets you assign
a button on your keyboard to something
else so for me I've assigned caps lock
to the f16 key because if I want to shut
on the internet I'm gonna hold down the
shift key like I really mean it
so instead when I hit the caps lock key
it pops up my Alfred search box and then
I can search for something on the verge
really fast and that's great now for
Alfred to get the most out of it you got
to pay 19 pounds for the app but
carabiner elements which remaps your
buttons is free now this utility is the
sadist nerdiest thing because it
literally saves you like one click but I
still love it it's called tooth fairy
and here's how it works in your menu bar
puts a little icon
shows you whether or not you're
connected to Bluetooth headphones so
these are my beats X headphones and
they're currently paired to my iPhone I
want to listen to on my Mac so a tooth
fairy I just click this button and then
it will connect up to my Bluetooth
headphones and it'll even turn dark to
show me that I am connected to my
Bluetooth headphones and you can set it
up for multiple pairs of headphones now
I know it just saves you one click but
that click makes a big difference to me
okay so last utility you may have
noticed that I've got a million menu bar
icons and it looks there's a couple of
utilities that let you hide most of them
the one that I like is called the
vanilla and it's really simple it just
puts a little caret in your menu bar and
you can just tap it and it hides all of
your icons and then you can just hold
down the command key to drag icons in or
out of the hidden section it just makes
your computer feel more comfortable it's
nice so those are my favorite utilities
for the Mac and I've talked about this a
lot but I really do think that being
able to customize your computer makes a
huge difference it makes it feel like
it's yours and not just thing that got
handed down to you if you're using an
iPad or a Chromebook if there's
something that you don't like you
basically just have to deal with it but
with a manic or with a Windows PC if
there's something you don't like you can
change it and most of the time I prefer
the platform that you can change hey
everybody thank you so much for watching
and I want to know what your favorite
utilities are cuz I'm always on the
lookout for new ones basically all the
time because I'm an obsessive nerd and
while you're down there leaving a
comment you could also hit that
subscribe button it really helps us out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
