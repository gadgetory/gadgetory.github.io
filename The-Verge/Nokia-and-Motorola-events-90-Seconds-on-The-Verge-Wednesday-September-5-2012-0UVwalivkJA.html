flagship Lumia 920 has a 4.5 inch curved
display NFC wireless charging and an 8.7
megapixel quote PureView camera it's not

the company also showed off its
mid-range Lumia 820 which Nix is the
PureView branded camera yet 20 also
includes a slightly smaller 4.3 inch
screen and interchangeable back covers

carrier availability or pricing
microsoft itself made a cameo during
today's event to shelf its new windows

clever third-party apps our favorite of

lineup the company's new hero phone is a
droid razr HD and updates of the
original droid razr with us 4.7 inch

similarly is that with a bigger battery
all models run outta cream sandwich for
motorola promises they will have jelly
bean by the end of the year in fact if
your 2011 moto device does not get
upgraded this year the company says it
will give you a hundred dollar credit to
buy a new one a motorola phone and of
course sorry no galaxy s4 and that's it
