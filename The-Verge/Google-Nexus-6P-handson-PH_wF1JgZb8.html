The Verge and we're going hands on with
the new Nexus 6p smartphone this is
Google's newest flagship Nexus phone as
you can see it looks pretty different
from last year's Nexus 6
last year's Nexus 6 was made in
partnership with Motorola had a very
different builds had a six inch display
this one is made in partnership with
Chinese phone maker Huawei it is no
longer plastic and if you look at the
back you can actually see the back is
very different last year's phone sort of
had a like bubble back or as I like to
say school and battery back and was made
of plastic this one is much more sleek
it's all metal anodized aluminum really
nice build feels a lot like a premium
phone it's also 7.3 millimeters thin
which means it's thinner than last
year's model and weighs about 10 grams
less it has a wqhd AMOLED display it's a
really nice bright display and it's
actually 5.7 inches compared with the
6-inch display from last year it's got
USB type-c charging which is pretty much
expected it also has a fingerprint
sensor on the back so you can unlock the
phone with your fingerprint but also
other apps third-party apps will be able
to use this as well another difference
between this phone and last year's Nexus
6 is this one has a 30 450 milliamp
battery I think that combined with a new
DOS feature and marshmallow Android are
likely to give you some pretty long
battery life so even though this thing
supports super fast charging you may not
have to use it all that much because
you'll get longer battery life with it
we're not gonna be able to tell you
exactly how good it is until we're able
to try it for an extended period of time
but still worth noting I think the most
significant update to this phone is its
cameras it has an 8 megapixel
front-facing camera it has a 12 point
three megapixel rear camera it's got a
new Sony sensor and Google says that
this sensor is supposed to let in 90%
more light than the sensor in last
year's phone basically it's supposed to
be pretty great for low-light settings
now it does sort of physically take up a
lot of space up here and you can see it
kind of protrudes from the back which
some people might find a little bit
unsightly but hey at the end of the day
take some really great photos maybe you
won't actually care as much so that's a
quick hands-on with the new Nexus 6p
smartphone it goes on sale for pre-order
today starts at $4.99 for a 32 gigabyte
phone goes up to 649 for a 128 gigabyte
model that means it starts at less than
the price of last year's six hundred and
forty nine dollar next to six and you've
got quite a nice phone here so stay
tuned for more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
