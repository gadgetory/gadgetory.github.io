it's the pixel three and the pixel three
Excel these might be the most leaked
phones in history but nothing can
replace actually using the things for a
week which I have and I can tell you
right up front that they're great and
they resolve a lot of the small
complaints that people have had about
the pixel - there's a lot to talk about
here there's two sizes a camera that has
to live up to last year's pixel -
there's a big notch on the pixel three
either screens there's where I was
charging and there's price what feels
like a pretty small update compared to
last year there's a surprising amount of
stuff to get into so let's get into it
first I want to talk about what might be
the most important improvement on the
pixel three the one that's gonna have
the biggest impact on your daily
experience with it and that is the
screen the screen on both the pixel 3
and the pixel 3 XL are massive
improvements over last year's phones
we're still looking at oh let's hear but
they're bigger on both phones and simply
the biggest most important change is the
color quality and the brightness
especially on the pixel 3xl last year's
pixel 2xl felt like you were looking at
colors through like parchment paper but
that problem is 100% gone now the screen
is brighter the Reds are redder and
everything just pops more it's not
Samsung levels of color saturation or
iPhone tennis levels of brightness and
contrast but it's finally where it
should be for a phone that can cost as
much as $1000 the smaller pixel 3 it
also has a great screen but it's not as
dramatic and improvement since the
smaller pixel - it wasn't so bad
then there's the notch on the pixel 3xl
yes it's big like super big and because
it's so tall it makes the whole screen
look sort of doofy do fear that it looks
on the iPhone 10 and it also it looks
like a face okay I'm sorry I'm not
really gonna make you have this thing on
the video but I will tell you that it
does sort of go away when you use the
phone and it does look much less
annoying in person than it does in
photos but anyway the game the whole
game here is just this did Google
justify the notch
with the features that you get for it so
let's just go through what you get first
you get more screen but that doesn't
necessarily mean that you get more
information in fact if you look at the
status bar you'll see that you have to
turn off the battery percentage in order
to see all the status icons and with the
time on the other side you can only see
two notification icons second
front-facing speakers Google really
really believes in stereo front-facing
speakers two speakers means that this
phone also has a pretty big chin and
it's generally not very symmetrical
which I don't like now google claims
that its speakers are 40% louder this
year and I don't know that they're 40%
louder but I will say that they're 40%
better there's much less distortion at
high volume third you get a wide-angle
selfie camera yes look don't worry we're
gonna talk a lot more about cameras
later but my basic attitude about that
wide-angle camera is kind of shrug so
did Google justify the knotch sorta face
ID to me seems like a much better
justification but after using the pixel
3xl for just a little bit I didn't
notice the notch too much and I really
don't think it's a reason to not get the
big phone if you want the big phone
because once again the screen on these
phones are great this year the build
quality and just overall feel of the
pixel is just really top-notch I mean
okay it's really good
switching the back to glass gives you
wireless charging sure but it also just
makes the whole thing feel more refined
the seams around the aluminum rail are
minimal and the rear glass has its
etched matte finish that just feels
awesome
although the glass does make it feel a
tad heavier I've set a lot of nice
things about this matte glass but there
is one very serious problem stick this
thing in your pocket with keys and it's
gonna get discussed if not scratched
right away it happened to two of our
phones we weren't rubbing the keys or
anything it just happened you are
absolutely going to need a case with
this thing there are a ton of other just
really nice subtle touches like the
haptics they're way better now it's not
quite as good as the iPhone but the
vibration is a lot subtler instead of
feeling like you've got a hand buzzer or
something now in terms of overall
hardware quality the pixel three the
small one is a bigger change it's
finally really great now instead of
feeling like the cheap little
stepbrother to the larger pixel neither
model is
quite is nice to say a galaxy s 9 but at
least Google's in the ballpark now and
yes there is no headphone jack and even
though that's the way things go now I
still think it's a pain but the good
news is Google's finally including USB
headphones in the box heck they even
work with the USB ports on my Mac
wouldn't it be nice if everything was
USB see ok you know we can't go there
that's a whole other video let's move on
because I know what you've really been
waiting for you've been waiting to hear
about the camera let's do it the first
thing to know is that when it comes to
hardware specs Google didn't
significantly change the equation on the
rear camera it's still a 12 point two
megapixel sensor and there's still just
one of them honestly it's pretty much
the same as last year but that doesn't
mean that the pictures are the same
Google's made a bunch of software
updates to improve how the photos come
out Google still doing its hdr+ thing or
it takes a bunch of photos and then
computationally combined them into a
single better image but over the past
year the company's just gotten better at
it and better at using the dedicated
pixel visual core image processing chip
and it's using all those images to
create a whole bunch of new camera
features here's the thing we've seen
lots of companies announced lots of
weird camera features for smartphones
and almost all of them end up being
gimmicks that you just try once and then
you ignore forever after so the big
question for the pixel is whether these
new features are just gimmicks or if
there'll be something you'll actually
use top shot it uses machine learning to
detect blinks and bad photos and will
suggest better ones from your bursts or
you can choose one later if you want to
it works pretty well in my testing and
even though we've seen this feature on
other cameras before I think Google does
a better job of recognizing good shots
motion autofocus it works super well and
both photo and video attracts your
subject and keeps the focus on them we
didn't shoot a ton of video but I will
say as far as video goes I do think the
new stereo mics are better now than that
awful mic that was on the pixel 2 next
is super resume from a technical
perspective it's wild Google uses your
handshake to grab extra data when you're
zoomed in they claim you don't even need
a telephoto lens and I don't think it's
quite as good as a proper telephoto lens
it's
better than the digital zoom in the
pixel - for sure but it will get you
something usable where before it was
garbage and usable doesn't mean great
another feature is called night sight
and it seems technically impressive
creating photos in the dark that you'd
never get otherwise but we can't test it
until it comes out later this year
though there's all the stuff that I
think is kind of in that gimmick zone
photo booth is basically a party game
you turn the mode on and then you and
your friends watch a progress bar expand
and depending on whether you're smiling
it will take a picture playground is
just more er stickers and then there's
google lens it is super cool to copy
text directly out of an image but I do
not plan on doing my shopping by
pointing my camera things and then
lastly the one everyone's excited about
is a group selfie feature well it does
let you get more people into a selfie
when you zoom out but you also have with
a bunch of weird distortion from the
wide-angle lens and that's unavoidable
but for me I think this is just another
for fun feature some of these features
you're gonna use and some you won't but
a lot of them are just built in and set
up being in special modes so I think
most of these count as improvements that
really will matter to you but the real
question the obvious question are the
photos better than they were on the
pixel - which had already beaten the
iPhone 10s my answer is yes but that
they also have a different style what do
I mean well it's easiest to look at some
photos so here's three photos all lined
up what do we see here
first we see the pixel three is doing a
better job than the pixel two of getting
detail out of the shadows but you can
also see that the colors are a little
bit warmer now compared to the iPhone
10s it does feel to me a little bit more
true to life where the iPhone is just
doing everything that I can to light
everything evenly in a way that feels
kind of overdone here's another
comparison from the selfie cam the pixel
3 again has much more detail and the
iPhone 10s really does look a little bit
over smooth and the pixel - it's right
smack in the middle lasts here's
portrait mode and I think all three look
pretty good but you can see that the
pixel 3 is more willing to brighten up
the shadows and soften the highlights in
the pixel - but not nearly as much as
the iPhone I prefer the pixel 3 again
because the iPhone I think it makes my
face a little bit too soft but I will
say that the iPhone 10 asks does a
better job in tricky portrait situations
because it has that second lens the
pixel 3 just straight up duffed it on
this photo bottom line for most shots
the pixel 3 is consistent it screws up
less often than the pixel 2 or the
iPhone 10s on any given photo you might
prefer one or the other but on the whole
I think the pixel 3 has more restrained
HDR and better looking photos than the
iPhone 10s most of all I trust the pixel
3 more the pixel 2 was the best camera
for all of last year and it seems like
the pixel 3 is going to be the best
camera for all of this year all right
specs the pixel 3 is pretty standard for
high-end Android phones it's got a
snapdragon 845 4 gigs of ram and 64 or
128 gigs of storage all the usual stuff
but the reason pixel phones are
generally better isn't about the specs
it's about the software and I think
Google's done a good job of optimizing
here so far as I can tell everything
feels fast and smooth and I haven't
detected any real lag to speak of
battery life though it's pretty
middle-of-the-road you'll get through a
day with either phone but the big one
should last a little bit longer there's
really no major improvements here in
other words but you do get wireless
charging now and I I love that it's a
little thing but for me it's so much
more convenient than plugging in the
pixel 3 also ships with the digital well
being software which helps you track
your smartphone usage and it has helped
me cut down on Twitter a little bit but
mostly I just like that you can get a
quick setting right in your settings to
turn the whole screen grayscale whenever
you want which is kind of weirdly
soothing but the coolest new software
thing is this new call screening feature
it has a duplex robot answer your calls
for you and speak for you and then you
can read a live transcription of what's
being said on your phone so that you can
see if it's a spam call and really I am
totally impressed with how well it works
hi the person you're calling is using a
screening service from Google and will
get a copy of this conversation go ahead
and say why you're calling hey dieter
it's new I I'm calling because I want to
talk to you do you need to get a hold of
them urgently yes
just so it's clear go ahead and say more
about why you're calling it's because
I'm you I your your friend and your
colleague and I'd like to talk to you
they can't talk right now but they'll
give you a call later Thanks thanks
robot and goodbye if you're worried
about privacy you should know that all
this happens locally on the phone and
none of the transcripts are stored or
sent to Google at any point just you
know what don't use it on people you
actually know because that's actually
kind of a jerk move here's what I think
Google did with the pixel 3 it made a
list of everything that people are
unhappy with on both the pixel 2 and the
pixel 2 XL and then it tried to fix them
the cameras less crunchy the screens are
way better the bezels are smaller and
yes there is a notch but still the
hardware overall is dramatically better
that's why I think this year's pixels
are kind of like the iPhone s your
upgrades they seem like small on
exciting improvements but they make for
a way better phone than anybody will
give them credit for these are simply
great phones if I have one major
complaint about the pixel 3 it's the
price it starts at $7.99 for the base
pixel 3 and the top tier top storage
pixel 3 XL is a thousand bucks are they
worth that much well yes their top tier
phones with great cameras and specs and
build quality but you can get a lot of
what these phones offer for way less in
the Android world now should you upgrade
well that depends on what you have now
if you have a pixel - a lot of these
features will come to you via software
update and if you have an iphone well
take a long look at your blue bubbles
and your iCloud photo groups and have a
think about how important they are here
but if you want the best Android
experience and the best camera you can
get on a phone today the pixel 3 is in
thank you so much for watching really
appreciate it I had a lot of things to
say about the pixel 3 let me know in the
comments are you thinking about getting
a pixel 3 and what's gonna make your
decision for you and also Google
announced a few other things and we have
a really great hands-on with the chrome
OS pixel slate tablet so you should
check that out too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
