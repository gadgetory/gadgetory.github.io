photos which is a new version of what
was Google+ photos but now it's its own
app it's devoid of your Google+ account
so don't worry about that
it's not something you have to sign up
for to get into photos you can just go
straight into the app it's actually
really nice I've really enjoyed using it
so far and if you can look at it looks
on the surface pretty much like the old
Google photos which was buried inside at
Google Plus Google is offering free
unlimited storage for a compressed
version of the photos you upload and for
the most part they actually do look
pretty great on the phone but if you are
someone who is interested in keeping
your photos at full resolution you can
store them at the original file size
using Google Drive so beyond just being
able to scroll through all the photos
you've ever taken in a timeline view
you're actually able to search through
your photos in a pretty simplistic way
they've organized into people places and
things and I've done no tagging for
Enya's photos it's went through and
realized that this faces my niece and
what's really great is I can take a
photo I took forever like last weekend
and I can actually go all the way back
to when she was like just born and we
were taking photos of her it's pretty
amazing it's probably my favorite
feature of it but it's definitely not
perfect like this is my wife and two
different versions beyond faces it has
places that are pulled from both
geo-tagging and site recognition like if
I search for images of Big Ben from my
trip to London it'll actually pull up
all the photos I took of that Monument
while I was there which is pretty crazy
since I don't have any these are which
is pretty crazy since this is stuff I
shot with my 5d and has no metadata
saying where or what it is it's purely
looking at the photo and knowing that
that is Big Ben
so it's organized all the people in my
life into these squares that I can go
I can find and it's pretty amazing
actually how detailed it can get this is
one of our blow of code workers here
Jimmy and like even in this photo they
can tell that that is him which is like
again really crazy and like really fun
that like and that's a tagging I have to
do any of this thing to this photo so
beyond the photos there's two other
panels one is your assistant this is
where you can track if you are uploading
photos and when they're gonna be done
but it also does a cool thing of
bringing up little notifications that
it's added new things to your library
one such thing as an animation where it
takes a series of images that I shot and
stitches them together into an animated
gif which I can save and add to my
library and sharing this out is actually
really easy too there's a share button
down here I can send it to messages or
my email save it to my photos even but
also I can just hit down here and hit a
link and this will generate and a link
to my clipboard and I can just copy that
link and send it to anyone and then I
can just take that link and give it to
anyone whether they have Google photos
or not and the other panel is the
collection this is where things that it
will make gets stored so any videos that
it's created which is a thing it can do
will live here and you can play them to
actually create your own collections say
I want to create a collage of different
photos actually a really nice feature is
that I can tap once then I can tap and
hold and then drag for a couple photos
add a photo in there and create and
it'll actually generate a simple collage
of photos from my wife and I going
go-kart racing last weekend so that's
cool of photos I gotta say as someone
who takes a lot of photos with their
phone and with a DSLR it's really great
to know that there's now kind of a
solution that is free and really simple
to get into</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
