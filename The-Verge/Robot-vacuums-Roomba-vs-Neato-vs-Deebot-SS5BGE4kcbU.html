schmutz goobers of unknown provenance as
the father of two boys under the age of
three I face the Sisyphus Ian's task of
tidying a home which I know just 12
hours later will be a riotous mess once
again and over time I've started to cut
corners I give my apartment a surface
clean while deep below a dusty grime
accumulates to wage this kind of war you
need soldiers that won't tire that in
the face of a never-ending onslaught of
new filth will simply suit up and clean
I needed to help her that knew no fear
enter the robotic vacuum cleaner there's
an overwhelming variety of robotic
vacuum cleaners on the market some are
specialized for mopping the floor others
for getting rid of dog hair for this
story we looked at the newest offerings
from the biggest brands with basic
cleaning capabilities a Roomba addi bot
and a neato let's start with the D bot
35 it's cheap under 200 bucks but it
can't see the world around it it relies
on touch bouncing off objects and
adjusting accordingly using it is a
supremely frustrating experience the D
bot goes over the same areas multiple
times takes extremely inefficient route
and gets stuck on pretty much everything
when you jump up to the neato which
retails for around 700 bucks the
difference is clear
it still bumps off things and moved
around but far less often uses laser
scanning to map the space around it and
then sweeps the floor and smart
methodical patterns it even circles
around tricky areas like couch legs it
did miss corners and struggle to find
its way back to the charging station but
at a basic level it got the job done the
next step up is the Roomba 980 the most
expensive and sophisticated unit we
tested it has a camera and floor sensor
to track its location and avoid
obstacles I found that it was incredibly
good at navigating my home and working
its way into nooks and crannies and when
it needed a charge the 980 was able to
work its way back to the dock and
connect all of these units had one major
problem which was that in a house as
messy as mine they filled up their trays
after just a rumor - you know the Neto
was doing great it went under the couch
and then it sounded like I don't know
maybe it got caught up in a little
something just you know your typical
sort of hospital casualty when you got a
couple two-year-olds around we will keep
using this toothbrush that'll wash right
off now they all promise to have the
power and capacity to clean an entire
apartment but to make that happen
you need to religiously run them every
day keeping the overall level of dirt
down to a manageable level
luckily the newest Nita and Roomba we
tested are now Wi-Fi enabled and could
be remotely controlled by an app that
makes it far easier to program and pull
off routine cleaning set a schedule and
just let the robot run once a day or if
you prefer start it when you remember
either in person or just with a few taps
on your phone in the end I found the
Roomba 980 was clearly the best robotic
vacuum cleaner but it isn't necessarily
the best deal the neato connected bot
vac which is two hundred dollars cheaper
left my house nearly as clean now this
isn't meant to be a comprehensive review
so much as an introduction to the
category these are incredible gizmos and
we've never really talked about them at
the virtual forum they're getting better
every year and if you've been holding
off wondering how well they worked or if
it was worth the money let me erase your
doubts we haven't quite reached the
Jetson era miracle of a completely
autonomous robot that can clean your
whole house with the technology on the
market today especially for a busy
parent like myself is a huge asset in
the daily batter against clutter and
chaos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
