Perseid meteor shower gets underway
every August so if you look up at the
night sky tonight you'll be able to
catch one of Earth's most famous cosmic
light shows the shower is the result of
our planet getting a little too close to
some Comet dust common in question is
swift-tuttle which orbits the Sun once
every 133 years whenever swift-tuttle
swings by the inner solar system the
immense heat from the Sun causes
particles to eject from the comet these
particles create a stream of debris that
stretches across swift-tuttle
orbital path and once a year earth
crosses this debris field causing Swift
Tuttle's leftovers to slam into our
planet's atmosphere the result a bunch
of tiny lights streaking through our sky
so why do we call it the Perseid meteor
shower if this is all swift-tuttle fault
it's because these tiny meteors seem to
originate from the constellation Perseus
in any given year you can expect to see
around 60 to 80 meteors an hour when the
meteor shower is at its peak but this
year the shower may get a healthy boost
thanks to our buddy Jupiter every so
often Jupiter makes his closest approach
to Swift Tuttle's debris field and its
immense of gravitational field tugs the
particle stream closer to earth
typically our planet just skims the
debris but experts think we'll be even
closer to the particles this year that
means we could potentially see up to 200
meteors an hour according to NASA the
best time to start watching the shower
is going to be just after midnight
wherever you are you know the drill if
you want to get the best view of a light
show in the sky you're gonna need to get
away from light here on earth so city
goers like myself may want to get to a
park but if nearby light pollution is
too intense or there's too much cloud
cover you don't have to miss out
entirely you'll still be able to catch
some meteors tomorrow night and NASA
plans to broadcast the Perseids both
tonight and tomorrow on its public
Ustream channel which we've linked below
happy stargazing want to know it's like
to live among these falling stars check
out our video with NASA astronaut scott
kelly who just finished up a year in
space you think watching a meteor shower
is cool check out what it's like to
watch a rocket travel to space and then
land back on earth</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
