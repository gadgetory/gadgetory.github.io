musicians union from 1917 to 1970 the
thing about this place is that is
actually considered to be the place
where jam session got its name and were
credited for the swing Ihram jazz the
creation of the swing of jazz in America
it's the oldest jazz house in the world
it's where Charlie Parker started and
it's a group that we've been working
with for a long time trying to realize
increased connectivity better
connectivity for their neighborhood
which is really the epicenter of
historic black Kansas City Isaac told me
about this project that he was working
on with the be the black economic union
and the mutual musicians foundation
about this community owned Network
sending a wireless signal from downtown
over to here and then actually
distributing that signal to the
community the free network foundation
was incorporated in May of 2011 we don't
build and that works for people we we
teach people how to build networks
outside of going and asking a for-profit
company to to come serve them and do it
for them the free Network Foundation is
seeking to build a more secure and
private Internet infrastructure using
mesh networking the network is the
material network that that everybody
cooperates to build and it's held as a
Commons and within that network you can
go wherever you like one of those places
you might like to go is to a gateway to
the Internet you know one of the
misnomers is free as in no cost but
really free and the free network
foundation
is about freedom so it's about access
it's about agreeable Terms of Service
those type of things
finally the neutral musicians foundation
recently has decided you know we're just
gonna do this they have put in like
fifteen hundred bucks to build a tower
to bring in connectivity into their
neighborhood and start to build the
Internet within the community is
perceived to be something well since we
can't afford it we won't worry about it
at home it's not available where it
should be it is such a deep cut in the
pocket of a single person a single
headed household in an urban community
that it is considered to be a luxury
when everybody else sees it as a
necessity finally this week after months
of secrecy google has finally announced
that it's big Google Fiber project will
be launching in Kansas City good morning
Kansas City Google Fiber starts with
internet speeds up to a gigabit a second
point here are three packages hopefully
you're excited about at least one of
them we're gonna deploy our network
wherever there's enough interest and
we're gonna build sooner in areas where
there's most interest you know exactly
where you stand and how many more
households you need to go rally when you
participate in the rally not only are
you bringing fiber to your home you're
bringing fiber to Kansas Citians that
you care about so let's do this for
Kansas City
for Kansas City for Kansas City
let's do this for kansas city when they
came into the community there was a lot
of excitement yay we're gonna but then
when the criteria came down we know that
this wasn't us
we knew that whoever said on the table
and said we're gonna put the little
rabbit in front of your face and
everything and everybody's gonna love it
in the billboards gonna be all I know
they did after we got the message we got
the message this is not for you
everybody I've ever met from Google has
been of pure intention and pure heart
and wants to do right and thinks they're
doing right and in some ways is doing
right the problem with with Google is
that they are a monolith right they're
gigantic
I can relate to Google's lack of
understanding of the issues that are
faced with in our community here in
Kansas City you know it's almost like
two state line you know there's there's
a state line between KCK and KC MO and
then there's this economic line
represented by Troost five blocks that
way they're talking about a thousand up
a thousand down in this community we're
talking about just getting people online
let's examine why we're prioritizing
ultra ultra ultra fast access to servers
that can't even respond at the speed
that that are connected to them over
getting the 25 percent of our city that
has no access whatsoever online why is
that our priority
I don't think we knew the magnitude of
you know how much we were gonna have to
be out there in people's neighborhoods
talking to them about it in order to get
them to sign up there's not an early
adapters all the time it's people who
sometimes don't even understand the
value of the web the technology needs to
be presented in a cultural fashion and
it needs to be understood that this is
something that is going to perpetuate
the community the thoughts and virtual
opportunities for the community because
that's how we still link would you
rather rent your home and then the
landlord has to do the maintenance the
landlord has to pay the taxes the
landlord has to do that but you don't
own it you don't have any equity would
you rather own your own home and and
that's the basic decision is are we
gonna do for ourselves or are we gonna
let somebody else do and pay them for it
for a community network to survive it
needs to be sustainable so by the time
we've built this first network they'll
have the assets to do it again to grow
this network further east
further north further south and and
crucially have the the job skills to
support it and then potentially be paid
to do it for other communities let's say
the biggest message is empowering the
community to support itself right before
I moved back to Kansas City I went to
speak to a class of graduate students at
NYU's ITP program and describe the
architecture they were fairly technical
they caught on very quickly and then
they asked a question that a lot of
technician to ask okay well how are you
gonna interconnect the cities right you
have this architecture for cities but
how you gonna connect them who said
space balloons we're gonna launch
balloons into the stratosphere and
they're gonna have a microwave equipment
on them we've investigated it we we know
the law we know what we need to do it's
just a matter of time and more or less
we were last out of the room and then
google announces it and Gizmodo goes
nuts you know to give everyone the
Internet but then it is to give some
people I worry that people in general
you know they don't want to imagine
alternative possibilities alternative
worlds they want to let the monoliths of
this world do their imagining for them
and that for me is very sad and very
very challenging when I think about it
so try not to think about it it feels
like an experiment you know they're
coming to town they're offering these
services they're there they're
understanding they need to educate the
community as to what they're offering as
well ultimately they're finding a very
different culture here then maybe what
they're supposed to out what
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
