Matt MacRay the CTO visio we're here at
CES 2014 obviously you guys have a lot
of TVs here desert TV company okay
yeah so you've got your first 4k
displays here you're gonna sell I saw
some last year where they were kind of
prototypes yeah why is the time to sell
4k displays now well we waited a little
bit for a few reasons
so what you see here is we have our P
series when our reference series we
decided to wait until a lot of the
standards and security and some of the
codecs and things for UHD video were set
we also waited because the panels that
were available at the beginning of the
UHD honestly weren't very good and the
panel's you see here actually very very
high quality they're all second third
generation UHD panels in the case of the
reference series they're actually custom
Physiol that we've developed internally
we wanted the picture quality be right
it had to be a leap forward not a step
forward and we didn't want to strand any
of our users we're you know you're from
now a bunch of UHD peripherals come out
they don't work yeah or some streaming
providers start announcing new HD
streams and they don't work well that's
the big question
right so you're finally selling the TVs
it's still a big question where the
content is gonna come down and I I
couldn't tell you the answer right now
at the show right now I can help you
okay it'll add a lot of it will come
from streaming okay so we're a big
believer in streaming obviously we're
the number one smart TV platform we've
really pushed that hard you'll see at
the show at least one or two streaming
providers announced mm-hmm UHD and I can
tell you there's at least two more
they're planning within the year to
actually do you a to do and I think one
of the best things that can happen is
have streaming and be first with content
be first with UHD be first with some of
the features like high dynamic ranges
example I think you'll see streaming
first before you see it on physical
media and so as as we can lead the pack
with streaming I think people will just
start to become you know that becomes
their primary content path instead of do
people have that the bandwidth for it
what's it gonna take - yeah that's what
you TVC helps a lot right so 1080p
content today is anywhere from five to
maybe eight megabits per second UHD is
four times the content so normally you
would think it would be you know 34
almost 40 megabits per second but
because of the new compression standard
of ac/dc it's gonna be more like 12 to
15 okay so a little bump it's a bump and
I think you'll see
I can get better over time as well so
you mention high-dynamic-range yeah the
things I've seen at CES it actually
looked good I think the high dynamic
range the Adobe vision that looks really
incredible yeah what else comic 4k is
great I mean it four times a resolution
you get closest play looks amazing on
very large displays like we're showing
here it becomes almost a necessity
because the pixels would get so big on
1080p so 4k is great but what we're more
excited about is actually color fidelity
and color spectrum and high dynamic
range which really extends the amount of
color information and to us that coupled
with ultra wide color gamut that we've
implemented on our reference series is a
much bigger leap I think in picture
quality than just a straight resolution
dan and I think the TVs around here show
that it so where is that going to come
from that content going to come from
same so we're working with the studios
on the HDR stuff and so the best HDR
stuff that actually goes back and
remasters and the directors are actually
very excited because really you get an
image that's better than most movie
theatres in a way so they're gonna
remaster a lot of stuff so that's coming
but so you need a middleman streaming
service you do you will see and I don't
know if these are being announced at the
show but there will be multiple
streaming providers that are going to do
each jar and so how many star first now
I think the next blu-ray standard will
have an HDR component to it as well and
we're ready for it because we have the
first HDR compatible TVs in the world
but again going back to my other point I
think the exciting part is it'll stream
first while these new technologies will
get you over the internet before the
physical media standards actually kept
out but is that that is that the
disruptor I mean you know the question
you and I have been talking about for
years now is how do I get rid of cable
box how to get rid of input one you see
what the game console guys are trying to
do - yeah - put smart OS over at top of
that is that is its content gonna really
drive the way here is well I think
people can see it I mean that's really a
question I think so
so I would I would say is ultra high def
in the right circumstance makes a pretty
big difference the color fidelity that
we're showing in the ultra wide color
gamut HDR that's for 4k or 1080p right
that those are those are things that
make any picture are you gonna sell a
$500 1080p TV that does
eventually cuz that's like the mass
market right yeah eventually I mean I
think what we do best at Vizio is
actually trickle-down technology very
quickly so we have our reference series
that we're showing here that has all the
technologies that we could think of
we've been working two years on a clean
sheet of paper and already even though
we're announcing the reference series
for the first time here at the show
about 60% of the technology that's in
the reference series
he's already trickled down into our pcs
so you had to build a custom panel they
did so the reference series actually
features a lot of Vizio technology and I
think it'll might surprise people how
much invention that Vizio actually has
accomplished in the last two years so
it's a custom panel actually there's two
Vizio custom-designed the backlight so
we have 384 zones of local dimming which
is off-the-charts gives us those will be
black levels and very bright whites it's
800 minutes so it's one of the brightest
panels in the market which gives you
that that high dynamic range right the
almost zero iru blacks but really high
800 nit whites we have our own
processors in there so we have a v6 six
core processor running and those to do
all the apps but also picture processing
and then we have a VM 50 of the Vizio
processor back in processor that does
all the MMC and picture quality tuning
in HDR and things like that
and so the pinnacle of you reference
here is actually what we're sitting in
front of you a massive 120 inch LCD
which is looks incredible yeah tell me
about mean are you gonna sell this thing
is absolutely yeah I know no this is a
show off at CES well yeah so it's 120
yeah and it's the reference series so
it's the same as the 65 inch reference
series that's sitting behind us so it
has 384 zones
HDR you know ultra wide color gamut
everything we talked about six core
processor all that stuff but it's 120
inches and it's massive and it's one of
the best panels I think in the world
it's one of the biggest panels in the
world I think it's the biggest at the
show this year and we have every
intention of going to mass production
how much is gonna cost we don't know yet
honestly everything else we're getting a
good idea of what it's gonna cost this
TV obviously it's fully up and running
it's it's basically production ready our
issue has really around logistics and
what's something that's big we're trying
to figure out what's the most efficient
path to your living room yeah and how do
we get that with something that's big
you know what's interesting about this
this is a reference series this is the
one you're gonna judge by and then
you've got sort of your mass-market
emissaries and none of them have
anything to do with 3d no and you've
gotten rid of 3d sort of across the line
what happens it's just over we did a lot
of studies around 3d and what people are
using it for if they were and why they
were buying it why not
and we came away with the fact that we
didn't think 3d was important anymore
and we didn't think it was impact for
the users so instead of putting a
feature in people don't want pulled it
out and I think that's one thing we do
different as well we view our job as not
only listening consumers but also
curating the experience and the products
they get so instead of just throwing
everything in the kitchen sink and the
cameras and gesture and voice that
doesn't work and all this crap
into a product we actually trying to
figure out what's the best user
experience curate it down to what really
matters and in our view 3d didn't matter
all right man what's always is active
