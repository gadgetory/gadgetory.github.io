how Instagram works and it's probably
because we're confused why the apps
arranged a certain way it's like why is
one person in my feed first versus
someone else or more crucially why is my
crush always at the top of my story
viewers is it because they're stocking
my page here's what I know
Instagram has 1 billion users including
myself and the app hasn't been severe
forthcoming about how its algorithm
works the company treats it like it's
the coca-cola recipe or something even a
New York Times article mentioned the
stalker idea so how does Instagram rank
people in stories and in the app in
general does it actually show me the
people who stalk me the most we went to
Instagram to find out
that's Julian Guttman product lead for
Instagram home which includes Instagram
stories and the feed first things first
let's address this document so the
answer is people that show up on that
list are not the people that stalk you
the most it's actually based on your
activity and the people that you're
closest to all right you heard that
Instagram isn't going to show you who's
stalking you the most instead it's the
people you're interacting with so if you
go to your crush's page or even your
frenemies page all the time it's likely
they're going to show up at the top of
your story viewers I think they're off
in these kind of situations where there
are a lot of confounding factors but you
can kind of create a narrative around it
maybe based on what what what you want
to think or sort of what's interesting
do you have it's totally possible that
I'm projecting a narrative on to my
story viewers because I'm actually the
one stalking them although I have to say
I don't think I'm creeping that much so
what else am i doing in the app that
makes Instagram think I care about these
people do you visit their profile do you
like their feet post and comment on
their feet posts do to view their
stories but Julien wouldn't get specific
about how certain interactions are
weighted in the app like whether alike
is less significant than a DM or a
comment or what happens if a DM is open
but not responded to how does that
affect the algorithm even what you do
outside the app can affect your feed
like who you're connected to on
instagrams parent company Facebook even
still I sometimes have random people in
my story of viewers list that I barely
know do you check the list multiple
times if you check the list multiple
times it tries to show you a new set of
people
so trying to give you new information
every time you check the list so if
you're like me and you check your story
multiple times after you first post it
you're probably going to see new people
at the top of your viewers because
Instagram always want to have a new
experience when you open the app this
whole strategy around showing the
relevant interesting content led the
company to change its feed from
chronological to algorithmic when this
happened in 2016 Instagram said people
were missing 70% of posts in their feed
so it wanted to optimize the 30% they
did see Facebook's feed works the same
way the algorithms everywhere when that
switch happened two years ago it was
super controversial but I actually liked
it the feed works is as opposed
- most of the time my best friends post
populate at the top of my feed although
because Instagram always wants to show
me new content it sometimes refreshes
too quickly and I don't have a chance to
scroll okay so I'm starting to
understand why I see certain people in
certain places on the app even though
Julien wouldn't get super granular he's
gardening that algorithm ultimately it
comes down to self-control everything we
do on the app molds the algorithm so
maybe I shouldn't look at my random
tinder dates profile I'd rather have my
best friends the top of my feed resist
the boy click if I were to guess why
this myth exists it's probably because
deep down we know that who we look at in
stock on Instagram says a lot about our
priorities and interests I don't want to
admit that I look at my ex's profile but
Instagram knows all our secrets our
interactions don't lie I just hope the
app never actually exposes my stalking
habits hey thanks for watching if you
haven't subscribed to the verge yet you
should do that and then you should go
check out our sister site eater they
published a series called the kitchen
gadget test show which involves testing
gadgets in the kitchen what could be
better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
