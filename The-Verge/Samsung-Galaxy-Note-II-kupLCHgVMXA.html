here at Aoife 2012 in berlin and we just
taken look at the brand new galaxy note
to you from Sampson it's just been shown
to us for the very first time I've
unlocked it you heard the little water
sprinkling sound it's very much like the
Samsung Galaxy S free it's still the
same user interface is still the
naturist by a design that doesn't really
have that much an HR in it but whatever
Samsung describes the Galaxy Note 2 as
an expansion and refinement of the
galaxy s free interface and you know the
features that are introduced their
sharing features etc but as much as this
is about refining that interface and
that software this is also another speck
heavy device it has a 5.5 inch 1280 by
720 Super AMOLED display I don't know
that it's without the pen tile range
when I think in my defense I had take a
closer look as two gigabytes of ram 1.6
gigahertz quad-core processor this is a
very powerful device and extremely
snappy take a look at the silver one
here it's called Mountain grey I believe
something is actually introduced a new S
Pen here it is if it is given it a new
shape it is now wider and longer to give
me a better grip and there is now a
rubber tip at the end and over here on
the display you can see that now there's
an automatic s-pen keep or application
which pops up as soon as you pull the S
Pen out of its silo on the back of the
device so here you can start doing
things with the home screen it seems
seize the day with magic one so now it's
called a magic wand I guess her so this
is what Samsung cause a contextual
screen where you can kind of see the
variety of things that you can do with
the S Pen the S Pen is integrated with a
whole bunch of Samsung's own
applications so software on this is
Android 4.1 jelly bean the very latest
version you should be coming out in
quota for we've got hspa+ on this device
you can presume and expect that there
will be 8 LTE versions as well as I say
this is a silver / grey one it kind of
has that look that Samsung has given the
galaxy s3 with the
pattern on the back is still plastic and
we've got the white version over here
again very much like the galaxy is free
you can kind of think of this is an
expanded galaxy as free terms of size
5.5 inch display as I say with a stylus
and there's a stylus lot down here at
the bottom you get a little vibration
when you pull it out and you get this
magic wand menu over here much like the
samsung galaxy is free this is NFC
integrated as a 31 milliamp hour battery
which is massive the only other
smartphone class device that we've seen
that has this sort of a battery is the
droid razr maxx from motorola there's a
size comparison so the droid razr maxx
is y on another device with a 3000 +
milliamp hour battery and we'll just
take a look at it right here next to
google's nexus 7 produced by asus to
give you an idea of the size of this
thing like the best way think with the
Galaxy Note 2 is we took kind of that
experience that occurred with the galaxy
s3 both in terms of design and software
experience and brought that to the note
platform so you kind of got the
refinement and evolution of what we did
with the original galaxy note along with
all of those great sharing features and
the power of the galaxy s3 device so I
think thinking about it as or thinking
about it along the lines of the same
galaxy s3 it's absolutely fair because
it does feel and act a lot like that but
now you've got the further advantage of
having the s pen and the note
characteristics with that so for us I
mean we've got a number of iconic
platforms one being the Galaxy S series
of devices so galaxy s2 galaxy s3 then
we've also got the note family of
devices kind of as another flagship
platform for us so started it with the
original note kind of creating that
unique category where we took a very
powerful smartphone and integrated a lot
of great tablet functionality and so and
then if you look at kind of what we did
with the S Pen with the Galaxy Note 10.1
kind of extending that paradigm a little
bit further to content creation and a
bunch of the unique tablet functionality
and now kind of continuing to extend to
that category further with the Galaxy
Note so absolutely look at it as being a
very different device in our galaxy s3
well needs to
well the reality is what why would you
stop extending I mean I think as long as
consumers continue to look for kind of
these unique features and as the
technology continues to evolve we're
going to continue to deliver these
innovative products</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
