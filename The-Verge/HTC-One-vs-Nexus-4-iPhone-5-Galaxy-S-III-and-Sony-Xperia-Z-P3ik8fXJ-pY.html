company's new flagship phone and we're
taking a look at how it compares to some
of the best phones currently on the
market so the big thing here obviously
is the screen the one has a 4.7 inch
1080p display which at 468 pixels per
inch is as high res as we've seen on a
smartphone ever other 1080p screens
we've seen have all been larger 5 inches
like the Sony Xperia Z and similar sized
screens 4.7 or 4.8 inches have all been
720p like the galaxy s3 and the Nexus 4
so this adds a whole new level of
resolution the phone still almost the
exact same size as most of its
competition it's a little taller and
thinner than the galaxy s3 and slightly
taller than the nexus 4 but basically
it's a big phone like most Android
phones these days and that makes the
iphone 5 which is smaller and still
relatively high res feel really
different in terms of raw processing
power this is as good a phone as we've
ever seen it runs Qualcomm's latest
Snapdragon 600 processor which is a
quad-core chip that's an upgrade over
the s4 which is inside the galaxy s3 and
even over the still pretty new s4 pro
inside the Nexus 4 in the Xperia Z it's
also clocked a little faster than its
competition but that's not as important
a number in a smartphone it comes with
two gigs of RAM and either 32 or 64 gigs
of internal storage which is as higher
higher than all of its competition the
one comes with all the standard android
phone trappings it has LTE Bluetooth 4.0
and all that one definite advantage it
has is an IR blaster inside its power
button which you can use as a remote for
your TV there aren't a lot of phones
that have that HTC also talked a lot
about the camera on the one and
interestingly this is one place where
HTC kind of loses big on specs but it's
hoping that doesn't matter where as the
nexus for the iPhone 5 and the galaxy s3
all have 8 megapixel cameras and the
Xperia Z goes all the way to 13.1 the
HTC has a grand total of four megapixels
of course HTC is calling them
ultrapixels and claims that they're far
better than anything else out there but
it's really betting big on software
while the others are using more normal
camera specs generally on paper the one
looks as good as any Android phone we've
seen yet but as always with Android
phones and HTC phones in particular
we're going to have to put the battery
the software and its hardware to the
test before we decide for sure the
phones coming out around the world soon
and it'll be on Sprint AT&amp;amp;T Mobile in
the US we'll keep you posted once we get
one to test out for real
