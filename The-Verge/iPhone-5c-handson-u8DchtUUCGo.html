really keep the iPhone 5c so this is
Apple's cheaper device it's not really a
cheap device like we thought they might
do but it's cheaper it's $99 on contract
and cheaper than the iPhone 5 off
contract obviously but the big thing
here is just the way it's made it's like
the iPhone 5 in most ways even the home
button and a lot of the fit and finish
of it all but it has a totally new
plastic shell which feels a lot better
than we thought actually it's it's
really smooth and glossy and kind of
thick picks up fingerprints and
reflections but it feels good it's
really comfortable it feels not quite so
metallic and cold comes in blue which is
I think my favorite color but also red
and yellow and green and white and it's
really it's just the iPhone 5s and
colors it's hard to believe that they
didn't have colors before it's still on
the a6 it's not the newest processor but
it seems to run iOS 7 pretty smoothly
the camera looks good it's really you
know what we'd expect from the iPhone 5
which we a lot of us have been running
on iOS 7 anyway but it just works really
well it's certainly cheaper and it's
gonna be hard to see whether the 5s and
the 5c really takes over the market
depending on the price point but for now
it's great to see colors on the iPhone
and as they're gonna do a plastic phone
this is kind of the way to do it so
that's the iPhone 5c it'll be out
September 20th for $99 on contract</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
