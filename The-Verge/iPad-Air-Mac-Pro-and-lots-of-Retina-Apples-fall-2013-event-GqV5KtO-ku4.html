here outside of apple's new ipad event
where a lot of things happen but
virtually none of them are actually
surprises Apple started with the Mac
they released Mac os10 Mavericks big
surprise there is that it's free instead
of costing $29 it usually does Mavericks
has been out for a while there's really
nothing surprising big highlight
features include finder tabs multiple
display support it's a little bit better
with memory an apple claims will
actually increase your battery life and
a notebook apple also updated the
macbook pro with retina display the
13-inch model is kind of the big news
it's now just 1299 has a much faster
Haswell processor with iris graphics
which would actually let the processor
run that beautiful Retina display and
it's a little bit thinner and a little
bit lighter to be more the 15-inch is
basically the same design also has a
much faster crystal well processor with
iris pro graphics and an optional
discrete GPU if you want that apple also
updated a bunch of its apps ilife and
iwork are all new across the board
they've been redesigned to work better
with iOS 7 there's a few new features in
the mixer and most importantly they're
free which is a big strike against
Microsoft doesn't have a free version of
office on the iPad and a big strike
against Google which doesn't really have
the full decent set of media
applications on Android quite yet apple
also revealed the pricing available to
leave a Mac Pro which they announced at
WWDC the cylindrical ultra powerful pro
computer will start at two thousand nine
hundred ninety nine dollars to be
available in December lastly of course
the big news here is new iPads app will
replace the existing iPad with a new
model called the ipad air which is
basically the same design as the ipad
mini but way way bigger at nine foot 7
inches same Retina Display new a7
processor the m7 fill faucets front side
really beautiful really light really
think kind of to hold its understand how
much it is apple also added the retina
displays the ipad mini
is basically the same as the ipad mini
of the retina display now the a7
processor as well that model is 399
travel staying on the high end with
established they're really betting that
people pay a premium for the iOS
experience from can I huge ecosystem of
tablet s overall is a very iterative set
of updates for Apple nothing surprising
nothing BMC coming the ipad air is
beautiful it is very light very thin but
we've been waiting for apple's take a
big step for a few events now i'm hoping
the next time we come to california
we'll see something daring</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
