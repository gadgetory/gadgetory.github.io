have a very special guest with us five
by 5's dan benjamin hey how are you
doing hanging out good how are you stop
I came to New York and I had to come
you're in New York I am in New York and
now you're on the verge cast I'm on the
verge cast where else I wouldn't be in
New York I can think of several great
places to be in number Melissa's right
here well that's that's very nice if you
did lie about coming a little preview
that guy Dan of course is a is a
well-known and well-loved well-known and
somewhat most well-known internet
personality yeah your personality beyond
the internet that would you say that's
true to some degree friends and family
you know if you only are in our feel
that you are as some kind of personality
or like you know one thing about then is
no personality off the internet now I
think if you if you hear my shows if you
know me on the internet that's what I'm
yeah that's I'm like off there now
you're you're based in Austin now Austin
Texas you weren't always in Austin no we
don't need to even I want to talk about
it we don't have you were in Florida you
don't want to talk about it he doesn't
mute when he cautiously I never okay cuz
I heard it still in the mic well I think
you heard I'm just saying it's not
personality you know Larry I'm used to
the headset and we got this ear thing
but it sorry 27 I like the pr3 I'd like
to say that Dan has been in the trebles
way there's a fine he's a fine man from
what I'm told
why they ain't he's been complaining I
would say almost non-stop since he got
the lights are too bright they're very
young seem to be so bright in here
nobody wants to see I hear he's when he
ready yeah there was a microphone wasn't
adjusted to the right height he's asked
me if I'm gonna shave for the show for
about two and half hours and
he complained about your cough not
muting your comment look we do think a
little differently all right no it's
stylist do you like it New York style
which is raw and real real this Ariel
deal do you feel I'm ready the school
take me to school I'm ready to go - I'm
ready - coated by the way this is the
verge Castro discussion where we discuss
the week in consumer technology
technology culture culture culture and
and damn Benjamin's complaint list this
is great already I said it's you say 50
of FI the urge cast 5-0 out give us a
round of applause I was literally just
doing a clap of like you dig all have no
idea what I'm doing yeah yeah this is
our major 50th episode I think you can
tell we prepared we're very excited
about it 50 episodes deep and you know I
feel like we're just getting started
yeah just right now dan how many
episodes have you done of your of your
my show you use multiple show yeah we've
got a lot of shows what about what your
what do you consider to be your main
show you know that's a really good
question
there the the show some right now are
really personality based right so we've
got a handful of different shows that
are I guess I guess each one of them
appeals to kind of a slightly different
audience with some overlap so we don't
have right now a main show that I could
sell listeners it's the main show again
why don't you say what would you say is
your my least favorite you know what
would you say it's your what's the show
that's most raw that's most out there
Oh to work with me Merlin Mann for yeah
yeah you met Merlin I've not met him
yeah what was a good chef you listen to
the show no I don't know to any course a
podcast my what now what would you say
is the defining characteristic of that
show Merlin Mann would be the defining
he's the that's it yeah we're helping
people it's been such it's a show about
helping what is the show can you just
tell me helping people in what way so
you don't have like an aunt like a con
camera light so I have to look over here
at this at this TV yeah to know which
cameras actually see another of their
flippin turns you need to address the
audience is that you guys are trolling
it I'm just saying yeah
it's called the troll cast do you want
to address the audience is that what
you're trying to do you know when you
when you go to this one this one right
here you want to talk to the people
there they're laughing and they see they
like you they like that you look at the
camera when you're doing the intro
sometimes yeah I try I vacillate between
looking at the camera when I'm
addressing the Aussie but they pay
attention where you're looking and they
switch it for you they know they'll be
well they have a camera that's alright
on me you see that that's my that's the
J th - JJ h - very funny I mean it's
nothing anyhow we we should talk about
some news you know you've got topics for
us what do you what do you have I do
well so Eric Schmidt how's the brett has
the bright yeah it's on the caffeine
Schmidt Schmidt who is at this point now
become he's created the Schmidt just a
character within the industry he's
created a total Schmidt story based on
his comments yesterday at the Y yeah 90
92nd Street Y here in New York no that's
where he was I'm not getting that up so
first of all he just opened the door he
said Apple should have kept our maps
they're clearly better and they even
speaking on behalf of Google at this
point I mean he's like a cartoon
character
I had like another conversation
character and the person to be meeting
with just was just referring to Schmidt
who was Schmidt was here I can't tell
you how do we know what happened it's in
a well I don't think Neal I would lie
anyway so then he also said there's a
gang of four that consists of Facebook
Amazon Apple and Google yeah notably not
including Microsoft right he said we're
all different were all competitors are
all making enormous investments
he said Microsoft is a deliberate
commission from the list and said it
although it's a well-run company they
have not brought out any state of the
art program they have not brought any
state of the art products to market and
that's which at this point to say that
about Microsoft is you could say it
about the past right no you'd have to
ignore Xbox I mean but you could say
sure but but they're on the cusp of
redefining - well two enormous platforms
attempting to redefine
but they're they are going to redefine
did he mean in for all time or just like
recently just before I think he's
talking about the four movers in the
industry now yeah Apple Amazon Facebook
Google and there's microphone I'm saying
and Huawei and I think what he's this is
a Denis Eze it's deliberate omission
yeah what he's conveniently forgetting
to note is it sure you might argue that
Windows is a bit of a staid product
right the Microsoft is about to redefine
Windows well which is an enormous move I
mean I think this is a PR move on his
part I think he's trying to downplay the
look everybody's in a battle right now
there's this like battle of press
releases yeah we're you know we're
ending we're about to end October here
with like a flurry of it's gonna be
Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 and now
there's this rumors about iPad Mini and
Google is gonna do a new Nexus device
and everybody is like trying to to to
suck up the air right they're trying to
like how can I make people forget about
these other products I feel like this is
Google just going like I mean they know
Microsoft is about to have a big one
he's tweaking my crystal I just feel
like yeah you know it's also like
they're very competitive they're not
competitive in mobile devices with
Microsoft but they're you know
desperately trying to take the office
market away from from Microsoft doing
that and Microsoft is running ads for
Bing right now yeah Google Bing what is
it called Bing Bing this out Bing Bing
time to being bring it up no it's like
being something's like that's Bing it on
Oh big it on it's like it was like being
in place of a regular word you know this
is this is this is their chance to sort
of grandstand a little bit and it's like
they can finally come out and say
finally Microsoft isn't in the club
anymore is there no I mean Microsoft is
is has been so dominant in PCs now
everybody's like relishing this
opportunity to go like they're not where
we are yeah right like this is we're
here and they're here and that's you
know hey cool PC market right like cuz
that's what they're saying right like
you own 95 percent of the thing that's
dying yeah you know it's like you're the
it's like you're a dinosaur and when I'm
a space alien yeah it doesn't make sense
because most people that make sense to
you when I do say
no no you're a dinosaur you're a
dinosaur makes sense and I'm a predator
and then you can say whatever else and
Yoram you're like a rat and you're gonna
like survive the Ice Age who's the rat
you caught me right I do is write your
own Google's a rat yeah it's like Apple
is a cockroach yeah
Google's our rat my guys are big all
over the planet and about to be wiped
out yeah
the problem for coming July 2013 I'm
just saying the problem for Google and
that metaphor and the problem for Eric
Schmidt to say they haven't brought any
innovative products to market yeah
Schmidt's problem is most people get to
Google through a web browser on a
Windows PC but it doesn't matter because
the wet because the they know that they
that the thing in the browser is more
important than the browser or more
important than the thing that the
browser is that true the thing inside if
I handed you a Chromebook yes and would
you just use it I mean if I had your
book or a piece of paper your choice was
a Chromebook in like that Lenovo that
orange Lenovo PC that you've you know
talking about the orange yeah deep in
the u3 yeah well you can't buy the
orange one anymore yeah they're like out
there out there anyhow going what's your
fight to ask you to pick one which one
you pick you'd pick the Lenovo you would
pick the Windows PC why are you
answering for me gives a chance to
answer the questions you don't know
what's in my mind I know what's in your
mind I would pick al it up and that's
like that's still a problem for Google
they have not reached the point the
point where their software beyond what's
good enough yeah but I understand that
but you know look you've got Android is
extremely strong and mobile and Apple is
extremely strong in mobile tablets
smartphones
he said Ice Age they're gonna be more
smartphone owners than then computer
owners pretty soon or there already are
I don't know what is I don't think there
are at this point
anyhow but the point is he's looking at
where are we strong where are we going
to continue to be strong and where are
they weak and where can we hit them I
mean I feel like I feel like this is I'm
not saying that what he's saying isn't
necessarily true I mean well I think
he's being willfully
he's willfully ignoring the Windows 8
thing that's about to hell yes but I
also think he's attempting to from from
was trying to derail in a no he's trying
to derail it he's trying to like
downplay the impact like this is just
more of the same
the same thing that happens whenever
there's gonna be a big Apple
announcement or something like that and
you get you know Amazon Kindle roll
something out right before it's the same
thing he'd they're DS trying to take the
attention away from that well there is a
lot of that that's the kind of the thing
we're doing trying to suck the air out
of the rooms I think your own news or
whatever right but but it's also more
like a he's trunk it's like one of those
planting the seeds of you know that's
not that big of a deal like yeah we
don't care like we're not worried about
you know attention at the end of the day
like Windows 8 is like I'm kind of like
look you they're gonna release Windows 8
now devices the tablet market is is you
know everybody's trying to battle for it
there's no sign that then Microsoft will
do better than yeah and then Android has
in the tablet space no sign at all as
far as I can tell me are you more likely
to buy a No you know Windows RT device
or a surface then a you know presuming
that like so you don't wait a minute you
don't you don't think that people that
are already entrenched in Windows are
gonna say well there's a Windows Device
I don't want that Android nonsense and I
don't like Apple well the window device
is I mean the way my understanding is
that the Windows Pro devices am the ones
that are like actual windows x86 right
those are gonna be like priced more like
towards laptop pricing like yeah right
yeah like eight hundred nine hundred
thousand they're a match for those and
then and then and then the if the other
ones are coming at the tablet range yeah
they still do some window stuff but not
really they do like office mm-hmm and
you can't make apps for that they don't
want people making applications for the
desktop environment they only want them
making them for metro yeah so I mean the
question is like is that a better bigger
proposition like are people more excited
about that than they are about an
Android tablet it's a fair question I
don't know yeah I don't know there's all
like how well has the zoom sold yeah
it's a $500 $600 Android tablet but you
know the only thing that managed to sell
is a $200 Android tablet yeah the Kindle
Fire and I think some Nexus Evans yeah I
don't think they're selling a bunch of
anything else but the thing is that it's
only like in this past week the Google
put out like guidelines for making good
tablet apps and it's only
remember sorry go ahead no but I'm sure
read that anything from the Chad these
guys have pretty good comments in there
Oh God don't you know this is now that
you've acknowledged them that's all what
are these you see in there that you
thought was a stroll pass and he's got a
tiny little fun but my more complaints
complainer by the way so took for me to
notice we know what I'm saying is Google
never solved they never gave anybody
remember this is the guy who said that
like oh he's made a number of crazies
these will be Google TV's by like summer
2012 and you know what is it like
Android Tyler Android tablet statement
that was completely you know like I
think Schmidt's deal and we keep
referring to his Schmidt I would just
like to thank him for that that present
a gift
Schmidt's Schmidt's strength is that
good strength strength is like oh so
we're doing like the sequel convention
is like he's like the Batman movie where
they're just getting a new name yeah
Schmidt strength is that he he is he
says crazy things and nobody holds him
like accountable for them yeah yeah I
think that's why he's not like in a real
operational role Google right yeah like
you could say Eric you can say whatever
you want just you can't actually like be
in a role where and yeah right CEO and
then immediately he's like we're good
we'll be on well I'll be living on Mars
for the next year because he might say
that yeah you know anyhow no I mean I
just Google never gave anybody reason
about a tablet they never did I never
said xo7
the Nexus 7 runs phone app please stop
and say hey down has landscape you
please stop dissing look they'll figure
it out to find look it's a fine product
in its brightest price point you know
but unfortunately the iPad Mini is
coming yeah or the iPad Air's as some
people are calling it yeah
which is where did that name come from
no I haven't heard that one yeah Gruber
used it the other day iPad air iPad air
he said it all like nonchalantly like
the time that wall Mossberg was like the
iPhone 3G that Apple's about to
introduce the news on Twitter is like it
was a guess um those are they're gonna
call it yeah I don't think they're gonna
call it iPad air
I mean it just seems like a what's your
what's your vote on this what do you
think you had to put your money on it I
think it's iPad Mini Mini
I mean it just seems like a heir is like
it's the regular thing only smaller iPad
sinner I never know I don't know I
honestly maybe mini I guess they could
call it air I just think it's weird to
refer to that product as air and then
you're like ultra-thin one right is what
you're not that's not the air yeah like
you I guess what I'm saying is when they
released the third iPad the new iPad
they really were like look how thin it
is yeah it's like so thin it's thinner
than a phone right right thinner than
the iPhone not the new iPhone with the
previous eye the f-4s now it's like you
introduced one that's will this be
thinner than that yeah you think it will
oh yeah no I think it will be thinner
than the current iPad what if it's as
thin as an iPod Touch no and I support
that I don't think they'll call it the
air but yeah I don't know it'll be
really fit yeah I think thinness is like
every and also I'm not that yeah
thank you Tom we know they didn't hear
that well we ain't heard it go on I mean
the Nexus 7 is like whatever the Kindle
Fire is like they made a small cheap
thing he's like whatever is nice David
but no it's not you don't buy a nexus 7
because like oh this has great apps you
buy a nexus 7 because it's cheap it's a
web browser I guess or you like Android
you want a tablet right yeah no but
that's why I about an exercise yeah I
didn't my great-great gmail experience
great calendar exam all Android stuff
great you know I read I read on it a
Kindle great Kindle experience great
Kindle app it is a good Kindle app but
me it's fine what do you want that's
what I enjoy it
those are the read right you know but
Microsoft may have a nexus 7 right I do
usually I thoroughly enjoy one exercise
I go through yeah - you're not you can't
we're not fair yeah you give that we
have a what is your progression every
day where I comes out a lot of people
come up to me and and said you know I
got this Nexus 7 I don't I don't use it
they come on you on the street on the
street lemme side and the like walking
through near and Delana Bay
they'll be like 10 this nexus7 I usually
said it was pretty good but I don't you
know what and I the people that I know
have talked to it do they all have iPads
some of them have iPads some of them do
not because I go through a progression
every day I come home and I read email
on my phone yeah and I get frustrated
with that and then you switch to the
Nexus 7 because it has a really good
impression with that yeah because I get
something real done you go to its
invariably there are links and an email
like webpages and things I need to look
at and then I go to the iPad okay and
then I need to respond to the email yes
yeah and then I go to the laptop to me
every night deal with it I feel that
both the the Nexus 7 and the iPad or
whenever I have to like I kind of now
have skipped the step that you're
talking about where I'm like I got to
deal with this I got a look at this yeah
I'm just like well to me it's like I
don't want to yeah here we are I'm
working how do we get on the topic of
tablets he's Mike what basically is
David About Schmidt Schmidt state what
Google what he's saying
and I think what Google would love to
say is the future is mobile and we have
a clever sir but but they in one they
have a claim in one space on the phone
also established also in in the on the
web but that the but nothing the
percentage of mobile search that goes
through Google is all right 90 because
of the phone yeah they lost 100 million
maps customers in one day yeah like it's
it's because of these family or do they
make do they make a bunch of even better
maps customers think about it yeah I
hear what you're saying but that's just
doing that for me when they put that app
out we'll see but but they don't have a
claim when they put that app out it'll
be like they have a claim blessing
totally sucks
it'll be like the number one happen I'm
saying they have a claim to phones they
have not really established that claim
to tablet yeah ok and I think all of you
know but I'm super eager I think that
Microsoft actually proves and you know
we had this what is it the acer is acer
convert not convertible but like hybrid
of 5 sin things the windows 8 there
I think if anything what that woke me up
to was you know you feel like Oh tablets
we stopped there yeah that's like we're
stopping there you know that maybe like
a small off-ramp - like a small town
yeah but like I'm not sure that's the
only one stop on the innovation what's
happened know we have this it's kind of
like long-running conversation about
gadgets and like smart the smartphone is
a gadget it's kind of like it's run its
run a very fast race and now now we kind
of know it's mark now it's coughing and
wheezing right but you know like the age
of like slider QWERTY keyboards and like
flipping phones like we've settled on
basically this right well it's how many
slide-out QWERTY phones droid for check
it out no I refuse I will not check out
the droid for your last market but I
think that the PC and the tablet because
of Windows 8 I think we're gonna see an
enormous flurry of form factor well that
that's the to me like I feel like the
look I see people on planes all the time
with those laptop docks yeah you know
what for their iPad yeah where you're
typing with I feel like we're not
anywhere near what we think is they
actually the best use for I mean I think
I will say this you know like oh they're
making that the like the service of 16:9
right I think that's a weird screen like
I don't think you want to hold this
screen in your hands what is this a 13
no it's a 15 well you definitely want to
hold but uh but like an 11 inch macbook
air screen yeah would be awkward I think
even now we're kind of like hey you know
what's weird to hold in your hands as a
10 inch screen yeah I think that's like
why people are like even talking about 7
inch tablets it depends is a very
comfortable form factor I think that was
the first thing I noticed about the
Nexus 7 when I got it was that it it's
super easy to hold this it's the perfect
format it you can you can take this
thing with you and sometimes I'll be
there saying I don't know if I want to
take the iPad it's a little bulky with
this you chuck the single bit and I
think that's and that's that's a beauty
I think it's part of the reason there's
the 7-inch the 7-inch thing is happening
and I was doing it all so I'm sure
they're gonna be like
my guess is 249 yeah whatever price
point they're gonna have they're gonna
they're gonna do 49 to 40 really is
really like a forget about it yeah sorry
who's and who's not gonna buy that yeah
poor people I mean mainly no in the
context of this she'll listen to this
show everybody's gonna go buy some
people for some sort of political reason
yeah but you know they'll probably do
thing where it's like look it's the same
size as a kindle fire but we've used a
smaller bezels right a larger screen or
saying you know whatever kind of fancy
stuff that they'll do but I think that
um they're saying in the Jackals in the
chat room there's no way they're gonna
do it last shackle 300 what they're
saying people they were gonna sell the
iPad for $1,000 yeah and they did it for
500 I think they're looking for another
like blow your mind price point yeah I
think they have to be on this and does
how does then you keep holding this up
what thing I you know the importance of
then is it's a decision between they're
not gonna price it lower than this never
problem we've been arguing about I think
like having these conversations and I've
kind of come around to the idea that
like I in my mind I'm like but then it
would be the same price but it's like
where's does that matter because you're
not gonna go like well I want a tablet
but maybe I'll just buy this rince
you're saying it's not an either/or
you're not since it's eight inches for
now they're gonna make a decision eight
inches versus four inches they don't do
the same thing now you don't slide them
into your front pocket right you know
one is like you throw in your bag one is
you put in your pocket I would I would
say the major cost center of this thing
is this play by the way it's great it's
keeping that little bracelet thing on
that thing has like the brand-new insell
touch Retina display and that is the the
best display Apple can make right is it
the same exact the same exact way as the
phone it's a that thing is great
everyone knows to love the strap no but
the smaller iPad will have a much
cheaper display right it's gonna have
yeah 1024 768 so that's a good reason oh
that's a great point it's not going to
be retina we know that why
di beyond that nobody 168 same as never
that's not gonna be random so that's
that's the thing you want you want super
portable and you on retina get the iPod
yeah any of you just wants I think it's
a cheap thing the cheap thing yeah if
you want to render that it doesn't make
cheap things well okay let's talk about
this do you see anything no no that's
cool yeah it finally is happy yeah I
know I don't know if he's happy I'm
sorry so what is this thing here
see iPod nano so he's in banana it's a
piece not a piece I mean it's really
nice you're upsetting it's not a watch
anymore I'm upset because it's it's such
it's got a clock I do
see that's so it's this is the best iPod
for audio listeners or video listeners
guys I'm perplexed we don't we don't you
know we don't think if we don't split
our listeners like whether we give them
all as listeners okay because here we
can't we send they can't see okay you
just roll with it alright cool but
here's my thing is I would describe
what's odd to me about this is that yeah
I thought that the the square form
factor was very successful and popular
and people were really into the idea
that they gotta wear it as a watch and a
super miniature and a touchscreen a lot
of companies based their there here's
our beautiful video of it what is the
reason you know again like with the for
I know I know the ones are green here I
know the answer to watch kwazii's no no
it's not sold on the plane if they are I
pity them I am a hundred percent
confident the reason they change this
thing every two years
it's a city ground is two nets on the
playground it's to juice sales this
thing is a trifle you buy for a hundred
fifty bucks you throw in a stocking you
say I bought you the new iPod Nano if
you may change the way it looks it's new
I mean this is the same argument that
we've making with the iPhone I mean
everybody's getting a mint green but if
you think about the things they took out
of that dodge from two years ago this
video man our videos are really nice
this makes me want to buy one yeah this
is the Apple should I are you guys to
make these but so here's my thing about
it and I review this we're talking yes
we're talking about our views of these
things and every say Gwaine but so we
reviewed the touch Dave interview that
and the touch is like it's expensive
it's $300 but it's also clearly a
spectacular product right it's super
thin it's beautiful it comes in these
colors it has the same display as a
video I would say I've talking about it
ever top I mean if I if look if I if I
had an Android phone I wanted to play
with with iOS the iPod Touch is the
placed mm-hmm right it is a great
product it's just a little bit expensive
this thing is like the Nano is a product
from two or three years ago it's not
it's not the thing that people want what
kind of numbers do they do on these
things how many of these declines every
year and that's always half the sales
like that's the touch yeah the iPod
numbers of decline every quarter yeah
and the iPod Touch is generally half the
sales so this isn't this is a there are
things I really like about the touch and
there are things that I don't like about
the touch like the new touch there's a
little too much going on in the back of
it there's a camera there's antennae
you've got the camera and flash and
everything feels it then you get the
logo and then you can see a little bit
of it the headphone can I just feel like
I wished some of this I mean obviously
you can't move the camera if you take
out the strap that little button is like
how do you do this you just pull it off
I don't think it's supposed to pop up
man yeah it's awesome it's done it's you
know it's popped up there you oh that's
cool like it's like a little apple
design flourished it's like cool right
but it's awesome
we're only days away from stories of
these being snapped off I mean if you
definitely could it's like one that we
first came out and people kept on
throwing the remotes through their three
TVs and windows yeah you trying to break
it no you're just seeing how much it
takes I mean if I was would they be a
problem
I do we have to bail this back but no
this is nice what colors that come in Oh
God green green red black yellow yellow
black white white white silver silver
what color would you get black it looks
awesome black
I feel like I would get yellow it's
another one of those colors that it's
like the Nokia phones I think I get the
pink in the middle it's pink and I think
they do a red one but it's like the HTC
phones where they look one look as a set
yeah thank you anyhow okay we're just I
don't know we're talking about now so I
won't talk about this for one second
okay cuz I gave this a very great review
but a fair review yeah because you know
the thing about the Nano to me is that
the the equation for Apple is not just
iPod it's always iPod plus iTunes mm-hmm
and this is like an extension of iTunes
this is made a lot of your intro is
actually really funny in the review
where you're just kind of like it's all
about reason AAC yeah that's we do but
like you know what you know what I don't
do anymore I don't use iTunes so when I
I went home to review this I had to boot
up iTunes and like plug into it and see
what files were in my iTunes and it's
like oh I stopped listening to music in
this way three years ago I feel like you
did that because you're an iPhone owner
and I what do you think the percentage
of people who buy one of these no but so
the problem is not this that's what I'm
saying the problem is is the iPhone this
is the promise iTunes mmm that Apple's
model for distributing music to the
world right and then putting it on this
thing is completely backward yeah but
it's backwards in like five years right
now it's extremely profitable I mean I
hear what you're saying I use REO and
Spotify and I want to just have a
subscription service and we've talked
about this like like there's a lot of
people who still use nine Tunes no I
mean that's the thing the majority of
people are like they're seriously
pre-ordering the new Britney Spears
record right now right and they're like
cannot wait because that available to
download
I think so no I don't think so but I
know she's doing one but like they
cannot wait to download the mp3s yeah
AAA sees you know we're I think we
happen to be in a what are you okay what
are you listening to on your on your
iPhone my iPhone I mean I listen to
Spotify and then I have like my library
and then like I don't you know like I
enjoy
where does your library come from but I
get we say it's files yeah I understand
my tunes right no no cloud yeah I mean
Spotify streams you the files yeah but
you see yeah I'm testing but is VIPRE
now that's it's oh it's up there on that
yeah see I'm old-fashioned I use iti use
the heck out this is a right here you go
regular user it's a kind of it that's
what I'm saying is that regular people
know how much music you know not a ton
of it might buy an album every week or
two you do that much that's an
extraordinary man that's a lot of music
that's like that's like you're spending
you know do the math I don't know 40
bucks a month possible times 12 as
possible what is that
forty times twelve anybody maybe it's
less than that
480 it's a bad habit like that much
money
you know I'm music it's much less no I
know but here's this variable here's the
things a month I mean what maybe I don't
exist
I know you Spotify but the point is this
sometimes you don't have an internet
connection you don't want you can sync
your devices you can download it on yeah
I'll have an iPod why and I'll why
because I you know it's small check in
your pocket you don't want a device you
want to use anything if you offline a
little bit you've seen one of these
right yeah these are designed to go in
your pocket no I have it in my pocket
right though the phone I mean I having a
phone in my poverty of the five yes you
like it it's great
have you used the maps I don't like the
maps you need yo nice caffeine this is
by the way our office every morning
comes in and everyone has compared PTSD
look at worries about scoffs can I tell
you I like the scuffing yeah that's cool
I think if this is what happens when you
look Kenny gonna get a shot of this
looking at a beautiful
look at a beautiful I can see that like
a camera okay god no but I mean it's got
it you want it to have a little
character yeah you know it's like
leather is not cool until it looks like
beat up that's why I applied when I buy
I love a jacket burnt burn CDs anymore
for portable listening burn what burn a
CD what B so you remember this nothing
data
there's a listen there's a lot of people
and they're their mo is they buy the
music they download it they make it a
mixtape essentially as you guys might
you may remember oh yeah and that's a CD
and they put in a listen to that in
their car and they get a whole little
book of them what you do is you take the
CD player you get a cassette player yeah
those are my in my Honda's there are a
lot of people that you love me too
yeah and my Honda so what year was your
so I think it was a late late 80s I had
a 99 yeah which I loved
yeah Mike one which my mother let me
tell you a quick story story let's hear
it which is similar but my mother stole
it I know my mother my air condition was
broken I went home to visit my parents
and my air conditioning was broken my
mother was very very hot summer yeah and
she was very upset she was like we have
a guy who does because they had a Honda
just like we have a guy who fixes
Honda's like leave it here we'll take it
to him we'll get the air conditioning
fixed so you know we want to do this for
you and I fought with her I was like I
don't need the air conditioning it's not
a big deal whatever and I and finally
she wore me down and my friend Nick was
like look just let her just let her keep
through things you'll want to do this
for you I think it'll make her very
happy let her fix the car for you you
know it's a small thing you can take a
you know ride with me back to wherever
you're working I don't know you know to
New York I guess and so I was like fine
I left the car there and then like two
days later a landscape or backed his
like rig into into my car totaled it
nice and that was it my car was gone
your mom did a nice thing for you then
yeah was wonderful she convinced me to a
guy yeah I inherited my sister's 94
accord this is I like this is brown and
brown brown so we caught like a off the
lot like it was older or that like a
brief parents my parents like you know
she was the the oldest child any but you
know she was the a plus student yeah
it's a good the good she was the good
one no she's impossible to live up to
and they were like your you know we want
to get you a car anything you want and
she picked a brown four-door Accord
weird because she was brown vegetables
you know I color that they won't pull
you over no matter how fast you go yeah
but she
we both she wants to universe reality
which is a bad neighborhood in Chicago
and the car got broken into so many
times that by the time I inherited it
the area where the Styria would go was
just a blank space and we just had like
in it yeah and I would just tell you
could amazing car had a button on the
shifter that was labeled sport mode
about this I think I think in the in the
and I don't know when this was but I
think in the in the late 90s early
aughts Honda's were the the most broken
into because you could disassemble one
of those and have the parts sold in like
now is that right yeah I'm pretty sure I
just bought somebody else's put it right
in there all right we should move on
from whatever it is that we're supposed
to be talking is what people tuned in
for to your show this is 149 you know
how much they saw the iPod Touch for 199
the other but that's ago that's the
Delta between but I'm saying if you're
buying this you should spend the 50
bucks and buy the touch it's the same
storage the same features you want to
sync it and play files you ever let the
guys in the booth and talk Mike I can't
hear them Michael's like dying to time
people that Brian they're part of your
crew they're the team in the air oh I
just realized Dan brought you brought
your Hattie is your she's my producer
producer back in there and she was like
making a crazy face and thumbs up in
just a second yeah but but I realized
Hattie is a real name I accused her of
having a fake tan it's a real name but I
just realized that there's a character
on the show Parenthood named Hattie
that's a Georgian that's short for
something yes it is not her you have a
real name
what's your real name no that's our holy
you use the medicine or license I think
I think how do you vote for something
did you ask your parents
can you mic here can you put her on the
Micah Micah no there's a mic right there
yep John is shaking his head you just
like to apologize to the listeners for
The Verge casts existing you know we
tried we thought we could do it the
right way and this is the best I gotta
say some listeners guesses and what how
do you might say it stand for
why can't they get a microwave a charge
carrier table yeah that's rude
Henry yeah Ray Charles wanna be one of
these O's loved artists of our reach I
have an album that I bought a night to
use a single great Charles out to DS you
think oh okay
that is a fake name
that is like Maddie but you messed up
the first letter like we wrote in him
but they thought it was an H so I guess
that's her name how do you deal with
these later why don't you have a nice
headsets III I prefer this because I
think the headsets are gross looking
that will no I monitor really well and
we do we've actually done we've done
something like broadcasts where we don't
use this either we don't use these
either we use the lab now which I
actually prefer I prefer to have as a
mic Oh Hattie as a mine yeah it's Hattie
is really her how do you give a middle
name
yes what is it and that's not a real
name that's that's that's short for
something
okay thank you Annie yeah patty had
that's a great note we agree
anyhow so alrighty you're from you are
you work with Dan down in Austin yes I
do
we should let her out here I don't know
it's fine we're something as a visible
person here I'm sure our chat room is
now freaking out because it's a new show
but we've had women on the show and they
always freak out they always freak out
it's a little weird it was how you get
ratings yeah now how do you why did you

common enough
about two months ago okay and and does
he complain how much does he complain in
Austin about what see you all the time

and many people I don't miss a party in
there and so he complains a lot would
you sale in 60 70 percent I'm er its
complaining not really babies I be
honest to be honest be honest but you
don't have do people in the in your
studio who come in occasionally and you
mostly do people remote most of the
gifts that we have on the shows are
remote people we bring in with Skype and
but you know we're in there and
sometimes we let other but it's like you
like for the people who are like this is
a really you've got this great space out
there but this actual recording room is

do a tour and stuff for people and what
the video is or a video tour not like

sort of what could even be described as
a topic right now yeah that I don't know

upset and confused

to leave alright yeah is this well since

what I don't want is your nice clean
normal audience audience you know when a
kid goes to any tech news today the I

that's like that's like what'll happen
if the bad streets even 5x5 listeners
come over to the vert they'll be like

overlap I think maybe well I mean you

Ross okay Ross Miller's getting in here

how long we been doing this 55 minutes
what time do you have
555 I'm a minute off yeah
that's not that worrying no it's fine
for an old watch I do anybody Ross
Miller can I can we talk we address
something just for a second I want you
to yes I'm using natural scrolling I
want you to be over it I want to take a
Vision Quest with me get a shot of raw
we get a shot a rock okay now just
imagine for a second that he's very pale
and that this is a shear it won't take
this years and sure that that's his
flash underneath there just imagine I
just think about it I wish I could we do
said let the record be sure that you're
thinking of me v del v elements Leeloo
Dallas outfit team like you you're like
I'm just a name drop a few characters
from Fifth Element like it's no biggie
you you don't know that's fine is
actually a pretty bad movie can we all
be pretty great movie it's actually it's
like a real what year was fifth album
made like 1998 is from the future
there's no time 1997 it is defined our
generation and for years to come it will
define a generation of of sad people
wearing sheer shirts and stripes on it's
awesome yes 97 I would actually say that
was more of a Freddy Krueger flesh flesh
flashy Krueger yeah so like if pretty
crew use the flesh of his victims say a
movie and I'll tell you a year was that
hmm maybe it's a mad 99 it's a mad mad
mad mad world in 1968 oh sure wait
67 that's probably the first was 69 is
actually thing it's 68 but I know it's
actually 63 okay fine when was failsafe
release oh you haven't seen failsafe to
you okay but they all save is based on a
book I believe called failsafe which is
the same thing that dr. Strangelove is
based on okay but it's like a serious
version kind of of it it's really good I
think and we think it was released in
1958 I could be wrong could be 59 this
is my thing is 50 64 No
well do the same range you know what
the important thing is we all learned
about a new film failsafe no it is a
great movie though and you should see it
who's the star of that Jack Lemmon
Walter fat I don't think so
really Frank Overton Walter Matthau
Henry Fonda damn Jack Lemmon in there
are you leaving all right it's great
meeting you that's Haddie ask your
parents about the name because I think
it's a real it's a real problem all
right
these I don't think that a good idea
all right really do you can slam it yeah
there's one more thing to talk about yes
and it's a topic of did we talk about
every week the nexus oh yes big rumors
are the next yeah I see rumors a truly
disappoint me the rumors are that LG's
making the next Nexus phone yep or a
Nexus phone there's pictures all over
the place they don't know a shot but
there are there are pictures of a phone
which looks on the front on the face
kind of like a Galaxy Nexus on the back
it looks like a disco Barbie or
something and don't mind the weird
pattern on the back what I mind is
everything else about the phone I think
the shape of it is ugly it looks like
it's using cheap plastic garbage yeah I
I actually hope this is not I hope this
is like a device but not the device like
if this is the flagship like if this is
the best that Google if this is Google's
a game like by doing this device like
come on guys I thought you're part of an
interesting point actually on Twitter
you mentioned data it says with Google a
on the look yeah raining that's not what
the Nexus phones do so so the the
original g1 so he pointed out to me says
with Google on them yep
but that was before they even had this
concept of like of Android phones as
like these flagship phones you know do
you want to wipe that down that was
actually a Olivia and wiped it down for
me so it should be good to go this is
not dance earpiece as far as I can tell
the phrase Olivia wiped it down for me
doesn't sound washing the studio man
polite I'm gonna I'm just gonna risk it
um you know this is the last time you
see this ear well you know where did we
say hey remember that verge gust was the
last time you saw Ross is here it's just
hanging out but this would be van good
right after the right after the verb
yeah I was saying yeah we just went
through this with the iPhone yes you you
know that's like hearing Apple fanboy
say it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't it and
then it was it I don't if Apple can't
hold it down I don't think LG can oh
well let me offer something if let me oh
you're showing me
let me just well actually first let me
just suggest to you yeah here's the
thing nobody's checking out LG's
production lines and no he's checking
out Samsung's production lines and the
scrutiny is there's no not in anywhere
near the scrutiny that Apple has on
their products like you know so I feel
like there's so it's possible to keep a
secret in some ways maybe even easier
than Apple because there isn't this
intense all right green oh wait
may I finish no by the way is the vice
presidential debate on tonight o'clock
Eastern oh my god oh my god yeah oh my
god yeah oh my god
anyhow I was just thinking of what it
would look like in my mind's eye my
brain page no they're gonna be saying
something and it's gonna be crazy okay
the other thing is that that it is
possible this is one of we've heard
there were gonna be multiple devices I'm
not trying to like be an apologist
because like this very well could be the
Nexus phone but I do think the with
Google thing is interesting it's one of
two one of two things makes this factoid
interesting one it's either for some for
some reason Google is changing the way
it addresses these phones as like a
product like with Google versus Google
as a nexus this is a Nexus phone and
it's with Google that to me is highly
suggested that there will be other with
Google phones that will be didn't do
this once before the whole with Google
Google experience go
yeah it was when I first launched it
okay right so that was fine but nothing
this is what I mean it also says not for
sale and giant letters on it they could
change the branding I know but this is
well but it's odd though with Google
will be on there at all so my feeling is
like it could mean that they're changing
if this is the next as they're changing
the way the Nexus program works right or
alternately this is not the Nexus but
those two things are possible what is
that that's the front they mean there
are pictures now of it next to an iPhone
but you think here's why these things
out there and it's running jelly bean
and doesn't the I is there so much room
on the sides of the icons in the dock
can anybody tell me does that seem odd
to you I'm gonna area yours maybe you
should have one more icon in there know
how many icons were there five yes it's
like that's the same yeah
the screens right bigger no but that's
what I'm saying isn't that odd if you're
making the Nexus phone was it have like
well when you'd be like well jelly beans
gonna be perfect oh there we go that
looks weird to me something's weird
about the screens water it's is it
you're saying it's wider than this yeah
why I mean why would it be wider than
this can you LG get this Square fun can
anybody tell me why this it's a it's a
phone who knows which to me
switching to me now I mean like great
job on switching I'm just saying LG does
what it is why would you want to make it
wider than this god this looks actually
kind of small in my head doesn't have a
big head give me your give me that iPod
Touch yup my iPhone give me your iPhone
can I get key unlock this it broke down
and perfect like I'm just like standing
here like oh I turn this off here yeah
that's fine that's not gonna be quite
the same here I'm gonna be that person
in the picture yeah see these these
don't look crazy different to me they
totally do a little bit one looks skinny
that is not in focus hold that by your
head yeah don't make me do hey do you
want to do it with this thing now I'm
over this it doesn't matter who cares
you know what guys it's not about what's
on the outside except it is no you're
look you're looking at the with Google
logo and I'm looking at an lg phone
that's running stock jelly bean so what
anything could run saw jelly bean but
here's the thing nothing does
he's know anything about this is the
phone why would they keep the exact same
basic design language as the Galaxy
Nexus like why would they make they like
had glue in the photo year your dad LG
that made a phone that look like
Samsung's phone you're asking why LG
made something that looks like Samsung I
don't think LG's that look they have the
optimus 4x or whatever it's called the
four acts HD or whatever then the stupid
name of the product is but it looks like
it's actually like a pretty nice looking
phone it's a square but it they're
saying this is based on the the Optimus
G or whatever it is like there's two
reasons well I give it an honest F
google has been designing these phones
for however long and they all look like
that right no no looks like that
they're both Samsung products who said
they have to look all look the same like
a cheap piece of plastic sure but like
Google's drive well there are even as
Google's driving businesses if your
argument is that LG's driving the design
LG - I don't think this phone is like
hideously ugly that the Galaxy Nexus
when it came out when it came out yeah
this was this was a much classier
thinner variation on like the plastic he
Android phone sure I actually thought
like and I went back a look to my review
I say like it's like one of the nicest
phones on the market and it was at the
time and it was nicer than most of the
other Android phones they were out there
and it is it was really thin and
whatever you know but like this to me is
like so iterative of the other like you
know it's so I mean I don't these two
things I don't don't make me here I want
to answer a question really about why
you thinks calling you know what can't
make can't keep a secret I got an email
someone's giving you an forget it you
know everyone when Apple makes a phone
they know what factors to look at you
know who's making the hardware
rankle makes the next device we're all
assuming it's LG from one point at what
point did eligible it's always Fox one
factor everyone but like what point did
we start assuming LG was the Nexus
device maker the next round this is just
no we heard this rumor has been around
well the Wall Street Journal actually
reported like in of course you know this
report I don't know how true or not or
not it is but they reported there were
going to be multiple Nexus devices
multiple phones yeah and I in a couple
of tablets yeah
my hope is that this is one of multiple
are there side shots now yeah pain like
that's what I'm saying this out this
device is out this is like total control
bleak
they never have and I don't know why I
was like sure whatever but here's I
don't know and this is not a Nexus LG
has so much marketing potential for this
phone now because everyone assumed it
was yeah it's I mean it's so boring its
yeah it's so boring like it's so so
boring what do you expect the next next
is going to be I don't know I saw a
bunch of really beautiful Windows Phone
devices introduced the HTC in the new
Lumia is that I would like oh one of the
1x yes the 1x is better-looking in this
phone yeah and also like I'd rather have
something made of polycarbonate than
these like cheap pieces of plastic to
run together well it's also like a Devon
you know or whatever yeah I mean
whatever notes its Sparkle by the way at
the back is glass would be really funny
yeah like all things considered like oh
cool you the glass back is everybody
loved those on the iPhone they never
broke and sparkly it's made of sparkles
be cool if it lit up
maybe lights up yeah yeah you know this
looks like this looks like a club
bathroom yes yes it's exactly what it
looks like it looks like one of those
weird like it like a karaoke place it's
like a weird light wall or something
it's like that material we should make
it out of that AAA game officially not
brought yeah well alright any other
topics that's it that's it really I mean
you want to we can keep hanging out no
was there anything we miss any big stuff
no what about what about oh the note to
you I actually think is kind of an
interesting device I think okay hear me
out
yeah if it was not running this custom
Samsung software mm-hmm and you know
there were like just apps that really
took advantage of it like paper they
took advantage of a device with a stylus
so there's like paper for Android right
for like a 5 inch phone what is it 5.5
inches or something
it's enormous yeah yeah and it's like
you don't think about it that sounds
like a phone or you're not using it like
a phone
you know you're like this is my you know
I'm using it with a Bluetooth headset or
you know it's my in-between kind of I
don't know I think it something cool
about the stylus like that not for like
using the device that's the old stylus
yeah idea but for doing things with the
stylus like drawing or editing something
or writing this is what I went through
when I reviewed the Note 10.1 yeah well
that was it that's a that was like not a
good device no but it's that shift the
contextual shift between using the
stylus and then using the device with
your finger is like a need a stylus but
this stylus does both it says no it's an
improved stylus and improved a screen
stylus combat look there's a somebody
nice may use this man your Smee it's a
smash bag but I'd say that so try to
tell you your reference or do people
know what we're talking you know
actually talk to someone who like knows
their Atlantic comedy group who made
something oh that's not a real thing
yeah
turquoise cheap yeah yeah what the sets
is the joke yeah it's all joke Oh
Flint flossing it's I've lost all
excited about it yeah I thought like
Maggie was a thing well know it can be
whatever you want with the treatment you
get the concept of a smash bang fusion
is insane yeah girl oh my god and that's
the verge cash for the week of October
8th 2012 there's one thing we could have
talked about we bring up now we're
talking about it well we ran as it's
magnet I think been ran a really
interesting report this week on cloud
clout and the thing is like basically we
were trying to think of headlines for
this and all I could come up with is
like the apocalypse is here everyone
hates this thing but it's going to
happen whether or not you want it to
happen yeah and I it's your claim it
must be greater than 35 to read this
yeah but there are like people like
companies who will only interview
candidates for jobs who have a certain
clouds well I think what's motorcycle II
because I think what's most amazing
about cloud is they have yet to
accurately Dem
straight that the Klout score is has any
has any like I think that my cloud
scoring kim kardashian's are like
relatively close yeah
can you find out I think that I'm like
76 and she's like 79 or something which
is like I understand we're in different
professions but if you're just going by
the score number which most people you
you're higher like 83 but yeah where did
you see that I just remembered I was I
don't think I'm a your cloud stalking
I'm not your cloud sake we ran there for
the night is anybody hold my clouds
chorus Michael just look at who could
get my Klout score fastest yeah so I'm a
78 and then you're an 83
what's Kim Kardashian can I do this yeah
today is the day that Josh made me look
up Kim Kardashian oh yeah cuz you never
look up Kim Kardashian anything 8888
Kanye West's 92 okay so whatever so
you're saying I'm not 84 I just want to
be clear folks from a cloud perspective
I'm within nine points of Kanye West and
I'm and I'm very boarded by five points
away from Kim Kardashian yeah I mean I
think that I rest my case the show's
over I'm leaving goodbye verge I'll see
you I'll see you it Hollywood where I'll
be wearing a diamond robe yeah by the
way anything I can give Kim Kardashian
plus K do not give her plus K on
celebrities photography and money oh
yeah
another option money give her a plus K
on like a vandalism you do that give you
a makeup I have no idea how to use this
service I can't believe I and I are in
such a rarefied space another
Yeezy as I like to call him in casual
conversation good friend of mine I don't
even know great collaborator I'm closing
this window and great at Twitter you
know he deleted a lot of his tweets
recently really you look at Twitter
meltdown alright that's the verge cast
for this week I know but this Klout
article is really good and you guys
should read it but I was gonna say is
like there's no there's no scientific
data or any data whatsoever that I can
that I know of that says like clout does
now look I'm not saying that maybe it
does have it maybe there is like a real
meaning to that number no but I think
any service that puts me in Kanye West
and spitting distances their sulfate
something he's got horribly right with
the world and I'm very excited about it
they're all asking about the car we
should tell them what's going out the
car the car that were giving oh my god

winner we have a winner now and and we
we were gonna do an announce post

a person won the car who made a gift and
it is an awesome gift I don't want to
wear not gonna say here are we know I'm
