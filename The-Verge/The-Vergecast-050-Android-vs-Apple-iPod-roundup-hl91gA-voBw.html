bright in here nobody wants to see I

applause that's great you made it I was
I was literally just doing a clap of
like you didn't got no idea what I'm

major 50th episode I think you can tell
we prepared we're very excited about it
50 episodes deep and you know I feel
like we're just getting started yeah
just right at Dan how many episodes have
you done of your of your my show use
multiple show yeah we get a lot of shows
about what's your what do you consider
to be your main show you know that's a
really good question um they're the
show's home right now are really
personality-based right so we've got a
handful of different shows that are I
guess I guess each one of them appeals
to kind of a slightly different audience
with some overlap so we don't have right
now a main show that i could sell listen
to this it's the main show ago I don't
you say what would you say is your my
least favorite you know what would you
say is your what's the show that's most
raw that's most out there oh I'm going
to work with me and Merlin man for yeah
yeah you met Merlin I've not met him
yeah what was a good chef you listen to
the show uh oh I don't know to any Orson
podcast why was she on the internet uh
what now what would you say is the
defining characteristic of that show uh
Merlin man would be the defining he's
the message yeah we're helping people
Spanish it's a show about helping what
is the show can you just tell me helping
people in what way so you don't have
like an aunt like a on camera light so I
have to look over here at this at this
TV yeah to know which cameras actually
see another of their flipping in our do
you need to address the audience is that
Naturalizer trolling a way I'm just
saying yes were you what
it's called the troll cast you want to
address the audience that were you
trying to do you know when you when you
went go to this one the sooner here you
want to talk to the people yeah they're
laughing and they see they like you they
like that people to love it you look at
the camera when you're doing the intro
sometimes yeah i try i vacillate between
looking at the camera when I'm
addressing the Aussie but they pay
attention where you're looking and they
switch it for you there they know you're
not gonna look well they have a camera
that's all right on me see that that's
my that's the JJ on the gh2 jjh too
that's very funny I mean it's not
laugh-out-loud me but nothing anyhow we
we should talk about some news you know
why you've got topics for us what do you
what do you have I do well so Eric
Schmidt the house that Brett has the
right answer yeah it's are the kaffir
Schmidt Schmidt who is at this point now
become he's created the Schmidt rustic
character within the industry he's
created a total Schmidt store based on
his comments yesterday at the y 90 90
second Street why here in New York no
that's where he was I'm not getting that
up so first of all he just opened the
door he said Apple should have kept our
Maps they're clearly better and they
even speaking on behalf of Google at
this point I mean I'm say he's like a
cartoon character I but I had like
another conversation believe me today in
character and the person to be meeting
with just was just referring to Schmidt
who was Schmidt was here I can't tell
you um how do we know it happen it
didn't at well I don't think Neal I
would lie anyway so then he also said
there's a gang of four that consists of
Facebook Amazon Apple and Google yeah
notably not including Microsoft right he
said we're all different were all
competitors are all making Norris
investments he said Microsoft is a
deliberate omission from the list and
said although it's a well-run company
they have not brought out any state of
the art prob they have not brought any
state of the art products to market and
that's which at this point to say that
about Microsoft is uh you could say it
about the past right no you'd have to
ignore xbox I mean but you could say
sure but but they're on the cusp of
redefining too well to enormous
platforms attempting to redefine but
there but nothing I no way hose is they
are going to redefine
mean did he mean in for all time or just
like recently just before I think he's
talking about the four movers in the
industry now yeah our Apple Amazon
Facebook Google hmm hours in a microwave
a gang war z and there's entity and
there's microscope I'm saying and Huawei
uh and i think what he's this is adil
when he says it's deliberate omission
yeah what he's low conveniently
forgetting to note is it sure you might
argue that windows is a bit of a staid
product right the microsoft is about to
redefine windows well which is an
enormous move i mean i think this is a
PR move on his part i think he's trying
to downplay the look everybody's in a
battle right now there's this like
battle of press releases yeah we're you
know we're ending we're about to end
october here with like a flurry of it's
going to be windows 8 and windows phone
8 and now there's this rumors about ipad
mini and google is going to do a new
Nexus device and everybody is like
trying to to to suck up the air right
there trying to like how can I make
people forget about these other products
I feel like this is google just going
like I mean they know Microsoft is about
to have a big he's tweaking microscope I
just feel like you know it's also like
they're very competitive they're not
competitive in mobile devices with
Microsoft but they are you know
desperately trying to take the office
market away from from Microsoft doing
that in Microsoft is running ads for
Bing right now yeah google bing what is
it called bing bing this out Bing Bing
Bing bring it up no it's like being
something it's like that's bring it on
Oh bring it up make it on it's like I do
is like being in place of a regular word
you know this is this is this is their
chance to sort of grandstand a little
bit and it's like they can finally come
out and say finally Microsoft isn't in
the club anymore is is there no I mean
any Microsoft is so has been so dominant
pcs now everybody's like relishing this
opportunity to go like they're not where
we are yeah right like this is we're
here and they're here and that's you
know hey cool pc market right like cuz
that's what they're saying right like
you own ninety-five percent of the thing
that's dying yeah you know it's like
you're the it's like you're a dinosaur
and when I'm a space alien yeah but it
doesn't make sense because most people
that make sense to you when I just said
no no you are a dinosaur you're a
dinosaur makes sense and I'm a predator
and then you can say whatever else and
you're you're like a rat and you're
gonna like survive the Ice Age who's the
rat are you calling me right Google's
are at your own Google's our rat yeah
it's like Apple is a cockroach yeah
Google's are at my camara subsidize our
big all over the planet and about to be
wiped out yeah the problem for helping
july twenty thirteen i'm just ended the
problem for google and that metaphor and
the problem for eric schmidt to say they
haven't brought any innovative products
market yeah schmitz problem is most
people get to google through a web
browser on a windows pc yeah but it
doesn't matter because the wet because
the they know that they that the thing
in the browser is more important than
the browser or more important than the
thing that the browser is that true the
thing inside if I handed you a
Chromebook yes and would you just use it
I mean if I had nothing else to use all
right what am i optioned out I'm just
saying you're gonna have your book or a
piece of pink your choice was a
Chromebook in like that uh lenovo that
orange lenovo pc that you've you know
talking about the orange 09 3 10 yeah
yeah like deep in the you 3jm research
well you can't buy the orange one
anymore yeah they're like out there out
there anyhow go on what's your fight ask
you to pick on which one you pick you'd
pick the lenovo you would pick the
windows pc why are you answering for me
gets a chance to answer the questions
you don't know what's in my mind I know
what's in your mind I would pick a
little bit and that's like that's still
a problem for Google they have not
reached the point I don't say they have
a point where their software beyond what
I get away i just got a book was good
enough yeah but i understand that but
you know look you've got android is
extremely strong in mobile Apple is
extremely strong in mobile tablets
smartphones yeah a great he said Ice Age
look at me more smartphone owners than
then computer owners pretty tune or
there already are I don't know a short
everybody's I don't think there are at
this point anyhow but the point is um
he's looking at where are we strong
where are we going to continue to be
strong and where they weak and where can
we hit them I mean I feel like I feel
like this is I'm not saying that what
he's saying isn't necessarily true I
mean well I think he's being willfully
he's willfully ignoring the windows 8
thing that's about to have yes I could I
also think he's attempting to from from
trying to derail in a no he's trying to
derail he's trying to like downplay the
impact like this is just more of the
same this is the same thing that happens
whenever there's going to be a big apple
announcement or something like that and
you get you know amazon kindle roll
something out right before it's the same
thing he's trying to take the attention
away from that well there is a lot of
that that's the kind of the thing we're
trying to stalk the air out of the room
Zack with your own news or whatever
right but but it's also more like a he's
trunk it's like one of those planning
the seeds of you know that's not that
big of a deal like yeah we don't care
like we're not worried about a no
attention at the end of the day like
Windows 8 is like I'm kind of like look
you they're gonna release Windows 8 yeah
devices the tablet market is is you know
everybody's trying to battle for it
there's no sign that then Microsoft will
do better than yeah and then Android has
in the tablet space no sign at all as
far as i can tell me are you more likely
to buy a no you know windows RT device
or a surface then a you know presuming
that like so you don't wait a minute you
don't you don't think that people that
are already entrenched in windows are
going to say well there's a Windows
device I don't want that Android
nonsense and I don't like Apple well the
winner Niekro devices I mean the way my
understanding is that the windows pro
devices and the ones that are like
actual window and x86 right those are
gonna be like priced more like towards
laptop pricing like yeah right yeah like
800 900 thousand they're a match for
those and then and then and then the if
the other ones are coming at the tablet
rain yeah they still do some window
stuff but not really they do like office
mm-hmm and you can't make apps for that
they don't want people making
applications for the desktop environment
they only want them making them for
metro yeah so I mean the question is
like is that a better bigger proposition
like are people more excited about that
than they are about an Android tablet
it's a fair question I don't know yeah I
don't know yours all like how well has
the zoom sold yeah it's a
five-hundred-dollar six-hundred-dollar
android tablet but you know the only
thing that managed to sell is a 200
other Android tablet yeah the kindle
fire and i think some nexus evans yeah i
don't think they're selling a bunch of
anything else but the thing is that it's
only like in this past week they Google
put out like guidelines for making good
tablet apps and it's only the
you remember sorry go ahead no but I'm
to read than anything from the Chad
these guys have pretty good comments in
there Oh God don't you know this is now
that you've acknowledged them this alone
what do they say well you see in there
that you thought was your old past and
he's got a tiny little fun but fly more
complaints yeah I'm feeling like I'm a
complainer by the way so took for me to
notice we closed the final time alright
no but i'm saying is google never solved
they never gave anybody reasonably
remember this is the guy who said that
like uh uh he's made a number of crazy
stares at all tvs all these will be
Google TVs by like summer 2012 and you
know what is it like Android Tao he had
some other android tablets statement
that was completely you know like I
think Schmidt's deal like the fact that
his name is Schmidt and we keep
referring to his Schmidt I would just
like to thank him for that that present
a gift Schmidt's shim its strength is
that good strength is equal to spencer
ya Mick strength is like oh so we're
doing like the sequel convention is like
like the Batman movie where they're just
getting a new name yeah Schmidt strength
is that he is he says crazy things and
nobody holds him like accountable for
them yeah yeah I think that's why he's
not like in a real operational role
Google right yeah like you could say
Eric you can say whatever you want just
you can't actually like be in a role
where any wood or anything out here
right over that negligence like that's
why he's CEO and then immediately he's
like we're good we'll be on we'll all be
living on Mars in the next year because
he might say that yeah you know anyhow
no I mean I just Google never gave
anyone any reason to buy a tablet they
never did I ever said X 07 the nexus 7
runs phone app please stop and say hey
down has landscape you in the place to
come please stop dissing look they'll
figure it out to find look it's a fine
product in its Brad his price point you
know but unfortunately the iPad Mini is
coming yeah or the ipad air's as some
people are calling it yeah which is
where did that name come from no I
haven't heard that one yeah Gruber used
it the other day ipad air ipad air he
said it all like nonchalantly like the
time the wall mossberg was like the
iphone 3g that apple's about to
introduce any news on twitter is like it
was a guess um well those are they're
gonna call yeah i don't think either
gonna call an ipad air I mean
just seems like what's your what's your
vote on this what do you think you had
to put your money on it any its iPad
Mini Mini uh I mean it just seems like a
air is like it's the regular thing only
smaller iPad sinner that's I never know
I don't know I honestly maybe mini I
guess they could call it air I just
think it's weird to refer to that
product as air and then you're like
ultra thin one Ryan is what you're not
that's not the air yeah like you I guess
what I'm saying is when they release the
third ipad the new iPad they really were
like look how thin it is yeah it's like
so thin thinner than a phone right right
thinner than the iphone not the new
iphone at the previous I the f-4s now
it's like you introduce one that's will
this be thinner than that yeah you think
it will oh yeah I think it will be
thinner than the current iPad what if
it's as thin as an ipod touch it's
pretty fun yeah but I don't know that's
a what L that the ipod air no and I
support that I don't think they'll call
it the air but yeah I don't know good
it'll be really fit yeah I have you know
everything I know not I think thinness
is like every and also i'm not that yeah
thank you tal el torito we know your da
just um they didn't hear that well we
heard it go on I mean the Nexus 7 is
like whatever the kindle fire is like
they made a small cheap thing he's like
whatever is not a statement but no it's
not you don't buy a nexus 7 because like
oh this has great apps you buy an extra
seven because it's cheap it's a web
browser is real or you you like android
you want a tablet right yeah they're up
there that's why i bought it no but
that's why I about an exercise yeah I
didn't buy a great great gmail
experience a great calendar exact all
android stuff great you know i read i
read on it a kindle great kindle
experience great kindle app how it is if
you're is a good kindle app but it's
fine what do you want that's what I
enjoy it those are the read/write you
know I but Microsoft I may have a nexus
7 right I do you usually I thoroughly
enjoy the next do you go lot I go
through yeah you give it a high too
you're not you can't we're not fair yeah
you give that we have a what I go
through a progression every day where I
comes out a lot of people come up to me
and said you know I got this nexus 7 I
don't I don't use it they come on you on
the street don't show you wanna me side
and the light day walking through near
and during a bagel and they'll be like
10
this nexus 7 I used he said it was
pretty good but I don't you know it and
I the people that I know have talked to
it do they have ipads some of them have
ipad someone do not because I go through
a progression every day I come home and
I read email on my phone yeah and I get
frustrated with that and then you switch
to the nexus 7 cuz it has a really good
Indian with that and then I go to the
idea because I because it something when
you want to get something real done you
go to your iPad no no no no that it's a
very leaders when you get your pelvic
area invariably there are links and an
email like web pages and things I need
to look at and then I go to the ipad
okay and then I need to respond to the
email yes II and then I go to the laptop
this happens to me every night deal with
it I feel that both the Nexus 7 and the
ipad or whenever I have to like I kind
of now have skipped the step that you're
talking about where i'm like i gotta
deal with this we're like I gotta look
at this yeah I'm just like well there's
hang on the laptop because I like some
go straight to me it's like I don't want
to oh god yeah here we are I'm working
how do we get on the topic of tablets
he's Mike what basically is David about
Schmidt Schmidt's Dave what Google what
he's saying and I think what Google
would love to say is the future is
mobile and we have a claim over sir but
but they in one they have a claim in one
space on the phone they have also
established also in in the on the web
but the but nothing the percentage of
mobile search that goes through google
is all right 90 because of the phone
yeah they lost 100 million maps
customers in one day yeah like it's it's
because of these VA or do they make do
they make a bunch of even better maps
customers think about it yeah I hear
what you're saying but that's just doing
that from when they put that app I will
see but but they don't have a claim when
they put that app out it'll be like they
have a clean lesson totally sucks it'll
be like the number-one happen yeah
absolutely yeah I'm saying they have a
claim two phones they have not really
established that claim to tablet yeah
okay and I think all of the other
there's no but I'm are super eager I
think that Microsoft actually proves and
you know we had this uh what is it the
acer is acer convert not convertible but
like what is my braids of 57 things the
windows 8 there um I think if anything
what that woke me
up to was you know you feel like Oh
tablets we stop there yeah that's like
we're stopping there you know that maybe
like a small off-ramp to like a small
town yeah but like I'm not sure that's
the only one stop on the high innovation
what's happened now we have this or this
kind of like long-running conversation
about gadgets and like smart the
smartphone as a gadget is kind of like
it's run its run a very fast race and
ass now we kind of know it's mark now
it's coughing and wheezing right but you
know like the age of like slider qwerty
keyboards and like flipping phones or
like we've settled on basically this
right well it's how many slider qwerty
phones droid for check it out no I
refuse I will not check out the droid
for your lost market but i think that
the pc and the tablet because of windows
8 i think we're gonna see an enormous
fluria form factor well that that's the
to me like I feel like the look I see
people on planes all the time with those
laptop docks yeah I you know for their
iPad yeah where you're typing with I
feel like we're not anywhere near what
we think is they actually the best use
for i mean i think i will say this you
know like out there making that the
service is 69 right i think that's a
weird screen like i don't think you want
to hold this screen in your hands what
is this a 13 no it's a 15 well you
definitely want to hold it but uh but
like an 11-inch macbook air screen yeah
would be awkward i think even now we're
kind of like hey you know what's weird
to hold your hands as a 10 inch screen
yeah i think that's like why people are
like even talking about 7-inch tablets
it depends really is a very comfortable
form factor i think that weird eyes it
was the first thing I noticed about the
nexus 7 when I got it was that it it's
super easy to hold this it's the perfect
format it you can you can take this
thing with you and sometimes I'll be
there saying and I don't know if I want
to take the ipad and so that's a little
bulky with this you chuck this Engleman
and I think that's and that's that's a
beauty and I think it's part of the
reason there's the 7-inch the 7-inch
thing is happening I was doing it also
i'm sure they're gonna be like my guess
is 249 is my
yeah whatever price point they're gonna
have gurnam they're gonna do 49 to 49
really is really like a forget about it
yeah sorry whose and who's not gonna buy
that yeah poor people I mean mainly no
I'm talking about any listeners in the
context of this show but listen to the
show everybody's gonna go by for some
sort of weird political reason yeah um
but you know they'll probably do zone
where it's like look it's the same size
as a kindle fire but we've used a
smaller bezels to make a larger screen
or saying you know whatever kind of
fancy stuff that they'll do but I think
that um they're saying in the Jackals in
the chat room there's no way they're
gonna do it last shackles 300 well
they're saying but people said as I
thought is 300 people said they were
gonna sell the ipad four thousand
dollars yeah they did it for 500 I think
they're looking for another like blow
your mind price point yeah I think they
have to be on this and does how does
then you keep holding this up what do we
do it we've actually had a lot of good
conversation about this 299 for this but
so the thing I you know the important so
then is it's a decision between they're
not gonna price it lower than this well
but is this is on so this is something
different problem we've been arguing
about I think like having these
conversations and I've kind of come
around to the idea that like I in my
mind I'm like but then it would be the
same price but it's like well there's
does that matter because you're not
gonna go like well I want a tablet but
maybe I'll just buy this Ridge you're
saying it's not an either/or you're not
sensible chosen so it's in about eight
inches from now they're gonna make a
decision eight inches versus four inches
they don't do the same thing now you
don't slide them into your front pocket
right you know one is like you throw in
your bag one is you put in your pocket i
would i would say that major cost center
of this thing is to display cut that by
the way it's great um it's good keeping
that thing is really i like this right a
little bracelet thing on loop josh is
really psyched that thing has like the
brand-new in-cell touch retina display
and that is the the best display apple
can make yeah it is it the same exact
same exact way as the phone it's a that
thing is great everyone moves to think
scholar op in it this this month I'm and
they can't love the strap yeah but a
smaller iPad will have a much cheaper
display right it's gonna have yeah 1024
768 so that's a good read no that's a
great point it's not gonna be retina we
know that well I well we know they may
find a way to call a retina I don't know
what was a ppi beyond that yeah I'll be
168 same is never done
it's not gonna be random so that's
that's the thing you want you want super
portable and you on retina get the ipod
yeah any features i think it's a cheap
thing a cheap thing yeah if you want to
render that doesn't make cheap things
well okay let's talk about this easy
you'll toss one surprising no no my it's
cool just yeah it finally is happy yeah
no I don't know if he's happy I'm sorry
so what it what is this thing here see
ipod nano sony see what he's in banana
it's a piece i'm not a piece i mean it's
so really nice you're upsetting it's not
a watch anymore I'm upset because it's
it's such a it's got a clock I do
anything so it's this is the best i pod
for my value or audio listeners or video
listeners guys I'm perplexed we don't we
don't you know we don't think if we
don't split our listeners like well the
we give them all is listeners okay
because here's know where's my tab you
can we send any of tiredness nation they
can't say okay you just roll with it
alright cool um but here's my thing is I
would describe what's odd to me about
this is that yeah I thought that the
square form factor was very successful
and popular and people were really into
the idea that they gotta wear it as a
watch and a super miniature and a touch
screen a lot of companies based there
there here's our beautiful video of it
what is the reason there you go again
like with the fly now I know the ones
are green here I know the answer to
watch mozzies no I don't know it's not a
soul on the plane now I am I and if they
are I pity them I am a hundred percent
confident the reason they change this
thing every two years it's a steady
ground is to nets on a playground it's
to juice sales this thing is a trifle
you buy for 150 bucks you throw in a
stocking you say I bought you the new
ipod nano if you may change the way it
looks it's new I mean this is the same
argument that we've making with the
iphone so we're getting the Holy John
Geno Smith I mean the holidays but if
you've ever been getting a mint green
but if you think about the things they
took out of that touch from two years
ago this video man our videos are really
nice um this makes me want to buy one
yeah this is the apple should hire you
guys to make these but so here's my
thing about it and I review this yeah I
was right um we're taught me yes we're
talking about in our reviews of these
things um yeah we released were
segwaying but so we reviewed the touch
David review the touch and the touch is
like it's
expensive it's three hundred dollars but
it's also clearly a spectacular product
hmm right it's super thin it's beautiful
it comes in these colors it has the same
displays video Indiana showing the video
that i would say you're John I've
talking about it every time so I mean
the ipod touch if I if look if I if I
had an android phone I want to play with
with iOS the ipod touch is the placed
right it is a great product um it's just
a little bit expensive all right this
thing is like the Nano is a product from
two or three years ago it's not it's not
the thing that people want what kind of
numbers do they do on these things how
many days it declines every year and
that's always half the sales but that's
the touch yeah the ipod numbers decline
every quarter yeah and the ipod touch is
generally half the sales so this isn't
this is a there are things i really like
about the touch and there are things
that I don't like about the touch like a
new touch there's a little too much
going on in the back of it yeah I think
you x rays are just too many jerseys it
there's a camera there's a saying
there's this little blonde tena you've
got the camera and flash and everything
feels it then you get the logo and then
you can see a little bit of it the
headphone can I just feel like I wish
some of this I mean obviously you can't
move the camera if you take out the
strap that little button is like how do
you do this just pull it off I don't
think this supposed to pop up man yeah
it's awesome it's done it's yeah we sit
it popped up there you yeah Oh like
that's cool like right it's like a
little apple design flourished it's like
cool right but it's also we're only days
away from stories of these being snapped
off I mean could you definitely could
it's like one that we first came out and
people kept on throwing the remotes
through there 30 TVs and windows yeah
you trying to break it now I mean you're
just seeing how much it takes I mean if
I was would that be a problem I do we
have to mail this back but um no this is
nice what colors that come in oh god a
million come green green red black
yellow yellow black white white white
silver silver what color would you get
black it looks awesome black I feel like
I would get yellow it's another one of
those colors that it's like the Nokia
look at that I think I get the pink in
the middle yeah it's pink I think they
do a red one but it's like the HTC
phones where they lick one you look fast
as a set ooh hey see the work if you
want this Lou yeah yeah yeah yeah it's
for thank you anyhow okay we're just I
don't know we're talking about now so I
want I with us for one second okay cuz i
gave this a very great an assault or air
review but a fair of you yeah uh cuz you
know the thing about the nano to me is
that the the equation for apple is not
just ipod it's always ipod + itunes
mm-hmm and this is like an extension of
itunes this is like you made a lot of
your intro is actually really funny in
the review where you're just kind of
like it's all about my reason AAC yeah
that's radio but like you know what you
know what I don't do anymore i don't use
itunes so when I I went home to review
this I had a boot up itunes and like
plug into it and see what files were in
my itunes and it's like oh I stopped
listening to music in this way three
years ago I feel like we're right buddy
you did that because you're an iPhone
own and I what do you think the
percentage of people who buy one of
these no but so the problem is not this
that's what I'm saying the problem is
the iphone this is the promise itunes
mmm the bottom wit yo that apple's model
for distributing music to the world
right and then putting it on this thing
is completely backward yeah but it's
backwards in like five years right now
it's extremely profitable I mean I hear
what you're saying I use audio and
Spotify and I want to just have a
subscription service and we've talked
about this like that like there's a lot
of people who still use an itunes no I
mean that's the thing the majority of
people are like lit they're seriously
pre-ordering the new britney spears
record right now right and they're like
cannot wait to cuz that available to
download i think so no I don't think so
but I know she's doing one but like they
cannot wait to download the mp3 s yeah
AAC's you know I think we're I think we
happen to be in that in a what are you
okay what are you listening to on your
on your iPhone my iphone I mean I listen
to Spotify and I have like my library
and then like I don't you know like i
enjoy where does your library come from
but I get we've sites files yeah I
understand my tunes right no no clown
yeah I mean Spotify streams you the
files yeah but you see I yeah i'm
testing but his library no that's its oh
it's up there on that ya see I'm
old-fashioned i use ITI use the heck out
this is a right here you go regular
a user it's an academy that's what I'm
saying is that regular people now how
much music sighs I you know not a ton of
it might buy an album every week or two
you do that much that's an extraordinary
man that's a lot of music that's like
that's like you're spending you know do
the math I don't know 40 bucks a month
possible times 12 it's possible what is
that 40 times twelve anybody maybe it's
much less than that god I'm gonna do it
for 80 it's a bad habit don't seem like
that much money for three yards in here
you know I'm music is awesome on let's
know I know but here's this variable
here's the thing why is it I have
literally a quarter of the problems a
month I mean what maybe get shut out I
maybe tell you i don't i don't know that
spotify and rdio exist though I know I
you Spotify but the point is this
sometimes you don't have an internet
connection you know what Anna you can
take them to your devices you can
download it on yeah yeah check that out
you're like I I'm old-fashioned oh but
that's the key and a lot of the time
I'll have and I'll have an ipod why and
I'll why because I like you know it's
small he's checking your pocket you
don't want a device you want to use
anything if you offline a little bit
you've seen one of these right yeah
extremely smartly these are designed to
go in your pocket oh I have it in my
pocket right though the phone on me I
having a phone in my poverty of a five
yes you like it it's great have you used
the maps I don't like the maps you need
yo knees caffeine do i yeah okay oh god
everybody that's how check it out this
is by the way our office every morning
comes in and everyone has like impaired
PTSD I get worries about scuffs like
this is like can I tell you I like the
scuffing yeah that's cool I think if
this is what happens when you look can
you go get a shot of this look at a k-
shoot us look at a beautiful can see
that like a camera yeah god no but I
mean it's got it you want it to have a
little character yeah you know it's like
leather is not cool until it looks like
beat up that's why I applied when I biol
of a jacket I just punch ganya you got a
botch it you guys ever burn burn CDs
anymore for mortal listening burn what
burn a CD what bees oh you remember this
definitely data there's it listen
there's a lot of people and their their
mo is they buy the music they download
it they make it a mix
essentially is he guys me you may
remember oh yeah all the time that's a
CD and they put him a listen to that in
their car and I get a hold of a book of
him come on I did that this is real yeah
I did that though he's Josh get one of
those you get what you do is you take
the CD player are you a cassette player
yeah and then you get one epic to set up
with the wires announced in your CV to
use one of those in my in my hondas
there are a lot of people that you love
me too yeah and my honda wait what year
what year was your Sarah I think it was
a late late 80s I had a 99 yeah which I
love ya my god woman which my mother let
me tell you a quick story my story let's
hear which is similar but my mother
stole it I know my mother my air
conditioning was broken I went home to
visit my parents my air conditioning was
broken my mother was very very hot
summer yeah and she was very upset she
was like we have a guy who does because
they had a Honda it's like we have a guy
who fixes Honda's like leave it here
we'll take it to him will get the air
conditioning fixed so you know we want
to do this for you and I fought with her
as I I don't need the air conditioning
it's not a big deal whatever and I and
finally she wore me down and my friend
Nick was like look just let her just let
her keep through things you'll want to
do this for you I think it'll make her
very happy let her fix the car for you
you know it's a small thing you can take
a you know ride with me back to wherever
you were going I don't know is it to New
York I guess and so I was like fine I
left the car there and then like two
days later a landscape or backed his
like rig into into my car totaled it
nice and that was it my car was gone
your mom did a nice thing for you then
yeah was wonderful she convinced me to a
guy yeah I inherited my sister's 94
record oh this is I like where this is
brown and brown brown so we call I said
like a leg off the lot like it was elder
was that like a brief parents my parents
like you know she was the the oldest
child in but you know she was the A+
student yeah it's a good the good she
was the good one no she's impossible to
live up to and they were like you're you
know we want to get you a car anything
you want and she picked a brown 4 door
accord weird because she was right
sensible said something like you know I
color that they won't pull you over no
matter how fast you're going yeah
she would almost be like sure I keep
keep you saw but she we both she wants
the University which is a bad
neighborhood in chicago and the car got
broken into so many times but by the
time I inherited it the area where the
styria would go was just a blank space
somewhere and we just had a steer here
like in it yeah and I would just tell
you could table anyway you see ray I'm
just like take it looking actual the
whole Union not just lady just run the
party yeah yeah it was great I an
amazing car I had a button on the
shifter that cut was labeled sport mode
yeah yeah there's nothing about this car
i think i think in the in the and i
don't know when this was but i think in
the in the late 90s early aughts uh
Honda's worthy the most broken into
stone for stone man for sure cuz you
could disassemble one of those and have
the parts sold in like how is that right
yeah two other honda another have the
center stack rebuild i'm pretty sure i
just bought somebody else's incentives
to put it right in there um all right we
should move on from whatever it is that
we're supposed to be talking is this
what people tuned in for to your show
this is I don't think say well now I
really prefer you to do so this is 149
you know how much I saw the ipod touch 4
199 the other older well but that's a go
that's the Delta between but I'm saying
if you're buying this you should spend
the 50 bucks in by the touch it's the
same storage the same features you want
to sync it and play files never let the
guys in the booth and talked and they
don't even have a Mike yeah Mike
sharissa don't usually I can't hear them
Michael's like dying to talk I could
love to say something my fiance
acknowledges like I Dan people that
Brian they're part of your crew that the
team in the area oh I just realized damn
but you brought your Hattie is your
she's my producer producer back in there
and she was like making a crazy face and
thumbs up in just a second ago but but I
realized Hattie is a real name I accused
her of having a fake tits a real and I
just realized that there's a character
on the show Parenthood named Hattie I
said sure Jen that's short for something
yes it is not hurt you have a real name
the time what's your real name no that's
our holy you use the medicine or license
I think I
sure I think how do you feel for
something you should ask your parents
can you Mike her can you put her on the
mica mica know there's a mic right there
yep Mike yeah John is shaking his head
you just gotta say all on the show
and it's like to apologize to the
listeners I'm Cassandra for the verge
casts existing yeah you know we tried we
thought we could do it the right way and
this is the best I gotta say something
listeners guesses and what how do you
might say it stand for tweet ow we only

tease or two DS you think oh okay that
is a fake name that's right that is the
Hatti that is like Maddie but you messed

hell which I actually prefer i prefer

even know it to the 60s is commander one
that's the standard now that's
commendable okay fine when was fail safe
release I don't even know what it is
safe oh you haven't seen failsafe I to
you okay but the hell safe is based on a
book i believe called failsafe which is
the same thing that dr. Strangelove is
based on okay but it's like a serious
version kind of of it it's really good i
thinkI think was released in 1958 i
could be wrong could be 59 this is my
thing 58 rigid I nice Angus 50 ah 64 Oh

bump you that's how do you ask your
parents about the name cuz I think it's
a real it's a real problem all right
please I don't think that had idea all
right goodbye a Benjamin st. really did
kai slam it yeah there's one more thing
talking yes and it's a topic of did we
talk about every week uh the Nexus oh
yes big rumors on the next yeah I just a
rumor is a truly disappoint me oh so the
rumors are that LG's making the next
Nexus phone yep or a nexus phone there's
pictures all over the place they don't
know a shot but there are there are
pictures of a phone which looks on the
front on the face kind of like a Galaxy
Nexus on the back it looks like a disco
Barbie or something i don't really know
this is your ollie McQueen's more
fashionable and don't mind the weird
pattern on the back what I mind is
everything else about the phone I think
the shape of it is ugly it looks like
it's using cheap plastic garbage yep I I
actually hope this is not I hope this is
like a device but not the device like if
this is the flagship like if this is the
best that Google if this is Google's a
game like by doing this device like come
on guys I thought you part of an
interesting point actually on Twitter
you mentioned data it says with Google
eight on the look yeah raining that's
not what the Nexus phones do so so the
the original g1 so he pointed out to me
says with Google on the yep but that was
before they even had this concept of
like of android phones as like these
flagship phones you know do you want to
wipe that down that was in it actually
uh Olivia and wiped it on for me so it
should be good to go this is not dance
earpiece as far as I can tell
the phrase Olivia wiped it down for me
doesn't sound just watching the studio
man polite you sure so I'm gonna I'm
just gonna risk it um you know this is
the last time you see this ear well you
know I mean I where do we say your piece
hey remember that verge cast was the
last time you saw Ross is here nah it's
just hanging out thing nothing but this
way van hey van good right after the
right after the verdict is his aunt
going to this is Vegas reverb yeah I was
saying yeah we just went through this
with the iphone yes uh you you know it's
like Victor's boring apple fanboy say it
wasn't it wasn't it wasn't it and then
it was it I don't if Apple can't hold it
down I don't think LG can will let me
offer something if let me know more you
sides are showing me let me just well
actually you first let me just secure
wagging your finger you suggest
something to you yeah uh here's the
thing nobody's checking out LG's
production lines and no he's checking
out Samsung's production lines and
there's scrutiny is there's no not in
anywhere near the scrutiny that Apple
has on their products like you know so I
feel like there's so it is possible to
keep a secret in some ways maybe even
easier than Apple because there's in
this intense I agree oh no wait may I
finish no by the way is the vice
presidential debate on tonight o'clock
Eastern oh my god oh my god yeah hmm oh
my god yeah okay I God anyhow I was just
thinking of what it would look like in
my mind's eye uh my brain paste so late
night not saying anything no they're
gonna be saying something and it's gonna
be crazy okay what was it saying oh the
other thing is that that it is possible
this is one of we've heard they're gonna
be multiple devices I'm not trying to
like be an apologist cuz like this very
well could be the nexus phone but I do
think the with google thing is
interesting it's one of two one of two
things makes this factoid interesting
one it's either for some for some reason
google is changing the way it addresses
these phones as like a product like with
google versus Google as a nexus tension
axis phone and it's with Google that to
me is highly suggested that there will
be other with google phones that will be
a cause you didn't do this once before
the whole with Google Google Experience
go
yeah it was when I first launched anger
okay right so that means my way but
nothing more I this is what if I about
this brand mean it also says not for
sale and giant letters on it they could
change the branding I know but this is
well but each other with Google will be
on there at all so my feeling is like it
could mean that they're changing if this
is the next as they're changing the way
the Nexus program works right or
alternately this is not the Nexus but
you know two things are possible what is
that that's the front they mean there
are pictures now of it next to an iphone
but seems you think here's why this
things out there and it's running
jellybean and you know why should not
look that's I doesn't make eyes of the I
why is there so much room on the sides
of the icons in the doc and anybody tell
me doesn't it seem odd to you how many
area yours maybe you should have one
more icon in there know how many icons
were there five yes it's like the
property or you know maybe it's the same
that's the same that's so it's not yeah
the screens right bigger no but that's
what I'm saying isn't that odd if you're
making the Nexus phone was it have like
well when you'd be like well jelly beans
can be perfect oh there we go that looks
weird to me something's weird about the
screens water it's is it you're saying
it's wider than this yeah why I mean
please making it I why would it be wider
than this can you LG be at this square
phone can anybody tell me why this it's
a it's a phone who knows which to me
switching to me now I mean like great
job on switching I'm just saying LG does
what it is why don't you want to make it
wider than this god this looks actually
kind of small in my head doesn't look
like a big vote doesn't have a big head
give me your give me that ipod touch
yeah i got my iphone give me your iphone
can i get key unlock this but I broke
down and perfect like I'm just like
standing here like that oh I turn this
off here yeah that's fine that's for you
it's not gonna be quite the same here
i'm gonna be that person in the picture
yeah see these these don't look crazy
different to me they totally do a little
bit one looks skinny that is not in
focus hold that by your head yeah don't
make me do this hey hey do you want to
do with this thing now I'm over this it
doesn't matter who cares you know what
guys it's not about what's on the
outside except it is no damn better look
you're looking at the with Google logo
and I'm looking at an LG phone that's
running stock jelly bean so what
anything could run saw jelly bean but
here's the thing nothing does
here maybe somebody's talking about I i
if this is the phone why would they keep
the exact same basic design language as
the Galaxy Nexus like why would they
make they like head well in the photo
year your dad LG that made a phone that
look like Samsung's phone you're asking
why lg-made something that looks like
Samsung I don't think LG's that look
they have the optimus 4x or whatever
it's called the 4x HD or whatever then
the stupid name of the product is but it
looks like it's actually like a pretty
nice looking phone it's a square but it
there say this is based on the the
optimus G or whatever it is like there's
two reasons well I give it an honest f
google has been designing these phones
or however long and they all look like
that right no next now looks like that
they're both Samsung products well I who
said they have to look all look the same
like a cheap piece of plastic sure but
like Google's drive well there are even
as Google's driving businesses I mean I
say the way nice to go say this if your
argument is that LG's driving the design
LG to my I don't think this phone is
like hideously ugly that the Galaxy
Nexus when it came out when it came out
yeah this was this was a much classier
thinner variation on like the plasticky
android phone sure i actually thought
like and i went back a look to my review
I say like it's like one of the nicest
phones on the market and it was at the
time and it was nicer than most of the
other android phones they were out there
and it is it was really thin and
whatever you know but like this to me is
like so iterative of the other like you
know it's so I mean I don't these two
things I don't don't make me here I want
to answer a question really about why
you thanks calling you know somewhat
can't make a quick can't keep a secret I
got an email yeah someone's giving you
an even 40 mil forget it just wait leave
this uh no see things like everyone when
Apple makes a phone they know what
factors to look at you know who's making
the hardware uncle makes the next device
we're all assuming at LG from one point
at what point did eligible it's always
walks on factory everyone well I'm
accessioning that's actually not true of
it um but like what point did we start
assuming LG was the Nexus device maker
the next round this is just a rumor know
we'd heard this rumor has been around
well the wall street journal actual
reported like in of course you know This
report I don't know how true or not or
not it is but they reported there were
going to be multiple Nexus devices
multiple phones yeah and I in a comical
tablets yeah
my hope is that this is one of multiple
are there side shots now yeah this thing
is a pain like that's what I'm saying
this out this device is out this is
NASA's like cold control does not put
out stock and control bleak they never
have and I don't know why I chose like
sure whatever but here's I don't know I
just is not a nexus LG has so much
marketing potential for this phone now
because everyone assumed it was yeah
it's a seven it's so boring it's yeah
it's so boring like it's so so bored
what do you expect the next next is
going to be I don't know I saw a bunch
of really beautiful windows phone
devices introduced the HTC in the new
Lumia so I would a gorgeous like a one
of the 1x yes the one x is better
looking in this phone yeah and also like
I'd rather have something made of
polycarbonate than these like she pieces
of plastic throwing together well it
sounds like a devil you know we up or
whatever yeah I mean whatever notes its
Sparkle by the way at the back is glass
would be really funny yeah like all
things considered like oh cool you the
glass back is everybody loved those on
the iphone they never broke and sparkly
it's made of sparkles be cool if it lit
up maybe lights up yeah yeah you know
this looks like this looks like a club
bathroom yes yes it's exactly what it
looks like it looks like one of those
weird like a like a karaoke place it's
like a weird light wall or something
it's like that material it's not good
and some Google as long as I mean a
stout and like I say a nightclub and
sold it was like we should make it out
of that hey a game officially not
brought yeah well all right any other
topics that's it that's it really I mean
you want to we can keep hanging out no
was there anything we miss any big stuff
nope there at week what about what about
into that happened oh the note to you I
actually think is kind of interesting
device I think okay hear me out yeah if
it was not running this custom samsung
software mm-hmm and you know there were
like just apps that really took
advantage of it like paper they took
advantage of a device with a stylus so
there's like paper for android right for
like a five inch faux what is it 5.5
inches or something its enormous yeah
yeah and it's like you don't think about
it necessarily like a phone or you're
not using it like a phone
you know you're like this is my you know
I'm using it with a bluetooth headset or
you know it's my in between kind of I
don't know I think it something cool
about the stylist like that not for like
using the device that's the old stylist
yeah idea but for doing things with the
stylus like drawing or editing something
or writing this is what I went through
when I reviewed the note 10.1 yeah and
well that was it but that's a that was
like not a good device no but it's that
shift the contextual shift between using
the stylus and then using the device
with your finger is like a since need a
stylist but this stylus does both it
does no it doesn't improve stylus and
improved a screen stylus combo I don't
man look there's a somebody nice but use
ish man you're smearing fusion it's a
smash bag fugitive what I'd say that's
so try to tell you like I does anybody
know we're gonna figure out that I'm
scared a friends or do people know what
we're talking you know actually talk
someone who like knows their Atlanta
comedy group who made something oh
that's not a real thing yeah turquoise
cheap yeah yeah yeah what the SATs is
the joke yeah it's all joke huh clin
flossing its Dobson location I bet you
lost all I've lost all excited about it
yeah I thought like smang it was a thing
well it no it can be whatever you want
we can dream it you can see the concept
of a smash bang fusion it is insane yeah
let me smang it girl oh my god yes and
that's the verge cash for the week of
October eighth 2012 there's one thing we
could have talked about we still should
be bringing up now we're talking about
it well we ran as its magnet huh is
there a smell I I think I been ran a
really interesting report this week on
cloud clout and the thing is like
basically we were trying to think of
headlines for this and all I could come
up with is like the apocalypse is here
everyone hates this thing but it's going
to happen whether or not you want it to
happen yeah uh and I I don't man it's
your client ID father must be greater
than 35 to read this yeah but there are
like people like companies who will only
interview candidates for jobs who have a
certain clouds well I think what's most
like actually because I think what's
most amazing about cloud is they have
yet to accurately dem
straight that the Klout score is has any
has any like I think that my cloud
scoring Kim Kardashian's are like
relatively close yeah can you find out I
think that I'm like 76 and she's like 79
or something which is like I understand
we're in different professions but if
you're just going by the score number
which most people you your higher York
83 what yeah where did you see that I
just remembered i was i don't think i
may your clouds talking I'm not your
cloud sake we ran their poor the night
is a buddy told my Klout score is
Michael just look at who could get my
Klout score fastest yeah so I'm a 78 and
then you're an 83 join us what's these
meds writing notes Kim Kardashian um can
I do this yeah today is the day the Josh
made me look up Kim Kardashian oh yeah
cuz you never look up Kim Kardashian
anything 8888 kanye west's 92 okay so
whatever so you're saying I'm conniving
I'm within 984 I just want to be clear
folks from a cloud perspective I'm
within nine points of kanye west and I'm
and I'm very wooded by five points away
from Kim Kardashian yeah I mean I think
that I rest my case the show's over I'm
leaving goodbye verge I'll see you I'll
see you it Hollywood where I'll be
wearing a diamond robe yeah by the way
is that a thing I can give Kim
Kardashian plus K do not give her plus K
on celebrities photography and money oh
you have another option give her the
money give her a plus K unlike a
vandalism did he do that can you a
makeup I have no idea how to use the
service I can't believe I I can't Johnny

casual conversation good friend of mine

recently really he look at twitter
meltdown all right that's the verge cast
for this week I know but this clout
article is really good and you guys
should read it but I was gonna say is
like there's no there's no scientific
data or any data whatsoever that I can
stead I know of that says like Klout
does now look I'm not saying that maybe
it does have it may be there is like a
real
meaning to that number no but I think
