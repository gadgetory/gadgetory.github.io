this is the asus padfone that's a
product that's been rumored and talked
about for more than a year but now it's
actually being launched and if you're in
Taiwan you can actually buy one now we
still have no idea when it's coming to
the US it's still kind of a new concept
we've seen something like the PadFone
with the motorola atrix but basically
the idea is that your phone is the hub
of everything all of your data and your
apps live on your phone and then you
just plug it into these different
accessories for different needs the
actual pad phone itself is a cell phone
and it's styled a lot like some of a
Seuss's tablets guy it has the
concentric circle design it's kind of
raged on the back and it's really light
and pretty well made it's about 4.5
ounces and it's nine point two
millimeters thick which is almost
exactly the same as the iPhone 4s it
feels nice it's a little slippery to
hold but for the most part is really
well put together and well built it has
a 4.3 inch display with 960 x 540
resolution and though we kind of expect
better resolutions from high-end phones
at this point it's not a bad one it
washes out colors a little bit and you
can definitely see individual pixels but
we've been seeing displays like this for
a while and we're pretty much used to
them the ped phone also who runs a
fairly stock version of android 4.0
there are a couple of little changes
like the notification pull down and the
keyboard both of which have been
restyled but for the most part where
you're getting is pure ice cream
sandwich the phone's performance is
really good too it's running a dual-core
1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon processor and
it's the same one we've seen in phones
like the HTC One X and it performs
really really well everything's fast and
fluid on the phone even as you move
through apps for play intensive games it
just works really well reception of call
quality we're also solid in our tests we
use an AT&amp;amp;T sim card which worked well
though the phone is definitely not
optimized for US carriers yet it also
has a solid battery life you'll
definitely get a full day of use out of
the phone even with pretty heavy use
honestly though the PadFone by itself
isn't especially interesting what's
really interesting is all the
accessories that it comes with most
importantly there's the PadFone station
which turns the PadFone from a phone
into a tablet it looks a bit like the
transformer pad and the transformer
prime but it has a door in the back that
you open and slide the phone into the
tablet itself is actually totally
useless until there's a phone inside the
phone connects via the HDMI USB and
battery ports and as soon as you plug it
in it starts to provide all of the
tablet software at that point what you
get is basically just a near stock
Android 4.0 tablet it has a
10.1 inch 1280 by 800 display and
literally everything is powered by your
phone that means all your apps all your
settings everything gets preserved
they're just running in a way that makes
more sense on a tablet now you can even
make phone calls in tablet mode or send
text you'll want a Bluetooth headset for
the tablet mode because you look kind of
ridiculous with it up to your face and
for that there's even this crazy stylist
headset hybrid device that comes with
the tablet it looks just like a stylus
and it even has the rubber tip on it but
it's also a Bluetooth headset and you
just press one button on it and you can
take a phone call while holding a pen to
your ear you look crazy but it actually
works pretty well unfortunately
performance in this particular mode
isn't great it takes a while to connect
sometimes you get this spinning white
dial that sometimes doesn't ever go away
until you disconnect and reconnect it
again and things just tend to slow down
a lot sometimes it's really seamless
like if you're on a phone call and you
pull up the phone it just keeps right on
working but other apps like Netflix or
Instapaper will kill themselves and make
you run them again the tablet also just
gets really heavy when you have the two
pieces together you're almost two pounds
which actually feels like more than it
is as you hold it one huge upside of the
PadFone station is the battery is just
enormous at 6600 milliamp hours and it's
almost four times the size of the
PadFone itself and it'll actually charge
the phone when there when the two are
connected there's also the PadFone
station dock a 1.5 pound keyboard dock
that connects to the PadFone station and
the PadFone and turns the whole thing
into basically a laptop the ped phone is
a really really awesome concept your
phone as the hub for all your data and
all your apps and you just add on these
modular pieces as you need them the
performance still isn't quite there
though as a tablet the PadFone isn't
nearly up to par even with some of these
suits other tablets and some of the
features on the phone itself like the
display are kind of a turn off as well
but I'm more convinced than ever that
this kind of device is the future and a
sous is definitely closer to hitting the
goal than anyone has before like
Motorola with the atrix the ped phone
right now from the crazy stylist to all
the different pieces is as much a
novelty as it is useful device but the
potential for this really does seem
almost unlimited</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
