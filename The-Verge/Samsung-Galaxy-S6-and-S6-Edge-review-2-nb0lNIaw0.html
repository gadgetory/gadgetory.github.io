been good enough
yeah they felt cheap and they were laden
with overbearing software on top of
Android but they usually did their job
better than other Android phones but
what if Samsung phones didn't feel cheap
and plasticky compared to the iPhone
what if the software wasn't the
perpetual annoyance what if Samsung
tried to out Apple Apple when it comes
to hardware design well we know the
answer to all those questions
it's the galaxy s6
actually it's two phones because Samsung
has made another version called the
galaxy s6 edge that has a screen that
curves around to the left and the right
side of the device both are basically
identical otherwise and they're gorgeous
for the first time in forever
Samsung has managed to produce a phone
that flat-out looks and feels great
instead of a plastic back in faux
plastic rims the s6 is all glass and
metal where before there was a sense of
Machinists and cheapness and flimsiness
to the galaxy phones now it's hard
Gorilla Glass 4 well sculpted aluminium
edges and perfectly machined speaker
grilles and ports yes you can't deny it
the galaxy s6 looks a lot like the
iPhone especially on the bottom where
the similarities are so stark I have to
imagine apples layers are already
drafting up papers and Samsung took
another idea from Apple the fingerprint
sensor it works with just a light touch
now instead of a swipe it's much much
more accurate than the s5 was and it's
faster too it's maybe not quite as good
as the iPhones but it's miles better
than any other unlocking scheme I've
used on any other Android phone yeah you
can get angry about the copying or make
jokes but me I'm just happy that Samsung
has found a way to finally finally
create a phone that makes me feel good
when I hold it now making this beautiful
machine required trade-offs and the ones
that might make hardcore Android fans
turn up their noses the battery is
sealed in now there's no SD card slot
for removable storage and it's not
waterproof anymore either
I'm also a little worried that it might
be a little bit more delicate than the
last galaxy phone and that the gorilla
glass might shatter when I drop it but
to me every single one of those
trade-offs is worth it the only real
complaint I have while the hardware is
the huge camera bulge on the back of the
phone it's a big ungainly blemish on an
otherwise wonderful design another
wonderful thing the screen I don't know
anybody that actually needs a screen
with this much resolution
it's a 5.1 inch Super AMOLED display on
both devices at 2560 by 1440 pixels
that's 577 pixels per inch which is 40%
more dense than what you'd find an
iPhone 6 plus it's just insane
radical overkill and I love it
everything is sharp colors pop and they
aren't oversaturated in the way that
Samsung used to do things as long as
we're talking about screens let's talk
about the edge variant of the s6 it's
about a hundred bucks more and for that
hundred bucks you get a pretty unique
looking phone but the extra
functionality those edges give you isn't
really all that great you can swipe in
from the home screen to get color coded
favorite contact shortcuts when those
people call you the edge lights up with
that color when the phone is faced down
you can also get a night clock and
finally there's a thing that shows basic
information like weather and random
headlines from Yahoo but the gesture
used to get it to show up is weird and
the feature seems buggy and laggy
basically don't buy the edge for the
software features because they don't
amount to much more than gimmicks but
you could buy it for the wow factor or
maybe the nice feeling of pulling in a
sidebar menu from a curved piece of
glass it is really nice but the
trade-off is that the edges feel a
little bit sharper and less comfortable
for me and I think for most people the
trade-off just isn't worth it I like the
regular s6 better the camera it's pretty
good it's probably one of the best
cameras I've used on an Android phone
and Samsung has always been at the top
of that heat but the question everybody
always wants to know is is it as good as
an iPhone and well mostly no but it's
damn close the 16 megapixel sensor with
optical image stabilization tends to be
a little bit too much on the yellow side
with white balance and especially in
low-light shots it can be really
aggressive in lightening things up too
much and as always with high megapixel
cameras you can see artifacting when you
zoom in more often than you like but
this is probably the closest any Android
phone has ever come to the just shoot
mentality I love about the iPhone
especially with real-time HDR I found
myself trusting the galaxy s6 to get it
right instead of futzing around with the
settings I also love that you can double
tap the home button to launch the camera
a camera that launches fast from
anywhere that you can actually trust is
a huge step forward for Android that's
all the good news now some bad news
battery life has been really
inconsistent for me I'm mostly getting
through a day but it's by the skin of my
teeth
it seems worse when you use games in the
video it's better with basic web
browsing and email I've definitely seen
both versions of this phone crap out
around 6:00 p.m. at least the s6
supports both major wireless charging
standards and fast charging via cable so
it isn't too hard to top off in terms of
speed though the s6 is as fast as any
Android phone I've ever used in fact the
phones tend to get warm and I don't
really know if that's by design or not
there's an insanely powerful octa-core
processor inside this thing so it's not
entirely surprising if it runs a little
hot I am impressed that it can run two
apps in split screen or windowed mode
without breaking a sweat
even if those features aren't really all
that useful on a phone this size I did
see some stutter and some bugs on the
first day or two but t-mobile pushed an
update that seemed to settle things down
I do wish the t-mobile would have pushed
an update to get rid of the aggressive
crap where it installed almost all of it
is redundant and annoying but Samsung
has toned down its customizations the
software design has stayed mostly true
to Google's vision of material design
for apps and most of the crazy Samsung
features are off by default they're all
there if you want them and I find myself
using a few but mostly they just stay
out of the way the Galaxy s6 and the s6
edge are easily the best phone Samsung
has ever made and I think they're the
best Android phones you can get today
the screens are just Walker's good the
design is lovely the cameras are solid
and they're fast
Samsung even seems to finally be
learning that it needs to chill out with
its software my only reservation is that
battery life isn't quite what I'd hope
but it's more a matter of being an
average thing at an otherwise
outstanding phone between the two here's
my advice go look at the edge it's
pretty and cool but then get the regular
s6 it just feels nicer and I promise you
you won't miss the gimmicks the last
year so hasn't been kind to Samsung
iPhones are big now and lots of
companies are making cheap phones that
are good enough to beat them on the low
end
Samsung really needed to hit a home run
here just to stay in the game and the s6
knocks it out of the park</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
