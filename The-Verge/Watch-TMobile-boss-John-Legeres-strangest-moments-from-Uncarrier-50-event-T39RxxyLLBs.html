event good evening everybody
if they gave you any of those hologram
cameras you can point them at me and see
if they'll tell you who I am I hope you
got the goody bags it should be an
energy drink right next to the doobie in
the bag this group is not a plan they're
out of their goddamn mind we make it so
complicated that is a complete crock of

why don't make Antion Verizon offer
unlimited data plans a they can't be
their greedy bastards
see these maps we keep seeing these maps
are you sick and tired of these maps
it's so much faster than even the
laboratory promises of whenever the hell
sprint finishes the spark network we are
absolutely kicking their ass on both
fronts
I'm absolutely out of my mind six
billion dollars that creates this
cacophony of the biggest in
history maps and charts and promises and
happy friendlies running through the
goddamn store what the do I care
about all that every time we do
something people don't tell me hey
that's a great idea these high and
mighty do Appa lists that are raping you
for every penny you have if they could
do something nice for you they would the
 hate you I promised myself I
wasn't gonna be angry today so I'm gonna
be happy the last time I had a seven
night stand was approximately never I
don't give a crap if you like Spotify
Rhapsody Pandora iHeartRadio iTunes
radio slacker Beatport milk I don't
you're gonna use beats every goddamn
note you listen to including the ads
we're gonna charge you for and that guy
that seems happy that makes me sick is
gonna come in and you're gonna listen to
him for hours until you stab somebody
why because we can I have two quick
answers I don't give a and I'll
celebrate everything we do is forever we
will not stop I can go out to the bar
with my best friend me I can order
another round for both of us I think
I've made my comments clear about the
young guy in the AT&amp;amp;T family different
searching porn
we're not trying to make money on this
how many of you right now here use other
than t-mobile and the rescue stupid the
biggest question I usually get in these
events we usually end with which is is
that it what I'd like to do is answer a
question by telling you yes
there's so many things that I could say
Roger so many go stay for the concert
type bourbon
I sold guys got to stick together</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
