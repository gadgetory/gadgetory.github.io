because it is. Boston-based VirZoom buys its
bikes from a Chinese manufacturer, and transforms
them with sensors and software into a virtual
reality motion controller.
Positional tracking via a PlayStation Camera
tracks your head movements, while the handle
bars remain fixed. That means you lean left
and right to change direction while moving
and use triggers near your hands to interact
with objects. And of course, the faster you
pedal the bike, the faster you move inside
the game. VirZoom is essentially the first
company to try and crack locomotion in VR
without wiring you up with a vest and gloves
and setting you loose in a wide-open room,
where you’re prone to bumping into things
or run the risk of falling flat on your face.
I should note that the VirZoom should be avoided
if you’re prone to motion sickness. VR from
the likes of Sony and Oculus is now at a point
where it’s diminished many of the disorienting
side effects of having a screen encapsulating
your face, but the feeling of moving in VR
while pedaling is an altogether different
sensation that tricks the brain in unique
ways.
Using VirZoom in combination with PlayStation
VR brought me right up against my discomfort
threshold, but it never crossed it. So if
you can handle reading on a bus, you can most
likely handle VirZoom.
That said, it’s a can be an exhilarating
experience to match physical exercise with
in-game play. The three mini-games I played
using the VirZoom weren’t great; the graphics
were sub-par and the mechanics resembled age-old
arcade games. But they're perfect experiential
test cases for the company’s product. I
lassoed bandits while riding a horse, flew
through a canyon on a winged animal, and raced
at high speeds in a multiplayer car game.
All the while, the feeling of touching the
ground after soaring through the air and speeding
up and slowing down by changing my pedal movements
left me shocked at how well even low-res games
can replicate the sensations of the real world.
It’s also a great workout. I was sweating
after the first 10 minutes, and it left me
with an appreciation for Sony’s VR design,
which covers your forehead with a comfortable
spongy material. I could easily see the VirZoom
being a more outlandish way to stay in shape
for the VR enthusiast who hates going for
a run.
VirZoom wants developers to build better games
for its platform, and it’s selling a $10
a month subscription service. The company
says that gets you new games down the line
and updates to current titles, as well fitness
tracking information and online multiplayer.
Whether developers can create more compelling
titles remains to be seen. But VirZoom will
be compatible with PlayStation VR, the consumer
Oculus Rift and HTC’s Vive headset when
the devices all launch some time next year,
so it’s casting a wide net.
For about $200 for the first 300 units sold
and $250 at retail, the VirZoom is not exactly
cheap. But for the price of about five months
at the gym, you get a crazy fun way to stay
in shape and play VR video games.</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
