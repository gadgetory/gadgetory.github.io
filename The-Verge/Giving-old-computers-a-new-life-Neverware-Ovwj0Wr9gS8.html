king technology is becoming increasingly
important to a whole variety of things
that we're doing and we'll only be so
more going forward but having said that
technology infrastructure issues are
getting to be much more complicated and
much more challenging for the Family
Academy in Brooklyn there's barely
enough budget to pay a part-time IT
staffer to keep a few dozen ten-year-old
machines running smoothly as we all know
budget is a big issue and one of the
things that we were not able to do was
to provide our students with new updated
computing equipment many schools have
computers nowadays but they suffer from
being in many cases pretty old many of
our students had to share computers
because we couldn't keep enough
computers working at any given time
enter never wear a New York startup
that's using age-old techniques from the
mainframe computing era to transform
barely functioning machines into
top-of-the-line supercomputers for a
fraction of the standard cost never
where uses a set of technologies known
as desktop virtualization never where
technology we're able to do is we're
able to push more power and performance
to the end computer without having to
throw out an entire otherwise entirely
good system a single powerful server
called the juice box becomes the brains
for the entire system the outdated
machines become the clients essentially
dumb screens with up to 150 computers
powered by a single juice box computers
no longer need to be individually
maintained now you have a single master
image you have an intelligent server
that can do things like automatically
address viruses and all the school needs
to do is maintain that master image and
they no longer have to run around
playing whack-a-mole with all the
computers that they currently have in
theory a ten-year-old machine could run
like a supercomputer and the cost of
maintenance is centered around a single
set of servers instead of dozens of
different workstations all around the
school
the computers were using here about ten
years old and we are now able to make
them run like brand-new Windows 7
computers students definitely notice the
difference the students and I both
commented isn't this wonderful every
single machine in this room is working
before the upgrade we had like this
little netbooks and it worked like
really really slow or sometimes just
crashing you while you're working and if
you don't know there's stuff saved that
was just terrible but after we got this
order so much faster students
appreciated it and I appreciated it very
much right now never wears major
competitors or big corporations like
Citrix and VMware downside to big
corporations like that is that they
don't provide their own hardware which
adds another factor to the mess for
schools who are looking to cut back on
costs in honor reporting the cost with
never where's approach were
substantially lower up to five times
less expensive
that being said never wears facing an
uphill battle it's pitching to a group
of clients mired in bureaucracy with
long and complex buying cycles it's also
a small scrappy startup with a six man
team meaning it can't possibly offer the
same level of customer support as a
giant like Citrix or VMware if
Neverwhere can succeed the benefits are
clear schools would spend less money
replacing and servicing old computers
meaning they'd have more on hand to
bring new technology into the classroom
when I come in there and I say hey we've
got this box that will plug into your
school to make all your old computers go
really fast their first response is I
don't believe you as soon as we actually
demonstrate for them a lot of the common
wisdom about how schools pay for things
and budget cycles just begin to fall
away so far Neverwhere has had dramatic
success with its pilot program at a
school
if the startup can do the same at the
citywide level it may be the beginning
of a transformation for technology
infrastructure it schools across the
nation when it comes to college
applications yeah a lot more of that
kind of a lot more of the work happens
online it's very convenient but it's
only convenient if you have a reliable
computer to use and so that's that's a
it's a deal maker for our students it
really really is it's a deal maker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
