heating up Apple Google Microsoft Sony
and small players like Roku all want to
take over your television and sell you
movies and TV shows the new Amazon fire
TV is a set-top box that plugs into your
TV and connects to your home's Wi-Fi or
Ethernet network it's not much different
in appearance from an Apple TV or Roku 3
though it's a little thinner and a
little larger than either of those but
the hardware design matters little this
thing is designed to sit on your home
entertainment center and get it out of
the way you control the fire TV with its
included bluetooth remote it's pretty
similar to both Apple and Roku's remotes
and offers basic controls for navigating
the interface and playing your media it
also has a button for Amazon's voice
search function which I'll get to in a
minute
Amazon's goal with the fire TV is to
address three main frustrations it's
seen from customers of the other media
streamer's speed search and
accessibility it's packed the fire TV
with a quad-core processor and lots of
RAM so it reacts quickly when you
navigate menus and load content it has a
new voice search function that works
effortlessly and completely obviates a
need to manually enter your searches
with the remote an Amazon promises to
offer you access to as many media
services as it can in addition to its
own Instant Video Service there are apps
for Hulu Plus Netflix watch ESPN crackle
and many others available at launch a
big exception here is HBO Go which isn't
available but Amazon tells us that it's
working with HBO to bring that to the
fire TV soon if you've ever used the
Kindle Fire tablet the interface of the
fire TV will be very familiar it's a
basic grid of TV shows apps and movies
that you can watch it's simple and
straightforward enough but not much
different from the interfaces on other
media streaming boxes Amazon pretty
loads your content on the fire TV before
shipping it to you so once you've
connected it to your network all of your
Instant Video purchases Amazon Cloud
Drive photos and starting next month
cloud player music are instantly
available the fire TV tries to learn
your viewing habits to preload content
before you decide to watch it so you see
fewer spinning circles and more movies
the extra hardware horsepower Amazon has
packed into the box shows it's more
responsive and loads content quicker
than a Roku or Apple TV and as with
Amazon's tablets if you're fully
invested in Amazon's ecosystem you're
going to get the most out of the fire TV
the Hulu and Netflix apps are very
similar to what you get on a Roku or
Apple TV but they are siloed from the
rest of the features Amazon is pushing
with the fire TV you can't use the
excellent voice search within Hulu or
and you still have to tediously key in
your logins using the remote things you
watch on hulu or netflix won't show up
in your recent feed and you do a lot of
bouncing between services if you're
watching video from different sources
Amazon does have some integration with
Hulu when you use a universal search
function so you can get right to a show
from the main interface but the biggest
differentiator for the fire TV is its
games offering you can get an optional
controller for 39.99 or use the included
remote to play a variety of games
ranging from arcade racer asphalt 8 to
an Amazon developed halo clone to Disney
sponsored runners for the most part the
games look nice and run well low times
can be a little long but I didn't see
any dropped frames or stuttering while
playing the game the controller is a
pretty generic clone of an Xbox
controller with dual control sticks rear
triggers and a few mushy buttons but for
the most part it gets the job done most
of the games appear to be ports from
existing Android smartphone or tablet
titles but with Amazon developing its
own with its own studio of games there's
a good chance we'll see many more titles
specifically made for the fire TV in the
future it's not something that can
compete with the Xbox one or Playstation
4 but for the casual gamer it's a nice
little addition to what is already a
capable media streaming box and it's
probably going to eat the Ouya and other
Android power gaming systems for lunch
there are some interesting things that
are missing from the fire TV I can't use
it to actually shop Amazon for products
and the vaunted made a support service
from the Kindle Fire tablets is nowhere
to be found there's a good chance that
both of these features will be added at
some point in the future but for now the
fire TV is very much a media streaming
box and it's a first-edition one at that
the fire TV is probably the best media
streamer you can get right now at 99
bucks it's the same price as the Apple
TV and only a little more than a Roku 3
but it's faster offers more and has
games to boot but if you're looking for
it to be a replacement for your cable TV
service it's really no different from
the current options already on the
market
Amazon isn't up ending the television
industry with this one it's just giving
you more ways to give it money</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
