this is the surface pro 2 Microsoft may
have released its original surface pro
only nine months ago but it's already
back with a refreshed model that tries
to correct some of the original
shortcomings at first glance it looks
identical to the original surface pro
and to be honest it's hard to tell them
apart visually it still made of the same
vapor mag material that's just like
aluminum and unlike the surface 2 it
only comes in black unfortunately
there's no silver option it really does
look incredibly familiar identical even
it's still 13.5 millimeters thick with
the same ports in the same place and no
changes to be found Microsoft does claim
to have improved the power connector on
the surface pro 2 but it's still tricky
to place it into the angle on the side
of the device the real difference is
kick in when you flip the surface pro 2
around go on is the windows logo
replaced with just the word surface but
the real star of the show is the
kickstand the original surface pro
kickstand only worked at one angle and
it really wasn't ideal for use on your
lap the surface pro 2 addresses that
with a second angle that's actually
designed to sit slightly further back
and dig into your legs a little more to
provide some much-needed balance instead
of being worried that it would topple
over I actually found it a lot more
secure it's not perfect but it's
definitely improved that stability is
aided by a redesigned keyboard cover the
type cover 2 is a slimmed down version
of the original that now has a fabric
touch pad just like the touch cover
there are some subtle improvements to
the keys but the main advantage is that
it's more rigid for use on your lap and
there's a customizable backlight so you
can use the surface pro 2 in the dark
that's crucial too because touch typing
on either cover takes some practice
the touch cover 2 has also been
redesigned with a lot more sensors that
improve its accuracy you can use
gestures on both covers to activate the
windows charms bar but the touch cover
also includes a variety of gestures
across the keys it's still a weird
experience typing on this one and I'd
recommend the type cover too if you're
going to be typing a lot apart from the
kickstand Microsoft really hasn't
changed much here it's the same ten
point six inch 1080p display that
includes stylus support and some
impressive viewing angles and color
reproduction although the cameras were
improved on the surface to model
Microsoft kept them the same on the pro
- there was 720p and not as good as the
surface 2's 1080p front and back cameras
but they still work fine Microsoft may
not have bumped up the resolution on the
surface pro - but there's a really nice
trade-off inside the tablet is Intel's
latest Core i5 Haswell processor and
while it does add speed and bump up
graphics power the real improvement here
is battery the original model couldn't
keep up for all day tablet use but the
surface pro 2 nearly doubles that to
seven and a half hours in our tests that
goes a long way toward making the
surface pro two's case for being both
powerful and portable speaking of power
this thing flies the original surface
pro is fast but the surface pro 2 is
even faster it boots up within 4 seconds
and resumes from sleep in less than 2
Intel's new silicon helps of course but
so does Microsoft's new Windows 8.1
operating system there are improvements
everywhere from built-in Bing search to
intelligent SkyDrive syncing that helps
you make the most of your disk space
well this tablet will run your desktop
apps
unlike the surface 2 there's also new
full-screen touch friendly apps
available from the Windows Store the
store doesn't have nearly every app
you'd expect right now though a recent
Facebook app in a planned Flipboard app
do show developer interest in Windows
tablets Microsoft also offers 200 gigs
of free SkyDrive storage and skypes
unlimited world service for free calling
in the US for a year Microsoft really
wants people to buy surfaces and it's
willing to use all of its products and
services to tempt them ultimately the
decision on whether to buy a surface pro
2 is down to simply what you're looking
to buy and how you plan to use it the
surface pro 2 does have some
improvements for lap use and has much
better battery life but it's basically
the same chunky tablet that debuted
earlier this year it's heavy for tablet
use and it's not perfect for laptop use
so it fits somewhere in between though
some of its accessories like the docking
station do go a long way toward making
those use cases easier if you're willing
to make a few compromises and usability
then you're going to get a tablet that
combines touch keyboard mouse and pen
input in some really unique ways and is
definitely both portable and powerful
but each area isn't perfect yet
it's a tricky balancing act that
Microsoft hasn't totally figured out
just yet and for $900 there's some
serious competition the surface pro 2 is
definitely a tablet that can replace
your laptop but there are still better
tablets and there are still better
laptops
