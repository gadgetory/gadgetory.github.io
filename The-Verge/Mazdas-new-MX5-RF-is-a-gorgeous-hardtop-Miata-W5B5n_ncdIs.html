purge and we're here at the New York
Auto Show we just our first big reveal
of the show the Mazda mx-5 Aref
this car looks a little familiar that's
because Mazda released an mx-5 miata
last year the difference here is that
this has got a target op now if you're
unfamiliar with the target --top'
porsche started it back in 1966 with the
Porsche 911 Targa and instead of your
normal hardtop it lifts up moves back
and goes underneath an entire back plate
that encompasses the entire back
windshield it's a little unique and it's
a little tricky to understand if you
haven't seen it before of course it's
not just Mazda and Porsche that have
made target stop cars in the past we've
seen Chevrolet's Ferraris Alfa Romeos
but to see one announced at this show
when we were only really expecting just
a normal hard top version of the mx-5
these a nice surprise
now we don't know too much more about
what's going to happen with this car we
all we know is that this is a prototype
we're not allowed to sit in it
unfortunately and the pre-orders will
start later that summer otherwise you
can expect it to be pretty similar to
the mx-5 relatively affordable maybe
around 30 or $40,000 and it will
basically give you that same kind of
roadster performance that thousands or
even tens of thousands dollars cheaper
than most of Mazdas competitors in this
now of course this is just the first and
many big announcements this week at the
New York Auto Show so to catch all of
that make sure you go to the verge calm
and head to youtube.com slash the
versions which subscribe</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
