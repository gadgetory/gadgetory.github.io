study shows that vaping causes the same
risk factors for heart disease as
traditional cigarettes while other
studies have shown that it produces
carcinogens it turns out inhaling things
in your lungs that shouldn't be there
might not be good for you
bathing has been consistently marketed
as a healthier alternative to smoking
but there's pretty big line between
vaping and not smoking at all well
researchers have found that vaping
leaves less chemical traces in your
urine it's still carcinogenic chemicals
in your body not to mention aside from
all the adverse health effects vapes
contain batteries and poorly made
batteries can you know explode here
let's watch some babies explode
I stopped to keep faith these things
come in all shapes and sizes from huge
custom builds that blow super dank
clouds to tiny little things that look
like USB sticks in the liquid you put in
them ranges from not having any nicotine
in it to having tons of it in various
special formulations my favorite is this
little jewel vape from the same company
and makes the PAX weed vapor lay this
thing it's like the iPhone vapes in
these little pods our foal is specially
formulated liquid that gets a nicotine
in your bloodstream the same way as a
cigarette is melody me tap on it turns
green you charge it lights up well
design product it's gonna kill me
ready hey myself for this look one of
the biggest public health victories of
the past 30 years was making smoking
socially unacceptable
what's the pack of smokes cost your
smooth skin see you again as a kid in
the 80s you could smoke basically
anywhere at any time
bars and restaurants at ashtrays all
over the place and he'd come home from a
night out reeking of smoke this was bad
for everyone and it's a good thing
smoking isn't nearly as cool as it once
was or in arguably a lot healthier
because of it the point is we're saying
things like these cigarettes 95 percent
safer than tobacco but as people we're
not exactly acknowledging that
cigarettes are a really low bar for
healthy in the United States the Federal
Drug Administration is cracking down on
vapes as a last August
any new vaping product is considered a
tobacco product and it has to get FDA
approval under standards that faith
lobbyists yes there are sad vape
lobbyists say will destroy the industry
meanwhile in the UK where more people
smoke the Royal College of Physicians
recommends ecigs because they're
probably safer than regular cigarettes
it might get you to stop smoking
the thing about vaping is it's built a
culture we celebrate when we find out
our friends have quit smoking and only
vape now there are huge wait conventions
people accept vaping and restaurants and
Parks there are people who vape in the
car with their kids don't do that the
concern is that we spend so much time
building a name for vaping as a healthy
alternative cigarettes it's like the
kombucha to soda maybe it is but if it
isn't we find that the vapes are just as
dangerous as cigarettes we were actually
going to believe it
so saving alright wheat claps survey
claps what happens my body's falling
apart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
