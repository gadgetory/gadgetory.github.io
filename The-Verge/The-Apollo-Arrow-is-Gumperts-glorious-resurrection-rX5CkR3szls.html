Show 2016 I'm standing here with yak
appeal of ski who is from Apollo and
they're showing off their brand new part
they just debuted here in Geneva is the
Apollo era and yeah cool a key was to
start off by telling us about the photo
and where the company came so the
company origin was founded by Rome
Gumpert which is the guy responsible for
the Quattro a groupie rally at Audi so
our T brands wouldn't be what it is now
without Roland Gumpert and so he has
amazing history with engineering and
after he finished his career at Audi he
wasn't himself and so he will that crazy
sports car and so some when they won the
car whenever the new company started it
totally destroyed the Nurburgring times
it was all the fastest and still is one
of the oldest and fastest cars at
Nurburgring and at the Top Gear top you
track which is a few all generations
generations of tires really not up to
date and it's still in top tens of also
with the new model I believe we're gonna
we're gonna be at the top of the list
again so tell us what makes the Aero
special apart from its looks which are
obviously really aggressive and
beautiful and everything else the RO is
special it's a it's really when people
say it's a is a is a race car for the
road this really is a race before it's a
steel frame but it's highly highly
engineered very stiff frame we using the
newest v8 technology a twin charge 1000
horsepower 1000 Newton meters
of torque and it is a very very light
car we are aiming for 1.2 or 1.3 tonne
for the production car so I think we're
going to destroy all the times around so
that's important you said aiming for and
this is your concept car and just
looking around it you have all these
fins and accents and everything else it
just looks like one of those concept
cars that will look very different once
it actually makes it on the road but you
feel differently about that yes yes we
know that it looks very concept carriage
but when we were designing the the the
model here and we really have production
in mind so so all the surfaces have
sense
they're very aerodynamically efficient
and we didn't try to pretend that it's a
concept car we have very realistic and
homologation ready lights we have very
real door handle we didn't use any kind
of concept car gimmicks so it looks
extreme but it's actually a we're really
going from confidence and ultimately
it's going to be made out of carbon
fiber yes yes
and there's something in fancy with the
exhaust system yes the the full body
will become a fiber and also the safety
cell for the passenger compartment
that's gonna be all for all carbon all
German made and the engineers we have a
design that we were very lucky because
the engine technology was called hot v
so the exhaust is at the top of the
engine and which gives us design is very
cool place to position the exhaust which
is at the top of the rear of the car and
so it really looks like an f-22 fighter
jet and how does it sound
I think is going to sound pretty brutal
it's a it's going to be a deeper and
more kind of aggressive sound than than
maybe the Italian competition it's going
to be a movie American v8 ramble about a
twin-turbocharged just hyper loud and
also because the exhaust is so short
because of the mid-engine we can have
top exhaust is going to be a fingertip
moment the loudest things out there so
the arrow is supposed to be a racecar
for the road essentially but we already
have quite a few of them you see if you
new debuts here at Geneva Lamborghini
and all the other guys hanging over
there near Bugatti how do you
distinguish yourselves from them some
very clever engineering solutions that
most of the companies don't talk about
like suspension geometry that's not
really something you put in the brochure
but it really counts and I think because
of that we can still hold the amazing
times at Nurburgring and Top Gear topic
trucks and also the stiffness of the
chassis it is really it is really race
ready yeah you can get it easily or
straight away if I homologated
for the high top race classes which most
of the other car supercars can do
straightaway they have to do
modifications to the car to get the
homologated for for race classes so
that's then that case we are very very
unique
so the era's plan for 2017 how much do
you think it will cost I think it will
be definitely cheaper than the current
hypercars probably below a million year
old okay that's really a we will what
we're doing our best to be as
cost-effective very good well that's it
from the polar arrow here at the Geneva
Motor Show 2016 stay tuned to the verge
