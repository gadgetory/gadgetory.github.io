these are Sony's new lens cameras the QX
10 and the QX 100 there are two totally
different cameras but are almost the
exact same concept that concept is this
your smartphone is the perfect camera
except for the whole taking great
pictures part the QX 10 and QX 100 are
by themselves full fledged cameras they
have sensors processors even a slot for
a micro SD card
there's no viewfinder on either to see
what you're shooting but they're a lot
like a GoPro you just turn it on and
start firing there's even a zoom control
and shutter button on each one they look
like lenses sturdy black plastic
cylinders the $249 qx10 about six ounces
and an inch tall and the $499 QX one
hundred both larger and heavier but
these are cameras even though you don't
technically need it your smartphone is
still the key piece of the lens camera
equation when you connect to the lenses
using Sony's PlayMemories mobile app for
Android or iOS your phone takes over all
the operation of the devices you can
zoom change settings and take pictures
the two ports connect by ad-hoc Wi-Fi
which is really easy to do if your phone
supports NFC you just tap the lens and
your phone together and your phone
either automatically launches the
PlayMemories app or takes you to the
store to download it you can technically
use the Q X lenses with any smart phone
as long as the app is supported but it's
really designed for NFC capable Android
phones like you know the one Sony makes
every time you take a picture the
full-size image is stored on the microSD
card inside the Q X camera you really
need a card partly because you can't
shoot video at all without one a small
version is also sent straight to your
phone for easy sharing you can set the
camera to send the whole file each time
which takes a lot longer but it's really
worth it
why shoot gorgeous 20 megapixel shots
and only share tiny versions plus
playing around with huge files and
editing apps is really fun on one hand
the lens cameras are pretty remarkable
the 18 megapixel qx10 has a sensor about
the same size as the average
point-and-shoot and much bigger than
just about any smartphone and it does
take pictures that are noticeably better
than a smartphone in almost any
situation
nothing fantastic and there are
occasional issues with color and noise
it's just a fairly average
point-and-shoot but the biggest thing it
offers is 10 times optical zoom
the QX 100 is on an entirely different
level it has a virtually identical spec
sheet to Sony's rx 100 which is the best
compact camera you can buy period it has
a huge one inch sensor a bright F 1.8
Zeiss lens
3.6 times optical zoom and Sony's fast
and capable processing chip as well the
20
megapixel pictures it takes are just
spectacular in most cases they're on par
with the rx100 and in a lot of ways this
is a better experience since it's a
point-and-shoot you're probably mostly
going to shoot in Auto anyway and having
a big touchscreen viewfinder and easy
sharing the Instagram and Facebook is
really nice there's occasionally some
lag with either camera where you move
the camera and the viewfinder can take a
while to catch up and the QX 100 is
bigger and a lot more unwieldy than the
Q X 10 which Clips pretty easily on any
smartphone but if you're going to buy an
attachment for better pictures you
should get pictures that aren't just a
little better than a smartphone the Q X
100 is a lot better than a smartphone
the Q extending Q X 100 may attach to
your phone via a handy versatile clip
that worked on every phone I tested but
they're big and heavy enough that you're
not going to want them attached all the
time and if they're not attached all the
time they're just another thing to carry
even if getting gorgeous pictures is
worth the extra bulk in your bag there
are other issues to contend with as well
every time you try to connect the camera
to your phone it takes five or ten
seconds before they're synced and ready
to shoot then every time you leave the
play memories mobile app the to
disconnect the lag makes it hard even on
still subjects - the focus is always a
little ahead of how it's shown on your
phone so it looks out of focus even
while you're taking in focus shots the
pictures look fine but I never thought
they were going to battery life was also
fine I got about 150 shots before the QX
10 died and a little less from the QX
100 frankly I'm amazed that Sony made
the QX 10 and QX 100 at all it's
absolutely the right idea adding a great
camera onto the smart phone you already
know and use seems like a much better
idea than trying to hack a smartphone
into your camera if in the next model
Sony can speed up its app and the
process for connecting to the camera
these lens cameras might just be the
perfect point to shoot but until then as
much as I love the idea and almost want
to buy a QX 100 for myself I don't think
I'd ever use it I bet you wouldn't
either
