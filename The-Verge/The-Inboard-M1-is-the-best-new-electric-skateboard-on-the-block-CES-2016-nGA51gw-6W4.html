this is the inboard the inboard is an
electric skateboard with a top speed of
20 miles an hour a 10-mile range at
headlights and taillights but that's not
even the coolest part about it what's
cool about the inboard is that the
motors are in the wheels it doesn't have
an outboard motor like a lot of other
Electric skateboards and that's
important because when the motor dies
because the battery dies you can still
ride this like a longboard the battery
on this is also hidden to a lot of other
Electric skateboards have outboard
batteries this one is embedded into the
deck itself but it's also going to be
swappable you're gonna be able to take
it out put in another one and not wait
for it to charge if you do have to
charge it up though you charge it up in
only an hour and you get that 10 model
range back the inboard motor is
controlled by a remote it actually has a
cool function on it there's a kill
switch so if you happen to stumble off
the board's not gonna keep put on
without you the inboard is gonna be
available later this year it's gonna
cost $1400 which is a lot of money but
Electric skateboards aren't really that
cheap yet so that's not really that much
of a surprise for more electric rideable
than everything else we've seen here at
CES 2016 head to the verge comm and head
