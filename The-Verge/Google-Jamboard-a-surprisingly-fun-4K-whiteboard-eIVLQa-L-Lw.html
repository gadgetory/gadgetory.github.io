products are pretty much ubiquitous in
modern offices this voiceover right now
I wrote this script with a colleague in
Google Docs that's all been online and
now Google is trying to take its
workplace tools from the cloud to the
physical world
we stopped by Google's New York offices
to check out its first attempt big
expensive surprisingly playful device
called the jam board so the jam board is
essentially a digital whiteboard it's a
55 inch 4k TV that's meant to solve the
miserable experience that is
collaborating with people remotely
everything you do can be synchronized
across multiple jam boards tablets and
the web so that different co-workers can
join in so even though this is something
that's must be in an office this is
weirdly fun and playful the whole design
is it is bright red it has these soft
curved sides material is actually kind
of a soft plastic it just really looks
like a blown-up kids tablet or something
like that the devices you use are also
the same way this is sort of like a
giant crayon and there's no real
technology here you just start writing
in it and it works the eraser is the
same way it's like a big puck and even
has microfiber on the eraser side which
is pretty neat
because that way you end up cleaning off
the display as you're erasing the tool
that I really love is a hand writing
tool my handwriting is absolutely
horrible I can barely read it sometimes
but the jam board for my experience has
been really good if you're to get out
look at that that happened pretty
quickly I really amazed because my
handwriting is really really terrible so
this is pretty cool and actually makes
this experience a lot more usable for
somebody like me and you can just grab
these you can manipulate the moon if you
want you can just throw them away if you
don't need them anymore the other thing
is there is a shape tool that's really
similar to that where again if you don't
make a perfect shape it's not gonna
always perfectly correct you in that
case it did but this is an Internet
textured whiteboard so nice to go a
little bit further and you can bring in
things from the web which is pretty cool
so we have this verge page pulled up and
I can just crop it
and bring this in and now I can mark it
up how I want so I guess circle the
author so you can go back and circle the
author here point out what it's about
but these things are also on layers
which I didn't point out and so I can
move and scale these things around to do
whatever I want with them and that's
kind of neat because again this is
another thing that normally you'd be
sending files back and forth rather than
being able to just draw on them which is
a much more natural experience for
people there are a few other options as
well like sticky notes you can write
text on and all kinds of emoji to play
with there's even a selfie function
which maybe you shouldn't use too much
at work but the big deal here is being
able to collaborate with people who
aren't in the room so we called Lauren
good out in our San Francisco office hey
hey what's going on Lauren and you can
see you can see me right now right I can
see you and it appears to be a
conference room yes is a beautiful party
room so I think what I have to do is
there's a specific button you can't do
video and at the board at the same time
but if I flip the switch I go away and I
think now you can see everything that
I've been writing right oh yeah I know I
look what you posted an article page
yeah I was able to get pasted another
full page from Caitlin yeah I know I
started so you can see can't even see my
web searches and stuff or is it no so
that's just that's not showing up to you
I can't see your web searches okay now I
just be a bunch of shapes and the words
horrible so I'm here plotting something
I see right now this is all a little bit
confusing Lauren can't interact with a
jam board because she's on the web she
also can't see me and the jam board at
the same time which is kind of strange
when the jam board is actually out
Lauren would be able to get more
involved Google is launching a jam board
app for iOS and Android
and it basically turns your tablet into
a miniature version of the jam board
it's a little less fun but it works
including the handwriting recognition
so even without the app we were able to
do a little planning for my next trip
out to San Francisco
if you put in AT&amp;amp;T Park again I remember
be grab some lunch and then go to a game
after work with people in the office
AT&amp;amp;T Park and now I have go on this and
I put that in okay cool yeah I don't
know exactly when they're playing so
we'll have to that's okay I need to look
up how baseball works before we go I
don't know how many offices will
actually end up with a jam board the
product costs $5,000 before annual
service fees but if you're in a
workplace willing to spend that kind of
money the jam board seems like a
surprisingly practical and fun way to
collaborate even at this early imperfect
stage and Google is already planning for
the future third-party integrations for
jam board are on the table I know I want
to see Trello on there and Google tells
us it's interested in using hardware to
solve other problems in the workplace -
so the jam board is only just the
beginning thanks for watching our video
on Google's jam board if you want to see
more stuff like this be sure to follow
us on YouTube calm the bird or you know
