and I'm here with the new Nokia 9, which,
as you can see has five cameras.
Look at it five cameras.
Nokia just announced this at MWC 2019,
and again the big feature
is that this is the
first phone with five cameras on the back.
It's actually got six
cameras because there's
one on the front.
So lets break down what exactly
we're doing with all this.
Five sensors.
Three of them are 12 megapixel
F1.8 monochrome sensors,
and the other two are,
again, same specs but color.
So what Nokia's doing
is that every time you
press the shutter, it's firing
all five of these sensors,
to pull in all that extra color
and depth data from every single shot.
Now we can see some
pretty beefy file sizes.
Part of the reason some of
those file sizes are so large
is that the Nokia 9 can shoot in Raw DNG,
and Nokia says that those
features will be off by
default for most people.
But, if you're shooting with this
you're gonna wanna be using those
and it's something you
should keep in mind.
The five camera system does
come with a couple big caveats.
First off, this thing is kinda slow.
It's powered by last years'
Snapdragon 845 processor,
but it still takes like
10 seconds between when
you fire a shot to actually
viewing in your camera roll
for an image to finish processing,
and another couple seconds
for it to load in full resolution.
Some apps are better equipped
with this than others,
Google photos struggled a bit,
but loading things in
Lightroom was much faster.
Nokia's actually partnering
with Adobe to specifically build
Lightroom presets based around
lens profile of the Nokia 9,
so, when that rolls out,
you should be able to get
some really interesting
and hopefully impressive
results from Lightroom
directly on the device without
having to go to a computer,
which is kinda the dream.
As for the phone itself, the
Nokia 9 is the top of Nokia's
range that they're announcing here
and it's got the build
quality and design to match.
The sides of the phone are
machined out of aluminum.
It's got Gorilla Glass 5 on
both the front and the back.
Now, Nokia's breaking from the
trend of most 2019 flagships,
you can see there's no
notch, its just a regular
5.99 inch QOLED display.
It renders a 2K resolution and
it actually looks a lot like
the Samsung Galaxy S9 or
the smaller Google Pixel.
The bezels on top and bottom are
bigger than I necessarily like,
but they're not egregious,
and it looks really nice to just, hold.
Hardware-wise, Nokia's
including 120GB of storage,
6GB of RAM and a 3320
milliamp hour battery.
Like Nokia's other phones, it runs
Android One, it runs
mostly pure Android 9 Pie.
With Android One, Nokia's
promising regular updates
and you should be able
to get like good software
from this to come, they're
really not messing a whole lot
with what Google has given them.
Which is honestly nice to
see, cos Google has it good,
like, don't mess with it too much.
There are a couple other
premium things that
Nokia's including on this phone.
There's in-display fingerprint sensing.
There's proprietary Nokia
design face unlock system that
it's introducing with this years' models.
There's USB-C, there is still
no 3.5mm headphone jack.
Sorry, folks.
I mean Nokia's really like
planting a flag here with this
as a premium level device.
Now the company does say that
this will be a limited edition
phone, it's not saying
how many it's making,
but it's not going to
be a mass market device
in the same way that of
those other phones will be.
There's also no real word
on price or release date.
Nokia says the global average
price will be â‚¬599 euros,
but we'll still have to wait
for a word from regional
partners to see where exactly
this phone is going to show up,
and how much it's going
to cost when it does.
So, obviously again one
of the big things on the
Nokia 9 is just how many cameras it has
and this sorta design might
look familiar to you from the
Light L16.
That wild, 16 lens camera
that shipped last year.
That's because Light has
actually partnered with
Nokia on here and Light's
lux capacitor technology
is actually what's driving these 5 lenses.
Qualcomm says that it's Snapdragon chip
isn't ordinarily equipped
for this kinda thing,
and that's why Nokia needs Light's help
in just processing this
many camera inputs at once.
It is still a little early
on to tell exactly how
the Nokia 9 is going to work,
but in our early hands on shots,
the amount of detail its been pulling in,
especially on like wood grain or
textures or the skyline shots
it's really kinda impressive,
especially from a smartphone,
and we're really gonna
have to test this against
other phones, other cameras
to see just whether or not
this investment into
this cool 5 camera tech
is actually worth it.
It looks really cool, but,
is it?
We'll see.
Another thing that stood out to me is what
Nokia's using these cameras
for, which is specifically
just for color, detail and depth.
We have seen other multi
camera phones like the
LG V40, which took a
really interesting approach
in putting different lens types
on its phones and different
focal lengths.
Now, with this you're
still just getting that one
static shot, just better in theory.
But, I can't help but wonder
whether there's a better way
to leverage sticking 5 cameras on a device
than just making them all the same.
Keep it locked here at The Verge,
we'll have more great MWC
coverage here the whole week.
