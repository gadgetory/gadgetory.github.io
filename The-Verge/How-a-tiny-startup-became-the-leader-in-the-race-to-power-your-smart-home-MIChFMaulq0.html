home has been going on for years but it
seems like nobody's really cracked the
code that will get consumers excited
over the last couple of months a new
Dark Horse competitor has emerged as
sort of a front-runner wink is a company
that's spun out of a partnership between
quirky and GE and they've created a
whole range of products and a central
hub that allows you to create one
integrated intelligent apartment so this
is a winged cloth or in Soho New York we
really try to construct this place to
have a kind of airy look and feel that
everyone could kind of feel comfortable
in so we built a garage door really puts
a whole new entryway it's really kind of
gonna be simplifying and bring to life
all the different products I'm gonna
point platform ok so right now the whole
home is kind of asleep we're about to go
in you unlock the door and what happens
so I'm gonna unlock the door that lamp
is gonna turn on the radio will turn on
this shade will go up and then the big
shades behind me will all go up as well
just from the swipe of this one button
so unlike a nice leg lock one of the
things I think is really interesting
about the smart home is that people have
been trying to solve this puzzle for a
long time and nobody seems to have
gotten a lot of traction to the point
where it feels like it's easy to
integrate all the different smart
devices in your home obviously the idea
of this Smart Homes been around for
quite some time it's been a number of
different radio frequencies that have
been out there or a number of different
people that have tried and I think one
of the things that was missing was that
many the brains that people know and
rely on and already have in the house
hadn't been connected yet we're seeing
them kind of all come online in fact in
Home Depot they have over 600 different
connected products that are sold either
in-store and online today this radio
isn't a smart radio it just plugged into
a smart switch this light isn't a smart
light it's just plugged into a smart
dimmer and again these are from
Levittown of neutron to brain sewers
have historically competed with each
other but all came together under kind
of the weak platform so this is like the
mothership here this is the hub right
what is what is the purpose of this and
how does it control everything in the
house okay so this is the wink hub it's
got six different radios in it and it
works with all these different radio
frequencies that don't have kind of
Internet
so for some reasons you can't have a
Wi-Fi chip in in different products
because of the power or the cost of it
and so it allows it to kind of interpret
those different radio frequencies and
lets you control it all from your phone
is there an idea that these devices will
sort of come to learn your schedule or
be personalized to you that they'll work
together in some way we have smart
schedules so kind of knowing when
certain actions should happen based on
time-based triggers we also have
geolocation so if you're coming home to
turn on your AC before you actually
arrive here in a certain distance we
have robots between I think of if-then
triggers they can kind of do things for
you so you know open your door turn on
your your your lights turn on your radio
what's the approach to privacy or
security when it comes to having all of
these smart devices living in your home
on your Wi-Fi network and connected to
your phone we take security of the
utmost importance two-factor
authentication to big level encryptions
so you know we're never going to share
your data or shell your data you don't
have to share your geolocation or things
of that nature so it's all kind of
opt-in and of course we'll never will
never share that with anyone else so I
think the toughest part might be in
making sure that you're always making
the product simple and easy to use you
know there's a lots of different things
you can kind of do with the smart home
or with each product and making sure
that you're often you can see really it
simple is some kind of easiest
experience to make sure that they're
kind of getting the most out of the
interactions and know kind of obligates
how to use these products and find that
value right away
