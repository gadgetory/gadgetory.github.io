water right out of thin air and without
using electricity that's what one
Arizona based start-up is trying to do
using a combination of solar energy
material science and data is this the
next level of drinking water this is
zero mass water it's a water startup
operating out of an old car dealership
in Scottsdale Arizona zero mass is
building and selling solar-powered
panels that harvest drinking water
called source the panels have been up
and running in specific locations over
the past couple years but source just
became more widely available very
highest level we take sunlight and air
and we produce water and so as you drill
into that the air part of that equation
is applying air into materials that like
water so in the same way when you leave
a lid off of a sugar bowl the sugar gets
a little clumpy that's because that
sugar really likes water in that in the
air I visited zero mass at their
headquarters to check out their panels
and of course to taste the water where
is this water coming from
so the panels that produce this water on
the roof so we're taking a water vapor
out of the air concentrated in the
panels and then we're dispensing it to
the tap it tastes nice and clean that's
good isn't it
yeah I had some tap water last night
that didn't taste quite like this okay
so to say they pull water from the air
is technically accurate but really it's
a multi-step system the zero mass panels
look like regular solar panels but the
middle strip is the only part that a
standard photovoltaic technology that
part drives the fans and the
communications inside the unit on either
side of that strip is a proprietary
porous material one that generates Heat
a separate proprietary material inside
the panel absorbs moisture from the air
then the pail uses sunlight to take the
water back out of those materials and
produce a process that's not dissimilar
from do forming on grass basically when
warm air hits a surface colder than
itself and then the water ends up in a
30 liter reservoir where it's
mineralized and pH balanced and
that point it's drinkable let's say
there's an emergency situation like with
the recent hurricane in Puerto Rico how
quickly can you get one of these set up
so the three of us could install two of
these in probably an hour and so it
actually turns out that the thing that
takes the longest putting is in is
moving that line down to the sink or to
the refrigerator while I was able to see
the zero mass panels and taste the water
I didn't have much of his ability into
how the water actually runs from the
reservoir to a faucet I was however able
to see the company's Network Operations
Center we call it NOC for short every
panel that we have ever deployed is
communicating with the server we have
here Robinson also said that each panel
has a circuit board that runs an
algorithm so it can adjust itself to
maximize water output on average each
panel is supposed to produce 5 litres of
water per day but it is safe to assume
that if you're in a less humid climate
or more dry climate that your water
output could be less but here is
probably very different from here in the
Philippines right the two things that
effect the amount of water we produce
are the humidity in the atmosphere and
the amount of solar energy that's
available still he says that zero mass
panels are absolutely able to make water
in the desert even at a place as dry as
Arizona there's no doubt that a lack of
access to clean water is a big problem
for a lot of people according to the
United Nations water scarcity affects
more than 40 percent of the global
population what would you say is the
biggest water problem you have around
the globe right now is it scarcity is it
quality is it access I would say is
really all about that would be the right
answer the number of people who die from
waterborne diseases is enormous it
exceeds a million deaths per year dr.
Ashok Gadgil is a kind of legend when it
comes to socially beneficial
technologies especially in the
developing world he's won numerous
awards including an induction into the
National Inventors Hall of Fame back in
the 90s he
a product that uses UV light to
disinfect water he says that changes in
climate patterns the explosion in urban
populations and rising incomes are
setting us up for a serious water crisis
this century is going to be an
extraordinary crisis that the ground
waters between relied on as if it was
there in indefinitely large quantities
is not of course they're that way and we
are really deeper and deeper and we are
extracting now water that some of my
geochemist friends tell me is 10,000
years old that is being pulled out of
the ground to be used because that's
that's the rate of your planet it's
minuscule compared to the rate of a draw
so is zero mass going to replace
groundwater as a primary source is it
going to help people with little to no
access to clean water or is it just for
people who buy a lot of bottled water
Cody Friesen the CEO says all of the
above just takes us from a position of
water scarcity to a position of water
abundance for every person and it's it's
a profound thing to say and I recognize
it sounds profound but this technology
entitles us to be aspirational because
of the fact that we can say okay yep
they're Syrian refugee issues in
northern Lebanon let's go there yep
Maria hit Puerto Rico yep let's go there
hey there's issues in Flint let's go
there hey by the way you're buying what
bottled water in Berkeley let's displace
that same in Oakland same in Scottsdale
there is still the cost to consider each
panel costs $2,000 plus a $500
installation fee so $4,500 total for a
two panel array so far zero math says
hundreds of panels have been set up in
eight countries around the world for
people in developed markets that means
they're either early testers or they're
paying out of pocket in emergency
situations or places where there's a
lack of funding the company is relying
on donors NGOs are multilateral
institutions the fact that it's totally
independent of any infrastructure no
wire no pipe or anything the fact that
we can just put this anywhere changes
your lives
there's no doubt zero mass is working
hard on an innovative way for people to
have access to clean water without
electricity or sophisticated plumbing
it's not surprisingly others are working
on solutions like this too the question
then doesn't seem to be whether it's too
good to be true
it's whether harvesting water from the
air is the most sustainable most
cost-effective solution for clean water
while dr. GAD Gill declined to comment
on zero mass specifically he said the
method of harvesting water from the air
wouldn't be his first choice willing
water from moisture condensing water
from moisture in the air he's liable if
I was on a desert island I had lots of
money and there was no other source of
fresh water and I was going to die then
the value of my life is what is now
pitted against the cost of that work
instead he says conserving water and
recycling water like the stuff we
flushed down the toilet every day are
still more cost effective than
harvesting new water we need to do both
but we should do whatever is cheaper and
least damaging to the environment in
almost all cases reusing the water seems
to be the cheaper way to go similarly
conserving water seems to be cheaper way
to go before you start harvesting it
from the air in the world of water there
may be different interpretations of
sustainability and varying approaches to
how to just get clean water to more
people for zero mass the company says
the goal is to get to the point where
the idea of water from thin air is just
a part of people's everyday
conversations if you're at a cocktail
party you say well I've got solar my
route people think Oh electricity in a
small number of years people saying oh
you have so learned if I give you talkin
electricity or water
let's go up to the roof and check out
our array up there I think my Chris come
with us yeah I'm supposed to sorry I was
eating mixin we all just like we and all
the enter from around corners memories</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
