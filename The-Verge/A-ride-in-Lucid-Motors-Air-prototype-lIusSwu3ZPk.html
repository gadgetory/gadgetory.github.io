here with lucid motors checking out
their new air prototype electric vehicle
they hope to be Tesla at their own game
and what better way to do it than by
hiring a lot of their old engineers so
we're going to go check it out and see
how it works the pickup on this car is
really quite impressive when you
accelerate it before I felt myself being
pressed back into my seat
it really kind of tacked away Lucid
Motors is a small electric car startup
based in Los Angeles California it's
among the latest in a wave of electric
car startups to spring up with sleek
dynamic attractive sports car models a
couple months ago they released their
first production car the air lucid
thinks that the air could be a tesla
killer and they should know the
company's chief technology officer peter
Rawlinson is the former lead engineer on
the Model S lucid joins Karma next evie
in Faraday future and their quest to
steal some of Tesla's shine as a result
the electric horsepower wars are heating
up and lucid as a contender with its
claim that the car will make 1,000
horsepower and raise from zero to 60
miles per hour in less than three
seconds and boy was it fast we took it
for a spin down the Las Vegas Strip
during CES it suffice to say this car
could cook it flew down straightaways
and blazed around corners with torque to
burn a few times I almost ended up in
Peter Rawlinson slap the air is super
roomy loose it says that was part of
their goal to make a larger than normal
interior to put the driver at ease
unlike their competitors like Faraday
future lucid seems more grounded in
reality steering clear of making lavish
promises about the future of mobility
and how they're gonna transform
transportation they just want to sell a
car and fortunately for them it seems
like they have a real winner on their
hands it was a sweet ride I can't wait
to take another spin</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
