of announcements here at e3 and EA just
wrapped up its press conference
sometimes this was incredibly exciting
and exhilarating and sometimes you just
wanted to turn it off and stop watching
it was so dull so we're going to go
ahead and try to cut out all the bad
bits and just give you the best there's
basically one thing that everybody came
into this event wanting to see and that
is star wars battlefront which is an
online shooter set in the Star Wars
universe in battlefront you can either
join the Empire or the rebellion and he
is compared it to a virtual toy box
where you get to act out being in any
battle you ever wanted to be in in Star
Wars Battlefront always sounded pretty
cool but we haven't gotten to see much
of it until today when EA give us five
minutes of what it calls pre-alpha
battlefront footage and that footage
seriously shows you a lot of stuff you
can shoot down 80 80 s and shoot things
down with a TIE fighter and use a
lightsaber enforced hours and anything
that you tried to act out with your
friends after seeing the movie when you
were a kid of course the problem is that
we're not actually seeing a game when it
says pre alpha footage it means they
picked everything they thought would be
cool and stuffed it into one level so
whatever we end up seeing when it comes
out later this year is going to be
pretty different but this does show that
ye a knows what is cool and it knows
what we do want to see and hopefully
they're going to be able to actually
translate that into a game so
unfortunately not everything was this
much fun to watch if you like sports
games EA has a lot of the best and
they've refreshed just about every
single one of them but they didn't
manage to really communicate why you'd
want these everything looks better
everything has some new features you can
scan your face and put it actually into
the game with this new 3d scanning
technology that hopefully won't look
like a terrifying uncanny valley
although we haven't gotten to try it out
but the whole thing just ended up
dragging on maybe because they spent way
way too long in an interview with Pele
and we wish we could just unsee that and
it did bring back a couple of our old
favorites just the games that have
become modern classics that people love
playing one of them is mass effect
there's going to be a new game called
Mass Effect Andromeda and it's set on
the Mass Effect universe but it's not
going to star commander shepard it's a
new story we don't actually know a whole
lot besides that except that apparently
it looks really good with a Johnny Cash
song which is a little bit of a change
from the epic sci-fi space opera that
we've gotten used to so we're going to
be waiting for details on that and then
there's a game that's kind of a personal
favorite of mine which is Mirror's Edge
music had a ton of flaws but it also
just managed to be a fantastic
experience when they got it right and
now they've got another game that's a
prequel called Mirror's Edge catalyst
where they have a chance to do that and
the trailer captures a lot of the things
I really liked about the first game but
we don't get to actually watch anybody
play it so we don't know if they fix
those flaws now sometimes III can just
feel like a cavalcade of guns but es
keynote was actually pretty varied
there's this adorable little yarn
creature and there's a new plants vs
zombies garden warfare game and then
there's racing and then there's all the
sports but it looks like the thing we're
going to be most excited for for this
coming year is these big epic story
experiences like Star Wars and mass
effect and apparently we're going to be
really excited about space too since
that's both of those if you want more
details you can check out our full
write-up on the verge com or you can
watch a far more watchable condensed
supercut of this keynote on youtube so
just stay with us for the rest of you
three we're going to keep bringing you
all of the news and all of the games
that we're seeing here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
