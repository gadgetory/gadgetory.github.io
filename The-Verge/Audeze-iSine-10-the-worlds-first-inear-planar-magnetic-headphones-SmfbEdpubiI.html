2016 I am at or disease booth and I've
just been listening to one of the most
amazing sets of headphones yet first of
all these are the ODI sigh and 10 the
design of them is pretty wild in itself
it's something that seems to have come
out of the Dharma Initiative or
something they have a 30 millimeter
diaphragm in them they play in a
magnetic but they're also in ears
I don't know how old is he has done it
but the most important thing is the
sound of them and it just blew me away
all disease booth is here at the audio
section of Aoife is super loud around us
as you might be able to hear and pick up
but once I put some music on they just
they take over the music is there
everything is there all the detail is
there the imaging the bass all the way
down to the sub bass the treble response
I'm in love I I keep falling love with
headphones but these are just really
amazing and terrific and the thing is
they don't just look wild they sound
really really great and the I sign 10 at
$399 actually quite reasonable there's
also an Einstein 20 would along with
voice coil at $5.99 which is a bit more
dear but as I say I'll spend something
like 10 minutes listening to these I
don't want to take them out of my ear
did that much fun or dizzy is offering
them with a lightning cable which
includes all diseased own DAC and amp
which makes them sound great but the
good thing is there's a usual 3.5
millimeter connection as well and I've
been using that with a galaxy note 7 and
like I say everything sounds
wonderful window so you could ride these
with a smartphone they plan the magnetic
even driving with a smartphone and it
sound amaze me what more do you want the
eye signs that I've been listening to
here I own a prototype at the moment
they have a 3d printed enclosure but the
finished product will not be as go see
it will be a dark matte black and you
have a slightly different irritation
mechanism rather than this white again
3d printed prototype we have here the
people have to point out is there's so
much noise isolation but Odyssey bundle
silicone tips and a set of comply foam
tips so you should be able to get
reasonable noise isolation as I say once
the music kicks in all of this drone
around me just kind of seems to go away
and there's just so much detail and
articulation with these headphones that
I just get lost in music I don't want to
take them off they're just that good so
the ODC I sign 10 in the I sign 21 is
399 one is $5.99 both be available at
the end of October beginning of November
plus there will also be an option with a
connection to the oculus rift and a
connection for the HTC vive so if you
want the idea in your headphones to go
with your your headset this is gonna be
an excellent candidate so thanks for
watching my first listen and my fawning
over the ODI signs hands for more about
Aoife 2016 coverage stay tuned to
reverse so calm and youtube.com slash
the verge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
