we are checking out the HTC One this
HTC's new flagship device it's got a 4.7
inch 1080p display screen it's actually
the most pixel Vince screen on the
market right now you can see right now
actually this is the new blinkfeed we'll
get to that in a second take a look at
the body itself you can see it actually
got brushed aluminum as the black models
also comes in a white model both of
which i prefer the black honestly it's
similar is the iphone kind of hard to
mistake in terms of the design but i
will say this is a pretty sturdy
comfortable device that's not the big
thing here also we've got the speaker's
here he's really promoting the Beats
Audio right here we got the camera more
on that in a second the big two things
here one is the camera talk about that
soon the other thing is blinkfeed this
is a cici's nuisance or since five
everyone else and essentially it's a
very Flipboard like look at big news at
your calendar some Twitter and Facebook
updates it's a very like brief you can
go and dive into whatever get a better
view think of this an RSS reader let me
look it on the go and a swipe right
you've got a pretty standard looking
android screen right now this is running
android 4.1 point2 but they will upgrade
to the new 4.2 later or so you know or
so HTC says the big things take a look
at the camera this is what you see see
is calling the ultrapixel it's 4
megapixels but they're bigger pixels so
of course it captures more light as you
can see these guys are just jumping on
tables ladies gentleman people get paid
to jump over tables for a living I don't
know what you did wrong in life but I
certainly clearly made the wrong choice
anyway let's take a look you can take
still photos you can take videos but the
big thing here is Zoey if you're into
Zoey mode you can take a picture let me
zoom in or something and
well down actually takes four seconds of
the picture and you get this little kind
of vine like thing it's audio and video
there's a lot a lot of options for
sharing it you can get the link and the
link takes you to HTC site nothing is
embeddable right now it really is just
think of it as a small video not just
similar to vine you know get an idea for
what it is that's a cici's phone in a
nutshell pretty nice proper looking
hardware not convinced on the new since
just yet but it is nice to have the
standard home screen</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
