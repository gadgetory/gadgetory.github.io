and i'm here with the orange santa clara
it's a brand new phone powered by
Intel's medfield processor it's one of
the first to come out or to be the first
to hit the UK when it comes out in the
summer I'll be out in France and the UK
and it's a pretty insane phone on the
brand new processor so let's take a look
at it so the processor in general is
just really really fast basically
everything on this phone just happens
instantly and with almost no lag and
there's a bunch of features that show
off the cool stuff that it can do
there's a 360 camera app that actually
it takes video this isn't from this
camera but it lets you pan around a
video and you can even tilt the phone
around to move and it's just super
smooth and works really really well it's
a 1.6 gigahertz processor inside the
phone and this the phone has a four
point oh three inch LCD it'll have a gig
of ram and will ship again this summer
it's also got a burst camera mode that
lets you shoot 10 photos kind of like
machine gun rapid fire and then
processes them all and gives you 10
photos all at once it's pretty crazy the
biggest problem we've seen with some
alternative processors they have trouble
running some apps but both Intel and
orange say they've worked very hard to
make sure that that doesn't happen we
had one issue running a nap but we're
willing to believe them that most apps
will work and the ones that we tried are
really fast and work really really well
so again this is one of the first Intel
medfield powered phones to hit the
market when it comes out this summer and
it's gonna be really interesting to see
what happens the processor looks amazing
and it's gonna be interesting to see how
quickly it catches on it'll be out in
France in the UK and again sometime this
summer with a different name and that is
the orange Santa Clara</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
