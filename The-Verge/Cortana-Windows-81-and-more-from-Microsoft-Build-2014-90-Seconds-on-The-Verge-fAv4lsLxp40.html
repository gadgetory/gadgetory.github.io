three-hour microsoft build keynote this
will be about a hundred and twentieth of
that I'm Nathan cycad and this is 90
seconds on the verge Microsoft kicked
off its annual developer conference
today with a new way for developers to
create a single app that works across
windows phones tablets PCs and even the
xbox one unification is appeared to be a
goal of Microsoft's for some time now
whether or not you paid for platform
however or pay once for universal access
well that's up to the developers Siri
and Google now have a new rival say
hello to Cortana she'll probably say hi
back arriving with Windows Phone 8.1
Microsoft's new voice assistant lets you
manage basic phone functions set
appointments and reminders search the
web and more Microsoft is taking a more
human approach to Cortana and even
brought in Jen Taylor the voice actress
for Cortana and the Halo series to
reprise her role here windows phone 8.1
will roll out as a free update to
consumers in the next few months while
the audience at Build was happy to see
Cortana in action it was the return of
the start menu that really got the party
started it looks like a Windows 7 and 8
hybrid being around the same size as the
windows 7 menu but also featuring
miniature live tiles along one side
microsoft also showed a new mode that
allows modern windows 8 apps to run on
the desktop inside their own windows the
windows 8.1 update is coming april aids
with major keyboard and mouse
improvements but the new start menu
that's not coming until sometime later
this year for much much more from the
build conference check out the verge
coming up Microsoft cancels a secret
real-life titanfall beta we talked to
the survivors</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
