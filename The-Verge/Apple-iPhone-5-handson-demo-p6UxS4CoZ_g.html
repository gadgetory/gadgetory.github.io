we are looking at the new iPhone 5 as
you can see it looks somewhat familiar
to the iPhone 4s the iPhone 4 but I have
to say when you pick it up in your hands
there is an immediate noticeable
difference it's thinner it's lighter it
feels incredibly light actually it's
almost bizarrely light when I picked it
up I almost dropped it because I
expected more weight than is actually
here but that doesn't mean that it's you
know cheaply constructed the back is a
beautiful matte metal finish there's
glass on these two pieces right here and
then of course glass around the front
it's also got a larger screen the much
rumor to now expose larger screen of the
of the iPhone 5 you go through the
bezels been kind of cut down along the
sides here so it just feels like it's
all screen on the front this is the
black version which is almost all matte
black pretty sleek I have to say pretty
slick looking and you know everything
functions as you would expect on an
iPhone it's of course running iOS 6
we've seen early versions of iOS 6 we
saw it demoed at WWDC and this is the
full version here a few new additions
passbook is one of them which is going
to collect all sorts of boarding passes
and gift cards and stuff like that which
was demo today there's also new mail
features for instance the VIP and
flagging has been changed and lots of
little nips and tucks all over the OS
but you know the big story today is not
the operating system the big story today
is the hardware and I have to say it's
definitely it is an evolution in terms
of the design language but I spoke to a
Phil Schiller and he said that this was
a complete ground-up new project for
them they looked at this and they said
let's just kind of blow you know blow
part what we've already done and build
something new from the ground up and you
do see little differences that that
indicate that that's the case
particularly one of the things that I
noticed is the detail on this the
machined edges of this I heard somebody
here say it looked a little bit like
jewelry and I have to agree that there
is kind of a jewelry feel to the way
these edges are machined and and as
clean as they are one other thing to
note the headphone jack has moved down
to the bottom
and it now has the new lightning dock
port which is much smaller obviously and
faster as Apple claims and has a bunch
of other features that are helpful of
your dock in your phone so this is it I
mean this is the iPhone 5 it's going to
be available I believe it goes on sale
September 21st and and we're gonna spend
a little bit more time with it will have
some impressions and and a lot more info
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
