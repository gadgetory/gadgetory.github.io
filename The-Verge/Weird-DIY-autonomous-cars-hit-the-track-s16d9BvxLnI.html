you probably imagine high-end autonomous
vehicles zipping around a track at
dizzying speeds well not really
in late May a dozen or so teams came to
California's Thunderhill Raceway to
participate in what was called the first
installment of the self racing cars
series I'm trying to do something that's
that's more about like the not so much
spectator sport but but love of
engineering people want to build stuff
they want interesting challenges to
build you know that's that's what I'm
trying to do I want people to be able to
feel the competitive vehicle for less
than 10 grand racing is an exaggeration
though there weren't actually any races
that weekend and with no qualifying
rules the event attracted a motley crew
investors high-end parts suppliers and
two guys at the Power Wheels car a lot
of these cars couldn't even make it
around the track on their own it was
more of an opportunity for drivers and
engineers to come test their technology
find potential partners or customers or
just trade notes with fellow enthusiasts
this event Thunderhill I think is
incredibly valuable to the autonomous
community because how many times were
you can have a track day for this sort
of thing it's still really new I mean a
lot of this technology you hear it in
the news all the time but there's still
a lot of testing miles there's still a
lot of things that need to be done and
the reason why I think this is fantastic
is that I mean racing has made
innovations for vehicles for the past
100 years
I mean we're this weekend's the Indy 500
it started in nineteen eleven the
average speed was 70 miles an hour now
it's over 220 miles an hour
that right there is proof of how
motorsports our technology movers so
what's really interesting about this
event is that we're a one e way of
looking at we're just reinventing the
wheel right there's nothing here that
Google hasn't already done but you can
take a google autonomous car and put on
this racetrack and they'll do absolutely
fine and I think the point is exactly
the same point that Jobs and Wozniak had
when they had the homebrew Computer Club
yeah the Apple 2 was not the first
computer or the best computer is
probably the worst computer but it took
a different evolutionary path you know
unlike you know the mainframe getting
you know faster smaller etc this the PC
ended up it going in a different
direction and the hope here that this
will go in a different direction then
we're not just gonna end up with another
Google Thomas car
you something that Google wouldn't dare
or want to do tens of thousands of
people are dying everyday right in the
globe because of automated technologies
are not enabling to save their lives
right and for me personally also I have
a special needs child right a special
needs child that will probably never be
able to actually drive his car by
himself so this can enable him to live a
normal life and I'm not alone there
we're not just racing cars here I think
that we're really changing the future
and and adding quality of life to to
millions of people in the world as the
technology advances over the next few
years
we'll definitely be watching
self-driving races next year there's an
all-electric autonomous race launching
called Robo race well it's off racing
car series be a DIY alternative maybe
but that's still at least a few years
off first these teams will have to teach
their cars to make it around the track
then the soft racing car series might
actually be a race</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
