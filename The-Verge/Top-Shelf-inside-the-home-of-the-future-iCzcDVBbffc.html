this is the one welcome to top shelf I'm
David Pierce and this is our new set
this week we're talking about the home
of the future not the Jetsons home of
the future thousands of years from now
when they're robots brushing our teeth
and dressing us in the morning but the
future more like tomorrow where we're
going to live what it's going to look
like what we're gonna do when we're home
we started here in New York City where
PSFK decided to take a look at what they
think that home of the future might look
like piece of cares a website about
design and new ideas and the future and
one of the things are really interested
in is the home of the future what it'll
look like and how it'll change how we
live so here at sixteenth street new
york city they built it and pierce box
the editor-in-chief of PSFK decided to
give us a tour give me sort of the the
run-up to how you guys started doing
this exhibition like where where did
this come from you know a psfk you know
we write every day we write about new
ideas especially within culture
creativity to write this reports about
the future of retail and the future of
games what what are these trends that
you're seeing like do people live like
this now I guess first of all I think
people are beginning to put these
products into the home and there and
then they will to naturally it's a by
accident it was really weird good we
know we were we did this analysis and we
were looking for products and we're
calling PR agencies trying to get these
products and these small designers and
then we realized we could go on amazon
and buy some of them but i think what's
holding probably some of it back is
there's sort of grand scheme how do all
these things talk to each other in a in
a clever way so how do we get there is
that but yeah i think is it is it sort
of your your iPhone or whatever phone
you have yeah i think you know some some
smart company has to come up with a
form inner that going to create
scenarios for you and and builds it on
this technology which is always already
around well thank you so much so now
we're in this department let's go see
what's downstairs they're all the
exhibition future home living experience
really it's um it's a real world trends
report basically talking about the new
trends and taking place in the home and
so in this place we have a number of
different zones and we talk about these
three big themes okay adaptive
equilibrium and on demand and they'll
put tofu this is the door pot and it is
an electronic I ok so so there's a
camera there camera then you press the
button and that gets been to your phone
now this kayak is a foldable kayak is
kayak it can be folded a thousand times
gonna be folded basically into a bag
which is this size wait really the nest
is interesting because it's becoming
such a mainstream product from barton
home depot and buy little owes you think
it's like helping people understand sort
of what it is its functionality people
have apps on their phones and very
familiar with having apps and the phones
and suddenly with something like the
nest the nest makes you think makes
people realize that oh they can this is
easy but I can control stuff and I huh
do you think that when you come home you
think how am I plants doing okay we
showed the coop Bochy system this is a
plant system which knows the time you
basically set it up over your phone do
like you tell it what your what kind of
plant you have said is it up and then it
goes you want to see you and tells you
about a water things that's really cool
knife becomes easy yeah this is again I
could have fairly mainstream brand
yelping you can control the power output
with your phone everybody leaves that
you know ions on sure or worries without
leaving their ions and obviously and so
you can switch off and make sure that
that that socket self health is a really
important issue of the sea for many
people and we have these consumer
devices which we used to see in doctors
offices yeah even just that these are
things you can buy is sort of new yeah
the phone automatically recognizes
you're wearing it
and with the press of a button it pumps
up just like the talk two words so you
got 133 over 95 it seems high it's got
an Amber Alert oh no I'm dying oh my god
this might tell it to me straight doc
convinced me that little printer is cool
and interesting we've had a big debate
about this job really like it some
people don't why it why is this here I
think right time right place that leads
a little printer work what everyone
loves in the exhibition is this Aquafarm
yeah it's a hydroponic farm basically
and so imagine you're having a breakfast
and you want to add some up to your
breakfast this farm works with this fish
that's underneath it the plants are
fertilized by the fishes poop okay the
roots of the plants clean the water for
the fish as well so you'll never have to
touch this thing is totally so sitting
going it going and you fed the fish you
know after the first month Reza Wow
self-sustaining this is called
principles okay what we like about this
3d printer is its consumer price is 299
dollars that's not that kind of thing
about some of the prizes put some of the
others yeah and so you can begin to see
how this technology is going to kind of
infiltrate the home in different ways
yeah you have a big hanging garden here
and they're all connected right exactly
all connected and then inside this is a
reservoir water it sends it to the top
and then it drips the water down and it
can monitor the humidity the amount of
water going through the temperature and
with a tablet it doesn't need to be
connected it can be remote it goes
through the pit ponics system and it
monitors and moderates the kind of the
growth of this these plants yeah i gotta
i'm like i'm gonna move into this body
is that cool I'm just gonna live here
101 West 15 anytime yeah
so one thing PSFK didn't talk about is
security you have all this cool stuff in
your house but how do you make sure that
you know it doesn't burn down or that
nobody steals it all from you so this
man hasn't answered that question Adam
cigar the founder and CEO of Canary so
tell me what is what is canary so canary
is the easiest way to connect to a
physical place and do security and have
security at home whether your homeowner
your renter you just want to have
information live video recorded
information on what's going on in your
physical environment so what is security
mean like what are you what are you
telling me so this is this is canary
this is the thing this is what is this
what is this telling so security is
really about two things is about
information and communication and right
now the security systems that are out
there aren't really good at either of
those things and and so we were devising
with the easiest way to both pull
information so canary is jam-packed with
sensors video audio temperature humidity
air quality a seller ometer and more and
it's designed to constantly stream that
data to the cloud where we analyze it
look at pattern detection and we geo
locate your cellphone know if your home
or not we're really trying to find the
easiest way to know if everything's okay
in your environment and if it's not send
all that information directly to you at
your mobile phone notify you so you can
take action immediately on it so you'll
tell me things like you know somebody
opened my front door on my sites unless
it's me what you can tell by my phone or
you know there's carbon monoxide or I
don't even know what else there's a fire
or somebody stoled your thing from you
um so it's you know you said some of the
other systems out there are bad at the
information and the communication is it
just this is just that it hasn't been
out there before like you mentioned
before you you know this started you
sort of went into home depot and there
just wasn't anything so like what's
what's been out there what's this oh
security today is really about they are
the big installers like a DTS of the
world and there's some new entrance to
the field like AT&amp;amp;T and Comcast and then
there are the DIY and they're a bunch of
those and some new ones which are great
but the to both the DIY and the
installers have one thing in common in
that
they're both very complicated right
their sensors all around they're
expensive generally and for a renter
like myself they're just terrible I mean
so I'm not I'm not going to put sensors
all around my home to do security and so
most people don't have any securities a
90 million homes in the US have nothing
no connectivity no security even if
their house or apartment burned down and
they are away from it they won't know
about it right which to us which is why
crazy because it burns down you're like
well I was just trying to get any
absolutely true yes but you don't want
to lose your stuff right but so you have
all these tools and then you have sort
of a communications back end to the
whole system to exactly so we we've both
created the easiest way to connect
because canary you literally you buy it
on boxes put it on your table we have a
30 second set of process and then you're
done you have home security the device
itself constantly sending data to the
cloud and you can access it whenever you
want its user option if they want to
store that data or not we're analyzing
it always to know well if it's normal
for on Tuesday 3pm for someone to come
in your house and have activities
whether it's a babysitter or a someone
cleaning your house or fan of yours at
visits or is it normal if you have a dog
or cat in the home we're going to learn
that over the first few weeks you you
own the device and get better at sending
you informed alerts so if we know you
have a dog and the dog walks in front of
the device we're not going to alert you
we're gonna alert you when something
wrong happens when somebody else's dog
when boxes when so nielsen died like a
really big dog yeah you have this little
Tsar we're like what's this big dog yeah
this is definitely probably yeah so let
me see I want to see the actual you made
this you can take it apart probably
actually this like oh we can take take
apart on purpose so we put together with
magnets and here's a one of our
prototypes we have here basically the
video infrared both night vision in
motion detection number of sensors both
on the front and back boards this here
is for our testing purposes and it will
include a speaker a siren and others
it's all in this really in this
composter it's like it's it's also an
alarm to it's not just sending you the
information but it's
it's you absolutely it's also an alarm
that that will go off at certain times
or you can activate it yourself so if
you see someone's going on you can
activate the siren from your phone I'm
interesting as a deterrent to get rid of
some of those in your environment cool
yeah and so it's like is it just knew
that all of this stuff is so small that
you can put it all in one sort of little
package like this yeah well what we have
today is we have ubiquitous wireless
broadband in homes everyone has wireless
connection you have the actual video
technology is so amazing today even a
couple years ago it was very different
especially IP video third you have state
data storage so to both stream and store
data in the cloud a couple years ago was
so expensive to do that no one was
really doing it right and she was like
there were old systems where there was
like a video camera but it was like
forty nine ninety-nine a month to access
like a video that was in the close
reading yeah and you have a lot of
systems like they're like that today
right it doesn't need to be like that
yeah it doesn't need to be and so with
with canary were actually providing
alerts backups you can use your friends
and families backups you can have live
video or both incidents that have
happened all for free when you buy the
device on the phone and so it just is
complete game changer it's taking a
model that's a few thousand dollars yeah
like security or even DIY systems that
will cost you thousands of dollars are
complicated set of the average person
won't set one of those up right we're
getting rid of all that and we're saying
you can simplify by having one device if
you're in a larger environment larger
home you get a more than one they all
work together but most apartments would
literally need just one device and right
and then you can have security what do
you where do you put it like is there if
I you know I have this like tiny little
New York apartment should put it
somewhere where it's like facing the
front door I guess it's sort of a
different device depending yeah well
yeah we tested this in about a hundred
apartments in New York and other cities
in the best place to put it is if you
can see the front door and a living room
or the main hallway at the same time
what happens is in apartments if
something goes wrong the likelihood that
they'll pass by a central area of that
apartment is over ninety-five percent so
if if there
you know you'll see you don't need
windows sensors on you know your
bathroom window like what how is that
useful to know when someone's open your
bathroom window you want to know what's
going on in your environment you want to
be able to see it immediately on your
phone and we always take action if I
mean if it's nothing okay maybe it's
some you know you're you're at work and
you have a child as your child's four
steps that you happen to capture and
that's great I mean it allows you to be
there to be present environment and in a
very unobtrusive way cool and so there's
there's apps to control all this yeah
right can I can you show me the door how
the apps work yeah so it's all of course
prototypes now but all working
prototypes so you have a basic app which
you can connect any time it's giving you
immediately if there's an alert the
immediate last alert so you're not alert
is like you know somebody opened the
door or somebody you know success
they're fine idea when there's not
supposed to be there's a rapid rise in
temperature totally so this was two
minutes ago actually we have won this
one to set up in our office so you can
see my co-founders here here live in the
video you can get historical data or
events coming from it so you can know
what happened over time and this is all
going to get so much more personalized
as as we continue to develop because
we're launching now the product and a
crowdfunding but the actual product will
come out towards the end of the EOB you
next year and so the app and everything
will be just so so much improved by that
time and available in the iphone we're
planning for the Android as well cool
and it's it'll there's their stuff of
coming for the ipad 2 because that's
kind of what i do is sitting just like
be mr. security guard and just monitor
my world exactly so our roadmap is
iphone then ipad at android of course
it'll be web enabled so you can access
to the web at any time in that our plans
get all through all that before launch
and then and from there just keep
developing cool and so where where do
you you know you mention the app will be
there better and different by the time
it comes out what do you guys thinking
about now cuz like once you put all the
sensors in this thing and stick it on a
table there's like a lot of stuff it
could do right so what else you guys
sort of think well they what's really
going into this and the heart and soul
are the
the computer vision and the algorithms
we're developing for to learn about your
behaviors and and those because it's all
done in the cloud it'll keep getting
smarter and smarter over time so even if
you have the device day one it's getting
smarter both by learning about you over
the first few weeks to learn your
patterns but it's also getting smarter
because we're learning about everyone
have people operate in general and so
learning about the community and how
people operate we can make our algorithm
smarter to to know what's normal what's
not to be able to send you better and
better alerts because ATT I've ADT or
another security system their false
alarm rate is ninety-nine percent
because they just go like oh crap the
alarm went off leave no ay y but no idea
why so like less than seven percent of
people that have alarm systems actually
a video in them so yeah if your adt
alarm goes off what they're gonna call
you you're not home what are you gonna
do right I mean are you gonna send your
neighbor are you gonna go home or you
probably the Sun the police yeah the
place will drive by if they don't see
anything suspicious outside then they'll
leave I mean that's what they do so
here's here's my question is do people
care about security like they should
yeah but do they like what have you you
know done any research I looked in all
this stuff we're gonna be searched or
there's public public available research
that show a number the surveys show that
up to eighty-five percent of people want
some kind of security at homes
absolutely hurting in fact what a new
survey was just released showed that
forty percent people wanted security
video in our home it's such a new thing
so few people have video in terms of
security so it was great for us to see
that but for all security is not just
about keeping bad guys out writes about
giving you information from your
environment and that information might
be you know learning about the air
quality and the temperature and how it
acts during the day it might be about
making sure that someone you're looking
after is comfortable so my father is in
California can help look after his
father who's 96 and lives in Florida it
can be about looking after a child and
making sure that the child is safe and
they're both their environment the the
temperature the humidity in their
environment and also you know if you
have a babies that are like how they're
doing appropriate things like checking
out at work so safety and security for
us is no
just about one thing about putting
sensors around right on the house it's
about being more connected to that
physical place in a very easy and an
almost fun way and this is something you
could you know convince your ninety six
year old grandfather actually plug in
and absolutely but my 96 troll
grandfather is on facebook and he could
probably solve this himself yeah your
night 60 little grandfather's on
facebook he was on facebook before me
that is totally I'm very impressed yes
man yeah um so this is coming out for
crowdfunding this week this is coming
out for crowdfunding and on IndieGoGo
yeah and how much is it gonna cost it's
gonna job it's gonna cost a beach room
149 199 happening on how quickly people
jump on there and is that so that about
the price you're going for for the
retail yep see the retail price would be
199 and as I said the apps free the
basic service is free connectivity
alerts everything backups and this kind
of thing has never been done before and
so we're what excites us the most is the
ability to give people access and
security that haven't added if you think
about it people in the largest homes
they're the ones that have security
they're the ones that need the lease
like large single-family homes are the
ones that are least likely to be burgled
least likely for there to be a problem
least likely to have a fire least like
it for any problem because they can
afford the best construction and the
best equipment and the app security
apartments which are specially rentals
the most likely to have a problem and
they're the ones that at least like and
have security and it's crazy for us I
mean that's unfair so we want to
democratize security make it available
for anyone and just and say you know
tell the big company is that their way
of doing things is not needed their way
of doing things doesn't work and this is
a new approach cool and I don't have to
you know convince my landlord to let me
drill into the wall to have something
I've seen nothing to install you take it
you buy me a you put on the table you
can move it from room to room if you
want or you can take it obviously take
it with you if you move from one house
to one apartment together yeah that's
awesome cool well Adam thank you so much
thanks so much for having me really
appreciate it I gotta I gotta get one of
these and absolutely my parents have two
cats and perfect just are constantly
petrified that
cats are dead uh because you know there
might be and I'm still old what do you
are and yeah and so like this is you
know it's peace of mind yeah I mean they
could you know talking to New Yorkers
probably more than anywhere else the
first thing people think about other
catch of the dog yeah and and what the
ability to like wow I can see what
what's happening all day long just check
in on them like you know brings pleasure
to their lives so this you can do that
and get like a like a live webcam
totally your pet and just live video
anytime you want exactly awesome alright
well thank you so much thank you he's
great a beer cool and that's our show
thanks so much to Adam Sager for being
here thanks to pierce fox from psfk for
showing us around the home of the future
we will be back next week on Monday and
every Monday and be sure and check us
out on youtube and download us has a
podcast if you want to and we will see
you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
