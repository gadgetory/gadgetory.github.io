this is the Samsung Galaxy Note edge
basically it's the same thing as the
note board and the same processor the
same design the same camera at the same
s-pen the same everything it is one big
change it's this it has a rounded
display that actually is part of the
same display if it's a little smaller
than the note 4 but it's curved and what
it lets you do is in software actually
have essentially a whole separate set up
off to the side so you can do whatever
you want to do on the screen itself and
then you have little menus over here
sometimes it's apps sometimes folders
will open sometimes it's contextual
things like if you have the camera open
the shutter button and all the modes
come down here so basically it's
designed to be sort of complementary
sort of separate and it's basically a
whole other screen that you can choose
to do whatever you want with Samsung's
on this before with the continuum which
was sort of silly this actually seems
much cooler so you can customize it you
by adding things like news and sports
scores and Twitter and things about your
steps and all this stuff and what's
gonna be really interesting is when
developers can actually get a hold of
this and start to do cool stuff my
favorite things so far this is kind of
small is the alarm clock mode so the
idea is you set it down in your table as
you sleep next to it and it will just
show you the time and you can scroll
through your notifications you can
scroll through or your news your steps
whatever you whatever you have while
you're lying in bed looking at it I
don't know if that's cool I'm coming
into it though so I don't know I'm a fan
so this is otherwise just like the
Galaxy Note 4 it has a 16 megapixel
camera on the back plus a heart rate
sensor it has a removable back it has
this new metallic design it's actually
really really nice it has a super-fast
processor it has the s pen it has
Samsung's same sort of wacky overall
software as always though I have to say
it is getting a little better with every
iteration of such wigs it's gonna be the
flagship model Samsung doesn't expect to
sell as many of the
the note 4 but this is the one that
Samsung is gonna trot out and say like
this is the future it's gonna be
announced at Aoife Samsung hasn't
announced pricing or availability yet
but there will probably be more to talk
about this fall it's coming to all four
major carriers in the US and around the
world it's definitely the flagship phone
and that is the Samsung Galaxy Note edge
