secure than the house of the past
because it's protected by cutting-edge
technology the front door has a smart
lock there are cameras around the
perimeter that can give us a live video
feed and our front doorbell can alert us
when someone's approaching all this tech
is meant to instill absolute confidence
that I'm as secure as I can be from any
intruders but tucked away quietly in a
corner of my home office is this a
simple unassuming printer and in the
home of the future it has the potential
to be an open window to my digital self
all these connected devices are somewhat
like Windows you're a link to this house
all of them are an opening that needs to
be secured and opening into the network
in this case and to your data the
general security of your network is only
as strong as its weakest link this is
nadir Israel co-founder and CTO of
armored security his job is to assess
and secure computer systems all the
devices we see in this home are in fact
computers these are not just devices
they run code they do everything your
laptop can do except they lack the
inherent security that you can put on
your laptop so I'm used to having my
computer have anti-virus software that's
common but the other devices the printer
these used to be dumb simple devices but
now they are basically computers that
printer actually runs a standard
operating system a very old one too and
that's very usual these days what that
means it can itself contract viruses
malware so it's not just a printer or a
thermostat or a refrigerator or a
ceiling fan or any number of devices
that populate the internet of things as
we learned in our last episode on
connecting this home Internet of Things
devices are still in their infancy as a
result products are designed more often
with connectivity first and security
second okay so you might be asking
should I be nervous that my smart light
bulb could be used to hack into my bank
account actually it's not likely it's
rarely the case where someone would
target you specifically in Europe
what's more common is that you're
basically a target of a wide-scale
campaign that's opportunistic he's right
most cyberattacks aren't targeted at
specific people since they rarely make
much money off any single account
hackers are trying to take over
thousands of accounts at a time so the
best course of action is making yourself
less of a target compared to other users
and it's not that difficult even basic
security measures can put you ahead of
many others and in most cases using
services like two-factor authentication
would put you in the top 5% of accounts
it's basically around changing passwords
keeping software up-to-date closing down
connections you don't use using password
protection where you can everything that
you can do to kind of lower your profile
secure things for example when you have
a car alarm it doesn't prevent a very
motivated person from coming and taking
your car it just makes that car less of
a target of opportunity there is however
another source of valuable data in the
home its occupants in our home in the
future I can control almost every device
with just my voice alone thanks to our
Alexa and a slew of Alexa enabled
products but these abilities are also
able to be tracked catalogued and stored
building out a profile of my behaviors
inside my home and for Tech's biggest
companies that data on my home life is
extremely valuable an analogy could be
the Wild West you know and it was all
about the homestead grabbing the land
having the square footage where the real
value was what do you own under that
land we're advancing into all of this
new digital interfaces while not really
considering the mining rights to the
real value which really is the data this
is an Boysen a futurist who runs a
strategic consulting business here in
Texas and she doesn't see this business
model changing the whole incentive is to
share data and I don't see that ending a
time
we're going to have to add some level
opt-in to that what a concept
privacy as a commodity right exactly
your home life becomes commodified
because you can use your data as a
currency you can use it to offset the
costs that you otherwise would have had
and then that becomes part of the
business model take Vizio a TV
manufacturer who made a name for
themselves offering quality TVs at
aggressively competitive prices part of
the reason they were able to offer their
product at such a reduced rate was that
they were collecting and selling their
users data and in 2017 Vizio had to pay
two point two million dollars in fines
because of illegal data collection on
more than eleven million TVs despite
those finds and all the bad press Vizio
TVs are still popular and are still
collecting this kind of data only now
consumers have to choose to opt in
instead of being signed up automatically
but it feels like a stretch that
customers would read the Terms of
Service before making a purchase if
you're struggling to get by you don't
have the luxury to think about your
privacy and then you become much more
easily a target for someone who will be
willing to trade their personal data for
that convenience I don't have a personal
assistant in my house and I don't have
Alexa echo or Google home and the reason
is that I don't want to be recorded 24/7
and I understand maybe the processing
has to happen somewhere else but that's
something that as a consumer I object to
and that's why I don't have that device
companies are already starting to hear
the new demands and the fears from from
their consumers particularly in the
aftermath of the scandal with Facebook
and Cambridge analytic a started a new
awareness where people started to make
more demands of the companies around
them
we didn't take a broad enough view of
our responsibility and that was a big
mistake and it was my mistake and I'm
sorry well we're already recently seen
in the EU that a sweeping new privacy
legislation called gdpr
which already now have huge consequences
for technology companies that are
collecting data I think we might be
seeing some similar types of legislation
perhaps not as pervasive so we're
starting to see already that the tech
companies are starting to adopt a much
more holistic view where it's not only
about what can we do technology wise but
what do people actually want in their
homes while governments companies and
public opinion try to create order in
this wild-west of data collection the
best thing we can do as consumers and
users of these devices is be aware of
the trade-offs because if we're going to
fully secure our home we need to first
decide what's worth protecting thank you
so much for watching now you've seen how
we're securing our home in the future
but what devices would you use and how
would you protect them let us know in
the comments below and we'll see you
next week with more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
