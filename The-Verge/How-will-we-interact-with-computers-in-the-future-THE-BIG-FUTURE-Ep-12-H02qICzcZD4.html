by way of our hands and fingers for
decades now first there was the keyboard
than a mouse and the touchscreen but
they all took advantage of our
evolutionary ability to manipulate
objects with our digits you see a thing
you touch it and something changes right
now it's second nature with touchscreens
we added a whole new language suddenly
it wasn't just tapping and clicking
there was also pinching zooming three
finger slides but we're still just
basically tapping on glass so what comes
after the glass one idea is to take
touch out of the equation entirely this
is the Google glass approach just drop
the information in front of their faces
and let them talk or in case of
emergency tap a sidebar people are
trying to bring this same technology to
contact so you wouldn't even need to
wear a headset but so far it's only at a
resolution of one pixel for combat big
screens like the ones in Minority Report
looked fun waving your arms to move big
graphics around they have a lot of
problems too we do a lot of interacting
with computers and big gestures get
tiring fast but maybe those gestures
don't need to be so flamboyant maybe
smaller movements for work gesture
tracking tech can detect a hand in
midair and tell which part is the finger
and which part is the palm so when you
spin your hand around it can spin the
graphic around to match it it still
lacks feedback but maybe that comes next
something like a nano coating that
vibrates to fake the feedback to what
you're not really touching or neural
trickery that makes it feel like
something's really in your hand the
thing is we've always been really good
with our hands when you hold something
whether it's a hammer or a joystick it
gives you a lot of information we can
feel resistance in weight like really
precise finger movements to give
directions that would be impossible
otherwise that's how we separated
ourselves evolutionarily we were the
species with the right fingers to use
tools as we got smarter about how we
interact with computers we'll get better
and better at honing in on those
strengths it's one reason why the
interfaces of tomorrow might look an
awful lot like the past</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
