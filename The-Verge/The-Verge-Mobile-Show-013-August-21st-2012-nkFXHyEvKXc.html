fight about which Dungeons and Dragons
campaign is the best and i picked dark
sun for what i think are really obvious
reasons but let's face it that's pretty
nerdy and crazy glar if you want to talk
to him about the fast and the furious he
will vastly quickly and furiously tell
you which one is the best and why and if
you want to talk to vlad about whether
kale or wheatgrass has a higher more
important nutritional value for your
body bless his beating heart under his
wall muscle chest he can talk to you
about that at length uh so we're all
nerds we're all nerds together and we're
all nerds together about phones and if
you're watching this show right now
let's face it chances are you are too
and you know what that's actually kind
of Awesome so let's not be ashamed let's
be nerds together stay tuned for the
verge mobile show IM dieter bohn I'm
vlasova and pretty sigler and this is a
virgin mobile show it is lucky episode
number 13 for the week of August
twentieth 2012 and we've got a lot of
mobile phone news to talk about how are
you guys how are you nerds I'm good I
feel really good about that introduction
you need go to the hearts of me bare
feet like I actually can opine on the
different categories and types of
cabbage which part is my favorite on a
given day of the week well I went to
different categories cabinet wheatgrass
really don't aren't directly comparable
are they I mean that wasn't really fair
but i'm not a huge nutritional cabbage
nerd so I guess I can't really speak to
that but I do love kale I just we joined
a co-op that delivers fresh vegetables
to our apartment door and so I've been
eating a ton of kale lately which is
pretty awesome
good about me I just I don't know if
this counts toward any nutritional
street cred but I just had a tall cool
glass of v8 which I'm told has eight
different vegetables in it spanning
several different color groups they've
got the red group the orange group in
the green group Syria is very I'm pretty
I'm pretty sure it also has your monthly
allowance your RMA of salt well that's
why you get the list that's the you stop
being an amateur dieter you gotta get
the book sodium v8 ok some of the eight
nerd apparently hey Rudy say had an
eight Ralph where's Nate rel I don't see
any golf so now the hang of the video
feed yeah well there is so yeah he's in
he's in the virtuous office which is
pretty awesome we should just get
started talking about the news and I
think the main thing to talk about is
just how insane September fifth is gonna
be right we're really December in total
right because you have apple presumably
in the middle of the month yeah but yes
at ember fifth in particular is going to
be just a complete nightmare yeah listen
that's not you know let's not disregard
Aoife because i'm actually gonna be
there so that's not the savvy for which
is the thing that happens before the
timber fit that's 10 end of august first
few days of September that's what we're
going to see the galaxy note 2 from
Samsung and maybe something else ah
thank you you kind of expect the other
companies to wake up and do something as
well since motorola is going to do a new
device in the fifth which is no you know
is going to be an Android device so what
are the other Android device makers
doing it what the role is doing
something Samsung's do something with
the guys note 2 how did the others
respond how does HTC respond is LG still
in this market is all well it's not
overplay this motorola announcement I
know that Motorola wants you to
this is the most important event of sep
tember but you'll notice that on the the
invite for that event they have the
verizon logo which i think almost
certainly means that this is going to be
the razr HD which is sort of correct me
if I'm wrong but I mean it's basically
just an atrix HD in a razor body for
verizon so I mean it's cool and all I
mean is that's great but I don't think
that that that is going to be the most
exciting thing happening next month I
mean personally I mean I I like the
atrix and I think that you know an atrix
done right could be well I guess I
wasn't done wrong in the first place but
you know could that could be interesting
but I mean someone in the chat just said
that Motorola trolled nokia by saying
join us for the day's main event Oh big
time like that's too big time like that
as soon as a second Esau we just started
okie doke left yeah um just moment um
I'm being distracted by people in chat
in a whole separate yet yes well nokia
the nokia vent stemma fifth is gonna
ruin this phone 8 it's gonna be at least
one device stop sending me chat messages
you troll I'm talking to close I wasn't
I was presenting a few I was getting a
chat dating Brandon it I'm sorry that's
right actually don't you just point out
that while this this uh this podcast is
happening we have the the chat on the
site so we're watching what people are
saying us as we talk we have our own
chat where we're talking to each other
and sending each other secret messages
which sometimes works and sometimes
doesn't we also have got our internal
chat for you know verge work and
actually there's anywhere between like
four and six rooms that we might be in
and looking at texts flowing down and I
don't let you guys mention that wild
diesel was given that explanation
somebody peeked in through the door of
my bedroom so it's just yeah we're so
freaking popular we can't be left alone
for good you know 60 90 minutes to nerd
out about
okay wait wait I'm so glad but I want to
go back for just one second um the
vagueness of that statement concerns me
someone peeked in through the door of
your bedroom like how many random people
did you just have crawling around your
house where someone some mysterious
individual peeks through your bedroom is
the Kris if I person identify the
individual and you don't know the
individual how useful is it to you or to
anybody in our audience that's true
that's your damage somebody established
that Vlad is into nutrition and we've
established for a long time now that
flat is a communist it's obvious that he
lives on a collectivist farm somewhere
and so there's no way of knowing which
crazy commits inhabitant has opened his
door to pekin that's true seriously
nokia come on this is contract or a
moment all right okay so when I was
making a the amount of texts that we
have flowing by while we're trying to
talk is insane right i mean how much how
many like one looks out fo communicate
ok is do you see in the course of a day
it it's completely insane like it and
this is why we can't talk about nokia
because we're completely distracted all
the time yeah detention again you know I
had a really nice quote from some old
time people I've got us this era the
quote from civilization the one about
bureaucracy people appreciated that so I
called another quotes which reminds me
here a French philosopher again I've
managed to forget the name said that
distractions are our worst enemy and
I've also managed to forget freaking
quote I don't know what I'm quoting it
but it's like we try and find
distractions from the misery of life but
then they actually take over and then
they become our worst enemy and they
then themselves become essentially
misery and the trial jury of life and
there's a lot of truth to that if you
sit down and think about it you might
discover more of that truth if you go to
an amsterdam cafe and reese it ever
think about it ah but Susie nokia let me
just
finish up with these guys so they're
doing a windows phone 8 announcement at
least one device could be a couple we
don't know exactly two doing it in
conjunction with Microsoft so as far as
you know this is going to be the first
windows phone 8 device announcement both
of them are making it essentially the
flagship windows phone 8 announcement I
would expect that to be the case anyway
given the close partnership and as d2
was saying Motorola is trying to troll
the entire thing by calling its event or
the same day the main event force
attempt it and I totally agree with dita
the main event is Tim effect ok
Microsoft Windows Phone 8 that's it what
do you think Chris yeah it's not just
about nokia of course right it's about
sort of the rest of the reveal for
windows phone 8 which is pretty big deal
and I think it's very notable this is
something that I don't the people have
discussed too much but just the fact
that Microsoft is allowing nokia to take
the lead on doing the full consumer
reveal of the next version of Windows
Phone is is a big step for both
companies and their their partnership
and I I don't know what that means to
other OEMs but I don't think that anyone
has really known where exactly where the
other Windows Phone OEMs have stood for
for a good year now but but yeah this is
going to be a really big deal both for
nokia microsoft and i'm excited i know
that i say that leading up to every
single Windows Phone announcement uh but
it this is a platform that I'm genuinely
intrigued by and really want to see
succeed and become entrenched as a
viable player because they are genuinely
trying to do something different and
cool and notable um so hopefully this is
it I don't you know not to say that I
wanted these particular nokia phones
succeed but just that this platform I
hope that this causes it to flourish in
a way that it hasn't so far the the
thing that I'll be really interested in
is if we get carrier announcements
alongside nokia stuff because you know
we've had rumors for quite a long time
that verizon might be jumping in with
both feet on Windows Phone and if you
stop and think about it you know verizon
going all in on windows phone at the
same time and maybe going out all in
with Nokia would actually be a pretty
big deal for all three of the companies
involved here and i think that would
that would really help that the the
other thing that I'm really curious
about is you know what else haven't we
seen in the full reveal of windows so
Nate I mean we know what the smaller
tiles we know about you know a couple
like small sort of nerdy developer type
features and whatnot but I still feel
like there's got to be some other big
flashy consumer-facing feature that
hasn't been put forth yet I think so i
think that they're they're holding and
back and in i think that that Greg
Sullivan who kind of did the PR tour
around the last windows phone 8 event he
actually said that right there's still a
lot yet to be revealed and I hope that's
true i hope we see some really cool
stuff at that event on the 5th but it
buddy you know i hate to belabor the
point about other OEMs but where does
this leave uh you know HTC obviously is
the big one samsung i I don't know we're
hearing rumors about this Odyssey device
and there's one other from Samsung I
think we've talked about in the past
that came out of the the trial documents
and apple vs samsung but it's it that
the fact that that they're basically
co-branding this as a nokia microsoft
fenton doing this big windows phone 8
reveal there's just really interesting
to me of course i mean i guess i guess
google did the same thing with with ICS
right they they co-branded that as a
samsung galaxy nexus ICS event so it you
know whatever well just a point about
Samsung I know that both ross miller and
neil i have been very forthright about
their opinion with samsung and the way
they express it is take a look at
Samsung's latest and greatest Android
phone and take a look at Samsung's
latest and greatest windows phone one of
them says this is our business is what
we rely on the other one says ACK you
know we just do this so it's some
diversity to our portfolio that's it um
and also the thing that we've seen with
these samsung leaks stuff that is
emerged from the documents kind of seems
like they
to do a galaxy s free show but for
windows phone which again for Windows
Phone enthusiasts is exciting right they
they want that software and they want
samsung say it's hardware but in fact as
matter is the galaxy's free is no longer
Samsung's very latest hardware you know
it's a few more sold Sampson brings over
at first and then triplet is there a
Windows where it is still their latest
hardware oh no that is hard ways in the
labs Chris but you know what I'm saying
it's been a few months and delays
hardware by the time these Windows Phone
device come out will be the galaxy note
2 but what I'm saying is Windows Phone
is essentially the trickle down or west
for samsung right yeah I will def air I
I could I can agree with that but I mean
the question about it continuing to be
the trickle Donald's I think you're
right about samsung but will it be for
HTC you know HTC is not doing well right
now and you know is there space for
Windows Phone to give them a bump
especially with so much attention being
given to nokia well i'm not convinced
that would be the case because in that
case we essentially change for changes
sake because as you feel like if you
look at the options that the the OEMs
have android is the best like the iphone
isn't an option iOS is an option for
them to pick up so that's not even a
conversation and android is clearly
ahead of windows phone unless the hidden
feature that Microsoft has for windows
phone is some underground ecosystem that
has been cooking up and all of a sudden
boom there's like 100 booties superb
apps for Windows Phone which you didn't
know about before and which are now
awesome so switching out the windows
phone will be just well we're different
as far as the htc's concern but then who
are you different from you different
from the android gadget different of
Samson but you're not actually different
from Nokia and then you're falling into
another trap which is if you invest
really severely and deeply into Windows
Phone you haven't defined nokia and
Nokia strength is design and
all of the things that they would say
you know the distinguishing OEM so i
don't really like that fight for HTC I
think agency needs to just keep doing
what has been doing and hope they can
just do it better essentially just
execute better one at a macro level I
think the question is is there some
economic principle that ultimately
dictates that there needs to be one to
one relationship between platforms and
successful profitable OEMs and that's
the question that remains to be answered
but you know that the market cannot
feasibly support more than three maybe
four platforms right there's no evidence
to suggest that that that anything
beyond that will survive over the past
few years so now the question is can
these beasts I don't want to call it one
second tier but these these these OEMs
that aren't the leading OEM on each
platform can they carve out enough
market to just stay profitable and of
course nokia has the windows phone
relationship locked up samsung has
android locked up where does that leave
everybody else not just HTC but but LG
and you know we have these these Chinese
guys that are really trying to make a
splash right now like huawei and ZTE I'm
sure that they can be successful in the
Asian market but can they can they find
it a niche in North America i don't know
i don't think so i mean i mean even HTC
is said that they're gonna make a push
in china right and we see that that
comes through and I mean what's the
we've got the story of the HTC CEO Peter
Chou there was a memo that there's
multiple areas where HTC needs
improvement I mean glad you said you
know they need to just keep on doing
what they've been doing and just do it
better and I'm hard-pressed to disagree
with you but like if the 1-series didn't
do it for him like what other ammo have
they got sitting in their arsenal yeah
stock Android it's ever to happen listen
it's a stock answer but is it true no
but it is actually no it is it last
night no no let me let me last night
because there's another apple vs samsung
case going on besides the main one which
by the way there's a live blog
Apple's closing arguments right now
happening which you should read while
you listen to this but in the other case
which was the Galaxy Nexus ban in and
that's about Universal Search so it went
to an appeals court and Samsung is
trying to argue that the Galaxy Nexus
hasn't caused a reparable harm to the
iphone and the quote from their lawyer
was that it had a miniscule amount of
sales and like Samsung is only made I
think it was 250 million off of the
galaxy nexus in the u.s. so like that
was not a tiny event that the launch of
the galaxy nexus google was behind it it
was a you know it was the thing it
wasn't you know a huge apple level event
but you know it's on three carriers it's
a lot more if you want to buy it
unlocked and it hasn't taken off so like
I I don't feel like it's not about stock
it's about marketing muscle and push and
we I guess we haven't really seen
anybody put that behind stock but I just
have a feeling like if HTC were to do it
they'd get some goodwill from the hard
core android fans I would love it you
know but I'm a hard core android fan I
guess right but I just don't see that
it's a a path to like huge success for
them I totally want to this day
operation there's no there-there's
there's no evidence to suggest that the
average consumer walking into a US
retail store can differentiate between
skin android or and stock android nor do
they care yeah okay I agree the first
part I disagree with the second papa the
first part they can't distinguish and
differentiate fine but do they care yes
take care stock Android versus sense is
a better user experience and my question
was for data on your HTC One X what
software are you running at a moment
dieter ah that's a very interesting
question I am running cyanogenmod 10
which by the way is not stock Android
but it is you know an S at it it's so
much closer to it than sense yeah
mom I don't even know what to tell you
guys like I wrote a right to peace where
I save the galaxy nexus to steal the
best android phone you can buy chris
disagrees with me then both you end up
on the Galaxy Nexus at least temporarily
then I argue you know stock Android is
preferable to sense just on the quality
of user experience they don't mind if
people can you know recognize which is
which I'm saying they can recognize the
quality of the user experience which is
better on stock and then you guys are
using it on your phone so I mean the
facts bear out that I'm just always
right and also there's another fact that
tom warren bought a Galaxy Nexus the
other day and tom warren is you know
he's got microsoft tattoos on every body
part you know so he really meaningful by
the way but he it buys android just
because of the song experiencing
garrisoning something he wanted to learn
about it but he loves it does the other
think he bought it and he's falling in
love with it so look but i want to make
it very clear the only reason I'm used
in galaxy nexus now is because i like i
like there's still something very
magical to me about tapping in a cab to
pay for my fare and and the galaxy s3 is
frozen and no does not have the secure
element necessary to get google wallet
working at least not the North American
versions um with them cakes we tell me
is you only using this phone because it
has more functionality allowed phones I
get it notice I'm already showing this
is a google boy look google wallet has
nothing to do with stock right okay can
we can we all agree like that there are
two completely unrelated issues yeah
okay fine they are fine can't you show
everyone I'm interested in something
that we need to to talk about with with
this September fifth event which is the
elephant in the room which is that it's
a week before the rumored iphone event
and so it's you get you kind of it's
hard to get around the sense that these
companies are trying to get their
announcements out before the iphone just
so that they can get a little bit of
attention because after
the 12 the rumored new iphone announced
they'll just be you know iphone iphone
iphone on that's it oh yeah but by the
way I think that's the wrong strategy I
think that's completely the wrong
stretch because what that means is that
they are giving themselves a fixed like
a known fixed amount of time in which
they can get any attention whatsoever
and then and there's that baffle event
and then boom the like any you know any
attention that they had any spotlight
any fraction of the spot like that they
had is instantly wiped off the map if
they announced after the iphone they
control you know they can dial in the
the product in the event and the way
they announce the event and then there's
really no bound there's no limit to how
long they can control that spotlight so
I I don't really understand the the
notion of like rushing to get something
announced before an apple event it just
doesn't really make any sense to me I
I'm on the show Chris I I mean first of
all it's very much in line with the
habit in the industry i mean if you
think of CES CES kicks off let's say the
fifth to january thereabouts everybody
pre announces their announcements on my
31st december nowadays just to get that
first just to be able to say first we
got there first we did this first it's a
terrible habit but so many companies
maintain it and if you recall microsoft
with its surface launch event everybody
commented that although the promotional
video was great and the surface tablets
will create clearly well developed in
you know designed over a long period of
time the actual event though extremely
hurried so microsoft was also in a rush
to get there ahead of somebody else get
there in the right it's new psych or
whatever and I'm not even convinced that
you know if you announce to say a week
after the iphone as opposed to a week
before i'm not going to see you can get
that much height because everybody will
be too busy saying okay it's two days
until the iphone pre-orders start
shipping has anybody got the iphone
pre-orders have you had a shipping
confirmation i mean it's it's always my
new share that
with an iphone launch and it annoys me
and I'm sure annoys most people but it
happens and that's that then tends to
become the news coverage which is a line
for everybody it ages the way it is I
wholeheartedly disagree but you're
entitled to well how about something we
can all agree on a tease FaceTime policy
they are not charging extra technically
but they are requiring a different uh I
believe slightly more expensive plan
you're going to need to get on the
mobile share plan in order to use
FaceTime as opposed to their standard
plans and my right that mobile share is
replacing what's currently data pro
which is their tethering plan or my hime
drunk I've been assured by AT&amp;amp;T that
that the mobile share plans are
supplemental to their existing plans but
you can see how over time through moves
like this facetime move they're hoping
to kind of like naturally obsolete the
be you know the quote-unquote legacy
plans so when when they announced mobile
share one of the things that they were
touting was the fact that unlike verizon
where they are now putting everybody on
a share everything plan on AT&amp;amp;T I'm
they're not doing that but this is I
mean it's you know six of one half dozen
to the other they're gonna end up with
moves like this just putting all these
old plans in a very bad place yeah I
mean I mean I'm paying for the data pro
plan right now which is a plan that
costs a bit more to include tethering
which like I've given how easy it is to
like get tethering sneakily on smart
phones these days I kind of feel like
I'm just doing it out of like a boy
scout sense of morality but there it is
so I mean you know it this won't affect
me i'm sure i'll switch over to the
mobile share and that'll be that but I
imagine there's going to be a bunch of
people that you know are going to have
to be making a hard decision of you know
do I want to pay more for basically the
same data in order to get this feature
and so there's been a lot of noise about
whether or not it
the brakes the FCC's open Internet rules
and Chris you actually wrote a really
good piece on exactly what the story is
here yeah I think that everybody is
hoping that that this move violates the
FCC's existing rules that are a part of
its open Internet initiative and there's
I don't have the exact verbiage in front
of me but it says something to the
effect of a carrier a wireless carrier
cannot block an application or service
that competes with its own voice or
video services and I'm postulating that
ATT is going to argue very hard over the
coming weeks and months when this
becomes a huge public policy debate that
facetime does not compete directly or
really even indirectly with any service
that it offers itself right because AT&amp;amp;T
does not offer a mobile video calling
service and they and you can't really
make a compelling argument that facetime
is a direct replacement for 18 teens
voice service because FaceTime can't at
least currently can't be used in a voice
only mode and you can't call people that
are using non apple devices with it so I
think they look tape here that disagrees
with that assertion I'm just putting
that out fair enough uh yeah I mean I I
just think that that they've that ATT
believes that they've carved open just
enough of a loophole in the existing
open internet regulation so that this is
not going to be a problem for them
verizon you know so the next obvious
question is will verizon do the same
thing they are in a slightly more
tenuous position only because they're
sitting on that 700 megahertz spectrum
the block suspected so-called black
speech flexi spectrum that has the open
access provision attached to it and and
that is a much more stringent set of
regulations just on that one block of
spectrum that would make it almost
certainly illegal for them to try to try
to do something like this but I think
unfortunately I'm not happy about it I
wasn't happy about writing this report I
was just delivering the bad news that I
really don't think that there is any
existing law in place that prevents 18t
from legally do
well you know what could prevent agency
from doing this chris is some actual
competition as opposed to them you're
essentially state-sponsored duopoly over
in the US which I am going to just use
as a segue a perfectly self-serving
segue to transition into the UK and our
our Kerry situation which has had quite
a tumultuous day today because
everything everywhere which is the
company that was set up from the
combination of t-mobile and orange they
got approval from Ofcom local regulator
to do an LTE network on some spare
spectrum that had eighteen hundred
megahertz so now that have licenses to
do 4G LTE on eighteen hundred megahertz
and everybody is freaked out and pissed
off about it vodafone o2 free everybody
they're just okay actually no you
explain to me why i should feel bad for
these companies that aren't going to get
to launch their their LTE networks at
the same time as everything everywhere
cuz i don't get a gent medium like
what's the problem like sorry guys they
happen to get lucky with the way that
they managed their spectrum and they're
gonna be able to launch sooner that's
that's I mean maybe it's just that like
in the US we've seen carriers launch
networks ahead of each other and that's
just the way it is and so I'm just used
to two carriers competing on you know
the quality of their their spectrum and
what kind of data speeds that can offer
as opposed to Europe everybody pretty
much you know is on a more equal partha
but I just I don't see where the
justification is to be unhappy about
this from you know of course the other
companies you know they're gonna it'll
make it makes sense for them to say oh
yeah this is unfair but like what's
genuinely unfair about it well I mean
it's it's a your point is fair enough
teaser but the issue is the primary
issue is the delay right because I mean
first of all there's going to be an
auction to set off the spectrum that the
UK government is assigned for LTE 4G LTE
in the UK that's going to be 800
megahertz which is gonna be
prime real estate and i believe is 2.6
gigahertz it's gonna be the slightly
rougher one it's likely cheaper version
the trouble is everything everywhere is
allowed to go inches 4G service almost
now like two weeks from now 11 for
September I don't know that they'll have
the service ready on that date but
that's when you can start rolling it out
nobody else is the same sort of spectrum
or bandwidth that everything everywhere
has to make use of the same what would
actually found out was that the up come
decision effects okaeri so if anybody
else wants to do LT at 800 megahertz
1800 makers they can do it if they just
don't have as I say the bandwidth to do
that uh isn't English you'll know why
that won't is that everything everywhere
is problem though I mean sure is that
the auction isn't going to start taking
bids until early next year and people
won't be able to get actual service from
every carrier on an even footing on an
equal basis until at least this time
next year so everything everywhere is
getting ever essentially a years head
start that's I mean that's all well and
good and I mean I'm shedding a single
tear for vodafone oh one of the largest
conglomerates in the world but it the
fact remains that under no circumstances
should Ofcom or FCC or the crtc or any
other regulatory body around the world
be artificially inhibiting a innovation
just because other companies don't think
that it's boat unquote fair um but the
thing is market distortions Chris it's
something that the Europeans care about
and the Americans don't there are you
know effects like I mean there's
anything in the u.s. you guys and this
is kind of straight into legal side of
things you guys take a more formal istic
perspective where is like are the
originating conditions fair and then let
people go in kill each other if that's
what the market decides where as here in
Europe people take a boat
consequentialist perspective and they
say okay this appears fair on the
surface letting these guys have the
network
and as I say Ofcom the European Union
Dave approve this the European Union
separately is over the thing approving
the merger between t-mobile and orange
previously but then prove it so they're
fine with it but the point is that the
concern here was about what the effect
would be of having one carry in the UK
with 4g for a whole year in front of
everybody else and the thing that makes
is more interesting and exciting is if
this next I next-generation iphone which
we all kind of anticipate will have ot
if that actually runs on this network
right yeah that is actually that that
particular thing like the the pc wrote
on that like that explains why these
other carriers are like freaking out and
yet trying to make the case that this is
unfair like that perfectly explains it
yeah i mean look if you are the only LTE
network you go to massive advantage over
everybody else because the other thing
is nobody in the UK is done the false
porgy claims that you've had in the US
so people in the UK I'm sorry honest
jaded to the idea for G as Americans are
so if you live and you say yes good I've
got news for you sprint head wimax for a
long ass time before anyone had LTE here
and no one gave to you know what about
it well that's because it's wimax no
it's no good no no all right it was way
faster than anything else on the market
when it was available yeah up but I
don't think that it's it's I mean you
gotta keep in mind that some people are
still under tariffs well ed I mean like
it people it's not like the entire
country is going to rush into everything
I've everywhere just because they start
advertising LTE that's that's absolutely
correct Chris and I had to tell you
really in the comments from our UK
readers and also speaking to Aaron who's
my local colleague a lot of people
actually all know that excited a lot of
people would prefer to have more data on
the 3g and more reliable data on the 3g
service than to have a faster 4G service
and I'm not convinced
once they get a taste of 4G they won't
be like holy you know such and such this
is like the rates an iPad is so much
better I can't live without it anymore
because that's how you guys feel right
over in the US now do you you have 30
services but at the moment like the
latent excitement the anticipation of 4G
NLT in the UK isn't that strong so
Christmas points about it but here's the
thing all of these reservations and
considerations that we might have about
the impact of one network because
there's one that's what given those two
brands having 4G and nobody else having
it for a year they get kind of nullified
again by the iphones effect because if
nobody appreciates the value of having
LTE that sample strength educating
people on why LTE is going to be a good
thing so and educating people why
they're gonna want to pay a premium and
why they're going to want to you know
cut of their contract early get the new
iphone and and this is really the point
you're going to have two tiers of
iphones if the if it's materializes and
pocket-lint one of the UK publications
cite sources that say yes the next
generation iphone will run on the LTE
network that everything everywhere will
roll out we should know you can take
that as credible as you consider pachal
in to be and they're good guys so yeah
hopefully they're right it's gonna it's
gonna make it interesting in any case
but the point is in people's perceptions
is going to be very easy to distinguish
there's going to be the fast life own
fast in terms of programs based and the
regular ipod and since the iphone is
being purchased at least in some
respects because of its was the fact i'm
thinking of well bragging rights right
yeah if you want bragging rights and you
purchase an iphone you're not going to
purchase the regular one you're gonna
purchase a full fat ltu one and this is
what makes it like i just feel like the
iphone magnifies the effects of this
well let's uh let's let's get down to
brass tacks well I would who's your
current carrier free and so what's your
plan when the iphone comes out with LTE
on everything everywhere let me clear
myself my current carrier is free like I
have this habit of pronouncing free as
free so I'm sorry sorry I'm just
correcting myself to save the trouble
for the really pedantic person in
comments I'm sticking with my carrier
because I just exchanged phone too
quickly and too rapidly I like I
wouldn't sweat it or this but but Vlad
I'm going to once again mightily strike
down your your meticulously constructed
argument because this exact same thing
happened when the cdma iphone 4 came out
and again with the 4s where AT&amp;amp;T has
been advertising the fact that they have
a significantly faster data experience
then then verizon does or sprint because
there it's evdo rev a vs whatever
mysterious form of hspa+ that ATT is
using and of course you have the
simultaneous voice and data advantage on
AT&amp;amp;T as well and in that the numbers
just don't bear out that there's been
this this you know I mean like rise and
sells iphone sprint sells iphones ATT
sells iphones but the net effect of
those bragging rights for carriers
between you know in terms of customer
flow between carriers I don't think
those numbers are particularly large and
so I think but so actually I gotta jump
in and defend lad here because we
haven't this this experience that the UK
is about to have is going to be unique
because with the exception I think of
maybe i'm going to say the ego 4g on
sprint which was a new network at a
genuinely good phone we have not had a
simultaneous launch of a next-generation
data network along with the phone that
didn't suck right i mean that's right
you can't say that the Thunderbolt on
verizon PL is it all comparable with the
iphone
to be on everything everywhere and so
you know did people switch to verizon
for LTE yes but it wasn't a huge like
boom let's do this now because it took a
while to roll out and the first
generation of phones were pretty bad and
but I know you know people did switch to
sprint for the evo 4G and so I think
that we are going to see people buy into
the argument that a 4g iphone is better
and faster than 3g iphone and we're
switching for no my thing I'm thinking
of right now is like the Apple adverts
think about those like first of all
everything everywhere gets free
promotion from Apple advertising sex
iPhone but then there's the ads and the
ads are gonna be really simple and
straightforward it's gonna be i'm
downloading a full album and then you
see the progress bar it's like zip zip
zip with elt connection it's like super
fast and then there'll be an
unidentifiable phone on the side of
something if Apple was to be
tongue-in-cheek doesn't matter yeah but
the point is Apple will make it really
crystal clear to people why they want
LTE and why they want 4G and it's just
gonna be one place to get it that's this
thing and everything everywhere they
also revealed today they're gonna launch
a new brand which is you know just
completely nuts and bonkers but it seems
like this new brand they're going to
launch might launch together with the 4g
service it might be the brand for the 4g
service immediately Oh initially and
then after a while after a few months
they might face out orange a tmobile in
the UK but for a while there will be
orange t-mobile and an unnamed brand
from Earth everywhere so we can look
forward to complete consumer confusion
apart from the f1 action I mean to be
fair everything everywhere is pretty
much the worst name for a joint venture
in the history of of the corporate world
agree so anything would be better than
that anything anywhere we better than
everything every where uh look at moving
lighten up I'm sorry it had to be done
um speaking of things that have to be
done we have
talk about blackberry 10 I mean we've if
we do we have got official screen
resolutions 1280 by 720 and 720 x 720
and yes late we've got a good report
from Josh about blackberry to him see if
i can find that but yeah so square
display which i don't know i'm i miss
square displays i rocked a trio for a
really long time I think square displays
could be uh I wait there wait hotness
but let me let me let me blow your minds
for a minute just allow me to just sit
back relax let me blow your mind imagine
a 720 x 720 full touch phone think about
it for a minute just that kind of like a
bad thing yeah just exactly like the
cannon except without the bottom slide
part just the top part and perfectly
square you know what Chris I I'm
imagining it and all I can think is
you're gonna want a strap so you could
put a new wrist uh it would probably be
a little bit too big but if it was like
if it was under 3 inches I would
probably consider doing exactly that
like if it was about what's the size of
a palm pixi piss away which i think was
what 2.8 inches or something like that I
would definitely put that on my wrist
motorola flipout hopeless loser just
brought it up in the chat can't forget
about the skirt flip out yes that is
that is always going to save rim that
form factor okay I'm with you Chris like
if you do a really good world design
square for in fact the phone that could
definitely be a total differentiator and
like something that people see in like
yeah that's a blackberry and room has
always had that Buddhist blackberry
because of the iconic keyboard design so
why not gonna see a new form fact that
nobody else uses yeah oh I'm sorry I'm
just looking at a photo of the motorola
flipout and I'm just the happiest person
ever um
the other funny thing is that CEO
thorsten heins there's a quote from
Josh's piece sales of the devices in the
US took a major hit as carriers
transition to 4g phones according to the
executive carrier version to marketing
3g devices was the main culprit for the
company's dipping numbers barely know
man bleep denial kappa yes well if I oh
that's exactly it's indicative of a
worldview that died like three or four
years ago where whatever the carrier
decides to put in the front window is
what sells right well not notice that I
mean you have to admit if you're him you
have to admit but your device you just
aren't competitive any more like who
does he think he's fooling look at look
at you share price like as a CEO I get
it you want to be communicating to
consumers business other businesses
partners and investors but everybody
sees through this like there isn't even
the hint of clothes on the Emperor at
this stage so just given us this BS
about your verizon doesn't want to
promote free g phones yes that's true
but that's just like a tiny tiny aspect
of why people aren't buying blackberrys
anymore like that's what it was also one
market you go on blackberry so UK is
this better services I really ER in the
show we were saying we hope that Windows
Phone 8 becomes a viable contender in
the smartphone market place apparently
blackberry 10 is like out for beta
testing right now beta testing and you
know we've got a there's a blackberry
jam which is our developer event coming
up in late-september and you know we're
getting close to 2013 right and that
thing is gonna launch you guys do you
even are you rooting for it at all do
you care I mean I've been like the
secret blackberry 10 a fanboy here which
is a really weird place to be gallon
yeah I know uh if there's some
interesting ideas in the OS well I
really want to see the final loss to see
if it coheres and make sense if it is
like oh yeah this is a genuinely new way
to interact with the phone and I don't
know if they're going to be able to pull
it off but if they do I would like to
see them you know clawback enough market
share to survive and continue to provide
competition oh I well I think everybody
wants to see it right i mean like it's
it's the same sort of morbid curiosity
that people had toward palm leading up
to the web of the initial webos
announcement they're like okay these
guys have been in the labs for a long
time now let's see what they have
cooking um but I whether that translates
to sales I mean that's a really really
big stretch for me because Microsoft
still has not been able to parlay its
initial success with Windows Mobile into
any sort of meaningful market share for
windows phone the most recent numbers
from the the major research firms
indicate that maybe they've kind of
gotten past that that bounce but I don't
know if it's a dead cat bounce or if
it's a genuine uptick in in market share
that remains to be seen but lately to
suggest that that Britain is going to be
able to show something really cool and
then immediately turn that into market
share I think it's just a bridge too far
they it still comes down to these
blackberry jam events getting major not
just not just like individual like
really cool indie developers on board
they need to get all the big names on
board and they need to have a
concentrated push and that is I mean
that is one very small part of the
puzzle but it is a critical part without
that their timely matter what's a dead
cat bounce Adele really balance is a
dead cat bounces and artificial bounce
it's it's most commonly associated with
a stock price if a if a stock price
falls dramatically because something bad
has happened to a company so there's
sometimes an artificial bounce and the
stock price because investors think that
there's suddenly a really good deal on
that stock but it turns out to be a
false bounce and that it immediately
crashes again yeah so it's like the
stock hits bottom and then there's a
short uptick which is just an
aftereffect of and hitting bottom and I
think we can still sitting in that as
even is just freakishly morbid yeah I
think we can all agree that dead cat
bounce is a great code name for a square
screen blackberry just I totally agree
or maybe dead cat and then the testing
of it in the labs won't they're doing
the like the ruggedness testing they
call that the dead cat bounce because
they're actually throwing the dead cat
wow this is this conversation is getting
weird really fast and and dark um do you
guys want to talk about apple vs samsung
we already mentioned the galaxy nexus
band as we are recording right now the
the closing arguments from Apple are
getting a live blog on the site you know
there's we mentioned this last week
there's a whole other verge cast special
edition you can listen to where they
talk about the issues of the case and I
mean what blows my mind is that this is
going like they're letting the jury
decide this like they didn't they the
CEOs met I want to say two nights ago
yeah two nights ago and they didn't come
to a resolution and so like they're
they're letting the jury go and decide
this thing we'll see if they settle
before the jury comes back but like it's
crazy right that it's yeah it is it is
what it is is a multi-billion dollar
game of chicken I think that bread both
sides are so entrenched in their beliefs
at this point and feel so strongly about
what's happening here but they're really
letting that cloud their judgment and I
mean Neil I just follow Neal I on
twitter if you i'm sure everyone who's
listening to this show does but if you
don't please follow him follow me he's
at reckless and he has been providing
some very very concise and important
insight into what's happening in the
courtroom right now um but yeah he's as
shocked as anybody that this is actually
going to the jury right now and also one
of the amazing things to mention is the
judge koh who's in charge of the entire
proceeding / carnival she's making
people actually stand up in the
courtroom to make sure we still alive
that's in the actual
that we go out of the courtroom so I I
just honestly I envy Brian for Matty
forgetting to attend these things in
person because it really is going to be
one of those once-in-a-lifetime surreal
experiences that we're gonna miss our
honestly like the fact that there's no
live stream for this event is breaking
my heart a tragic my favorite Lucy Coe
moment so they each site only had twenty
five hours to present their case and so
they were both trying to get in as many
witnesses before the 25 hours uh got up
as possible and so she apple says we
want to get in like these you know 20
witnesses in the next hour or whatever
it was and co says um unless you're
smoking crack you know these witnesses
aren't going to get called that the
Apple attorney had to be like first Your
Honor I am NOT smoking crack I can do
that like that's amazing like huge
amount of money on the line the the
future of apples patents and Samsung's
patents and the design for both of these
companies on the line and we're talking
about smoking crack it's it's awesome I
i have to say both co and and posner in
the motorola case that shown a lot more
personality and I ever was expected out
of like you know you think of these
kinds of trials or really you know the
court system in general is being this
very stuffy institution and in many ways
it is but there are these moments of
just complete humanity uh bubbling up
out of these cases that you you really
don't expect um do we okay I guess we
should talk about google ad in gift
cards to and let's talk about what we
want to talk about I just freaking talk
about something let's talk about a guy I
don't care just get into it man no wait
wait wait wait wait I wait and I do want
to talk about that the girls will do it
I do too so these I don't understand
what it part of my french but I don't
understand what big whoop is about these
cards
I mean can someone please explain to me
why anyone cares what may be nearly as I
can explain because Google thinks that
they're gonna they're going to compete
with iTunes and you can't use itunes
unless you can buy gift cards at walmart
or 7-eleven they think that people are
going to be putting these gift cards in
you know Christmas cards and instead of
getting an iTunes gift card you'll get a
google gift card and it's going to be a
real genuine content store that people
want to go and buy movies and TV shows
from I think that they've got a full
ecosystem that will you know i can buy a
TV show and watch it on my google TV and
watch out of my Nexus 7 and watch it on
my android phone and like like they've
got all the pieces of having a content
ecosystem except for the content
ecosystem like it's like it's all there
for Google Play they need more content
in there but nobody nobody had thinks of
it that way right google play store
buying android apps and but do people
really think of like i'm gonna buy five
seasons worth of shows on google play
and just have them round the way that
people used to do and maybe I guess
still do on iTunes when it's not
available to stream on netflix like it
it's just so they're there mmm yeah so
obviously the queue in in theory what
the queue was trying to do would be very
important to that strategy right but
unfortunately the queue was executed so
dramatically poorly that yet actually
plays no role whatsoever especially now
that it's on indefinite old so well
there was a stationary failures all over
the place I mean we had Eric Schmidt
saying that Google TV was gonna be
embedded in every smart TV by now right
and that didn't happen yeah we've got
google TV boxes that are completely
underwhelming then the Nexus 7 is far
and away the best success story they
have in terms of thinking about google
play as a content ecosystem but even
then i mean as great as we all think the
Nexus 7 is it's it's certainly not
enough to to carry that on its shoulders
so it's it Google Play to me you know
it's great for getting apps but it
doesn't it feels like it's a checkbox
more than it is a compelling content
feature just if only because there
so far behind itunes in terms of
mindshare and so it's great that they're
doing she's no get it out or shelves I'm
sorry talks over you but it's a checkbox
for now but then maybe again cuckoo is
laying the foundation to evolve and
finely fashioned it into a career
competitor no I mean gift cards then uh
news in the sense that yeah Wow
fascinating something I really need to
know but then you in the fact that they
exist now and and they're just one of
those formalities like I say checkbox
stuff that you just need to have to
spread your distribution and all of
these things I don't have a confession
to make here actually when Chris started
talking about the queue I i heard that
as q as in qu e ue the actual word as
opposed to the Nexus Q and for a moment
I just completely forgot about the next
accuse existence so you were never be
observations to make about that now
first of all I really like the name Q
for a streaming device because you know
you can think of it as like the place
where your media q is anywhere is
waiting for you so next is cute that
actually makes sense to me in that kind
of funny way the second of all I Chris
was saying that thing is kind of it was
really exciting is really interesting
when it happened and raised a lot of
eyebrows and then just kind of
disappeared off the map which again I
like you guys the same like Google TV is
just an unfinished something and it has
a potential and instead of Santa just I
also do kind of feel that way about
Google+ in many ways like you see the
potential to take it and just like kick
everybody's ass with it but then Google
just isn't putting the finishing touches
on it like did I don't know the company
lacks polish is that what we what it
needs well what's easy to me too is that
the the Q is
the exact same thing I can remember the
code name but they showed it in
basically a development kit form at the
google i/o prior in 2011 and it evolved
into the key which is basically just a
spherical repackaging of that
development kit that didn't really add
any functionality as far as I could tell
and so they took a year to I guess part
of that was the fact that they had to
build this this America this you know
completely American a supply
manufacturing chain for it that's that
took time I'm sure but in that year they
didn't really seem to add any
functionality or capability to it that
would get people exciting particularly
at three hundred dollars so this is kind
of a very it Laura wrote about this on
the site but back when the key was it
was originally announced but this is
kind of a disappointing first attempt at
at creating an American manufactured
consumer electronics device by major
combo you're right because we I think
that that there's so much talk about
that right now that it would have been
very very encouraging and interesting to
see a wildly successful product at a
price point that made sense that was
manufactured in the US but this just
goes to show i mean it's it's the proof
that you can't do that at a price you
know you're gonna end up with sticker
shock there's no way to get around it
well it's to think it's crazy but the
queue is like the hardware is great and
the price is expensive sure but like
Google the software company like failed
on software right they failed on
execution implementation on the queue
and that's what's so disappointing about
it is that it did it could have been
more and maybe it will be maybe they'll
come back and say we added the
functionality we talked about but like
what's a bummer about the queue is that
there's no earthly reason for them to
not have done more with it from the
software side I want to get back to the
gift cards though because there's
something I totally think is important
to note gift cards on iTunes we're
always super important because they
would allow teenagers with ipod touches
to buy apps and stuff so parents could
buy gift cards or kids could pay pay for
gift cards with cash at a store and then
be able to use that in order to
I stuff on the the virtual iTunes Store
and it's actually kind of insane that
that hasn't happened on Android which
theoretically since there's so many
cheaper Android devices out there you'd
think a lot of teenagers who don't have
full access to credit cards would want
some kind of you know gift card solution
there so I'm not saying that it's going
to stop piracy because obviously it
won't but it could be that you know it
at least fills that checkbox that if you
think about it was actually kind of
crazy that wasn't wasn't there before
yeah yeah no it's very it's very good
point that you make it essentially like
you can now buy prepaid credit for
Google Play Store which couldn't do
before you need a credit card but
actually on the point about making
software and Google software failings
again I totally agree with you tita that
reminds me of Adobe again and how
sometimes you can see a company doing
something so well like one product so
well and then just thinking up the joint
with multiple other products and you
know with Dobie 3d of this Photoshop
excels other products like Lightroom are
also strong but then you have flash and
then you have Premiere Pro which some
people love other people like me find
just completely overbearing and I feel I
mean with Google my example would be
chrome which I still feels the best the
browser hands down have you spent quite
a bit of time testing Safari 6 which i
think is very strong but Google is just
better in small and the subtle things
problem that is so I think as much as I
was just saying that Google has might
have a systemic problem of never
finishing up things clearly and properly
maybe maybe I'm wrong and maybe it's
wrong to consider these companies just
because are so big nowadays it is wrong
to consider them as one unified company
because the guys who make chrome the
browser they're like one group of one
team and the guys who make the Nexus Q
software the guys we make the Google TV
software
there how are the team probably
anonymous and never to be mentioned
again and I think it we might be fairer
to products into pieces of software if
we just analyze them on their own
strengths and just kind of stopped
talking about the overarching companies
anymore because it's so massive that
it's no it's not like Instagram makes
product number 20 so it's a lot of small
company like Sparrow before I got taken
over by Google now is just to do the
Department espera was going to do an RSS
reader for example then you can say it's
these guys doing that can we say that
with Apple Google or Microsoft or any of
these you know massive names that we
keep talking about but no see here's the
thing like these companies are selling
themselves on the strength of the
ecosystem that you could buy into and
that this applies perfectly to Google
Play right microsoft has got its
ecosystem with the xbox and that Windows
talking the xbox better and that smart
glasses coming a blah blah blah you know
Apple has gotten its Apple TV talking
buy airtime to the computer and the
iPads all those things are talking to
each other now with iCloud so you know
if these companies are going to you know
market themselves on the strength of
their ecosystem and interoperability
between the devices made by all these
disparate different divisions then I
think it's fair to judge them on that
and it's fair to say you know you're a
giant company and yes it's a small team
that built this particular product but
it's your responsibility as the giant
company to make sure that this team has
the resources and needs to make
something awesome well I wanted to leave
Josh from on that basis but do you think
about this both of roses promise this is
timber fifth is the main event I can
prejudge them right now and say no
you're wrong yeah but what I'm saying is
that that doesn't really help anybody
understands Motorola and what
septemberfest is going to hope for that
company you know so as a responsible
journalist which we sometimes try to
pretend that we are I don't think we're
being constructive in taking the premise
of ecosystem and I'm running with it the
way the
these companies that press departments
are doing because I don't really think
they have these ecosystems like they
don't have the ecosystem within their
organizations like most Lee's company
stuff its wine HP's takeover of palm
such freaking disaster because
everything is insular and siloed and it
takes you know HP probably has well
middle management people that has
cleaners in surfaces and this is this is
the thing that bothers me i mean i could
tell you this i was speaking to somebody
working at nokia a few years back
probably won't mind me mentioning this
because it was fused back in no case
surely fixed everything up since then
but he told me that what you have is
separate to use working on one aspect of
software so what one team is working on
this part of the UI and the TV's working
on radios and set a low signal and all
that stuff and then in the final month
or two before they decide to launch an
announcer device they all come together
and I have a big integration 80 and to
me that's the crazy thing like if you
don't as a company have that meeting to
start with and then have that
consistently going on how things fit
together then you can't sell us this
ecosystem prominent what would you
google or apple anybody know and I think
that with the exception of Apple the and
I create Microsoft especially I think
with ya I think matter so much when you
getting in thanks guy yeah yeah but
Google's just out there yet especially
when combined you guys are arguing that
Microsoft is really good at presenting a
unified ecosystem strategy I i said no i
think what other has getting one now
would you which is a chance for you
because yeah i mean you can really see
it with the metro style / modern design
style / whatever microsomes gotta call
it and the way that they're trying to
roll it out across their devices points
to a strategy I'm not saying Microsoft
is greater communicating that know right
i mean Microsoft is legendary for having
these internal boring
factions that all have different
priorities and different things that
they're trying to get done and I think
that that is a you know with the
exception of Apple like you said dieter
because of their you know the nature
that the way that organization is always
operated with with the exception of
Apple most large companies suffer from
that problem to some degree particularly
at a place like Google that is really
comprised of dozens and dozens of
acquisitions over the years right
Android was an acquisition and I think
that some of that you know culture clash
continues you know it perpetuates and I
continue to believe to this day I've
never been able to get anybody to
confirm or even hint to me that this is
in fact the case but I strongly believe
that there is a lot of distrust and
dislike between Google's Android and
chrome teams over the you know the
ongoing debate between Chrome OS vs vs
android and how those two platforms
match the fact that they seemingly don't
there's like a you know an entire
category devices where it is unclear
which direction Google is trying to go
and I would guess that inside the
company both of those divisions are
trying to argue that they are the best
platform to control this particular
class of devices but in that flag get
settled already no I don't think so I
mean I knew a new bunch of Chromebooks
just came out right oh yeah and
everybody's froth Chris you Louie and
Adrian and I'll team and two other
people yes I can't leave my Chromebook
look I'm just saying they they uh you
know Google internally put a lot of work
into a brand new UI for Chrome OS so
they are clearly not giving up on it
last we heard they're deploying
Chromebooks internally as like you know
Google devices or uh for staff so it's
not going anywhere I so I just I just
think that that kind of mentality where
you have all these different divisions
that are kind of you know sent off to go
in their own directions and sometimes
those directions to overlap a little bit
that's where you start to run into
that that politicking that kind of uh is
is opposed to what it is that the
company as a whole is trying to do and
and that's that's the mentality that
they constantly need to be fighting I
have no way to wrap that up and I lever
conclusion other than they need to get
their act together and do it yes yes
they do well I mean I'm okay I do want
to say it like i like the philosophy
behind Chrome OS a little bit better
than I like the philosophy behind
Android but in terms of like
implementation Android kicks it up and
down the street right and the same is
applied to everything that sort of tried
to be based on the web and be a big
consumer success other than you know the
web and web coasters right so i will see
i would argue i would argue that the
aura UI which is I think that's what
they're calling the new uh i just rode a
yeah i mean the the aura UI is excellent
but the reason why it's excellent is
because they've abandoned their their
attempt to make the device completely
browser centric there is now a UI to
that exists outside of the browser so
it's kind of like it's it's a victory
but it's also a loss well it's it's a UI
that exists outside the browser but it's
still like you know it lives and
breathes with web and web apps right
right it doesn't look like a you know a
browser but it's still a web device and
I mean I I prefer that openness to
Android's philosophy I guess but you
know nevertheless the bottom line is you
know what plays games what gets work
done for you and the open web isn't
there yet as a platform so yeah I'm
night knowing I'm Arab up Oh Donna just
before we do Jennifer with you I would
like to just do a little update on my
razr maxx adventure here in the UK oh
yeah because I mentioned on the last
show that I had turned it on as a show
started and I wanted to see how long it
would last the first time actually
was really disappointing because I
unplugged it from the charger in the
evening on the Tuesday and then it
needed to recharge by the evening on the
Wednesday which was weird to me because
it has this mass mass battery and it was
just in standby whatever happened
between that first charge in the second
was magical because from Wednesday night
with standby little bit of camera use
just regular phone use it lasts until
Monday night which were any school
smartphone is epic so it's saying but
like that's it i'm so glad i'm driving
android out of first boot after like a
reset it it needs to like settle in and
this is a really common topic you know
since i've been flashing roms on my one
acts people i like let it let the ROM
settle in for a day or two before you
start judging the battery life it seems
like most of these phones get better
battery life after the OS has sort of
gotten into a groove and I have no idea
if that actually is reflected by what's
happening behind the scenes you know
with what the software is doing but it
I've seen like that advice repeated over
and over and maybe it's just to make
people go away but I don't like mad as
my knees knees yeah it sounds like wine
drinking advice what you want to do is
you want to open it up and then just let
it settle down let it really so down
overnight the next night you just keep
it in high school area if you haven't
got one just like move to the software
on stay they have them in abundance and
yeah then you then you let it down and
it's beautiful now with them I was gonna
say thumbs up for the battery life which
is excellent but thumbs down for multi
role is really horrible rollouts of the
android 4.0 update because this phone up
girl still has gingerbread and first of
all the droid razr maxx and droid razr
in the united states got ice cream
sandwich first before the european
version why that needed to happen I
don't know but fine okay so there's a
late for the european version then the
european version camps and all you can
actually find on the web out is is
happening it's OTA
you can get yours and I haven't had mine
and it's been like a month since they
announced it during the European rollout
it's not acceptable treated like
seriously par for the course I mean but
that's not getting fixed and it's not
getting fixed with jelly bean how long
has that been announced and you know
maybe we'll see it on the galaxy s3 soon
that will be impressive if that actually
happens but I I like I've given up even
being angry about android OS updates
because I like I just my expectations
I've just been beaten down into the
ground and so I just I just assume it's
going to be terrible yeah I do you hear
what else this is devon fifth event
whatever comes out of it is gonna be
running ice cream sandwich of course and
got not not the nokia vent not the nokia
bet he's through yes yes great
correction Chris great correction and I
know I know it seems like really spoiled
and weird for me to be complaining oh
it's only running ice cream sandwich but
the point is the same point we've been
drumming on with gingerbread is not
running the latest version of the
operating system and if it's not why the
hell are you launching it I saw your
phone app so it software out give me the
latest at the time that i can buy it
because that's what I pulled us so
Microsoft okay you're gonna do in
September fifth and if all of these you
know android oems just keep finding
acceptable to just update their phones
later and as i say do it in an
inconsistent manner that you know gets
into some people doesn't get it to other
people it's gonna piss me off and that's
a bad thing because I'm one of the
people and people speak with their
wallets so let's say on that inspiring
note thank you very much for watching
