out hi guys we're here we're like I
don't know how to balance I'm balanced
gosh I'm trying to blackberry stuff
we're here alive the new blackberry
accompany it was called rim and is now
renamed itself to blackberry just had
its launch event for blackberry 10 the
platform two phones the z10 and the q10
and we're just going to emotionally
react that news can I just say by the
way this one I didn't realize how
confusing this whole new name thing is
gonna be socially you've just described
it just now like so let's go through the
Hansons because there's a lot to talk
about with a name change true so Rim the
company that you may know is RAM
Research In Motion held there held their
event today and just basically a lot of
announcements and the new platform which
we'd had known about blackberry 10
they've been talking about it for a
while the two new phones which have been
pretty thoroughly leaked but we have
review up we have seen the phone out in
extreme detail they weren't through some
demos ain't as a bunch of apps that are
going to support me a platform but
arguably the biggest news is that they
are changing the name of the company
from rim to blackberry and thorsten
heins of CEO said that's what customers
know us as that's what people call us
where they're they're cashing in on sort
of the blackberry brand cachet that they
have and it is in fact very confusing I
mean I want to get it kind of makes
sense right because rim is blackberry
and blackberry is rim we've always kind
of associated the two and like I
couldn't name a thing for you that RIM
does that isn't blackberry they might
have had other stuff I don't know but
the he's writing that we associated
those two things with each other but now
it's like the is the phone call the
blackberry it's really clear blackberry
z10 so it's literally to the blackberry
blackberry z10 yeah I thought that easy
that's insane I because nobody calls you
know their iphone their Apple like I
love call it making calls my Apple sure
um but it's a good move for them I think
it's they're trying to reboot their
company right I think it's a rebirth for
them in a lot of ways and so I think
it's a good move to say I mean people
are going to say black bear
a new phones today whether or not Oh
told us the name or not so I think it
makes sense for them I think they're
focused on the platform of the phones in
the phones themselves they're better
than I expected right I think we're
going to look at joshs z10 review a
little bit later but his overall
takeaways they've made a really strong
first step into rebooting their platform
and that it's not I think there's not a
killer app like to push you away from an
android or iphone if you have unwrapped
e but there there's the potential for
that in the future right I mean that's
put the you know the problem and we have
lots more to say about this i guess but
now it's like everybody else made this
first step five years ago yes so now the
question is like can they make enough of
these steps quickly enough then they'll
catch up and like they seem to be i was
actually kind of impressed with this
event we're gonna talk to a couple of
folks who were there and i'm curious
kind of what the mood was but they
seemed like they answered all the
questions they had they said a lot of
the right things they came out they were
like look we need apps and they showed
apps they really i mean ii good hardware
and they had good hardware like they
seem to be on the right track and
they're saying the right things and
doing the right things but the question
is gonna be like they're so far behind
can they do they have a chance of
catching up is like have we just moved
past what there's a lot to say there and
I think there's a lot of questions about
whether they can effectively their
competition is Microsoft right for my
third place platform I think there's a
lot to unpack there but speaking of
people who are there vlad savov is
sitting in London he's I believe he has
eaten in hand flat are you here
greetings can you guys hear and see me
yes we can do both of those things show
us this phone man I love you but I want
to see the phone ok so here it is so
what do you think what's your what's
your situation mentally oh sure I food
takeaway is that it actually reminds me
of the iphone locks and I'm just gonna
try and hold to a side-by-side wow they
really just hang out and I mean honestly
is kind of odd you can call it an iphone
rip off because this kind of design
leaked over a year ago but it's a nice
design like I'm a fan of it it's a 4.3
inch screen which I've been talking
about
virgin mobile show for ages is pretty
much the sweet spot as far as I'm
concerned besides and and it's really
the only true flagship phone that is
anywhere near the iphones four-inch
screen screen size in terms of competing
with it he also has a micro SD card slot
which there was a kind of a unique
feature respects your home there's
replacement battery and actually funny
thing about here in the UK everyone has
been quite excited about this baby
there's been this latent excitements
about Grimm I've just been waiting for
them to do something you yeah for years
and years and it just kind of starting
to bubble up now so what was the mood on
them in the room when you were at the
live event there what was the mood that
you were kind of sensing from everybody
SD and absence were happening yeah well
the funny thing is I think someone put
it pretty well I think a lot of us were
just kind of stunned into silence
because of the presentation so but the
mood of the people here the mood the
other UK press really has been one of
anticipation it's a sort of an innocent
anticipation like will be snow jaded and
so you know cynical about the latest
gold you know the latest Android phone
you just fix up and gather yada yada
this is really new I've ever eaten is
pretty new like our the first time i
picked up this phone i was like where's
a hung home button and a funny thing is
you struggle with it for a while but
then you realize that the home button is
essentially a swipe from the bottom up
and it works pretty well it's be
seamless and rumors done a lot of new
things which is worth saying you don't
feel so jaded as previously because
their new things for us to explore yeah
it's a normal platform that's so I'm
actually curious about what you just
said about their the gestures um one of
the one of the things that seems to me
is that this phone would be really hard
to figure out how to use like if
somebody just hands it to you like
there's no home button there's nothing
that's like immediately obvious what
you're supposed to do so what you've
spent a few minutes with it now what was
that like look that's what I'm saying
you kind of have to
the first thing you grasp is that
swiping it from the edges does things so
if you swipe in from the top you get the
notifications area well no you don't you
get settings and quick toggles then you
get notifications over and left on the
hub then you go disposes asking menus
and likely lock it in mind some respects
and then eventually you get the grasp of
this swipe up on the bottom to leave an
applica back to the home screen so no I
don't think it's really intuitive to be
fair but you also have a nice lock
screen you're trying to bring up now so
you get a whole bunch of information in
notifications of your lock screen and
you unlock it with this really nice
fading animation action and then there's
if you hold down the camera gotta go
strange little animation each into the
camera the pretty much does everything
that a bottom user interfaces can you
box it does well can you walk us through
the UI a little bit just hold it up and
show us from the gestures in action yeah
okay so the cameras up right now maybe
probably take photo Oh blood sample take
a good I wasn't letting my face average
everyone yes yes and as a result it's my
face okay so I'm gonna try and leave
this by swiping up from the bottom and
I've succeeded and this was the most
asking menu there's all your apps you
got three hung three home screens of
apps which does the many you got the hub
let's probations yeah the other and
there's a lot of stuff which I'm yet to
understand like you got this stuff
popping up on the right but I can't
access it so I'm gonna need suspense of
time and work on this the multi-tasking
menu is kind of like the iphones in so
far is it sucked because you have to
shut down every single a petite fille
yeah and it's a pain and there's no
clothes oh one other thing I wanted to
mention here is brim is coming out with
a really strong line-up of apps you know
7000 apps and they had this in to have
all the big ones I was really excited to
find a youtuber
kick into it I go into it and it turns
out it's m.youtube.com me oh that's a
rather yeah so strung up line up but
then room is doing the same thing at
Microsoft's kind of do with windows for
today I will send you to the bar bar
YouTube yeah which sucks but the final
thing I want to also say is that the UK
is getting this phone blackberry z10
tomorrow in white and black which is
great I've always said if firm wants to
make a splash nice to George immediately
it's not work for the US because you
guys going to get it all the way March
but at least UK and I think Canada is
getting at pretty soon as well so a
couple of big markets are going to get
this phone nice and early but the final
thing to say is there's no q10 around
here there are no cute n this is a
keyboard version really I put them to go
off and they haven't actually announced
availability anywhere for the q10 it's
kind of a mix of advice of others hmm so
do you think this is you said there's
some you know pent-up excitement and
anticipation do you think this thing's
actually gonna do well and sell well in
the UK I think it will I think you were
I mean brim hasn't done anything you so
long I can say this just pent up demand
this pent-up it's kind of like with
Nokia's loyalty like people's loyalties
run deep they grow up with their phone
you spend three or four years with one
phone from one company you still wanna
you might still have fond feelings for
that company I don't think rim is that
company for a little former teenagers
might be my age at this point or
whatever so I think it will do well
alright but then a lot of people have
also said cam rooms to stay in that
momentum after the first few months
after the initial assignment and I might
be the real question well we'll see
alright well thank you so much wide for
for calling us straight from the event I
know you're super excited you're getting
one right there giving I am The Giving
is yeah everyone there so go collect
your dear ill-gotten property and you
know I realize not jealous at all just
just you just swipe away buddy you just
do what I
you need to do i remove it i will thanks
lad hey do something that's actually a
really important point the flag made
which is there is an initial burst of
excitement I think some people will buy
the phone but I think there was that
initial burst of excitement for for
windows phone as well right I mean I I
think there was always an initial burst
of excitement that you get from a new
platform and especially rim did like an
incredible job of these kind of Apple II
controlled leaks of the stuff coming up
so late we basically knew all of this
stuff coming into today but we had kind
of Inklings of the software and we
they'd shown off bits and pieces of even
some of the hardware and so if they've
been building something I mean they
announced it in what may I think last
May so it's we're pushing nine months
since they first started talking about
blackberry 10 and they did a great job
of really building the anticipation as
we got closer to the date but now I I
agree it's like now what yeah okay well
you know I think they're now what for
them is they've been tracking it at the
event they made a big deal we've been
traveling the world to collect app
developers right we've been on Alicia
Keys has been traveled we should keys
personally for playing the piano and
every continent to get app developers
she will come to your home and play the
piano so this is the key and i think
that the you know with Vlad was saying
with the YouTube app being being just a
wrapper for the mobile site there are a
lot of apps that are very clearly lifted
off the iOS version and then there are a
lot of apps that are just android apps
and that you know when I was playing
with the review unit it's the same thing
I noticed which was a josh pointing out
to me which was once the blackberry app
world has android abstinent right the
phone supports Android you can run
android race and it's not like it's it's
not ported apps it's like it's literally
running and actually they put android
there's a layer of android somewhere my
system and but it's not the native UI
it's not the native right it's android
2.3 which is like the old android so you
can get a lot of these apps they're
there in the system but there are a lot
of inconsistent UI elements especially
as you run either the rapper's into the
web apps for the android apps that are
going to make up i think a bulk of the
supported apps to begin with at least
until the platform at least until rim
can convince people to build
apps because the platform strengths are
there right and to me that seems like
that seems like a huge mistake on
blackberrys part i'm gonna call them rim
for forever and no one can stop me and
that's fine but so i think they you know
70,000 is a big number they said the
number a bunch of times and they were
like it's the most anyone's ever had it
launched and they were really excited
about that and like that's that's good
and i'm glad they have lots of apps but
I feel like most people are gonna go in
and download you know YouTube and it's
gonna be a terrible experience because
that's just a wrapper for the mobile app
and not a very good one or they're gonna
download an android app and be like why
does this look completely different what
and see I don't think they're gonna be
like why does this look completely
different I think the more I think it's
funny you know actually I phone they all
look different apps on Android they all
look different but it's like the
settings menu settings are they they're
gonna work differently right and right I
think josh is showing me the text
selection just selecting text ya in a
native a crab versus the android 2.3
text selector in one of the port of
android apps is their wildly different
experiences and you know there's just
that's that's just some inconsistency
but it's i disagree with you i think
putting the android apps on there was a
good idea if why because it literally
what they said when they announced it
we're gonna get the tonnage of apps like
they can launch with a bunch of apps
yeah they can say to people like look
there's a facebook app look there's a
twitter app like all this stuff I'll you
know they're launching all the carriers
right in the u.s. there they're going to
be there I think they can say to app
developers especially Android app
developers this is a minimum lot of
effort to get on to a whole new platform
but if you hit this first and we're
success you're going to come along for
the ride where's I think Microsoft
Windows Phone has to say it's a big
effort to port your app I mean it's a
bigger effort than like user just an
Android code and like make the tweaks
right and you know if we're a success so
come along for the ride but you've got
to invest all this stuff so I think they
have a better story for developers the
outset but the right story has to be
making native BB time at right and I
haven't as far as i can tell haven't
really made that case to anyone you know
and they you know to their credit they
have a bunch of pretty big-name apps i
didn't expect to see our do i didn't
expect to see the new york times they
have a bunch of you know big-name games
where's my water than everybody knows
but it's like
me and I was talking to a couple folks
about this the other day the the
question is not like can you get our do
like our do ultimately is going to build
for everybody because it behooves REO to
be everywhere but then it's the it's the
one dude who's like oh I have a pretty
good idea i'll build a game and like
that's what makes iOS so try because
being vine exactly and there are these
apps you just can't see any porn vines
and that that's really doesn't have to
tell you about that yeah well yeah
they've got their announcing their noun
singh everything here right they've got
a music service in the video service and
like their partnerships and right
they're trying to be the holistic device
OS service company that you kind of have
to be right that even if you look at
Samsung the Samsung is trying to turn
into right right and that's a lot of
stuff to take on for a company that
traditionally made an enterprise server
and a handset that got email right so
they've got to grow into this thing and
you know one of the things I thought was
interesting at the event was during the
Q&amp;amp;A they were asked are you what are you
doing with the PlayBook in tablets and
they said well update the PlayBook to
blackberry 10 but we have no further
plans to announce her tablets at this
time and even said like it's it's hard
to figure out the mix between cost and
profit or something that and it
basically was this kind of depressing
but yeah it's kind of like we just don't
know how to make money some title right
on the market isn't validated but the
market for tablet will be validated for
them if they figure out all these other
pieces that make your phone game right
so if they have a music service of
people like if they have the apps people
like people will say well I want to take
this experience onto a tablet there just
aren't ya make the phone right first but
then I mean that comes back to the
bigger question I guess which is like
this is this is ketchup and and they did
like they caught up a lot right in in
one day they caught him Allah uh they
did it all between in the last 24 hours
ya know but like they have you know they
have a legitimate like Google Play and
iTunes competitor now um I mean I
haven't spent enough time with it to
know if it has everything but it has
enough that you can download movies and
music and TV shows and they have you
know enough of an app store that they
can say yeah you can listen to music and
read news and all this stuff but why
that versus anybody else I mean it seems
to me that there there only advantage
is that people know the word blackberry
and that's where the renaming part
becomes really interesting to me because
it's like they're just gonna shove the
word blackberry in your face as much as
possible to remind you that like a Super
Bowl ad campaign coming right and like I
liked I loved my blackberry like the I
had one years ago now and loved it and
got rid of it because it couldn't do any
of the things i wound up needing to do
but it like had a really good keyboard
and got my email uh I don't just rely on
that it seems like you know I don't know
what else they have other than like
relative competitiveness pants is BBM
really stole thing I don't know but it's
there I will say it's awesome now so it
has the it has BBM BBM voice and bbm
video right which is and they're doing
the video chat with the screen sharing
the phones which is just totally always
wanted to do like I for whatever reason
I've always been like I just want you to
look at why I've never in my life wanted
to do that really but like but we were I
was sitting in a meeting with Josh and
he said the same thing he was like I
always wanted to do this yeah absolutely
why do you work so we keep talking about
Josh in this review so I should just run
the review video so we're gonna run the
whole thing it's like seven minutes long
Yan song but here's it's a complete
overview blackberry 10 it's our review
so check that hey this is josh with the
verge and we were taking a look at the
blackberry z10 the first-ever blackberry
10 device the phone might look a little
bit familiar because it shares a lot
with the iphone 5 in terms of design
language though the z10 is a bit larger
it's got a four point two inch display
it feels good in your hand the back is
made from a soft touch kind of rubbery
dimpled material which is really nice to
hold as I said it's got a four point two
inch display and the resolution is 1280
by 768 and it looks quite nice inside
there's a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
processor 2 gigs of ram and 16 gigabytes
of on-board storage though that is
expandable through the use of a microSD
card the z10 has Wi-Fi GPS and all of
the other sensors that you would expect
in a modern smartphone it also has two
cameras an eight megapixel shooter on
the back and a 2 megapixel camera on the
front of the device the cameras on the
phone are decent but the software is
interesting rim is touting a function
called time shift which allows you to
snap
picture kind of in burst mode and then
select through the different frames of
the photo that was taken to find the
perfect moment overall the phone is
nicely designed and I liked using it I
was a little disappointed with the
battery life however there were a few
days during testing when I took it off
the charger around 9am and ended up with
a dead phone at about 6 or 7 p.m. but
the story here is not really about the
z10 it's about blackberry 10 the new
operating system from rim it has nothing
to do with blackberry 7 or any previous
versions though there are some similar
design traits exhibited the basic
concept of the blackberry 10 interfaces
that there are really four states you
can be in there's in an application
that's pretty straightforward on your
home screen which does double duty as
your multitasker in your app drawer
where you can open up a nap just like on
any other device or in blackberry hub
which encompasses all of your messages
that you get on the phone and that could
be email mms SMS twitter facebook etc
you get into those various states with a
couple of gestures the main gesture on
the phone is to swipe up from the bottom
of the display which unlocks it and
takes you to your home screen if you're
inside an app you can swipe up you'll go
out to your home screen the other main
gesture that you use is kind of a
continuation of the home screen gesture
you swipe up and then continue holding
and swipe to the right which gives you a
view of what notifications have come in
and eventually if you swipe all the way
over you get into your unified inbox
your home screen is limited only to
eight items and those items can only be
arranged by what you've most recently
opened so if you've got Twitter open it
and that's your ninth app and you open
another one twitter is gone and you've
got to reopen it the second problem with
the concept is that some of those apps
turn into widgets when you minimize them
which is great for instance the weather
widget works really well and updates in
the background right on the home screen
the problem is you can't keep the
weather widget on the home screen so you
have to keep reopening the app every 8
applications you open but the bigger
issue with the OS is the way it handles
notifications so instead of having a
notification bar like Android or iOS
you're at
just looking at the very message that
you were notified about the biggest
problem notifications is that when you
go into your hub and you check a message
it saves that state which means that
when you get another notification and
you go to check that notification you
actually end up in the notification you
were checking before that what happens
is you've got to start backtracking into
your hub to figure out where that
message actually is located in terms of
general speed and capability i would put
blackberry 10 on par with android or iOS
it doesn't seem to be lacking any or
many of the features that those
operating systems have it's got a
different idea about how you should
navigate it but the question is whether
or not it's a better idea and in my
opinion it's not on the app front rim is
done a pretty good job with its first
party offerings the browser is very good
and certainly as capable as any other
modern mobile browser that's out there
the email experience which rim of course
has been known for historically is good
even with my gmail accounts but I would
not say great multiple message
management proved to be a little bit
tricky in particular you have to long
press on a message then select another
item from a popover menu and then start
selecting your messages and then tap on
the trash to get rid of those messages
it seems like there could be a much
quicker way to get at multiple message
management one of the great things that
rim is done is integrate a lot of
third-party services into its core apps
they've got a nap here which is a note
taking a reminder app called remember
that integrates Evernote so you can sync
your account and folders right into that
application there's also a surprisingly
clever app called story maker which
allows you to combine video clips with
music and a variety of effects and
titles I thought it was pretty fun to
play around with and was impressed at
the typography and the effects used in
the application itself the device comes
pre-installed with a twitter facebook
linkedin and foursquare app in my case
however i thought the way it handles
twitter was a little bit clunky much
like windows phone it will show you a
list of your latest at messages on
twitter but in order to fully read those
messages you have to click into each one
individually and speaking of the twitter
app it's actually kind of bad in the
version that i tested it looks and feels
very much like android or iOS twitter
except that it doesn't auto update in
the background and when you pull to
refresh
it takes you from wherever you were the
last time you check the app to the top
of your timeline rim has improved BBM
for blackberry 10 adding some really
interesting functions like BBM video
calls which worked well most of the time
when I was testing the device and a
novel function which allows you to share
the screen of your phone with somebody
else over BBM video rim claims that
blackberry 10 will launch with about
70,000 third-party apps in its
blackberry world app store and that may
be true but it kind of feels like 69000
of those apps are bad a lot of them are
rehash play book titles and some of the
ones that I tested which are made for
blackberry 10 just didn't really seem up
to snuff it is clear however that making
great apps for blackberry 10 is possible
the USA Today app for instance is very
good as our handful of the games Angry
Birds Star Wars for instance plays as
good if not better than it does on other
platforms and rim says there's a lot
more coming including some fairly
significant app contributions from EA
games as well as gameloft rim is added a
content marketplace to blackberry world
so you can now buy music TV or movies
pretty easily through the same interface
that you get your apps in one spot that
I think rim has executed fairly poorly
in is the inclusion of Android apps in
blackberry world the device is capable
of running Android apps in a runtime
environment which is essentially like
software emulation of Android and the
apps definitely run like they're being
emulated they don't really run that well
and as soon as you're inside an Android
app you're literally inside an Android
environment and just reminder this isn't
this year's Android or last year's
Android this is Android 2.3 it's not
really in addition to the OS and in some
ways kind of detracts from what rim is
doing with blackberry 10 the z10 is
going to be available for 199 dollars on
contract overall the z10 is a fine
device it's even a very good device and
blackberry 10 is a very good mobile
operating system I think it's extremely
capable and I'm excited about what it's
going to develop into the bottom line is
that it's a good phone but it's lacking
a killer app or killer piece of
functionality that's going to sway most
buyer
is from android iOS or Windows Phone
back so that was a review there was a
review video the Josh should I think
last night late last night um yeah so we
gave the phone a seven yeah when I kind
of talked about that score how you guys
got there I mean basically the the story
is that it's it's a good phone yeah
right its it does everything you needed
to do and it does all of those things
well it's you know it's smooth and
intuitive and I I've spent less time
with it than Josh but I was really
impressed with just like the basic
navigation of the phone is really easy
it's great for phone calls yeah which I
guess people still do that from time to
time and it's still a really good email
device that's still that thing
blackberry does as well or better than
anybody well so I disagree so I got a
lot of emails from Josh while he was yet
he had the phone for a while and I got a
lot of emails from him while he had the
phone and I could always tell when a
female when he was sending me an email
from the blackberry z10 because it would
break all of my gmail threading it was
in blue it was formatted with like you
know how like when you have when you get
an email it's a part of a long thread if
he hides it would break all thats would
like his emails were three times longer
than everybody else's so like and this
is something I've noticed with Windows
Phone to which i think is funny that
these two companies are classically
known for messaging and messaging
devices have not figured out like modern
email so like I get a gather of the
email experience while using the
blackberry z10 is great but everyone
will know that you're right you know
that's intense and yeah and they have
Windows Phone 8 is the worst and every
time somebody's using it I get like the
you know the reef forward forward yeah
but on no i mean i think the gmail
experience is sort of bad everywhere but
it is it's the email experience is good
on this actually think they're banking
on you using like your internal exchange
server at work in which case it won't be
as much of an issue right so we've got
some questions here well there's a few
things to talk about without that was
actually one of our questions actually
before we get to questions we should the
other phone they announced today which
we didn't know you're cute is not out
yet the q10 we at the event just got
some got to spend some time with it and
we have a video from that so let's let's
run that before we give gone
oh hey this is rossman with the verge we
are in New York City the blackberry 10
launch event the company today announced
two devices of blackberry z10 the
blackberry q10 with the physical
keyboard let's check out the q10
unfortunately we cannot touch it
interact with it they're being making a
very controlled demo but we can't
actually put our fingers on the keys and
it feels very much like you know the
traditional blackberry keyboard you got
720 x 720 square display we're told that
all the apps will be optimized for the
scream unfortunately can't see those
right now in this tightly controlled mo
thickness and width it actually is
pretty close to the iphone 5 only a
little bit thicker obviously he's also
got a physical keyboard no word on
pricing or details there's little to say
here it's a blackberry with a square
screen and if this keyboard is a
traditional blackberry you've come to
know and love and it's here with the
blackberry 10 first of all I'm never
ever gonna forget just seeing Ross just
stroke so far oh that was a tremendous
hands-on from Ross yeah well I mean
that's the thing so there's a lot of
questions with the q10 right there's a
it has a totally different aspect ratio
of its screen and they've got all these
android apps which theoretically can
handle themselves and different sized
screens it's a part of the erratic
android promise but every android device
i've ever seen with the square screen
has been a disaster yeah but i feel like
if they can pull that stuff off and
especially with the native apps i'm
curious how they'll do it for the
different aspect ratios but if they can
pull that off I feel like the q10 is a
way more interesting fun than the z10 at
least to me really because in in the way
that the z10 is just a good phone
without any particular killer app like
the killer app is the keyboard on the
q10 like that's why people have bought
blackberries for the last seven years
that's the only reason right uh and if
they can do that with this kind of
modern interface and high end or at
least competitive specs and the new apps
and like then it suddenly becomes a
phone that like you're not making
compromises to get this great keyboard
it's actually like a good phone with a
really good keyboard and that becomes
super compelling even met really raises
the question I I think rim disagrees
with you right i think that was that was
the case then so in the UK the z10
launching now tomorrow right in Canada
any place the Queen on her money yeah
the z10 tomorrow not any place just
those two plays I really hope that was
the rule they actually made they're like
if the queen is on the money we love
Canadians they have a lotta trip so the
for the Commonwealth el lunes mr.
unfrozen ya know so the z10 in the UK
and canada tomorrow right and then the
q10 is not even at the UK launches yeah
and they won't they won't let us touch
it like it's yeah I'm here in the States
it's the z10 in March yeah and then the
q10 sometime in April some time
afterwards right and we still don't
really know pricing we don't know
carriers like it's it's still kind of in
network right I'm telling you there's
there see reason so that one rim I think
they want to emphasize they've made a
device compared with the iphone their
device looks like the iphone yeah yeah
there it is so I think they want to
emphasize they've they've taken a step
into what everybody else is considered
to be the future and I think the second
piece is that the carrier's themselves
are not leaping to the q10 they're not
verizon isn't saying to rim oh my god
thank you please focus on the q10 right
because that's what our customers want
verizon is saying our customers want big
touch screens and give us that one first
but verizon has I mean that's nice right
verizon AT&amp;amp;T sprint who have virgin
mobile whoever they they all have a ton
of big phones with big touch screens
like the end that that's too mean why
the q10 could be interesting it's like
if I want if I want a big phone with a
big touchscreen I probably am NOT gonna
buy this you're also like you're part of
this vanishingly small that's why I mean
like you know Wren was putting on a
touchscreen phones with keyboards a year
ago they just anymore cuz nobody was
buying them right and I will say I know
Ross said it's about the size of an
iphone 5 that phone looks enormous q10
looks like a big phone teeny and i think
i think the elephant blackberry is that
the blackberry curve 8900 i thought that
was like this great book the ultimate
refined end of their industrial design
the bolds are great but i think that one
is small and perfect and it's way bigger
than that thing yeah at least as far as
i can tell it seems to be all right
that's like they've got a they've got a
recapture sort of that that feel of
you've got this tiny powerful computer
with a keyboard but it seems they have
selling that to America and the world
again is a bigger challenge then we made
a full touchscreen phone that happens to
have a really good keyboard so we should
talk about that Josh was talking about
it in the in his review actually I
believe mossberg and his review said
it's the best touchscreen keyboard
around Wow I mean that's rim has been
saying that your job is very good
they're like we went out to make the
best and which is sort of hilarious like
I just want somebody big we went out to
make a pretty alright so here keeper
we've made a media as long as you don't
hate it by the one with the real
keyboard it'll be fine ah so you you
used it I've played with it for two
seconds I found it I think there's a
steeper learning curve than you might
expect yeah cuz I found it like very
confusing to use in the two seconds but
josh says that once use it for a while
it gets better what were your thoughts
well so that's really the thing is it it
learns it adapts to you in a number of
different ways so it figures out um like
if you the way I type I always hit be
when I'm trying to hit n and it'll
actually figure that out over time as
you start to correct it and you'll
figure out where you tap your thumb and
essentially make the touch target on the
end bigger so you'll hit the right thing
instead of always pressing the wrong
letter so that you know it but it takes
time to learn how to do that and then
there's the the predictive text where
it'll actually guess what word you're
typing or will even type next hmm and
it'll actually index which I thought was
cool it'll index your send emails and
your messages like as soon as you add an
email account to the phone it starts
figuring out how you type in what you
say really and so automatically has all
this information value and then over
time starts to guess and it'll actually
present what it thinks you're gonna say
next above the keys but we saw a little
bit that interview and you can just
flick it up and for one so that's the
part I found confusing yeah so I'm used
to on the various Android keyboards that
i use to tapping above the key right
there's the line of words at the top
yeah but this is like you just flick up
yeah and it's like fur for one-handed
use if you for me I type things like you
know I'm on my way I'm all the time and
so if you start to if you type like I'm
on it starts to quickly guess that
you're going to say my and then way and
if I'm just like running down the street
with one hand being able to just flick
twice is it's pretty great often you run
down the stree with one hand constantly
just always one hand in the pocket well
yeah I mean I gotta keep the blazer back
for the GQ look and then just play click
on the bike that's good see you put it
that's a classic
keyboard blackberry look right so very
2002 business total business 2002 yeah
it's like on the cover of GQ is the
whole thing spin your novel this is 2002
but so I think that in the they're using
swiftkey tech yeah to do a lot of this
prediction stuff and SwiftKey does a lot
of the same stuff for Android and works
really well and like especially with the
predictive stuff is kind of remarkable
once you take the time to actually you
know get way into my problems I always
switch around two months before I can
really dive into one but with this you
don't have a choice and both from what
Josh said and in my own sort of limited
experience it definitely seems to be it
gets better as you use it more right
well I think that's actually the whole
interface it's that seems to be the
theme with blackberry tell ya right is
it is very different they've done some
things that are very different right now
they're not necessarily better right
because there are so many ways to
accomplish the same task but they're
different and the more you use them the
more kind of intuitive they become I
want to talk about them so we should
talk about the blackberry hub yes is
kinda I would say the centerpiece of the
platform yeah that's where everything
goes and I think it's what's interesting
about that is we've now come with this
progression of when the iphone first
came out it had no centralized and be an
information place right right had no
notifications and no notification center
and then they eventually built up to
whatever thing that they have now which
is still not very good right which is ok
but yeah you can tell that that is the
core experience of using an iphone for
me is very much about Notification
Center oh I see what's going on I think
with Android the core experience of
using Android is defined by how good the
notifications are yeah i agree i think
that's there's a lot of kallarap of
android in general and and so there's
been that progression in now with
blackberry 10 you see like they've
literally taken notifications and
combined them with incoming data and
said there are there are essentially no
notifications your notification center
is just your inbox right you're not like
maybe that's a good idea like I'm very
curious to see how works in practice
having only plated the phone for a
little bit yeah but it is definitely
extremely bold would you call it curvy
yeah that's a
it's a storm oh yeah that's terrible no
it's it's a very bold idea for a
platform to say we're taking this thing
from these other platforms that is
central to the experience the
notifications and you know a centralized
place for ambient information and we're
gonna make it literally the centerpiece
of the plat right which I actually think
could be really cool like kind of from
the beginning this is the thing I've
been most excited about about this phone
is that I love the idea of having my
emails and my texts and my Twitter
messages and like the linkedin messages
and all this stuff just in one place
where as in iOS I'm constantly flipping
between 11 different apps to see what's
come in at any given time but the
problem here is that I feel like the
idea is really good and they missed some
stuff on the execution so like when you
get say you know an email and if I'm
reading a text message and then I leave
the hub and I get an email yeah flick
back into the hub and since they're not
like abstracted the notifications not a
link to a thing it just is the thing and
it tells you you have a new thing so you
go back and you open up the hub to see
what's new and instead of taking you to
that new message it takes you exactly
where you were so then i have to like
back back all the way out and then go
back into where I wanted to be and it
just seems it's a bunch of extra steps
because there's no abstraction all it's
telling you is you have a new thing and
it's in the hub and that's that's good
but I want there's no way to get to it
and it becomes you're just constantly
hunting for this new thing that you know
let's come in which just so I mean I get
a lot of notifications that I kind of
like don't need to see right um so I
have an app on my iPhone that tells me
that's gonna rain it's all dark so it's
good at it's a great you get it dr. guys
and a literal identification is it's
raining yeah and like then I clear it
and goes away and so I'm wondering how
those kinds of apps are going to
function with the hub because the hub
the hub wants you to interact with
notifications basically right which is
you know back where is very you know now
that they're called blackberry I'm never
gonna get this right oh I'm with you so
for years it's like you correct yourself
when you say blackberry instead of rim
and ral you have to correct yourself the
other way anyway um they're five pairs
all about the inbox it always has been
and they've made everything fit into an
inbox
metaphor and I think that works really
well for some things Josh's my interview
that doesn't work so well with Twitter
right twitter is an inbox thing it's
just supposed to be there right you just
look at tweets and then you go away
right and especially for you know him
and you for like Twitter is a big mode
of communication happens Josh was saying
like this this works great if you get
you know a couple of app replies every
once in a while but right when it's when
you're using it more as a communication
tool and stuffs always coming in and
going out it becomes either super
stressful to use almost more just kind
of untenable because there's just a
million notifications and you have to
like read every individual one to clear
it and you can't just kind of jump in
whenever you feel like I mean I think
that's again it's a it's a very it's an
inbox metaphor it's an inbox before and
it's a very like daring metaphor to take
an entire to take the entire concepts
and notifications and to take the black
the very strong blackberry concept of
inbox right and just mash them together
i think is very interesting but how it
plays out for all the various kinds of
apps so we now count on to deliver
notifications right is like up in the
air so actually speaking of Twitter I've
got I asked for questions on Twitter and
I've got a lot of them so here's what I
think is really interesting i want to
ask you this because you were a
blackberry user right you were a while
yeah so this is John Liu 1984 does it
steel does it still feel like a
blackberry whatever that means so I
actually uh the hardest part for me was
that like the feeling of the blackberry
was always that the trackball and then
the optical trackpad and it was like
that was how you moved around and I feel
like touch in general just kind of makes
it stop feeling like what I associated
real black berry that's interesting um
but I think that's also kind of to their
credit I mean in in the same sense that
like you're always jumping back to your
inbox and it's all about the
communication tool and it's very much a
messaging phone and the keyboard is
really paid attention to and I think it
still feels like a blackberry in that
sense but it also feels more it feels
more modern it's more it I'm gonna say
it flows and then I'm gonna cry about
that but it flows better it's it makes
more sense than you know I was
constantly always digging into menus on
old blackberries and you were always
pressing the little blackberry button to
try and figure out where you should go
next
and this feels much more intuitive
there's like this big learning curve
with the gestures at the very beginning
and then as soon as you get past that it
starts to feel much more natural as I
move around which i think is very much
to BlackBerry's credit that they've
pulled that off without getting rid of
what some of the communications actually
another question I have here where'd it
go it's gone Oh from I can't pronounce
her name do you get a better Twitter
handle from summit to cement asst are
the gestures intuitive uh so Josh
actually we were talking about this
yesterday and I think he put it
perfectly which is it if if I just
handed you the phone yeah you'd have
absolutely no idea how to do it right
you and you would just look at it be
like what when you boot it up doesn't
tell you know yeah so the initial
startup is you know you connect to Wi-Fi
and you set up an account and then it
basically says that's kind of what
windows 8 does where it's just like
swipe in from any edge and see what
happens and the biggest thing you need
to know is that you swipe from the
bottom to get your home screen and
that's really true like as soon as you
figure out or are told or learn that one
swipe up from the bottom to get to your
home screen gesture you can kind of
figure everything else out you just on
and even the peak well so the peak is on
I mean it's again it's the same with
windows 8 we're like you don't need that
yeah but it's an it's a nifty thing in
it it walks you through it and teaches
you how to do it but it's yeah I mean if
I just hand into a turned off phone that
I had already set up you'd have
absolutely no clue right but in in two
minutes I can get you pretty set up so
it's yeah it's up and down alright so
from uh ian robinson what is the maps
app like bad it's bad i mean it's just
such big change being which just isn't
as good as google yeah uh and especially
like Google's Maps app on iOS is like
continues to be my favorite thing in the
world right on it's good yeah and it
just continues to get better and bing
maps doesn't have the same number of
points of interest its transit stuff is
not as good the app itself is fine it
runs it runs perfectly well um it's kind
of the same stories everything like it's
smooth and fast and works fine but I
think Josh was saying in his review that
he looked for like a restaurant and it
led him to a town in New Jersey with the
same name as the restaurant bank I mean
that that's big there's a bad guy
that's just that's something that's also
totally out of BlackBerry's control and
something i don't i don't know that i
see google you know Paul Norris you're
in a nap about what's Paul Miller's
theory is if you put being on your bing
maps on your phone you don't care about
your users that's really since wow it's
rough it's a rough thing to say I mean
but there's what's what is your level of
this a lot of people ask this question
what is the level of integration with
Google services because old blackberries
had some funky gmail thing going on
right but what it was okay um but what's
what's the true level of integration so
basically what we've been told is that
it's uh it's not there yet but it's
coming okay things like you know stars
and labels which were always great in
old blackberries yeah on blackberry 7
and I was kinda surprised they were
there or not there now but they're very
much on the roadmap and it's part of the
plan and it's going to be there um but
for now it's it's it kind of treats it
like any other imap client basically
which leads to the problems you're
describing where these just my thread is
gigantic and it doesn't but you're like
Google Talk google voice none of that
stuff is there yet not it's it's not
integrated in the same way and Google is
I'm curious to see if google jumps on
this board like they have on iOS well
yeah this comes back to this comes back
to the windows phone 8 kind of
conversation right right where Google is
kind of making a lot of steps taking a
lot of steps and doing a lot of things
to make sure when it's funny like stays
down right right because people are
bought into the Google ecosystem
services they use gmail they use maps
they probably use google talk and most
people i know you use google talk
Missy's use HTML maybe use google voice
and they're not everybody's YouTube and
they're just not there on windows phone
because I know that there's you know the
Google's on as we go to where the people
are right but they're like preventing
people from getting there right so there
they've like looked at the
chicken-and-egg equation and they're
like firmly denying like chicken right
whatever that whatever that be killed
all of the chickens yeah so they can't
lay or not their chicken limited look a
chicken and I but it's the same question
for black bear right they've maybe you
can plug in a gmail and experience is
fine your friends will yell
because a reformat saw your email but at
least you have it right but all of the
other the spectrum of other Google
services is not there and I I wonder if
google will be happy to let blackberry
be the third player because that will
continue to prove it microsoft and i
think google is aligned very strongly
against microsoft right so i wonder if
they will ally with blackberry just to
say Microsoft you're out of the game and
that's a wide open question or you know
maybe in this is potentially true as
well maybe Google really is just going
to where the people are and they're
gonna wait to see where the people go
yeah they'll provide the services yeah I
mean I think it's the name of a really
interesting handedness we're like if
they build a you know a gmail app and a
glutton a Maps app and a youtube app for
blackberry and not windows phone 8
that's a huge thing in BlackBerry's
corner um I think it's just I don't know
I agree I don't know necessarily what
happens i think google and blackberry
are much less competitive than google
and microsoft they just overlap a lot
less right so i wouldn't be surprised to
see google play a little nicer with
blackberry uh but but yeah I mean for
right now the YouTube app is a rapper to
the mobile site like Google clearly had
nothing to do with that right and it's
it's gonna be real interesting caecus
for right now some of that stuff like if
you're a heavy google user it's just
it's man i think consumers are so we
have a question here that i want to
answer with a video okay if that makes
any sense for the world from Keith prime
do you think we're impressed do you
think those impressed with blackberries
efforts are genuinely impressed or did
we just have low expectations and I just
want to show you and maybe maybe we had
lower expectations or impressed so they
they beat them but I think there is an
incredible invited blackberry I keep
wanting to say rim they spent a lot of
time this morning pointing out how much
worldwide anticipation there's for the
thumb which is something we heard from
Vlad in UK yeah but I just put them the
way they chose just watch it's just
watch it's tremendous embarrassing
hey is that my phone my affiliation with
blackberry and why I set up blackberry
community because I'm falling in love
with blackberry and the first starts
that's it blackberry 10 will give a
jaw-dropping moment for everyone I have
to share my passion and enthusiasm to
ask many people as possible there's the
challenge blackberry 10 I'm trying to
own it let's hit up this blackberry
nation my name is Louie well when it to
the salt was I started losing sleep
waiting for the launch day of blackberry
10 I wanted to create no sleep to
blackberry team to give to your
blackberry or so to get everybody ready
and pumped up for the launch day january
thirty
what I like and support about blackberry
10 is that you're able to do multiple
things well leaving the application
people in Dallas can't wait bring on
blackberry team
I just want you to imagine thorsten
heins the Teutonic handsome thorsten
heins just rock it out to that song in
his in his head phones connected as
blackberry 10 device can you imagine
that because I certainly can but look
something else very important has
happened I've eliminated David Pierce
and it's gonna be okay because in his
place we have ross miller who has with
him a blackberry z10 I can't believe
you're taking credit for the
vanquishment cuz I mean I do think I
took a pretty strong well you did strike
it very hard in the head yes how did you
coordinate your shirt you know I just
had what is wrong with you I vbm torsten
this morning I was like yeah talk to me
don't BBM II don't be me and me alright
lets up we have one we got what's the
synesthesia in 10 said 10 yeah see this
is me the experience is redesigned its
reimagined this is really this this is
not going to be the one that you and a
property detection rear carrier I really
don't like some sure thing did not mean
deeply to get away from me so I have it
I'm I'm not contract coordinated with by
the company so I will say this this is
not probably not the packaging unless
you buy this thing unlocked part not the
packaging you'll see from carrier but
it's very nice z10 now you're matching
oh yeah it's good come on come on we are
the combined z10 packaging right here
this is nice yes this guy we got it it's
all happening here is there stuff in
here maybe you know I will say the one
that we we don't do unboxing videos it's
a verge anymore we or photos it's it's
things in a box there's not much to say
but i will say that having done a lot of
them in my life there's nothing more
depressing than like of taking the phone
away like oh we see the phone then you
put aside never look it is great
component here's the battery battery
could be useful alright that's all we
need your sim card here's the charger
plus and minuses aligned so uh in case
you're wondering the blackberry z10 is
in fact a phone that comes in a box yes
this is breaking news it's got a charger
like every other charger and it comes to
the case which is very nice the film is
over it is on that's on there we got
boot this thing up for the people all
right spitting up and it
it's kind of out of focus it's coming
back there we go okay so I don't think
we need any of this like crap I don't
think there is so much play there's a
lot in that look you know you should
have packed this stuff in recycled paper
yeah thorsten I know you did it yourself
uh every single one of us is broken see
that was there oh let's go with the case
great i can i can close so i don't i
want to show this is a virus off Matt
and what we noted in the review and I
think what a lot of people said so this
is a z10 uh here's an iphone 5 10
annotations on it they are I mean just
remarkably similar glasses the z10 is a
little bit bigger has a bigger screen
but at a glance there's really unlock
this thing you've got a pretty banged up
iphone 5 just a dozen tangent my iPhone
5 is it's basically like it's like a car
in the road warrior I mean it this has a
lot of character but if you can see I
mean these things look just very similar
and part of that is making a black phone
with a black screen you just end up with
something that looks like an odd right
you know we'll see we'll see what apple
says about it but it's very handsome
it's got a textured back it's got these
little crumb bums and it's not this soft
touch finish and somebody in Twitter
actually asked me if this feels like the
Nexus 7 and I would say this feels to me
a lot better than the nexus s really
yeah i mean the next I mean that's like
a faux leather but this is that's not a
knife fighting over this right now I
don't know how diff you see the
low-level like really wait I'm learning
how to insert a sim card that's what's
your first class swipe left to continue
yeah all right sorry so I've got one so
you were at the event I was at the event
what was your sense of the event uh it's
turned out on a very weird no I don't
know how much was actually broadcast
live did you see crackberry Kevin could
officer yes you did i watch that on and
I've had in a car on my way to the
student raised very strict it was before
the event the event hadn't officially
started by streaming it I wasn't sure if
that was being at the event or not I was
actually confused about that so start
out with this guy kind of coming on
doing a telecast in front of us we
didn't know what was happening didn't
really say they just had the guy come
out yeah he said we're gonna do in life
in London and then nothing
happen it turns out there's a small blip
on the back TV that no one noticed right
until they started putting on the other
countries it was just the most awkward
weird things live yeah I didn't know
either right so what they were trying to
show and I think this is something that
maybe our wider set of viewers in the US
doesn't know is that blackberry is still
very huge or like countries around the
world like when other blackberry phones
blackberry six phones or blackberry 7
pounds of crab there have been lines
internationally for blackberries hmm
which has not been the case United
States know so there as there is a lot
of like pent-up blackberry frustration
demand the man waiting for a device like
this well I think what they were trying
to show with the event and I think they
didn't do a very good job of it but what
they were trying to show is that around
the world blackberry still strong brand
and then there's demand for it what they
ended up showing was a lot of like rooms
of people watching TV and like a guy in
Paris like going like now so correct me
if I'm wrong now years and years ago
when they are still research in motion
they did the key know about saying
blackberry was popular in third world
countries is this was the same computers
that Paul uh no it's fucking it was
blackberry okay I don't think problems
over pop yeah sad to say that is it's
unfortunate but uh what is this thing
doing what are you doing is it what so
we're just trying to connect this friend
of Wi-Fi and failing out that's what's
happening um here we should continue
surgeons just keep soft touching yeah
I'm gonna you take some stuff about the
event well I get the author I mean so
like it was it also weird start it kind
of gotten more normal as we went on I
mean thorsten heins did a good job it
was weird seeing my clothes arias there
oh he was there well he's on the board
isn't it he's on the board he was in the
front yeah he was on the front he stood
up and torsten thanked him for driving
us into the future of blackberry which
is an odd thing to say for the man who
drove the company to a ground well he
did he did it I think that yeah
investors lost confidence in it but I
think he at one point whoreson said we
have to thank some people who helped us
make a very hard decision which was
right do we make our own platform or do
we pick a competitor platform and i
think i failed connecting and they
clearly behind it it both though and we
have the android emulator in here right
which is i really wish i could connect
to a network here second show p.m. ET
women trauma do you know how to password
is i don't know the password yeah i got
this
I got this as Ross so this was what else
did you see at the event that was going
on like during the announcements there's
a lot of time spent demoing you I
there's a lot of time Ross I think Ross
figured it out I think that there's a
lot of there's a lot of talk about the
UI but the announcements what were their
selling points for some of the stuff
they were saying about the UI I mean
it's just different like it's a new
thing like they didn't really bring up
any competitors they're just saying like
we have a swipe we have his way of
getting notifications of course they did
a lot on the enterprise right which is
their big selling point I mean it was
they wanted to basically give us in a
bubble you know you see you all times
you see Microsoft here's the Apple kind
of go on they'll vaguely reference yeah
competition they can't really do that
here they're just like this is the
rebirth of blackberry huh well I mean
that's like they I don't think they can
reference a competition I don't think
that works out well for them if they
keep talking about the iphone because i
don't think they want to invite the
comparisons yet i think that's bad for
them I thought the iphone so i don't i
don't think they're gonna go after the
iphone android market right now i think
i think they're fighting for third place
Thurston said that many times before
he's fighting for third place right and
first and second is clearly iphone and
android depending on what your metric is
ones and first ones in second did you
break you just said it connected to a
Wi-Fi network and then immediately did
yep Oh keep swiping ah this is all about
swiping again it's all about special
apps to continue fix everything by
swiping but Windows Phone I think that's
a fair comparison this should have made
I mean do you want to compare yourself
to Windows Phone at this point I think
saying you're gonna beat a platform that
isn't successful it's not a good do your
blackberry ID you know you want to make
one I don't want to make one I'll make
I'm sorry yeah um I want you to talk I
don't want you to know any federal funds
are you like my Chris can I have the
phone yeah we can shit we'll set it up
there's a review on the verge with a
complete video this UI is the blogger is
it we have one we have another one I
think we have a few more that are gonna
come floating in way up and all the
events though so we have the phone i
will say that just hardware wise it is
it is very handsome um it does look an
incredible amount like an iphone there's
just no getting around it ever more like
when we're waiting with the show that
small pictures 8-10 on screen i was like
i thought they were holding I point this
out you can you can take the battery out
which is very into that's very that's
right
samsung the Flexi back right so talk
more about the event just like we've got
a few more minutes here and I want I
just want to get your sense of as you
meant was going on as you witnessed
Alicia Keys deflect questions about
blasting speaking of like pinned up
frustration Alicia Keys metaphor to her
experience but it's not a bad boyfriend
Oh what's a boyfriend boyfriend no no I
know Alicia key is not a metaphor she's
a real person what was going on with
alicia keys just Tommy straight up why
was she there and what the hell I don't
know we're all taking bets on who was
actually gonna come out because they're
like we have a new creative director
yeah we know what that means in the tech
space now it means we've hired celebrity
to show for us and to make us look cool
yeah be it gaga be it will I am so we
have a picture from the live blog of
thorsten greeting Alicia Keys this is
like romantic country looks like he's
about to like kiss yeah it's somewhere
between a romantic comedy and they're
like that movie poster for what about
Bob yeah like I'm going to hurt you but
I also want to love you and that was for
relationship with blackberry apparently
also yeah she defined as like a
boyfriend and then she's like she did
yes what she's everything about okay so
Alicia Keys like you know blackberry was
mrs. boyfriend you know and at some
point I started looking at the you know
kind of playing the field a little more
checking out my checking out these a
sexy new option she definitely said sexy
I'm talking about obviously the iphone
and android all that do you know you
know I you know I came back to
blackberry essentially because like it's
the nice guy that's always there it's no
end of him it's terrible um but I want
to say it someone to Twitter noted
Alicia Keys is still heavy and Instagram
even though she says she's exclusive to
blackberry where's aunt agreement so I
will say this there was a lot of room so
they did a lot they did a lot of talking
about apps and one of the rumors that
we'd heard endlessly was Instagram was
coming to to blackberry 10 right didn't
happen right we're not in seeing it but
what other apps do we see right we saw a
Skype Skype which is you know is it's
good it's microsoft thing but it's also
a huge communication business platform
we saw kindle which is whatever amazon's
and everything i'd be surprised if it
wasn't right so we but we basically saw
services that benefit from me and every
platform yes right did you see so well
twitter facebook on foursquare well that
link that fits from all social networks
and like we saw a lot of stuff where
they need people to like be a part of
that plan right so what do we see any
like anything I Mary blow up apps
oh I mean like we saw those we saw angry
birds I don't think we saw netflix or
hulu like there's no entertainment app
speak of interesting to tell that's
that's fascinating I mean unless it's in
the app store but they did not highlight
on stage and if you have netflix the
absolution oh here's Alicia Keys and uh
I know this is terrifying like whatever
he is a very tall man like I think if
anyone talks to him caption contest to
this photo cuz I look at that and I
literally see once you're dead to me
like that's what I see when I see that
big good don't say you know it's it's
romantic to me I don't know what so you
see romance I see malice that's what I
see that I don't think there's a
difference to you and that's and that's
how I feel about the by free time it is
what you see it it's my state 0 kath
sadomasochistic partner which is why
Neil Gaiman is now a show for this too
thats Sarah mo Oh is he really yeah so
there's a you there's a new blackberry
initiative um x terrible and it's like
it's a new blackberry district and it's
basically Alicia Keys going around
getting other celebrities to play with
blackberry yeah 1mon was neil gaiman
that's ridicu I don't know if the other
person is right now because I get
focused on like they had this trailer
and there's neil gaiman in a diner
claimants blackberry there's neil gaiman
walking through the snow with his giant
dog playing with his blackberry and i
can only assume the next pictures like
neil gaiman talking with the real demons
and brainstorming on the blackberry yeah
that's that's the only logical step I
should start an emergency call oh god
dogs do damn you did I know that simpler
it's fine sir look there's one one
question I we should I start wrapping
this up the one biggest question I got
from Twitter all right straight up and
it's something you just touched on was
between Windows Phone 8 and blackberry
10 you had to pick one to use which one
would you bet gut reaction I would spill
even you've been a windows phone I tried
so hard to love the 8x and Nokia Lumia
um I would probably still go with
Windows Phone really um if for no other
reason then and this is something I was
talking about with Billy enjoyed our
video crew before blackberry is just
blackberry there's nothing else is
connected to if I get a window so it may
be that third party experience I'm just
looking for something new but i also
know I've got windows 8 yeah I've got
the xbox experience in the fact that it
will tie together I can just assume the
Microsoft will put ever
think it has two windows phone I think
it's probably a little bit more
longitude that has nothing to do with
actually using this phone what you just
see I mean like that mean I think it's
still like using a third place thing if
swipe gestures versus bad they're both
bad multitaskers right they both have
kind of okay keyboards in the swipe
gesture do you think this keyboards just
okay it's okay yeah interesting have you
sure I've heard of now a broad spectrum
of reactions about this keyboard right i
mean if i get used to it i'm sure what
I'm gonna love it i will say i love the
physical keyboard mm-hmm but I'm at a
point my life where I've been specially
in five six years you played with the
q10 a little bit special say without you
quickly totally weird yeah it's like we
got there they were almost like one like
they're for devices in the whole thing
in the corner we'd run to them we'd
found them uh we try to pick it up he's
like no no no you can't pick it up uh we
tried to play the keyboard like I swiped
it a little bit um he's like can you
push the buttons down no no ha we push
them anyway but like I mean they're very
you calling a controlled demo they won't
show any of the apps but they say
they're all optimized for this square
720 x 720 screen that's a really weird
and it looks really good really yeah
well I mean black Michigan's have always
looked at and dad it looks like this
looks exceptionally well this like it's
like the best blackberry there's been
which is not saying much yeah in this
day and age but i will say they can
dominate the physical keyboard market if
people room it if you don't remember
that and want to have you if that
markets so change so that markets
largest the onus like it's a great piece
of kikyo it's a great piece of hardware
the keyboard did feel good a little that
we played with it yeah and what else is
there it's blackberry the keyboard
that's all we really need to know it's
fair hey final thoughts here we were
wrapping this up right this is a battle
for third place I don't think they're
gonna take android's market sure away
from them I don't think I'm gonna take
the high end of the market way from
Apple I think those are difficult
problems to solve and i don't i don't
think blackberry even wants to they
don't seem like they're trying to give
her first they want to settle anywhere
they want to survive right and i will
say this on the last Apple Apple always
makes a big point of how well they're
doing an enterprise right and they they
do it to tweak and they do it every
event they do a never earrings call and
they do it to tweak not only Microsoft
but to point out they have effectively
killed the blackberry enterprise right
with bring your own device where he has
an iphone now what I was happening
there's a huge potential market here for
blackberry with balance with this thing
we have different profiles for work and
personal there's a big potential market
for them to go back to their former
enterprise customers and say look we're
back with a phone that's compared with
the iphone but as far more secure and
more familiar to you mr. CIO and did
they make that argument today when they
were at the live event he did a little
bit minute they did spend a lot of my
enterprise they touch base on this whole
like bring-your-own-device trend and
they're saying like we need to bring
this back I think blackberry balances
one of those things we want to do is
like this is your personal life this is
your business line business life and
both are very secure and separated so
you can have everything you want in one
device it's no more like carrying your
blackberry and then carrying this fun
device that you actually want to use
right there trying to say this is a
single ubiquitous device that you're you
know your IT professionals will love and
you'll hopefully enjoy yourself I mean
this your IT professionals will love
this device is like you know that's a
sad argument for it's a sad argument but
they're hoping you know it's an argument
that actually works before bringing our
device completely eats them up right so
final thoughts you earth event today and
you got to play with the device a little
bit we're holding one that I'm taking
from you you mean that I'm taking back
since we're off the air there's a lot of
we're going right there's a lot of
angers don't say that we wrassled and
thugs really it's a tell Tommy wrap this
up for me yeah I'll throw some first
knowledge the world okay wrap it up it's
blackberry I'll say it's actually a
compelling device I think they have a
lot of actually good chance of taking
that third place yeah Microsoft's going
to step up and really say we've got this
whole ecosystem we had this whole weight
behind it that Blackberry just cannot do
and then we claim this enterprise market
too because everyone's using microsoft
office anyway yeah but black bear came
out there's like we've got a great you
know this UI is actually interesting
it's fun to use they don't have the apps
but they're clearly pushing harder than
Microsoft has been you know what I
thought was interesting and this is sort
of my final thought was when they
started saying we're gonna reboot black
way we're gonna do blackberry 10 their
line was this is like a revolutionary
new way to use a phone and a
revolutionary new way to do messages and
I have backed all the way down to we
have a hug right I think that's that's
an important point like this is an
interesting you I
is no longer like a sellable point I
don't think you can go in the mass
marking be like this is an interesting
you I I think you can say to people
probably watching this I think you can
say to us here are some in gestures that
are interesting but what you really have
to say is this like makes your life
better in these tangible ways and I
think some of that stuff is here I think
some of their ideas about messaging some
of the notification hub kind of
coalescing I think for a lot of people
will be very interesting but they've got
to figure out exactly what that message
is so they can go to the mass market
they can run their ad on the Super Bowl
and they can say this phone versus you
know this I these two things look the
same yeah here's why this one is better
right right and they really do look the
same like those app icons like that
basic sense of like you're holding
something that's very familiar is just
going to be there right and I think they
need to show exactly why this one is is
literally ahead of the other one and
here's the other thing like you're
saying like it's actually I want to take
back this is not like a fight for third
place because it's iphone the top is
Android and there's so many different
versions of Android out there that are
actually fighting for second third and
fourth place right like there's clear
Android there's TouchWiz there's
Samsung's very I mean I think these
android such was the sanctions variant
yesterday I said well you said touch
wasn't it's fine really touch with it's
basically TouchWiz and regular most off
you and then yep it's almost a
fourth-place fight because what you want
to do whatever they can show in terms of
jesters you're right android can do it
mmm or someone will make android do it's
an open platform so we really is kind of
weird to say android second place when
it's all these companies interpreting
their own wanted shit it's marking sure
yeah but there's a lot of android out
there and i think that brand is strong
right when i see ads unlike the in the
taxi flike the newscaster who has a nap
he's like it's for your iphone or
android and that that's what that is
they never say it's for your samsung and
your motorola or it's just an doubt it
there's this mask you can you can give
us every entrance when you want and it
has some variations but the App Store is
huge and it's ubiquitous and you've got
to justify your after reading someone
else's and we just saw them catching up
right and not quite there yet either but
they're catching up to other people's
apps right well if you're a blackberry
user you were once a blackberry user hey
Freck a year with this would this bring
you back you know no no they have it
it's all over
no so click that's the end of our live
stream for the day there's a lot there's
a lot of constant leverage a lot of
hands on a lot of analysis we're new
some reports you should if you haven't
read josh's review you should definitely
go and look at that there's we ran the
video bit earlier but if you missed that
you should definitely watch videos it's
very illuminating but that is here's a
blackberry z10 we have it it is launched
the time has come for you to move your
thumb in a circle circle to see
notifications David is there goodbye
David I'm sorry that you were by dated
cast away all right folks you have any
more questions of stuff we actually we
