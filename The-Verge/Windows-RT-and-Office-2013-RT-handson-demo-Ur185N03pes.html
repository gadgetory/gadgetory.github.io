live at ethos 2012 in Berlin and we're
checking out the Samsung ativ tab more
importantly however what we're looking
at is a build 9200 the final build of
Windows RT something we haven't really
got a chance to look at so we're gonna
kind of dive into the menu get some more
details see what's actually different
between this and kind of the classic x86
Windows 8 version ourselves you can see
we have a pretty much standard Start
menu we can go to the desktop mode still
a little file explorer it's the same as
you've seen in the x86 version in fact
you can kind of push down you can still
make folders you can still access files
really quickly it can rename and of
course you got a pop of the menu touch
keyboard there we go
obviously you can see this it's not
entirely optimized for a touch
experience a lot of what you're gonna
see in the desktop mode it's still
better cater a better suited for a
keyboard and mouse but it is there
alright thank City apps to get the basic
apps you've got the Microsoft Office
we'll go back to the next second and
then you got your Windows accessories
your notepads your paints and
unfortunately for that for notepad it's
basically that all the standard x86 mode
you go with the classic mode you can
still you know test I know Auto crack
and that goes the same for Microsoft
Office 2013 we're looking at the preview
versions right now so if we go to excel
right here make a new work new excel
sheet you know and do my taxes and make
charts and stuff it's still somewhat
more touch friendly I also get these
minis that cut come up and kind of use
these
easy to touch the most part just get a
little unwieldy here unfortunately like
I'm not going to be able to very easily
push my way to print of you it's it's an
imperfect mode clearly this is still
more optimized for a keyboard and mouse
as with everything in kind of the
desktop mode if you hold your finger
down you can get over to the screen
resolution hope that's personalization
again like I said the touch menus are
really not suitable for touch get down
there beautiful okay wonderful so as you
can see the resolution is 1366 by 768
nothing we can change on this hardware
we need to check us on the other ones
one of the very few windows RT models
we've actually middle C thus far
orientation we can change portrait we
can flick landscape from here see if I
can do this okay there we go
so just keep changes no accelerometer
it's not going to change on its own I
dear God hope there's an easier way
doing it but right now it looks like the
one option is to go to a very tiny menu
it's a very tiny portrait thing okay
there we go
and keep changes all right much better
crisis over everyone we are back in
normal mode okay so now if you actually
go into settings it's actually you know
you won't change your PC settings you
get the ones called Metro now just
windows 8 UI design or whatever settings
with your personalization nothing too
serious or detailed here if you want to
do that you go to all apps gets like
control panel unfortunately though once
he gets the more nuanced settings you
were back in classic mode which again
not very touch friendly with you have
very small fingers there is no stylus
support towards the digital stylus for
this one and we haven't heard of a model
that's really doing that just yet for
the RT version so basically that is
Windows RT as far as we can tell build
9200 the final version this isn't test
mode however first you very similar to
Windows 8 of course obviously the x86
classic programs will not work and if
you're going to do anything sudo series
in the classic desktop mode you're going
to need a keyboard and you're going to
need to find a mouse
