here with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1
samsung stylus stable version of the
Galaxy Tab as you can see it's a pretty
handsome looking tablet it has samsung's
new design with speakers in the front
and kind of this chrome Ridge on the
back it's pretty plastic it's a little
bit lighter than you might expect
there's a camera with a flash and IR
port a microSD slot and headphone jack
the screen is pretty nice it's a 10.1
inch LCD display it has pretty good
viewing angles all the way around it's
not nearly as good as the iPad display
it's only 1280 by 800 but I think the
most important part is obviously the
stylist or Samsung calls it the S Pen or
as I call it the spend it's actually
based on Wacom technology and it has a
thousand 24 points of sensitivity so as
I draw kind of lightly on the screen you
can see it's barely showing up but if I
push harder it gets a lot darker and if
I move the pen around different ways it
changes what the ink looks like on
screen when you pull the stylus out of
the integrated slot it actually opens up
quick action menu to show you some of
the apps that Samsung loads on it what's
weird is that you can't change this so I
guess cram physics is gonna be there
forever but this is actually just one
piece of Android that Samsung has
changed for dramatically with TouchWiz
it's Android 4.0 480 so insights from
sandwich but TouchWiz on top of here is
really intense and it feels like it's
slowing the entire system down you can
see it's a little bit jerky some of
these giant widgets don't do much of
anything every single menu option you
pick on the Galaxy Note is accompanied
by a blooping sound and that level of
intrusiveness by TouchWiz seems to
permeate everything on the tablet
there's also a lot of built-in apps the
main big app that I've added in is S
note s - there's pretty decent
handwriting recognition so you can just
write on it and he'll figure out what
you're trying to say usually but you
have to write directly across if you're
like me and you're right at an angle it
won't know what you're trying to say at
all Heller is exactly what I wanted to
say there obviously and if you write at
any other weird angles or you don't have
perfect handwriting or if you write in
block print it'll think you're always
writing capital letters I'm like an iPad
stylus which basically just fakes being
your finger the S Pen is really good at
acting like a real pen the problem is
that it's sometimes a little bit slow
and there's not a lot of places to use
it around the system only S Pen enabled
understand that it's different than a
finger and they'll get confused if you
try to use both your pen and a finger in
an app that doesn't support the s-pen
Samsung's also replaced androids
built-in calendar app with it its own
app called s planner which doesn't seem
to have any purpose for existing other
than to look like a copy of the iOS
calendar application with this terrible
foe weather at the top it's functional
it works fine
it's just not clear why samsung felt the
need to replace the stock calendar
application another way the Samsung is
building the note as a Productivity
device is the ability to run two apps at
once which I was initially very excited
about sadly that's not meant to be only
Samsung's special apps can run in multi
screen mode so I can open s note hit
multi screen and then open the browser
and now that I've got two windows open
here I'm switching back and forth
between them is actually really laggy so
I can right over here but it's not
showing up and now that I've got s note
active switching back to the browser is
completely unresponsive so I can scroll
the browser I'm trying to switch back to
s note it's not doing anything this is
even worse if you open another app like
email these applications are not running
simultaneously they're running kind of
one at a time and they're very
noticeably switching back and forth
which one is active the bigger problem
of course is that that's not Chrome and
that's not Gmail there in fact weird
Samsung versions of each application
that I don't want to use in many ways
this is a dream that has been turned
into a terrible unresponsive nightmare
it's particularly perplexing because the
Galaxy Note actually benchmarks faster
than any Android device I've ever used
but it's really sluggish it should be
able to handle this kind of workload
without breaking a sweat but Samsung
does let you use all that power in
interesting ways you can text and watch
a video at the same time you do actually
use the pop-up player feature on the
note things slowed down even more you'll
notice that none of this is particularly
responsive as I move it around but the
video does keep playing because it's
being offloaded to the GPU one thing
that's really strange is that although
the Galaxy Note phone lets you do
handwriting recognition in the keyboard
the Galaxy Note 10.1 doesn't seem to
have any handwriting recognition the
keyboard at all in fact there's just
this button that shows you the last
things you've put in the clipboard and
not anything useful at all ultimately
the biggest problem with the Galaxy Note
is it's really two products in one it's
a pretty mediocre regular Android tablet
that's plagued by performance issues not
nearly as fast as something with
jellybean like the Nexus 7 and it's a
space tablet that doesn't really have
any compelling stylus apps yet the app
support just isn't there and the apps
that do support the stylists kind of
don't take full advantage of it the way
that you want it to for $4.99 you're
probably better off buying an iPad or if
you definitely want to Android tablet
you should buy the Nexus 7 which is
excellent but I'm willing to say the
Galaxy Note 10.1 is kind of a first
generation product and I'm really hoping
future stylus based devices are much
much better</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
