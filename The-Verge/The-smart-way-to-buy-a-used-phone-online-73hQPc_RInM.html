said the s7 for two years now
and being someone that films the latest
and greatest tech everyday it's gotten
me wanting a new phone the thing is I
don't want to spend a thousand dollars
and I don't necessarily need something
that came out yesterday so I'm gonna
show you how to buy a good used phone
okay
I'm Biden s9 plus now I am NOT here to
tell you what phone to buy and I'm sure
you'll sound off in the comments about
your favorite devices and what you would
buy but what I am here to do is to tell
you the best buying practices for a used
device the safest and most reliable ways
before we get to any of that though you
have to remember that phones come out in
cycles and there are better and worse
times to buy certain devices so I hit up
Chris Welch reporter here at the verge
and I was like Chris is it a good time
to buy an S 9 plus so there are pretty
clear timelines drawn it's a good idea
or a bad idea to buy a phone new iPhones
come out every September so your
relation violent if it's July or August
Samsung puts out the Galaxy S at the
start of each year March or April then
the note follows that up in the summer
Google this pixel updates in October in
general Apple and Samsung both change
their designs every two years then in
between there's a more powerful version
of the same phone with better specs a
nicer camera stuff like that that's what
we call the S here so the question comes
down to do you want the new flashy
design right away or can you wait one
year for the more powerful more refined
version of that same phone now Google is
a bit different because the pixel
generally hasn't used the same design
more than once but maybe you'd be
totally happy with last year's phone you
don't need an aural engine to browse
Instagram or a snapdragon 845 to play
spotify so in your case you'd be totally
safe to buy the s9 plus right now
and since it's less than a year old
buying it used will save you at least
$100 and still get you a great phone
okay so we are in luck it is a good time
to buy a used s 9 plus but where do you
start I mean there's a million different
options personally I always look at eBay
and Craigslist first Craigslist can be a
little bit of a slippery slope if a
phone is stolen and then you go to turn
it on and the serial numbers flag to
stolen
you'll be out the phone and the cash and
you'll have no connection to the seller
so for this video I'm gonna skip it
entirely but let's have a look at eBay
so eBay has a ton of listings and I went
on Samsung's website to see what a brand
new s 9 plus would be is around eight
hundred and forty dollars so I'm gonna
try to beat that now for my sake I'm
gonna search by Verizon because that's
my carrier
there are a lot devices but you'll have
to do research on your own to figure out
if they'll work on your network I've
looked through a bunch of listings and I
found this one this is the most
promising it's a Samsung Galaxy S 9 plus
64 gigs for $549 for me this looks nice
because the photos are very clear I can
tell that there's no scratches on the
device Wow
they have a lot of five-star reviews 760
positive reviews and only six negative
when a seller has a lot of positive
feedback like this it's usually a pretty
good sign that they're safe to buy from
also when searching I've noticed a lot
of stock photos used for the photo of
the phones this is something you want to
stay away from it's really important to
see your device in the photos and maybe
that means reaching out to the seller
and asking for a photo of a specific
thing just to be sure that that's the
device and that he has it so 549 dollars
on eBay that's pretty good but if you
know anything about me you know I'm all
about the deal so I'm gonna keep
shopping there's this website called
swap accom that I really like you're
still buying person-to-person so there
is a level of risk but there's a lot
more safeguards in place to ensure that
you're getting the device that you're
actually looking at there's a few
listings for the s9 Plus on here they
range from about 500 to $800 that mostly
has to do with the storage but I'm
looking for the 64 gigabyte model so
it's not a huge problem for me I'll be
at the lower end okay so this one looks
pretty good it's 514 dollars if you look
at the photos you'll notice that there's
like a code in there that's one of the
safeguards that swapper has it basically
is the code for the Sal so the phone
that you're seeing in the photo is the
phone for that listing I'm gonna scroll
down I'm gonna read some of the comments
next maybe I'll go in and I'll
who the seller is if he sold things here
before kind of all the same steps as
eBay okay so this looks pretty good and
another safeguard is that SWAPO doesn't
allow the sale of broken or unusable
devices now since you are buying used it
doesn't come with a warranty so say down
the line something happens to your phone
or it glitches out you're on your own to
get it repaired if you want a little bit
more reassurance when buying a used
phone you might want to look at
refurbish models they come with a
guarantee so if there's a defect down
the road they'll replace the device for
you you can buy reefers from a few
different places including the
manufacturer and your carrier but
there's also sites like gazelle or Best
Buy and they often have cheaper prices
on these alright Best Buy's website is a
little confusing and trying to find
refurbs but if you scroll all the way
down to the bottom where it says buying
options that's where you'll see them now
you can buy open box online it's a
little more expensive or if you go into
the store they have cheaper options but
it's probably because they want you to
actually look at it and know what you're
getting before you leave the store so
gazelle.com has certified pre-owned as
well here's an S 9 + 64 gig through
Verizon first six hundred and
thirty-nine dollars that's cheaper than
Best Buy
but it's still not as cheap as swap a--
or ebay was so buying a refurbished
device is definitely the safest way to
buy a used device but for me I'd rather
have the cheaper price and take the risk
so swap ID is the most appealing to me
the price was the lowest and although it
doesn't come with a guarantee the seller
seems like he sold things on here before
and he has really good reviews and I
feel good about it so I'm gonna go with
swap it for this one and I'm gonna waive
that whole guarantee so if something
goes wrong I guess it's on me but what I
will use gazelle for is selling my old
phone it's not in great condition but I
definitely want it recycled properly and
I no longer need it so you can go on
their website enter some info if it has
scratches if it turns on at all and then
they'll offer you a price they're gonna
give you ten bucks for this thing and
free shipping so I guess that means
lunch on gazelle
all right so sound off in the comments
of your favorite way to buy and sell
devices and who's got the oldest phone
out there anyone got me beat also like
and subscribe we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
