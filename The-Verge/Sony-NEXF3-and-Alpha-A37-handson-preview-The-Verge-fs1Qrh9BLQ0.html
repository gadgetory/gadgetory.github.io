and i'm here with nate rel as well as
sony's new translucent mirror
interchangeable lens camera this sony
alpha 837 this one here is a 16.1
megapixel sensor and 15 point autofocus
system same as many others on the sony
alpha line and in fact it's also the
same as the camera i'm holding to record
this footage with a sony NEX f3 this
particular camera that you're looking at
has a brand new 18 to 1 35 millimeter
lens on it which is going to be
available as a kit lens for several of
the alphas later in july and it starts
with this lens at seven ninety-nine or
with the standard 18 to 55 millimeter
kit lens for 599 you can see them having
a little bit of trouble with the auto
focus of the dexter 3 let me switch over
in the manual out that we go manual ring
dial and anyhow so the alpha 837 for the
price of 59 to 999 has an articulating
screen on the back nice big panel there
which can tilt up quite a bit and also
down if you want to get shots from a
different angle this is going to be
available in june with the lens in july
now in a moment we're going to switch
over and use the alpha a 37 to film this
NEX f3
and we're back with the NEX f3 Sony's
500 9999 successor to the next c3
earlier version of this mirrorless
interchangeable lens camera you can see
here there is quite the honking zoom on
this camera that's because it's a new 18
to 200 millimeter lens it's going to
retail for 849 99 in July but back to
the camera here spin that around to the
side and you're going to see a USB port
on the left that's not just for data
that is how you're going to charge the
NEX f3 it doesn't come with a separate
battery charger instead it recharges
over USB and sony tells us it's going to
take maybe about five hours to charge up
the battery internally the NEX f3 also
has a pop-up flash as we've seen in a
few leaks jumps right up like the one on
the on the next 7 and you can pull it
back with your thumb for a bounce flash
if you like other interesting new
feature of the f3 is the articulating
screen it pulls up like you'd like
expect in the back and can angle down a
ways but you can actually push it up 180
degrees or something Sony is calling a
mirror mode to take self-portraits and
not actually out there we go seeing on
the screen right now we zoom in while
you are arranging yourself in this
mirror mode and acts just like a mirror
with the image reversed so you can set
yourself up for a portrait like you'd
expect but once you start the start the
shutter 3 second timer after that goes
off the image it takes is actually
reversed completely so if you've got a
neat you know text logos on your shirt
or anything it'll appear the right way
up that's the same 16.1 megapixel aps-c
sensor in there
and autofocus system 51 autofocus system
and bonds processor as the Alpha series
and we'll find this in june for five
hundred ninety-nine ninety-nine with the
18 155 millimeter kit lens you're
wondering why this video is having some
focusing issues here it's because i'm
not used to this camera i am recording
all of this on the alpha a 37 we saw a
little while ago learning what i'm doing
for the first time here thank you for
