Lytro camera have you guys seen this
it's a wild wild demo would you stick
around and help out with this demo do
you be willing to do that so we're gonna
we're gonna be back in a second with
that but Neil I actually went and talked
to people who put together this camera
which is completely insane so take a
look at this clip and we'll be right
back with an actual real demo of it so
this is a microlens array this used to
be a room full of cameras and we've
miniaturised it to this we capture the
direction of light or the angle or
vector of light if you're a physics
person and when you do that you get
capabilities in a camera that you don't
have with conventional cameras and the
very first one which some folks have
been talking about is focusing after the
fact but we also have benefits like 3d
shift perspective and lots of things
that can come as you capture all of that
additional data and the way it works is
that light comes into the lens it's an 8
x f2 optical lens so lots of light flows
into the camera it strikes the special
light field sensor right here then right
on the camera we process that data that
light field picture file so you can
refocus directly on the camera you can
also refocus and interact with the
picture on your desktop and when you
share the light field picture throughout
the web you share it in a player like a
YouTube player so that your friends and
family can interact with a light-filled
picture without needing any special
software that's very cool stuff but you
actually demo it right here right now
we've got Neal I Paul and Matthias is
going to be their lab assistant so take
it away hey gentlemen I'm gonna hang out
here and have a cigarette so this is the
the lytro and as you can see it's
completely no frills this is all the
stock for the lens right here and I'm
actually I'm going to take a picture
right now you saw the video and I can
refocus after i take this but i'm going
to put the book close josh is in the
background took and now it processes the
photo and then I can tap to refocus all
right don't let me t is working it's
working so well write something was
happening on
on the screen of that ok yeah Lil ize
got a photobomb me right here we're
gonna see this in action is that's hard
to free gotta cater photo/pablo oh yeah
yeah there we go that's good it's more
of a zombie Bob just like John Cusack in
this thing yes what does that say
anything does that say anything yes yeah
I feel very passionate about that Sony
like can you talk about the sensor a
little bit yeah I'm actually holding it
and I was told that if I lose this the
PR person will lose their job so I'm
gonna go now so this thing is actually
this is the core bit of technology but
sits behind here is just a regular like
CMOS camera sensor but this thing sees
light rays it's kind of like a super
crazy advanced prism and once they
collect all the light rays in the sensor
they can do things like when you saw is
wearing 3d glasses you can look around
the picture it's just one camera to do
3d it's kind of like really insane snow
time it's truly crazy looking I mean you
guys will see it but it just you can
manipulate the photo as if it's lie yeah
it's like it's like you know if you got
shooting raw and your regular cameras
like this is the next layer you're
collecting light instead of like your
what the sensor thinks is in hands yeah
you can literally do the enhanced thing
only like enhance and you actually
focuses on the back and you can go into
a reflection and see back what's
happening you can't do that does it say
in the future it doesn't see the future
but it sees in the past it can submit it
can solve it can find replicants correct
absolutely ok good yeah because you
don't have megapixel rating it's just
it's like 15 megabytes per file yeah all
that information is always gonna be they
say it's mega raised right they call
their coin right ladies watches it's
like yeah that's cool its 4G to you got
to learn the terminology the future well
I micro adding features right now they
love you I loaded that the photo onto
this computer took a while because this
is an extreme beta this doesn't come out
until next year I got shot but if you
look at this can I do is yeah so just
tap and it's gonna refocus that's good I
prefer the other case Wow there we go is
gonna solve suddenly that's great you
there
a good job there we go God that is
insane yeah so right now right now it's
just focusing on two planes but the
final version will have a whole whole
bunch that is that is so insane they
make a giant can they make a giant one
that's a huge guy to take pictures of
huge thing yeah you've been like this
scaled up yeah like that like the mall
ten times the size of your own in that
windows your desk I'll be great that
yeah they can make sure the winco stone
so anyways this is a 399 for the eight
gigabyte the 16 gigabytes gonna be 499
it's going to come out next year this is
just a beta right now but it's just it's
completely new technology when it's
really fun and the he bunt they've
promised they're going to roll out
additional features so all the pictures
that you've taken thus far next year
when they roll out the 3d those pictures
will just magically become 3d which is
bonkers you could also upload your
photos to like Facebook or you can view
them on an iPad I can't do you don't do
the stuff yeah you can still adjust them
forever and if you if you want to send
it to your mom you can render out a JPEG
of one focus and what you say mama can't
use the focusing she's not smart enough
huh I'm sorry yeah you should be I'm
sorry Neil I to Joseph a dad I'm just
saying you know Facebook it's a little
technology called flash which everybody
loves that's not cool well that's
awesome thank you guys so much for
demoing it that is pretty ugly</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
