the last 37 years ILM has made some the
most well-known effects in Hollywood
history have you seen the Star Wars
movies the Indiana Jones trilogy or the
Transformers films you know the work of
ilm
Jeff white was the visual effects
supervisor on the Avengers and
Transformers Dark of the Moon i sat down
with him to talk about what first
inspired to me get into special effects
and a problem I'll um had about a
particularly colorful Hulk you know I
think so many of us Star Wars and said
okay this is this is where we want to
work and you know knowing that ILM kind
of was founded to create that and then
just following it over the years and
then getting a chance to get a job here
was was really a dream come true let's
talk about the most recent film you do
the Avengers Rex you're sitting here in
the motion-capture stage where you said
you'd shot a lot of stuff for that movie
what's the process what happens in these
four walls one of the great things about
Avengers especially with the Hulk was
having Mark Ruffalo come up here and do
performance you know and we actually did
several rounds of that he came here
initially just to come here on the mocap
stage and we showed him his motion kind
of retargeted onto a hog very fast and
loose so they could play with some ideas
and at the same time we captured a range
of expressions from him that we used to
drive the digital version of him and our
process on this one rather than just
kind of jumping straight to the Hulk was
to actually build the mark digital mark
ruffalo first and and verify that when
we took that the data that would
captured you know from all his
expressions put it on the digital
version of him and then looked at them
side-by-side that they would look the
same so that you know we were really
figuring out the difficult problems by
having a perfect reference and then
because the Hulk had elements of mark
incorporated into his design which I
think was a really great decision for
this film we were able to take a lot of
that same work and kind of apply it to
the hall sometimes I feel like you may
ccg character's name will kind of like
pop out from the environment they won't
kind of blend in and he is seamless
throughout that entire movie you know
what steps did you take to kind of make
him blend in like that says it seemed a
step above the stuff I've seen recently
because the design was based on him he
did a performance for every shot he
actually came up here and put on the
helmet cam and put on the you know
ridiculous-looking try
suit and went through the entire process
and Joss could direct him and you know
very quickly work through you know what
the shot was make some selects off that
then we track all of that data apply it
first to our mark ruffalo digital double
again make sure that we had that as a
good match and then apply it through
retargeting process to the Hulk because
the Hulk is such different proportions
from Mark Ruffalo there's a lot of work
in terms of you know taking his
performance and then the animators
really crafting it into you know what
you see on the screen and a lot of hand
on you know work in terms of putting
that together what I think then helped
us really blend it into the plate was
when we were on set mark was there for
every Hulk shot and so we were able to
render the Hulk and stack them up side
by side with the mark ruffalo there and
you know something that we kind of
learned on Davy Jones from parts of the
Caribbean is you have the real actor
there even if you're not using any part
of them just to have the reference of
what do you know marks eyes look like in
this shot in this lighting in this
environment and then making sure that
our Hulk matches that because a lot of
times we would we put our same or
digital character in there we'd render
it and you know like hey this looks
great and then we'd start comparing it
like whoa there's a lot that's off that
we need to go fix even down to just the
angle of the eyelashes could make a big
difference in terms of your perception
of the character and that kind of match
so you know I think especially for the
things where cg tends to be a big
struggle like around the eyes where
you're trying to put some thought and
some emotion into the eyes being able to
have that reference performance and was
really valuable know what are some other
areas that are traditionally a struggle
when you're trying to go and put a
character together like that well I
think you know for the Hulk he's he's a
human and yet he's not only giant sized
but he's got green skin and you know we
sort of joked around all the time that
green is a really difficult color humans
are very sensitive to green and
differences in that color and he's in so
many different environments he's down on
the Park Avenue viaduct and he's jumping
up you know stark tower to the you know
outside
and you know the the blue sky or the the
building shadows would all change his
green color to sort of bad looking
colors we had minty Hulk and we had
pumpkin Hulk and so we worked very
closely with Marvel in terms of trying
to make sure that his color was
consistent throughout and that we also
early on in the process Joss decided
that the green really wanted to be a
pretty deece a chewy at green and I
think that helped us a lot in terms of
making him look real because it's it's
very similar in saturation to kind of a
natural flesh tone so you know rather
than something that kind of pops off the
screen he integrates really nicely with
the other Avengers that are there well
so Joss Whedon directing the avengers
not something that had done a huge big
budget film like that before what was
that experience like I you know I was
really excited to get a chance to work
with him on this project and had been
such a huge fan of his coming into it
and it was it was really fantastic I
think you know all the humor and that
you see in the writing and that you see
on the screen is what it's like working
with him you know every day and you know
he's pretty amazing at pulling out
references to movies and artists that
we'd be scrambling to go you know look
up to see what he's talking about but it
was it was a really phenomenal
experience and I think the great thing
that he brought to it was making sure
that in the end the visual effects
always serve the story that he was
creating you know I think people really
connect with these characters and then
you know our job was to just make sure
everything look good one of the really
fun parts about working with him is that
because he's such a fan of comic books
to begin with he knew what people want
to see the Hulk do and so he gave us
those moments another effects supervisor
influenced by Star Wars was Grady Cofer
we talked to Grady about has work on the
film battleship and paul thomas
anderson's there will be blood so we got
a call that there were there were a few
shots on there will be blood that kind
of sat in the middle of his movie and
that was kind of the big country know
whenever they strike oil in the middle
of it and there's the big kind of the
big geyser of oil and there were lots of
ways to kind of tackle that kind of shot
now for for Paul who's
definitely a purist and and it really
honors kind of the craft of filmmaking
and likes the purity of the frame and
all of that because I could have done
this is a little early I could have done
like a big CG simulation had done all of
that and for that show that didn't
really seem like kind of the right
solution we kind of it was something
actually a special effects form it was
great had a pretty good looking kind of
representation of oil and we did a big
kind of we shot it as kind of a
miniature we we actually sprayed oil up
in the air down in LA and filmed all of
these elements and it became kind of a
large kind of comp of those kind of
elements and it worked really well and
it was all very real it meant a lot of
the lot of the cameraman Ghana got
covered with this kind of fake oil but
you know it worked out in the end you
had the supervisor on battleship you
guys have a long history of great sci-fi
movie special effects when you're taking
something on like that you know was it
daunting and you know and what is the
process and some pretty good innovations
you guys brought to the table with
battleship it was daunting and you know
a lot of that were I mean there was a
lot of big ideas and this and that's
kind of what you want you know when you
can when you find a director who and
Pete is definitely an idea guy it's like
he it's kind of non-stop he'll show up
in the morning and go I've got it you
know get my previous guys out here he'll
throw out some all these these
interesting things and you go down all
these different kind of creative
journeys and and like ideas and stuff
but when he pitched it it wasn't just
kind of naval warfare it was naval
warfare meets sci-fi alien invasion you
know on a grand scale on a summer
blockbuster scale and and he wanted he
wanted spectacle it's like he you know
he wasn't shying away from it you know
he was he's like I'm here I'm making a
big you know mega summer movie and the
way he described it was that these alien
and this alien invasion they landed
these ships called stingers which are if
you look at kind of their their
silhouette they're kind of based on like
these water bugs right so they kind of
hover or kind of a walk along the
surface or float along the surface of
the ocean but he wanted them to start
kind of submerged so in their reveal in
this kind of a big part
the movie they all kind of breach up
through the water then they splash back
down that's already pretty hard right we
know that that's that's a kind of a
large-scale fluid simulation and that
was going to be something we're going to
wrap our heads around but as the the
project we were in we were you know and
in pre-production he said okay not only
do they breach and they sit on the
surface of the water but I want them you
know I want all of these tubes and stuff
underneath them and they they kind of
suck water up out of them and then
recycle it over them constantly like
there's constant waterfalls you know and
you know of course you nod you're like
okay that sounds great very interesting
and we so we we kind of knew at that
point that an island has actually great
you know history of water show
specifically they've done some really
really groundbreaking stuff but
maintaining that over the course of this
entire show for a lot of it in broad
daylight and in very very wide kind of
spectacle shots we knew we were going to
have to raise our game and and it was
you know it was pretty amazing here at
ILM because they you know they have a
really really strong R&amp;amp;D department and
so you get all these guys together in a
room and they came up with a call it the
battleship water project and pretty much
over the course of columns two year they
re engineered how we tackle kind of
large-scale fluid simulations at ILM and
and then how we render it you know
render it for all you know we wanted to
kind of represent water kind of through
the entire kind of life span of kind of
water from from from a big kind of
splashy massive water to to you know to
the little speedy kind of particulate
that comes off of that to the little
mist that comes off of that and all of
it we wanted to be influenced by
airfields and simulated kind of movement
of vortices in the air was a huge huge
project but the end of the day it really
enhanced kind of did your experience of
these stingers became a part of their
personality you know Pete's mandate from
the beginning on this film was authentic
right everything had to be very
authentic and we were scouting the
Missouri one day down in Pearl Harbor
and there was kind of kind of
when throughout the day that people
wanted to have a bit of an effects
meeting dockside at the end of the day
so I met him and so we're kind of
sitting there and there's this like you
know wall to wall there's the Missouri
kind of beautiful and majestic kind of
filling the horizon and he said all
right that I get that's real you know I
feel that that ship your work has to
look just as good as that I have to
believe your work and it was I mean it
was a challenge you know that's your
pressure that's not right yeah but you
know but it was great and it actually
it's set kind of a high lofty goal for
us and that's it's kind of what you want
you know you want to aim high well Grady
thank you so much for spending some time
with us it's been a real treat is to get
inside of what you do every day and the
facility and yeah thanks for checking in
soon yeah awesome thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
