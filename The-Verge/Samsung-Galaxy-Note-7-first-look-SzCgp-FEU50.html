i've got the brand new samsung galaxy
note 7 the note 7 is a blend of last
year's galaxy note 5 and this year's
galaxy s7 edge it features a 5.7 inch
quad HD Super AMOLED display but it's
got a dual curved sides now which is a
new for the note line much like the s7
edge you can see that curve on the both
sides of the screen as well as on the
back the back has the same type of curve
as the front which makes it very
comfortable to hold it also makes a
phone 2 millimetres narrower than last
year's model even though it still has
the same size screen so it's a more
comfortable device to hold the glass on
the front and the back or Gorilla Glass
5 inside the phone is very similar to
the s7 series there's a Snapdragon 820
processor four gigabytes of RAM the note
7 comes with 64 gigs of storage microSD
expansion the camera systems are the
same so 5 megapixels on the front 12
megapixels on the back with app 1.7
aperture lenses optical stabilization 4k
video pretty much the same camera
experience across the board note 7 is
also ip68 water-resistant just like the
s7 series the what there are does of
course have unique hardware features the
first major one is the iris scanner
which is new to the to the note line
which allows you to unlock the phone
with your iris or secure content in a
secure area on the phone which you can
unlock with your iris of course you also
have the fingerprint scanner option as
well they can be used interchangeably to
unlock your phone or access the secured
content and since it is a note of course
it also has an S Pen the S pen's been
improved this year it's got a finer
point it's a little bit more precise
writing as well as twice as much
sensitivity so over 4000 levels of
pressure sensitivity which you can
notice when you're doing writing and
drawing and other functions with the pen
there's a couple new software features
that are really cool there's a bility to
magnify the screen using the pen so you
can zoom in a little bit in addition to
magnify there's a translate option so
you can translate text from a few dozen
languages and then what's really cool is
the new ability to make gifts from any
video source so if you are watching a
video in youtube or video that you've
captured you can instantly create a gift
from it using the smart select tool
press record you can choose how long can
be up to 15 seconds and you pretty much
created a gift that you can share right
away you can also annotate it you can
add stickers you can draw on it add text
etc and kind of style it up however
you'd like so it's a really neat neat
feature that's available on the note 7
one last S pen's feature that is new for
the note 7 is the improvements to the
always-on display and screen off memo so
the note 5 you could draw notes on the
screen when it was off now you can pin
those notes so that they are always
available in the always-on display mode
it's kind of a combination of the screen
off memo and always-on display from the
s 7 series and you can hide your notes
or expand them or you can trash it right
there other upgrades from last year the
note 7 is launching with Android 6.0
it's got a slightly redesigned interface
every year Samsung kind of tweaks its
interface makes it a little bit better
to look at and this is no different the
colors are more pleasant kind of a
lighter theme Samsung's also upgraded
the battery the battery inside is thirty
five hundred million powers it's a five
hundred million powers bigger than the
note 5s and the charging is now done
over USB C as opposed to microUSB still
includes fast wireless charging as well
as fast charging Samsung is going to be
launching the note 7 on August 19th
across the world pre-orders in the US
will start tomorrow August 3rd you'll be
able to get it from all four carriers so
be available in three colors in the US a
black a silver and then this new coral
color which is kind of like a unique
blue we'll have a lot more to say on the
note 7 once we spend some more time with
it and have a review unit so be sure to
check out the verge comm and youtube.com
slash the verge the big thing that
they've added this year is improvements
to the s-pen the s-pen is kind of the
defining I'm going to try that again the
software on the note sock seating
software on the note 7 is based on
Android 6.0 ma ma</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
