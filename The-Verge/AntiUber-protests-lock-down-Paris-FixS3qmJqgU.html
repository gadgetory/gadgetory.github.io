violence and blocking roads in protest
of uber one of the writers from the
verge on our tour actually loses in
Paris and he's gonna tell us what's
going on yeah well actually it's a
strike organized by a bunch of French
taxi unions so taxi drivers who are
upset primarily over the fact that over
Ober pop which is ubers like low cost
service and this has been something
that's been kind of brewing for a long
time
so there was a law passed in December of
last year like that basically said that
all chauffeurs including taxi drivers
and also kind of private car services
have to adhere to these rules and
regulations which on the face of it
makes it seem like uber should have to
apply to that as well and uber pop
technically still is illegal but is
allowed to exist because uber kind of
appealed the ruling so they maintained
their a technology company and not a car
service or transportation company so
therefore they shouldn't have to adhere
to these rules it's been kind of this
gray legal space for a long time and it
everything kind of boiled over today and
the taxi drivers are primarily upset
because because we were pop employees
kind of amateur drivers or
non-professional non licensed drivers
they don't have to pay a lot of the
licensing fees that typical taxi drivers
have to pay which can be up to like you
know nearly $300,000 for the moment
there's no end in sight this seems like
the government is trying to appease
things and/or appease the taxis by this
call to ban uber pop which seems to me
like they're hoping that that'll bring
things to an end but when they announced
this strike normally they announce
strikes you know for trains or airport
or for airport or things like that
they'll give like a definite timeframe
but they didn't do that in this place
like they said like it's unlimited which
is you know have not a very good sign
for anybody looking to travel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
