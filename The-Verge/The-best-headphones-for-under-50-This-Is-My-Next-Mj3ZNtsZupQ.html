bestfriend
they're nearly as ubiquitous as
smartphones themselves and they let you
listen to music games or video and make
and receive hands-free calls without
disturbing those around you
many smartphones including the iPhone
come with a basic set of headphones that
have a microphone and remote on their
cords but most included headphones like
Apple's ear pods kind of suck with a
poor fit mediocre sound and a cable that
turns into knots right in your pocket
you can spend hundreds of dollars on
getting great headphones to go with your
new smartphone but if you just want
something better than came with a phone
and don't want to spend a fortune
there are countless options available
for under fifty bucks a good replacement
headphone offers three things great
sound great fit and a microphone so you
can still make phone calls some offer
volume controls but that's not as common
in this price range and the
compatibility with volume controls
varies from smartphone a smartphone and
they should be cheap and easily
replaceable so it's not a problem if you
lose them send them through the washing
machine or just wear them out over the
course of a year or two if you're
looking to replace your ear pods or
other bundled headphones the best
overall option are Panasonic's TCM 125
these basic black headphones are super
lightweight comfortable to wear for
extended periods of time and most
importantly sound fantastic they include
a microphone and remote for play and
pause controls but unfortunately no
volume and they come with three
different size tips to fit a variety of
years
the Panasonic stayed put in my ears
whether I was swiftly moving to catch
the next subway train or flapping my
John a long conference call Panasonic's
also have a balanced sound profile for a
variety of music and audio sources they
sound great for pop rock metal classical
hip-hop podcasts and more it sounds so
good that I often forgot I was wearing
inexpensive headphones and not more
high-end models and the best part about
the TCM 125 is just how cheap they
actually are you can easily find these
for about half the cost of Apple's $29
ear pods it's not a big deal if you lose
or break these you just buy another pair
the one area where the TCM 125 don't
blow away the competition is with heavy
bass response if you want more bass in
your headphones the sony MDR xp-50 are
the ones you should get they're a bit
more expensive than our top deck but
they offer a lot more bass response in
the Panasonic's the downside is they
don't sound as good overall and aren't
as versatile for different types of
music they're also a bit heavier and
larger than the Panasonic's but they're
still comfortable and fit my ears well
didn't really fall out Sony's also have
a nice cord that resists turning into a
ball of knots in my pocket there are
many other options across the field but
none of them really fit as well or
sounded as good as our top techs the
Yurbuds inspire 400 are sweat proof and
designed for wear during a workout they
do a really good job of staying in your
ears while moving they also have a
remote with volume control that works
with the iPhone but they just weren't as
comfortable or as good sounding it's
Panasonic's similarly the urban ears
krantz and are packed with nifty design
features like the ability to lock the
ear buds together for storage a fabric
covered cord and a built-in cable ties
so you don't have to worry about knots
they do a good job of staying in my ears
but they don't sound as nice overall
compared to my top picks the others that
we tested all had a tendency to just
fall out of my ears whenever I moved
turned my head or just took a sip from a
water bottle
it was difficult to get many of them to
make a proper seal which leads to lower
quality sound and makes them fall out
easier the best options like the ones we
already mentioned have designs that lock
the headphones in your ear so they don't
fall out it turns out you don't have to
settle for Apple or Samsung sin fear
your headphones almost every option we
tested we're better than the headphones
that come with your smartphone if you
just want the best overall headphones
without spending more than 50 bucks you
should get the Panasonic TCM 125</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
