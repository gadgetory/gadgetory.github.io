certainly what the company is going to
announce at its big press event this
Wednesday if the months the years really
of rumors are true here's what we can
expect much like its Kindle Fire tablets
the Amazon smartphone is expected to run
a forked version of Android Amazon even
has its own App Store which it says now
has more than 240,000 apps and games and
rumors have long pointed to some sort of
glasses-free 3d user interface
supposedly the phone's interface will
move as the user tilts their head around
and may even display more information
about something when the phone is tilted
in fact Amazon's teaser video all but
confirms that with various scenes of
head wobbling no one's quite sure how
the 3d technology will work or what
it'll look like on the phone but leaves
photos suggest the device will track
your head using upwards of four
front-facing cameras as far as specs go
BGR which also posted the leaked
pictures says it has a 4.7 inch 720p
display and a Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor that would put it right in
line with last year's Moto X which is a
decidedly mid-tier phone of course the
3d might end up being nothing more than
just a novelty where Amazon can really
stand out is on cost Amazon's always
priced its devices aggressively forgoing
profits on the hardware in exchange for
more people using Amazon services it
already uses advertising to offset the
cost of its Kindle lineup and is
experimented with interest-free payment
plans for its Kindle Fire tablets the
Kindle Fire is nothing if not a portal
to Amazon storefront it's a way to use
its multitude of services like Prime
instant video and now streaming music
but tablets are secondary devices the
ones you use when lying around the house
or traveling with a smartphone Amazon
could own your primary device the one
that's always in your pocket and
constantly being used all of this leads
me to mr. Pines purple house Amazon sent
attendees a copy of the book ahead of
the event with a note from Jeff Bezos
who called it his favorite childhood
book it's certainly one of the weirdest
gestures we've ever seen from a tech
company in the story mr. pine had a
little white house that looked exactly
like the other 50 white houses on the
street so mr. pine paints his house
purple and while it inspires every other
homeowner to paint their house different
colors nobody else chooses purple
so what's Amazon trying to say here that
it's found a way to stand out from the
competition that people will try to copy
them but won't be the same maybe this
whole event is just gonna be a live
reading of mr. pines purple house well
members of the press actually paint Jeff
Bezos house
either way we wouldn't miss it it's
gonna be something
