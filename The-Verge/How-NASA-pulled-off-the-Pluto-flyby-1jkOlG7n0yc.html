there were lots of first missions to new
places to be a part of to be first to
Mars and Venus and Jupiter and Saturn
and all that and by the time I got a
graduate school but it was really the
only one left even though the missions
that I've worked on otherwise are great
science it was just irresistible to get
on what we used to call the first
mission to the last planet this is Alan
Stern the project leader of the New
Horizons mission which flew by Pluto on
July 14th 2015 it marked the first time
a vehicle ever visited the dwarf planet
and nearly a year later the mission is
still giving us crazy amounts of detail
about the timing world at the edge of
our solar system what had we known about
Pluto before the mission even got
started I mean what was the extent of
our knowledge well we knew some really
interesting things but for example we
knew that Pluto is really a binary
planet with a moon half its own size and
that there's nothing else like it we'd
had seen anywhere else in the solar
system that that system probably formed
like the Earth Moon through a giant
impact which again was super interesting
because there's not another analogue for
the formation of the Earth Moon system
except way out there Pluto Pluto is
located in a region of the solar system
called the Kuiper belt it's a big cloud
at the edge of our galactic neighborhood
filled with tiny icy bodies ranging from
the size of Manhattan to the size of
whole countries scientists used to think
Pluto was the only tiny world orbiting
beyond Neptune when it was first
discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh but
in the 1990s researchers started finding
more objects and even more dwarf planets
in this Kuiper belt region it became
obvious to planetary scientists even the
whole National Academy that there was
this third class of planet in the Solar
System and that Pluto was the harbinger
of that because of Pluto's potential as
a destination a planetary survey in the
early 2000s listed the dwarf planet as
the number one priority for space
exploration among those in the
scientific community the report helped
to secure funding for the New Horizons
mission which launched in January 2006
New Horizons was launched on a very very
large expendable launch B of
2006 called an Atlas 5 in fact we bought
the most souped-up tricked-out version
of it you can get with every add-on
every rocket lightweight nosecone
everything it ended up being the fastest
spacecraft ever launched we flew it to
Jupiter first where Jupiter's gravity
gave it a slingshot to make it go even
faster so that we could cross the entire
solar system in nine years
New Horizons stayed in hibernation mode
throughout most of its journey to Pluto
with its last hibernation ending on
December 6th 2014 just one month before
the spacecraft entered its approach
phase in January that's when things
started to get exciting and a bit scary
we had to fly through one little window
in space there's only 60 by a hundred
miles across and you could not arrive
more than 9 minutes earlier 9 minutes
late after a nine year journey somebody
did the math and said that aim is
equivalent to hitting a golf ball from
LA to New York and landing in a soup can
in Manhattan so we were taking images of
Pluto on approach against the star
fields and shipping them back to Earth
by radio and having teams analyze those
to see how far we were of course and to
compute engine burn corrections which we
did a series of to home in and we flew
right through that little soup can
window as New Horizons got closer and
closer to Pluto photos taken by the
spacecraft showed the dwarf planet in
clear detail the images revealed the
diverse shading and geography of Pluto
as well as the presence of a large
heart-shaped region on its surface
finally after six months of approaching
and one terrifying software glitch it
was time for New Horizons to execute its
primary mission the right word just to
say it was emotional um we had put so
many years and so much of our our lives
into that and and as much as you
practice with Brown simulations or with
software simulations as much as we
tested it on the ground and then it came
down to just one day and at the same
time most of us were pretty exhausted
we've been working seven days a week in
very long days for many weeks on
approach because in addition to they can
care of the spacecraft and look in
every rock there was also new data
landing all the time and the press was
interested in hearing about it so we had
to quickly analyze it the day of the
flyby consisted of two big moments there
was the time of the actual flyby which
occurred at around 7:50 a.m. Eastern
time that morning and then it was the
time when the scientists got word back
from New Horizons confirming that the
flyby actually happened that signal
didn't come until after 9 p.m. there are
always unknown unknowns in the new
horizons was traveling so fast that if
we'd want to run into just one little
rock pellet in orbit around Pluto the
size of a rice grain it'd be game over
and we'd never hear from it again so in
the morning we all knew the spacecraft
had gone by but because the spacecraft
was busy taking data while it was there
it wasn't talking to us until many hours
later and then the signal from the
spacecraft took almost five hours to get
back to the earth so we knew down to the
minute when the moment of truth would
come and we were ready for it and when
New Horizons checked in and all the
signals were green it was bedlam it was
awesome during the flyby New Horizons
took over 450 different observations of
the Pluto system the spacecraft has a
big memory bank for storing this data
but a less powerful communication system
for sending it all back to earth we took
a lot of data but we're sending it back
at slow speeds so it takes more than a
year for it all to get shipped back to
earth and even here as we do this
interview
we've still got months to go and there
are a lot of goodies up there and no one
knows what discoveries are in it every
week new data lands and and we open
those packages and see what's inside and
it's been there's never been a mission
really like that and the data so far has
shown Pluto to be something of an
anomaly normally smaller and smaller
worlds have less and less going on and
that's the norm when you look at for
example the moons of Saturn and Uranus
and Neptune the bigger ones are a lot
more interesting the smaller ones that
bigger planets tend to be more active
than the smaller ones and then we get
the Pluto and we found well there's the
exception to the rule it's just every
bit as complicated as the earth or Mars
and on top of it the thing is active it
should have cooled off by now it's four
billion years on and it's just roaring
with geologic activity and atmospheric
activity given how much we've learned
from new horizons Stern says we need to
make even more spacecraft just like it
it would be super if we could build a
next generation set of missions like New
Horizons three or four more and fly them
to other small planets and sample the
diversity of that crazy part of the
solar system we spent dozens of missions
going to Mars and Venus and even
Jupiter's up around ten missions now
this is the biggest zone in the solar
system the most populous zone in the
solar system it's where most of the
planets lie there have this really
strange type that Pluto is and I think
they easily deserve several more
exploration missions and for the first
time in the multi million year history
of our species we're kind of stepping
out of the cradle right here at the
beginning of the 21st century and going
out to explore the universe this is
where Star Trek begins it's awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
