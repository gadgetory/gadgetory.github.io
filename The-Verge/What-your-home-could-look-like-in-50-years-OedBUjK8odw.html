home of the future here in Austin Texas
go from pieces in a factory to a
beautifully designed house packed with
the latest connective technology with a
thing about aiming for the future is
that it's a constantly moving target
technology and design evolve at a rapid
pace and the last thing you'd want is
for your home of the future to feel like
it's living in the past what clues can
we take from the home of today to help
us determine what we need in the home of
tomorrow I tried to collect every image
that existed of a home of the future and
I started in the 1920s this is Michelle
Addington
Dean of the University of Texas at
Austin School of Architecture even as
certain styles might have changed
they're all the same always the first
part of the home of the future is
automating the door one in the 1960s
involve a camera system as we approached
our arrival could be observed by an
automatic closed-circuit television
system which would notify our hosts this
special hosted by Walter Cronkite in
1967 took a look at the home of 2001
like our home today
it featured surround sound speakers a
console to control the entertainment
center and a monitor for surveillance
cameras today we're living all those
dreams but it's still a home of the
future and not a home of the present why
after 50 years are we still thinking
about our home this way what's stopping
us from making more radical shifts in
what we think of as a home still four
walls and endure it that's the part that
is familiar to us that's the part we
keep you know a lot of it has to do with
risk you know for many people this is
their life savings it's the single most
expensive thing you'll ever buy as an
individual absolutely
and so it can tolerate much less risk
than you can and many other things as
we've seen so many other areas
technologies have rapidly evolved
throughout the 20th century and yet in
the case of the smart home we're looking
for ways to implement the latest
technologies but to do the things that
we've always done so what if we allow
ourselves to rethink what we assume a
house needs to be what kind of
improvements could we make if we discard
basic assumptions of what a house should
do right now we have heating ventilation
and air conditioning systems so all of
our bodies are surrounded in this
blanket of homogeneous conditions that
are contained by the envelope of the
house it's a clumsy way it's an
expensive way and it's an incredibly
energy intensive way and interesting up
not a particularly effective way of
dealing with how the body exchanges heat
so everything that we're doing all
around here wasted wasted assuming we
could successfully utilize a system to
heat or cool our bodies in a more
efficient envelope it would obviously
reduce the energy demand on our home
drastically and it could even shift how
we think of those four walls in a roof
but I've got to be honest it's a hard
thing to see happening to think about a
future without a cooling system for that
as thermally inefficient as it may be
for our personal bodies it seems
difficult to accept so this is why kind
of have to step back and sort of
reimagine what that's environment is
going to be and that's partly why
imagining the far future of home design
is difficult our cultural and physical
environments tend to change slowly with
time
while architectural trends are evolving
from tiny homes to communal housing it's
rare to see mass adoption even our homes
modular design is far from becoming
mainstream modulars been around for
decades but still isn't overtaking the
market its most economical at scale and
the pipeline just isn't large enough to
reduce costs around factories and
shipping but within our basic framework
of four walls and a roof what are some
areas that could change radically in the
next few decades let's turn to our
kitchen now one thing that you can't
miss in our home of the future is this a
smart fridge first of all it's got a
giant LED screen you can draw on it find
the absolute worst way to surf the
Internet this is absolutely a crime and
you can make it transparent so you can
see inside without having to open the
door let's say you're at the market and
you can't remember what you're out of
you can call up the smart fridge on an
app turn on the internal cameras and see
what you're missing and oh yeah there's
a Bluetooth speaker for reasons this is
all fun to play with for now but bear
this in mind the average refrigerator
lasts about 15 years 15 years ago this
what's the most popular cell phone so
when we try and consider what appliances
will last with us into the next home in
the future I'm not sure if the smart
fridge checks all the boxes but this is
only version one when I think about tech
that changed my life I think about
matters I used to have a map for every
region I was in and would draw the path
before I set out then there was the age
of printing customized directions on
MapQuest and now smartphone GPS I didn't
even know it was a problem until
technology gave me a much better
solution and after that there was no
going back is there anything like that
that you
see a problem that we didn't even know
that we had that the smart home can
solve for us I think particularly around
the issue of food one of the reasons
that people are not making the best food
choices today especially families with
children is because of the
impracticality of making sure that you
have healthy food at all times this is
an voicing a futurist who runs a
strategic consulting business here in
Texas I think that for families the
convenient choice is not always the
healthiest choice so potentially a home
of the future could help you get closer
to having those two things be in line
yes and then we're not wanting to go
back after that the way we eat has
actually always played a role in
imagining what the home of the future
will be typically revolving around speed
and convenience like the instant pizza
and back to the future part two and
remember that Cronkite piece this new
play normally cooks in 40 minutes with
microwave that's ready in 90 seconds ah
the miracles of the microwave the
quickness and convenience also usually
means less healthy unless in the home of
the future it doesn't have to now I see
these solutions to these problems
particularly in two areas one is the
ability to order staples and foods that
were using all the time so for example
instead of you having to know oh I'm
running out of milk you have a scanner
in your refrigerator that's running out
oh you're running low on let's go ahead
and just you know order and then you
might even do do some of the agriculture
yourself in your home grow your own food
in in your home of the future
yes growing your own food either in your
own home or if you live in some sort of
high-tech community garden or home
garden which is hydroponic which is
using computer physician to find out
exactly how much it should be water what
type of nutrients down to the fine tune
very high resolution level and that way
you can have much more control over
the food that you were using and
consuming on a daily basis and save you
a lot of time at the same time and if
you link these two ideas you've got your
high tech community garden delivering
the best quality food to you when you
need it it's a great dream and who knows
maybe 50 years from now it could be a
reality to be honest it's hard to even
build today's home of the future let
alone tomorrow's our house was built
specifically with that mission in mind
to be the home in the future and in a
lot of ways it is our brain pulls all of
our devices into one control system even
giving us a live readout of our power
usage our solar panels are built into
our carport
and we even have an entire audio system
hidden in the backyard landscaping
there's still a ton more we would have
wanted to add to this house but with
delays in our timeline zoning
limitations and budget overages on site
actually building a house still requires
compromises and while some technology
like our smart fridge may not seem
particularly future-proof you can see
how they are building blocks for
something more ambitious down the line
historically tech and design takes time
to be perfected and once they are
we're already hard at work imagining the
next steps they can take but at least
for now I'm just gonna enjoy the time I
have in my home in the present
thanks so much for following along in
our home of the future series

future let us know in the comments below
