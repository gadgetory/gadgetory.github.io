that's the tin here is the iPhone tennis
now there's gonna be a lot of that in
this video but just go with me I think
it's to make this review better so this
is a weird year for iPhones usually
Apple puts out the new iPhone in
September it drops the price the old
model and keep selling it for a few more
years this year Apple dint to any of
them the iPhone 10 which came out last
year in a flurry of hype is gone instead
there's the iPhone 10s and the new
mid-range iPhone 10 are Apple really
wants I phone tend to be its new brand
of phones the letters s are are telling
the models part but let's be honest
these are horrible names especially
iPhone 10s Mac's which looks ridiculous
no matter how you write it and to be
perfectly honest steals name of my child
for which I will never forgive Apple
anyway if you're shopping for a phone
this year that means you have to Apple
phones so that not just one we don't
have a 10 R yet but we'll review it when
it comes out and about a month so the
iPhone 10s it comes in two sizes the
five-point eight inch regular size the
news 6.8 inch 10 s max the two phones
are identical apart from the size the
same a 12 Bionic processor same cameras
same basic design same OLED display tech
with 458 pixels per inch the max also
has a larger battery but I think the
only real reason you should get the max
is if you really really want a big
screen and that's really main question I
got how big is the max is it too big is
it worth it and I think the answer is
that it's both bigger and smaller than
you expect it's gonna be wrong it's big
as big as the iPhone 8 plus and the
pixel - from the back it shares the same
surfboard quality as Apple's previous
plus size phones for the front is a
totally different story because the edge
to edge screen fills the entire front of
the phone it doesn't seem as huge as the
plus phones and when watching a video
it's killer a huge gorgeous display it's
great but the max of size also gets away
from it the older plus iPhones you never
really had to reach the very top or
bottom of the phone because of those
huge bezels but to pull down
notifications or Control Center on the
max you have to reach the very top of
the device
I've big hands and I basically can't do
it I end up having to use two hands
every time you can use apples reach
ability feature to pull down the UI and
then swipe but that's two swipes for one
thing and it just kind of makes me sad
the max also doesn't really do anything
in software to take advantage of that
big display no there's not an extra row
of icons no you can't watch video and
picture-in-picture apps have to be
updated for new display Instagram just
looks broken right now and apps like
slack and Gmail and Twitter show you the
exact same amount of information just
bigger in fact everything is mostly just
bigger check out how huge the status bar
is in control center it's huge so yes if
you want a really big screen get a max
it's a beautiful display and I've
enjoyed looking at it a lot nothing
about it is easier to handle than the
old plus phones and in some cases it's
harder in every other way the max is
identical to the 10s which is almost
identical to the 10 from the outside you
would never know the difference except
that you can get the 10s in this
interesting gold color which has cool
coppery iridescent effects in the light
here's our only to go with me the iPhone
10 introduced so much new stuff into the
phone world that reviewing the 10s gives
us the chance to check in on it a year
later since so much of it is the same
take the display the 10s has the same
OLED display is the 10 with curved
corners and the knotch it's still one of
the best displays out there with
excellent color reproduction brightness
and touch response last year we were
wondering how Apple would handle burnin
on this display and this year we know
there are basically no problems with
burnin on the iPhone 10 display and I'd
expect the 10s to keep it up it's also
been a full year of this physical design
and well it's beautiful I can tell you
the iPhone 10 scratches way more easily
than you'd expect Apple says the front
and back glass on more durable this year
so we'll see I can also tell you that
getting rid of the home button and
moving the screenshot feature to wake
plus volume up means I've taken 10,000
accidental screenshots
Apple please change this to wait plus
power down so they're not directly
across from each other or have the knurl
engine detect that it's 7:00 a.m. and
I've accidentally taken another photo of
my lockscreen just do something I'm
begging you it's also been a full year
since Apple introduced face ID and
know that it works pretty well most of
the time face ID on the 10s is ever so
slightly faster than the 10 it's
noticeable side-by-side but it's really
just an extra beat it still won't work
with glasses that block IR light and it
doesn't work in landscape or upside down
or anything like that you still have to
adapt to it instead of it adapting to
you but overall for most people I think
it's easier to turn on face ID and
forget about it than it is touch ID and
that is a very good thing so what's
really new here you're basically looking
at two things the camera and the
processor let's start with the processor
since that's pretty simple last year
there is the a11 Bionic and this year
there's the a12 way on it pure cpu
performance wise the a12 isn't really
that much faster Apple only quotes a 15%
performance improvement and I don't see
a noticeable speed-up over my iPhone 10
the GPU is 50 percent faster but as
usual that feels like Headroom for the
future since these devices tend to stick
around for so long
last year's a11 GPA was 30% faster than
the a10 and thought like we're maxing
that out after a year the big change the
a12 is really the vastly bigger neural
engine which accelerates machine
learning there's more and more apps rely
on machine learning that's gonna be a
huge deal but right now you're looking
at a bunch of AR demos and some new
camera features speaking of those new
camera features the camera upgrades on
the 10s over the 10 are significant but
I'm just gonna come out and say it I
don't think the iPhone 10s has a better
camera than the pixel 2 and the pixel 3
comes out in just a few weeks it's not
gonna be wrong it's a really good camera
and I think people are gonna like the
photos it takes but the pixel 2 is the
standard to beat and the iPhone 10s
doesn't really do it for me let's dig in
the iPhone 10s has three cameras two in
the back and one in the front that front
camera is the same as the iPhone 10 a 7
megapixel sensor with an f2 points you
lens of the two rear cameras the
telephoto camera is the same as the
iPhone 10 it's an optically stabilized F
2.4 lens with the same 12 megapixel
sensor is last year but the wide-angle
that you'll use most often has been
seriously updated it's still an F 1.8
lens with a 12 megapixel sensor but each
of those 12 megapixels is physically
bigger now which means they can collect
more light
there's also twice as many focus pixels
which is what Apple calls at autofocus
system the cameras and sensors work in
tandem with a new a12 processor its
integrated image processor and the knurl
engine in a new system Apple calls smart
HDR the iPhone 10 also did HDR but with
the 10s the effect is way more obvious
it works similarly to what Google does
on the pixel - it takes a series of
images at different exposures and
combines them like the pixel to the
iPhone 10s starts a rolling buffer of
four images the second you open the
camera app which allows your zero
shutter lag the image has already been
captured the second you push the shutter
button but unlike the pixel two which
combines several underexposed frames the
iPhone 10s also captures an overexposed
image for each shot in the buffer which
picks up additional details and the
shadows of your image then it looks at
all of the other frames in the buffer to
see if they can add additional detail
merging at least three images together
to generate the final picture that you
see but side-by-side with a pixel to the
iPhone 10s still doesn't quite hold up
you can see it pretty clearly in this
photo when you zoom in the iPhone
aggressively smoothes images the whole
thing is just way softer this loss of
detail is the thing that bothered me the
most about the iPhone 10 camera and
while the iPhone 10 S is better the
smoothing still disappoints me every
time I see it
Apple used to talk a big game about
having a more accurate camera than
Samsung which has done these aggressive
smoothing tricks for years but I think
those days are over
Apple knows that most of these images
will only ever be viewed on mobile
displays and it feels like it's really
starting to compete with Samsung's
tricks because it knows that no one's
really looking that closely loss of
detail is one thing but there are some
subjective things I prefer about the
pixel - as well the 10s shoots really
warm photos while the pixel is more true
to life if a little muddy or in the reds
pixel - photos are also extremely
contrasting and evocative which I like
but some people find harsh I can't tell
you what style of images to prefer but I
can tell you that these cameras are very
different and I can also definitely tell
you that you want more detail in your
images
not less the other big new feature on
the iPhone 10's camera is a new portrait
mode which lets you adjust the blur
after you take the shot
samsung's phones will let you do this
for a while now but I think the iPhone
looks a lot better because the phone is
doing a lot more work when you pick up
an iPhone 10s and shoot a portrait mode
photo a number of things happen first
the phone is facial recognition and
splits apart the foreground from the
background then it creates a depth map
of the entire scene particularly the
subject in the foreground then it
progressively applies blur from
foreground to background simulating how
a real lens on a full-frame camera would
smoothly transition from front to back I
think it's nicer than phones with a
pixel and s9 can do although it still
struggles around the edges and sometimes
it makes big mistakes like cutting these
glasses off entirely apple says it
modeled the portrait mode blur against
prime lenses on full-frame cameras which
we happen to have a lot of in our studio
and it looks really different to be
honest here's a 50ml lens on a Canon 5d
Mark 4 on the left and the iPhone 10 s
on the right the big cameras and real
lenses produce different shapes inside
the blur because of the way the physical
aperture in the lens closes the iPhone
doesn't really do that it just looks
like a pretty standard blurred of course
most people don't have full-frame
cameras and expensive lenses and
portrait mode will do a lot for all of
those people but in the past a year of
having the iPhone 10 I've shot nearly
5,000 photos and just 207 of them have
been in portrait mode I don't think this
new version is gonna make me use it much
more there's also a bunch of updates to
video recording the front camera which
I'm using right now has all these
stabilization the rear cameras of all
new software stabilization and you can
record in stereo audio which is cool so
those are the two main upgrades the
processor in the camera let's talk about
some of the little stuff first battery
life
I mostly tested the Macs and it did
great better than even apples claim of
ninety minutes more than the ten in fact
I got a full twelve hours of battery
life out of the max without using low
power mode and that's even under my
pretty heavy daily use the smaller 10s
is rated to get thirty minutes more than
the ten which has run about eight hours
for me this past year its solid second
the iPhone 10's chips running iOS twelve
I didn't dive into iOS 12 too much in
this video
because we already made another whole
video about it but here's the quick
version it's a lot like iOS 11 but a
little faster if there's momochi and
those neat screen time limits that get
you off your phone when you used it too
much and needing two taps to send photos
and the camera rollin messages is a huge
pain please please go back to the old
way how about late a big deal out of
Wide Stereo during the keynote and some
of you asked me about it so here's the
deal the iPhone 10 also had stereo
speakers but really it was just making
the earpiece speaker super loud to serve
as the other channel this year both
speakers are more evenly matched
so Apple can do more signal processing
to achieve a wide stereo field is it
super noticeable the only kind of is it
really loud and clear yes Apple's also
improved wireless charging times I'm
told the 10s will get to a full charge
around 30 minutes faster and that it's
less sensitive to placement you don't
need to get a new charging pad or
anything the internals of the iPhone 10s
are just improved that's cool yes the
iPhone 10's has 3d touch support so use
it while you still can
I guess there is gigabit LTE support
which is carry dependent so we weren't
able to test it there's that
top-of-the-line 512 gigabyte model and
there's new ip68 water and dust
resistance which is better than ip67 on
the iPhone 10 and the iPhone 10 or so
let's talk about price and whether you
should buy one first
these aren't expensive phones the 10s
starts at $9.99 in the top-of-the-line
10s Maxx with 512 gigs of storage is
1449 that's a lot of money and just like
last year some of you are gonna find
that ridiculous and others of you have
already pre-ordered for those of you
that already pre-ordered I think you're
gonna be really happy with this phone it
is indeed more iPhone it's Apple's top
of the line with everything the company
can put into it and I think it's gonna
hold up for years to come Apple's
falling behind the camera rates but not
by much and that camera is still a
significant improvement over previous
iPhones I'm sure all of you are gonna
let me know how you feel about that in
the comments for everyone who hasn't
pre-ordered I think it's worth waiting
to see how the iPhone 10 are turns out
it's got the same processor the same
main camera and a big screen for 750
dollars in fact that was the biggest
question I got is the iPhone 10s
worth the premium over the 10r and right
now I just don't know we're gonna have
to review the phone when it comes out
next month but for right now I can tell
you that the iPhone 10 s is an update to
the iPhone 10 and if you like the iPhone
10 you're gonna really like the tennis
hey so there's one big feature we were
not able to test which is dual SIM
support that won't arrive until a
software update later this fall so we'll
be on it when it comes out in the
meantime we're gonna be working on a big
camera deep dive when the pixel 3 comes
out so let us know what you want us to
test and we'll get right on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
