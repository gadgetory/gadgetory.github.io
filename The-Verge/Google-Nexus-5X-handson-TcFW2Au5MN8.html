verge and this is the all new Nexus 5x
it is the successor to the nexus 5 from
a couple of years ago and that means
that you're going to love it because
anybody like the old Nexus so here it is
in this sort of a powder blue color and
the big updates are that it has a
fingerprint sensor which google has
decided to brand as Nexus imprint it has
a 12 megapixel camera with laser auto
focus on the back and looks like a dual
flash on the front we have a 5.2 inch
screen and it is 1080p resolution
Snapdragon 808 processor in there and of
course android marshmallow so you get
some things like your recent apps up at
the top and another clever thing if
you're looking at some information in an
app you can hold down the home button
and it will launch now on tap and looks
like it doesn't know anything about
Donald Trump and you know what either
why Google is putting a lot of emphasis
on camera quality on this device and so
we can take a look here it's always
really hard to know whether a camera is
great when you first use it but we have
high hopes for this google says that the
size of the pixels in the camera sensor
are really really big so we're hoping
that will be good as well it should be
available for pre-order right now the 16
gig version costs 379 I get app a little
bit more for 32 gigs and I recommend
that you do this is the nexus 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
