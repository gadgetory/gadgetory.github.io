sixth 2013 I am dieter bohn I'm glad so
i'm dan seifert and i'm chris ziegler
and no thanks to google hangouts we are
live for really real sorry the first one
had issues if you're ready for new
features yeah we refresh the page but
like that you're not if you're watching
this you've already solved that problem
um how you guys doing are you asking via
the viewers or are you asking us or both
both why can't speak for the for the
viewers maybe you can i'm doing i'm
doing a ok i'm coming to you from
fabulous new york city new york verge
headquarters to be specific in fact i'm
sitting right now in nilai patel's
office who's on vacation I'm stinking up
the joint with very smelly foods I plan
on setting up a little hibachi in here
uh just grilling garlic a week basically
one thing I'm noticing about Neil eyes
office is that's remarkably well lit
compared to what you usually work in
well that's because there's a window
which is a future that my residents
lacks but one thing I'm noticing about
this office I wish I could show you on
the camera he has clocks everywhere and
it's a little weird yeah he has like
tons of clocks seemingly with no rhyme
or reason to the to the times displayed
on them it's a little um what sort of
looking for conceptual i get like
there's no basis in reality to the time
is being displayed here it's just it's
an hour art piece i guess so i will
never look to these clocks to know what
time it is your for running over are
they just like a couple minutes off our
they just completely random easels no
but like like one is indicating you just
need to point the camera is what you
need to do one is well i'm not gonna be
able to get it back on my face
unfortunately but um one is indicating
146 p.m. another is indicating for forty
forty or maybe so the first one you
missed in specific the second one you
mentioned is east coast
he just doesn't have them labeled yeah
the different time zones but they're
like they're not in a row on the wall
there's all over the wall it's weird
anyway Christians are very very confused
I'm very confused by this which is what
effect is wearing my jacket and tisha
together oh that's that you that that's
okay in certain circumstances yeah what
that's if you wanna what you want yeah
when you want to look like a jerk yeah
okay it's like if it's the late 90s and
you're launching a movie and all of you
it's okay it's okay in two situations
only one of which involves being Lorenzo
Lamas look I'm living in the late 90s I
may or may not be related to Lorenzo
Lamas and and I'm embracing a decade
that frankly I think was really magical
and important to all of us I really did
funny your brother llamas has ever worn
that outfit I think the fun of your part
about it is it's actually like 80
degrees in New York today so yeah well
it's perpetually cold in this office as
far as I can tell maybe it maybe Kevin
Sorbo oh there you go yeah that's
definitely a Kevin Sorbo he's a
Minnesota boy by the way just he's also
lets dude you played her please write ya
konan ya konan heard normal Hercules
that was conan no never yeah never ever
Chris coated was played by Arnold oh
you're right here kid well and then
nobody owes nobody else and then there's
I haven't watch it but there was the
reboot with what's his face from either
guy from Game of Thrones right yeah
which should have been amazing but
whatever anyway glad you're back welcome
back to the show i am lee apparently
last week was a big galaxy s4 deep dive
yeah do you have one we don't deep I do
I think and I've abandoned it already
yeah this is how fickle I am I went from
galaxy s4 I feel it for about an
a half with it setting it up get rid of
all the junk and the fluff in the
nonsense then I spent about a day using
it and being annoyed by it and order
plops and drops in all of those sound
effects I never hold of Lumia 720 which
i tolerated for two days which is
improvement of galaxy s4 and I'm back to
that phone right now so that's my little
three days of experimentation I mean
windows phone is just torture honestly
ah triaging email particularly with
multiple people in a single thread is
just like I see a thread and I think
okay I'm just gonna go to the desktop
for me to stare I just you just there's
so many annoying things about okay
Windows Phone just go to youtube app an
actual legitimate YouTube app which is
good fine because using the web
interface for YouTube was kind of sucky
but there are just too many of these
pain points with it which is annoying
because the 720 is a good night phone
yeah so there are 33 count them three
fewer pain points on windows on than
there were last week we are getting like
real genuine apps released on the
platform Microsoft has put out a real
for really real youtube app well almost
really real because it's a Microsoft
YouTube app right but but it's like an
actual app you know it's not it's not a
link to the web player and it's just
it's so crazy that it took so long for
Windows Phone to have a first-party
native YouTube app but here we are who
do you blame for that Google or
Microsoft i believe the actual blame is
on google right at least microsoft
always pointed the finger at Google
saying that they didn't have access to
the api's that they needed and I believe
that it resulted in quite a few
complaints with the EU and put a lot of
pressure on Google so here we are we
have one now so that's good I blame the
invoice for what it's worth the whole
thing yep um we have mu plus i'm tom ok
and well for you i suppose i like hulu
plus i watch me some daily show in the
hulu no good for you
I i go to watch The Daily Show and I
just get not available in your dirty
rotten territory you're too good for Jon
Stewart this is what it comes down to
nobody's too good for just do it cost
you did for us I don't know I feel like
the show's gone down well I would much
like this podcast right now um oh come
on it's hard we've also got four square
and update to Foursquare and it's also
coming pre-loaded on some devices um
would we talk about a Foursquare update
for literally any other platform right
maybe we wouldn't talk about it but it
would be news no I mean it depended on
the size of the update yeah I think it's
a redesign I mean come on Chris don't
deny your love for square I know you
love it yeah are you the mayor of some
like sandwich shop that literally opened
a half a day ago I believe it's a waffle
shop a waffle surfaces yeah don't get it
I'll get it twisted dieter there's a big
difference between a wobble Java and I
got a sandwich shop it's acceptable to
visit every day nobody's what you don't
understand they use the waffles like
like slices of bread ah and you thought
it's like it it's like a waffle taco
like you fold up the sides of the waffle
and then in the middle you have you have
like things Thanks ya like like for
instance they have like a UH they have a
peanut butter and banana waffle but
that's folded up like a taco actually
sounds amazing yeah it's literally
called a UH the shop is called waffle
fold and go because that's what you do
with the waffle you fold it and you go
no I don't they call it waffle taco
because that will talk about all first
of all would probably be trademark
infringement on actual tacos well and
also then the question would be you know
do they come in soft shell or hard shell
like would you want to crispy waffle so
you get a waffle you get waffle supreme
it's interesting you say that there
there is such a thing as a crispy top or
excuse me a crispy waffle but it's not
those ones can't be folded those are
come the asia waffles and their dirt but
they're thicker they're thicker and they
put stuff on top instead of stories are
pretty what we've learned is that what
is that Chris is the rightful mayor of
this waffle shop given his intense deep
knowledge of waffles no i would i would
say given his explanation to us
Philistines about what can I had at the
waffle he can cover whatever it's called
go shop she's not just the mayor he's
also a client president and a client
he's their chief ambassador that's right
but may it that's right a national
sigler is he is the the entire
government of waffle a stan is this this
clarified important point are they
circular these waffles before you fold
it via the folding waffles are circular
the lieges are not there square well
that's silly like you want to square one
when you folding now don't you I don't
know what taco shells around and then
yeah that's like four would you ask
where time level is considered that a
fundamental flaw with tech hose yeah I
got it we're def go if I got a square
taco I would throw it on the ground just
like the lonely island would you fold it
would you full ask or taco like point
two pointer or edge to edge and have it
be a rectangle oh that's not bad like
yeah that's like a flatbread sandwich
but would like crispy tuck right made
out of waffles this podcast is just I'm
writing it off wolf uzum mobile is ever
see something damn mobile to go just
mobile food technology I know to Nick
our producer as soon as the show's over
just believe the post just let's pretend
to show never good the good news is is
that google has released a feature where
you can start from the beginning even if
your mid broadcast so people do not have
to miss any of the beautiful wobbly
action 10 is you
yes oh that's a really neat feature if
it didn't delay the modular podcast
today because people's having trouble
updating its hangout software will be
awesome the BCCI pin arrives yeah okay
I'm actually trying to bring us on the
topic maybe see I player reps here any
you gather with it happen nobody outside
like the K cares about how we're talking
about the danger man is semantics no but
that app on the desktop you you have
this exact same rewind feature where
even if you join at the 59th minute of a
one hour show you can hit rewind to the
start and then start watching it which
is great you know cuz you can
comfortably miss the first 10 minutes 15
minutes and then just start working
during the show so long is this
happening live it's a nice feature tweet
your network oh and now now it's muting
me because they recognize i'm typing i
love google hangout so hard as google so
in addition to new windows phone apps we
have an actual new windows phone that
nokia apparently is decided it wants to
tell us about before they've actually
announced it which is we're expecting
the announcement next week yeah or was
when is his hands soon yeah no keys gun
event on monday right again emoni but
that's in london yeah it doesn't make
any sense for them to announce this in
London because it's I mean everybody
knows this is going to verizon right so
referring if you don't know to the Lumia
928 yeah and and I think that it's it
you know it's like a custom issue phone
that they may die I think the deal is
that I wish Tom Warren were here because
you'd be able to say this much more
eloquently than I can but I think the
deal is that the 920 in at least in the
US is an 18 th exclusive so the 928 is
basically a you know shortcut around
that that thorny little issue um it's
you know it's a reworked 920 with a
xenon flash basically right as far as we
can tell right very much thats related
the most important thing we've seen so
far we've seen a billboard for this
phone does
Vanity Fair spread and okay calm is
actually featuring the phone just yeah
it's like it's like a Latina slider I
got 928 right all I want to say is that
Vanity Fair's where I go luckily two
scoops yeah I'm talking the physical
events actually dancing oh my at a
newsstand Kara Swisher had a really nice
sort of history of how Instagram got
bought by Facebook and Vanity Fair so I
mean come on it happens yeah nokia com /
us hyphen en / Lumia 928 I mean and you
just looks like in the Lumia well so
everybody look into the front so what my
theory is that this phone is actually
going to be announced a verizon has
scheduled a a secretive press conference
for ctia which is coming up later this
month we don't know anything about it my
theory is that the 928 will be
introduced their anvil the event in
london is actually for something else
right it better be because lang kita was
saying yeah a verizon only phone doesn't
make much sense to be announced new but
then at the same time the nokia com
League of 928 shows it without horizon
logo on picture yeah there could very
well I mean I can totally imagine there
being like a European variant of it
right but in Europe I don't understand
like it doesn't seem like it would make
sense to sell both the 920 in the 928
right if and doesn't make sense so if
they replaced the 920 with the 928 in
Europe then ATT customers I would not be
like as angry as I was from the 909 20
but I'd still be a little bit like hey
guys what I mean we've had this
conversation before that that's like the
big fear right you know the 920 hit the
market in October or something like that
so it's we're beyond six months out it's
like seven months now um that Nokia
could launch then I'm 28 and piss off a
whole lot and I 20 owners no I mean this
phone is just really a rework 920 even
the ads is showing
low-light performance so they're
emphasizing is that is in cameras right
and it is actually he has it's such a
rework of the 920 that even the ads are
faked again and the other thing is what
was it good damn really enjoyed that one
that's a good job what percentage of 920
is eight like if you're gonna upgrade
the product model number by eight out of
nine hundred and twenty you're basically
telling everyone this is same phone it's
it's less than one percent better it's a
it's a point little extra point 869 5652
percent good well there you go that's my
point made it rounds up what's like a
wave of thin sliver on top of your slice
if it's like you know it's like a tiny
piece of ham on top of your I love you
photo waffle they go yeah on top of your
liege a waffle the AJ what is that okay
yeah you google look it up you'll see
you know I believe everyone I just want
to get the etymology of the AJ is cuz
it's really interesting to use it this
is what sounds courage comes carly is it
like you must you must you owe fealty to
the waffle if by oatmeal t to you mean
pay for the waffle been yes um so yeah I
don't think it makes any sense for me I
felt the same way L I eat with a little
watch majigger yep it is I mean yeah I
mean the first time I asked about it at
the at the store I said leash waffle and
they think corrected me very they were
they were a little bothered they were
like look if you're gonna be the mayor
here you need to pronounce Lee write
properly that's right so this 928 if if
the London event is for this phone i
think it's going to make a lot of people
pretty upset it's possible that they
could bundle the launch the 928 with the
catwalk and do a one-two combo but the
fact remains that nokia is still at the
mercy of microsoft's
schedule for Windows Phones launching
these rework devices with the same
operating system that we saw in
September last year when they should
show the 928 when T is not a good look
for nokia but there's not a lot they can
do about it right yeah it's out of their
hands so so we we just straight up don't
know what's happening in London like we
like we think it's a 928 for a European
barrier if it's not the 928 the know he
has done it absolutely tremendous
bang-up job of concealing their true
plans I think it's gonna be we just
haven't been paying attention at all it
could be an Ashes awesome oh yeah if
it's an Astra phone nokia and myself are
going to have an issue relationship is
going to hit rocky ground uh but I mean
to do that rumor about an aluminium
nitride any variance right show me the
eye at the end of that world to show
Jimmy yeah show me where the eye is next
to you oh yeah dominium is the
internationally a Greek name for that
that that's fine i would just like to
see the eye in the in the in the word
i'm not talk about the one towards the
beginning i'm talking about the one
towards yet i know you can't find it
listen america's made a typo at one
point they were too embarrassed and way
too proud to be like Al me what this is
all i would have you done I'll do just
go with it go with okay aluminum that's
what we're gonna call it again janitor
fits the materials so much better it's
so it's such a workman like material
it's good for so many things like nah
busy there you go he's well-liked now
but back in the day used to be the most
valuable interior because we didn't know
how to bring it out ground and how to
extract it yeah so we're worst week
we've met we've Americans are pragmatic
you know let's we just we make the word
fit the thing for its time likely AJ
waffles Liege waffles I would just call
that a hard waffle myself
it's actually awful it's not just hard
and crispy those also really thick it's
like it's like this deep wait so it's
it's a belgian thicker and it's more
difficult to eat because it's like
harder well i think it's supposed to be
like it's it's not very big around i
think it's supposed to be handheld it
just has lots of stuff on top of it I
don't know it's confusing it's I mean if
we want to start a waffle culture
podcast count me in I mean of course I
just want to know where we're on this
spectrum do Belgian waffles land and
where do like eggos land your your your
uh what you envisioned when you think of
a Belgian waffle is like a big Liege a
waffle like a lazy waffle is like it's
it the diameter is smaller but it's
about the same thickness okay and i
would consider the the foldable waffles
to be exactly the same as Vegas ok so
the eggos that they put still be
informed on twitter that were
pronouncing Liege a wrong by the way I
bet we are because unless insulation on
a second e it's just liege that's a
that's how they that's how they
pronounce it at this particular
establishment I you know is that the
Chicago accent on it but this is just my
essence active on point guides Americans
just don't give a damn what the actual
hood is or has to go Smith pronounced
like there's aluminum there's me AJ and
in this entree which to you guys means
of main course whereas in French which
is where entree comes from it means
starter because entree and entry are
rooted in the same thing but you just
ignore that you're like you know what
I'm hungry so i'll just make it a main
course i'll call it an entre Wells's
like that so my proposal and no ever get
me started on like the distinction
between biscuits and cookies between the
u.s. and the UK it's a mess it's
absolute mess it's my proposal is due
like the Taiwanese over inside pay and
just make all you men use photos of food
just point it will they want there's no
confusion look you guys have cookies
called digestive
it doesn't help it's not helping you
guys miss anything why is it called a
digestive because it's easy digestible I
don't know oh so it's not us guys
because I don't even touch that garbage
but just happens namie guidance point
out that my twitter stream right haha
comments I'm sorry guys we're gonna
we're gonna talk about mobile things um
later but right now we're talking about
waffle that's important it is and we're
going to do so in such a way that
there's a double entendre and I'll have
to walk away from the computer again um
no anything else what Windows Phone I
mean it's coming 928 I mean listen I
need to reiterate my rant about Windows
Phone it just annoys me now I am it is
that old mix of a minus in frustration
we're like okay fine finally have a
youtube app but now there's the email
plant that needs to be spotting up for
people who have a conversation with
modern one other person there's all
these other little things which are just
other so bad no I guys hang on hang on
Chris Pirillo just yes this is amazing
credible hey Kris Furillo I this this is
great but what's is a where can i buy
wanna be tweeted at YouTube lad uh this
is a yeah there's a keyboard shape
waffle maker is that a liege waffle or
is that a taco waffle or I don't know
what a liege waffle is you mean ol eh eh
I'm sorry I'm just rolling I'm trolling
the entire universe right now so so it I
mean I haven't used a windows phone 8
device full time in months uh and and it
like you with each passing day I feel
like I have less authority to speak
about how good it is of a primary device
but from my last
my lasting lengthy experience with it
which is on the one say on the 920
actually I'm glad I have to totally
agree with you that the email client
it's funny like I've heard many people
including verge staffers tell me that
the email client is great I think it's
nonsense I attack allows one of them
actually I was one of them like when we
first saw a windows phone I was like
this is really clean and tidy and night
I need and fast right he just hasn't
moved since that like data threaded
messaging and I thought okay well don't
know that we need to do and they haven't
nowhere near well I I also don't like I
I mentioned this a little bit last week
but like the the entire philosophy
around animations and screen transitions
in Windows Phone is cute for the first
15 minutes that you're using it and then
it becomes increasingly annoying over
time same is true is in Mac OS or excuse
me OS X we're like there are screen
there are these like stupid animations
everywhere that you can't do anything
about and well you can you can that
there are settings you can tweak but
they're not immediately obvious where to
go to find those those settings and so
the default is that over the course of
your day you're probably wasting minutes
of time just looking at windows going
bloop bloop bloop all over the screen
same same in Windows Phone 8 and Windows
Phone 7 for that matter like just
watching menus collapse and expand and
screens go this way in this way it's I i
would prefer to have none of that happen
but like it's it's cool when you're
picking up in the store but as an owner
as a windows phone owner that's not
something that I necessarily want to see
ya Steve so but the only thing I heard
of that entire rant was you call it OS X
when we all know it's always 10 I was
waiting for someone I bailed him out on
that no it's it's not OS 10 be because
then because then dieter what are you
arguing to say OS 10 10.8 yeah now oh
it's 10.8 know it's if it's OS X in fact
I'm sure I find I'm sure there's a whole
bunch of people say no I'm just saying
I'm sure the argument
was that intentionally so people can
subconsciously say two words sex when
they're thinking about apple according
to wikipedia it so is 10 that's what I'm
saying I mean it's not something I ever
pronounce the loud I guess but it's like
me and hors d'oeuvres I didn't know how
to pronounce our d'oeuvres until I was
like 25 how did you pronounce him before
host goobers yep yeah we're back for me
books I was right that doesn't really
funny thing about French is that a lot
of French words have infiltrated their
way into bulgaria and actually know them
from bulgaria right but then I've come
in like we didn't yeah I kind of read it
exists only to troll toll way to make
people feel bad about not knowing how to
pronounce things at sealed that's that's
what it's for okay um if I'm going to
college and I'm gonna stick with I'm
gonna stick with Jaffe I'm gonna stick
with it max I'm gonna stick with Lee AJ
and I'm gonna stick with aluminum and
and everyone can can deal with it wait
wait wait wait everyone can deal with it
if I don't have a gif of that by the end
of the show or a chip depending on how
you problem yeah that's Jeff oh my god
um android we're moving on I hope a
droid uh so I wrote a story about the
locked bootloaders on the HTC One and
the galaxy s4 talked to all four major
carriers in the US and I also talked to
HTC and I talked to Samsung and then I
got corrected on Twitter thank you very
much for the corrections basically the
way that it looks is you want to unlock
your bootloader on one of these phones
and you don't want to hack it do
something you know crazy hacky not an
expert but you still want to be able to
do custom roms you want to be like a
mid-level hacker right I don't know all
right this is this is the worst
explanation of unlocking bootloader as
ever but bottom line is verizon 18t
working the law
boot loaders although it's weird because
apparently some 18t models are currently
unlocked and then they're going to walk
them later maybe and then sprint and
tmobile our unlocked tmobile says
they're going to lock the gs4 but they
haven't to date so basically the story
in 2013 is that carriers are still being
a pain and like they're the ones not the
manufacturers that are like causing
these android phones to be locked down
at this point you should surprise
anybody right right um but what's crazy
is like I would like reach out I would
like talk to Samsung and HTC and said
hey guys tell me about the software that
you make on the phones that you like put
through a factory really it you tell me
what they are like yeah now you gotta
ask carriers or not we can't comment on
that like that's how deep it goes that's
it's crazy making but is where I think
we're way better off so we were a year
ago right I mean the HTC has got HTC dev
so you can go and unlock your phone
officially through them presumably will
see a galaxy s4 developer variant at
some point and it looks like at least in
the early days that the galaxy s4 on
AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon the hackers are gonna
be able to unlock the bootloader they've
already shown that they can do it but
they haven't released a method because I
think they're waiting for verizon's to
get released so they can you know use it
on both so like we're doing okay as far
as like custom roms on these you know
these modern generation of phones but
we're still not out of the woods in
terms of Android being as open for
customers as it is for carriers the
existence of the unlock 700 megahertz
HTC one is still like the most
heartwarming thing in all of the
American mobile landscape right now it
was not a veterans before we get more
like we saw the Xperia Z got released
but it wasn't done LTE but we're
expecting good like I can't tell if
you're doing that to troll me or if you
like you're genuinely like Canadian
like which is it boy it foes a thing
they sold out of them I seem to recall a
tweet from HTC saying they saw it out of
their dead phones which does show that
there's at least yeah but we don't know
how many they had to sell they could
have had like a hundred votes yes that's
always the case and like all of XDA
developers forums would have bought them
up and it's done right nice trick sure I
mean blackberry has been saying they've
sold out of Z tens and tens and all of
that stuff whereas for we know they've
sold like two dozen yeah yeah I doubt
that HTC is is uh what's the word I'm
looking for diverting very much of their
manufacturing capacity of making these
devices because I did there's this this
hard-headed belief among oh yeah that
nobody wants these things and maybe
they're right I mean yeah at the end of
the day you still have to pay 575
dollars for this phone in a market
that's used to paying at most 2 49 yeah
so that's that's a barrier that they
still need to get over but okay the
thing that we can save definitively on
the base of this information is that the
interest is greater than HD estimated it
to be yeah yeah so it's enough speaking
of things that manufacturers and
carriers have hard-headed Lee told us
that nobody wants smaller phones with
actually good specs we we've already got
the first which is still mid-range and
with a terrible camera but there's this
leak of the m4 uh from HTC religion yeah
it looks it's maybe this was from a
couple weeks ago but like I I can't stop
looking at it basically looks like a 4.3
inch HTC One yeah and um if they put a
real processor in this thing like this
looks like an awesome camera this means
i said it's going to break your heart
what's going to happen they ok why do
they always break my heart it's going
well it's so a few things one there's
there's no well no I stand corrected 8
the rumors at eighteen t is going to
launch as can say it's not going to come
to us but rumors that AT&amp;amp;T is gonna pick
it up uh but is it's going to be a you
know a dual-core processor
sir it's gonna have a crappy display
it's going like everything about it is
my patience isn't 20p super OCD which is
following a 4.3 yeah 4.3 inch 720p
display is phenomenal it's like there's
a waiting press it's gonna have a
one-inch air gap it's going it's gonna
have a half inch bezel surrounding
holographic display this play will
actually be behind the phone as you hold
after actually guys there's a point to
brace it and that is it is precisely
because the flows in these phones aren't
that big because there's more kind of
things that sneak under your skin and
just annoying irritate you that's why we
get so again I know I didn't irritate
about it like if it was a one-inch air
gap it would be so far away from idea of
a perfect phone or of an ITF Oh wouldn't
even think about it but when i get close
when they start approaching it and when
they start yeah just showing you the
potential that's what it gets really
frustrating but another point i was
gonna raise which Stan was saying is
gonna have half an inch a bezel unless
you come back around to the idea that we
need bezels around focus because in
using the s4 I mean I said I'd only use
it for say it's been manga and using the
s4 it actually has two little brothers
yeah that's just speaking to the point
that the screens too big if the screen
wasn't say I mean absolutely be able to
manage it i mean if you look at the
iphone 5 if there's like no bezel
surrounding it and you don't have the
issues that you have with the bigger
screens like oh you do maybe i phone 5
you do have a nice chunk of centimeter
oh so a bezel on top and on the bottom
Oh below it but I mean on the sides like
on on the one my the the fat part of my
at home always like rut when I'm trying
to reach across the screen it always
hits something before it before i get
there because the screen but what I'm
saying is you basically need to have
some portion of the front of the device
which you can hold on to pretty much
just something to put your finger on and
it doesn't react where is with the
galaxy s4 the whole thing pretty much is
and even put your finger on it exactly
exactly we would have ever you hover
action so the very bottom is the back
button and the menu button in the homes
button and very top where you get the
other extra bit of bezel with the export
you can't reach because the 5-inch
freaking foam and it's too big so most
of the time works happenes are picking
up the phone I turn it on and I'm
activating things i'll press him back
pool and canadian google now or
something so what the speaking of the s4
what do you guys think of this drama
about its storage capacity that because
of all the extra stuff they've added
there's you know to fewer gigs available
still the 16 gig version the base model
i forget how much storage it has freed
samsung statement was like well we've
got a microSD slot so just use that
suckers like I mean this is a big deal I
know it's just gonna take up and yeah
it's not even anything less you need to
Samsung or to Android because the Lumia
720 that I've got has five point four
gigabytes available I think right so
that only happens not only has eight
gigabytes to start with right but this
dude 534 is very close to you know 56%
it you know yeah but I mean the thing is
like I I I don't think it's a huge issue
for most most users I think power users
are gonna have a problem with it but i
don't think that Samsung's argument that
a micro SD card slot is the answer
because uh yes if you put a micro SD
card slot you can fit a lot of music and
photos on there but if you're say
playing games or you have like these big
files the latest versions of androids
don't don't let you move those to the SD
card like they used to so you can fill
up your free storage with like five
games and be done so I don't know if
you're gonna be doing that by the 32
game I model I guess yes launching
tomorrow is that right no sir the 10th I
think yes on Friday Yeah Yeah right
listen here is the absolute worst thing
about the galaxy s4 and Oh galaxy phones
in general okay it's okay study it
you like a few days ago I was in my
bathroom I heard a popping noise of
water droplets and I was like with
Samsung device he's making that noise oh
it was me nevermind it was actually it
was actually water droplets hitting puts
it in the sink it's that bad is that
it's gotten that bad and so that I use
samsung devices in databases it's
actually that I'm coming across them and
come across people who just don't bother
changing the default sound ski I will
say that the the default sounds in the
galaxy s4 much improved over the galaxy
s3 but yeah there's still bloobity
bloobity yeah yes and they said the
technical term there's that whistle that
everyone uses their notifications I'll
on that whistle yes that's the default
one it's the first so it's it's I find
it just as annoying as the marimba
iPhone ringtone that nobody wants
average but that that Samsung what is
the only ringtone at least on the s3
that there's actually high-pitched
enough for me to be able to hear it
because all the other octaves in my
register are gone I don't speak audio
terms that well so pretend i use the
right words in that previous sentence
yeah but you have a pebble so you can
you don't even need to hear it you can
just have a rich prick which brian klug
has just confirmed me on twitter that if
you turn on accessibility options on the
HTC One there's a known bug where when
you hit dismiss call it actually answers
it and that is like been the bane of my
existence I've been like answering calls
that I mean to dismiss and it's because
of this bug I'm super happy that I know
that now now you can just dismiss stuff
directly from the watch so I won't be
answering those calls so you've had a
lot of like really awkward like hellos
that you had no intention of taking I'm
guessing I don't I just picture him like
hitting the decline button to be like I
really didn't want to talk to that
person yeah the phone hit like I go the
same in that my head probably happen
probably haven't once I really don't
want to talk to chrissy today oh yeah uh
then what a friday also we've got the
optimus G coming out an AT&amp;amp;T I'm sorry
honesty front row the phone that I
I want to care about it but I really
just don't I mean I'm losing my I feel
like Optimus G is is probably one of the
most underrated and underappreciated
phones in 18 tease lineup which isn't
saying much but yeah I don't know that
the g pro it just feels like it's such a
me to device like you if you could come
up with a me to like a definition of a
me to device it would be like well
here's a Gears the note 2 and six months
later here's the g pro they look like
physically identical the only difference
between them is the fact that the pro
has a 1080p display now and a i guess a
more modern processor but likes
competition then they're so similar like
LG didn't differentiate at all except
for on those places to the modern
concept of competition is this you go
you sent spies out they go into the
factories they go into the blueprint
drawing room however samsung schemes up
his phones they find out how to do it
and they copy that's competition and
samsung companies LG sometimes and and
it's making even worse is that like LG
knows how to make hardware that's nicer
with either if you look at the optimus G
or the nexus for their glass and rubber
they just well the a penci any talk
about nexus 4 nursed a nice hard way
it's better it's better than the g pro
and the note tues like glossy cheap
feeling plastic like the cheese fair
enough is exactly like the note 2 in
that respect so fair enough but again
that's not meet setting particularly
high pave is it no I'm sayin I'm saying
it's like you know they could have done
something different but they didn't they
I think yeah absolutely both of these
companies also a fee if you look at the
desktop monitors actually right and
particularly some of their laptops which
wouldn't make it out of career but
looked really amazing a couple of years
ago ticket LG had some laptop so make
current ultrabooks look ugly in fact you
know they absolutely know how to do good
industrial design I just think their
priorities are not the ones that
idealists and purists would like to see
you know I think we had their work into
a budget
at the at the pace of of spec iteration
that Samsung and LG and frankly the
entire mobile industry want to work at
though I think that like their only
option is to like you know not put a ton
of time and effort into industrial
design not put a ton of time or effort
into materials like they basically are
just putting bigger processors and more
radios into a box into a generic box and
and that's that's how you end up with
products like the gs4 and not miss G pro
exactly you know we had a meeting with
them with Samsung a few weeks before the
launch of the gs4 where someone from
another publication said uh you know
like this industrial design sucks like
what's going on and and they said that
the response from one of Samsung's
executives was well I don't think that
we're being given enough credit for all
the all the stuff we're packing into
this phone and it's like yes that's true
like you're packing a lot of stuff into
the phone but it's at the sacrifice of a
quality you know look at the the term is
you know jewel the jeweled product not
jeweled that makes it sound like it's
bedazzled I mean like I only like an
iPhone 5 or an HTC One that's something
that that Samsung LG clearly have no at
least in their phone divisions have no
intention of trying to pursue and maybe
that'll change eventually but right now
that's not what the game is about for
them that's right i mean for samsung
it's just selling these things hand over
fist and making tons of profit and then
I think for LG it's trying to do
whatever Samsung's doing right if you
think about it LG has it's a line of
proud of folks so it does try and
differentiate yourself with design firm
and what is the last time a prada phone
came out it's been a while nothing it
has made that long the prada phone for
free point oh whatever it was with
android i think it was like three years
ago now no no in the last year no maybe
energy doesn't love it when my tears
reason anyway i know i attended their
launch event and but doesn't try
with those devices it's a design phone
in quotation marks you know my god the
the webpage for prada phone by LG 3.com
have got at norton trying to look like
he's going to murder you I think you
muted yourself theatre active anything
yeah I'm titanime resizing I'm just
looking at a giant image of Ed Norton
looking like he wants to kill me and you
are you looking at american history x
are you looking at i'm looking at a
prada phone by LG 3.com by american
history x yeah and it has oh my god it
has like the home back and search button
on the bottom like it's a cute little
android interface this is the worst this
phone is not new ok I'm sorry I've just
I want it now yeah I'm gonna go but
member it had the black and white
interface like there was no color on the
home screen yeah I think of lab correct
me if i'm wrong i think aaron reviewed
that right uh concerti i know i didn't
yeah i think he really did hit it so
yeah actually that makes it way yeah
probably year old december of twenty
Lana's wedding this video with that
norton right now and it's running 2.3
yeah yeah fascinating information dita
you should wikipedia you guys I don't
know if I brought this up on the on the
podcast but you guys realize that ATT
still sells an android 2.2 phone right
what yeah the sharp FX plus 0 is it too
like b2b isn't is that like know if
she's blown wasn't it not not until long
ago that Verizon sold the what was that
Windows Phone 7 model that they had from
acc uh they sold it for an eighty dollar
bro Theon tracks yes yeah and then and
then I believe sprint or one of the
other carriers was still stalling like
the bold before the 9900 yeah with the
tour or whatever there's there's still
an active
link to buy a palm pre 2 from verizon
yes someone tweeted it at me the other
day like you there's still a way to get
to the checkout page like I don't know
if it would actually work I don't they
would send you a preacher or not but
well I know I know that there's been
sites those like daily deal sites that
you can get like a pre to for like 50
bucks or something for verizon uh yeah
and I've been super tempted to buy one
because I don't have that particular
model but i've refrained but i think you
can still order direction verizon for
like two hundred dollars hey every tues
relation rate i have one observation to
contribute right here what I'm noticing
is that all of us are at the moment
anyway bearded rapidly approaching
middle age and fondly were collecting
nostalgic leave a collecting about
phones of the past that's where we're at
right and waffles this is this is our
eyes actually I'll yell the eldest of
this group so and I should I should
contribute my phone that i worked from
the past which is actually the panasonic
eluga power wow I really want to look
every one of those and they just kind of
came and went that was on the market for
like half a week right right yeah i mean
i remember seeing them at mwc 2012 and
it was Panasonic's big push and they
were showing off how waterproof it
wasn't everything and then I never saw
it again yeah I mean I think it was only
on sale for like a month or two or she
was away speaking of crazy things last
left the fact that this first else like
you I is being brought back as an
Android launcher it's kind of crazy if
ya recall that part that product Oh
another one that I'm w at market but we
have to discuss this I mean the foot do
we really have to we doux-doux come on
so if ok ok so the else 41st else was a
phone that was based on a company out of
is real yep that was based on IP that
they got from access which was the
company in Japan that bought the remains
of the original palm OS uh way back
after they split into palm source and
palmone so before webos before even
cobalt which was the operating system
that they were making and then killed
and then maybe they were making another
one kind of based on who knew anyway
like this thing happened and this
company made an operating system based
on it and then it made a UI on top of it
that was the else you I and now it's
it's not dead it's available as a home
screen replacement for your android
phone and have we done I think it is
free i think it's it's considered a beta
right now but i think it is free oh good
times what's crazy about it is if i'm
not mistaken it's like they developed it
and launched it like it's not somebody
that just made a copy of it or mimicked
it and like created a launcher out of it
so it's doubly nice i mean first of all
the company went on though so that was
annoying but it is about the product
ever coming to market well does the
thing i was saying will discussing this
in Chatterley i'm saying this is mosque
esque and so far it is it's a really
ambitious projects that reminds you you
might think I Elon Musk is the one
behind it in being so kind of thing
about this android launcher makes me
think that Elon Musk is behind literally
nothing about this launch never crossed
my mind okay well I don't know the
luncheon looks like we come on the the
thing with it this companies that they
were really really ambitious and maybe
maybe they got me at a time when it
wasn't quite so jaded like the way jolla
yola are happening right now and all of
us are like yeah nothing's gonna happen
for me i was a feeling that when the in
place first outs came out and also they
did have a really unique hook or feature
which I guess ultimately turned into a
gimmick which was at the whole UI and
menu an interface would essentially
sprout out from your thumb so you place
your thumb of the screen and then you
got everything kind of
it's actually very similar to the the
camera interface on stock android 4.2
yeah which is terrible yeah i mean like
a google trust in allah and failed and i
guess that that's the point it's a good
idea but nobody is executed correctly
yet but the first actually not a good
idea no I absolutely categorically deny
that it's not a factual I mean I played
around with it and it looked quick
enough and it looked sensible enough I
mean the whole idea is you can use it
with just one hand like absolutely you
don't need a second hand and everything
is immediately right next to your thumb
because it literally starts the menu out
from your thumb right so it's like your
purse on the screen then you get over
your menus and you're like okay I'm
going into messaging and then you get an
eight the next submenu exploding out of
that space and you go into your latest
message cetera and that basically means
that with a guided swipe here screen you
can go you know three menus deep or
something like that or three levels deep
into a menu any two an item so he had
the potential I had something I was
really interested in unique I think
ultimately it was a case of not finding
the funding and I'm getting the carrier
contracts in place so I mean
particularly with this pricing right now
I don't care if the beat or not being
free I'm totally just gonna load it up
on some android phone and see what's
happening with it for nostalgia for no
other reason it's been a while since we
gotta beat a hottie yeah I'm pretty
happy who made that happen I'm free 30 I
promise you I will never remember which
one is the American which one is English
would beat or beta the one that what
about weird is the American one what
about tech named a that's that's mine
I'd like to see tech maybe um I feel
like the way they should have they
should have done this this launcher is
instead of launching on Android they
should have launched on an open webOS
version of the n8 the Nokia and nursing
n9 know the development
the N 9 50 yes yes that's what they
should have done so that literally like
when you when you like filter it all
down like literally one human being can
load it that's that's hey palms former
CEO is joined Qualcomm's board of
directors jon rubinstein he's now on
amazon's board and Qualcomm's board make
of that which how many times is jon
rubinstein been pulled off of a mexican
beach and i had to work at a company to
save a company i fin just one time well
i mean at all fairness I don't think
Qualcomm meet saving Qualcomm seems to
be doing very well yeah they're doing
this is this is the first time that he's
not that he's like attached to a company
that's already you know well so
hopefully was Gene all things deep broke
the story on this and one of the things
they pointed out is like of everybody on
the board he's like the most one of the
two most like technically savvy people
like he's one of the few engineers
actually have in there for which is not
what do you expect on a company like
Qualcomm yeah that's all the people on
the board of directors actually do
govern corporately they choose a CEO
they approve mergers and acquisitions
pain I've been it from Chris they went
jacket so get that kind some of them
even wed sighs I've seen them do it but
they're there they are there to look out
for the best interests of the
shareholders and there's meant to be
separate from the company's own you know
executive management infrastructure is
it as much as possible because they're a
check on a balance to serve the best
interests of the shareholders so they
take reports from the CEO and the
accountants and everything else and
makes sure that the company's plans are
good at proper little-known fact about
Qualcomm drop some knowledge on you guys
oh boy no key asiri is Qualcomm's
hardware division yes us what yeah
exactly that is that is blowing my mind
right now I had no idea yes you're also
one of the very first if not nothing is
a second palm based phones
uh-huh yep that's yes yes what's on room
remember her Qualcomm made the the Q I
believe it was called and and that was
palmas based right yeah now I bet you
guys didn't know that kyocera had a line
of digital cameras but they did I did
not know that that I did not know
welcome to the virtual show where we
react idea and talk about waffles at
dharwad waffles and then read Wikipedia
on how to pronounce waffles right OS 10
second question about board of directors
in Ruby say if Amazon and Qualcomm come
together to start negotiating the amazon
kindle phone whatever they want to call
it and Qualcomm obviously with the
Snapdragon series has a very compelling
set of chips wouldn't ruin stance
position being on both boards of
directors be a conflict of interest I
suppose it would depend on the
particulars I mean Eric Schmidt was on
apple's board he could just sit out and
I I always thought that was and yeah I
mean he left when the conflict became
very obvious but I was yeah that was
kind of awkward but he also said but
even before he left he said that he
would frequently recuse himself from our
conversations if he felt that it was
conflict of interest so Jeremy nothing
like different boards work different
order some parts are just there to like
you know hang out and drink margaritas
and some boards are there like HP's
board glamorie and HP's board like it's
just it's just a whole bunch to like
pyromaniacs there's like what I want to
light on fire today what whose dreams do
we want to crush today I don't know man
in in many ways the slate 7 is a dream
come true boy I know you want to buy
today and then stearyl position the
slate 7 man I tell you it's atrocious
they should have just launched the the
opal right yeah the ovals so much better
do I have it here no it's not here I
right for those who don't know the opal
was was the touch pad mini touch but go
go excuse me which which HP came within
days of releasing yeah and it had a
really good screen it was the same
resolution as a full-sized touchpad so
whatever it was for the time it was the
weird square but it like if they had
managed to price it aggressively it
would have been a way better seller it
would have been like the first like
really successful small tablet it would
it would have out mini the ipad mini
before the ipad mini was well i'm
thinking like out nexus 7 the nexus 7
yes yeah but i mean it had the same
aspect ratio is the ipad mini same
screen resolution yeah probably around
the same size maybe probably a little
thicker I was a lot better but you know
it was also 2011 basically everyone just
ripped up HP yeah that's it that's the
kids are deadening dish oh you should
learn them we like waffles Apple ripped
off HP that's what we're saying right um
so okay we actually talked about this on
the last mobile show tom wheeler but
like it's confirmed now he's going to be
the new chairman of the FCC well maybe
if he is if he's confirmed oh yeah he's
gonna be he's been nominated right
assuming the Senate doesn't play
politics which you know who knows what
the Senate and uh Eddie no crisps wrote
a really good uh report again telling us
about who this guy is and basically like
he spent his life being a shill for
lobbying groups but maybe he's not so
bad is that my takeaway from this yeah
he's he's got nothing to lose any more
right he's he's in his twilight years he
is a wealthy wealthy man i can't wait
for your first interview so in my
twilight years no no it's but it's a
very very uh you know fair point that
that this is someone who is effective
like he's not in julius genachowski
position of being very young and having
you know a long career in in private
life ahead of him so i think that that
is probably going
in many ways inform his policy making so
I don't think yes I think that it is
fair to be very worried that he has
spent his entire life lobbying for uh
wireless carriers as the president of
the ctia for a dozen years uh he he was
president of nagda which is the national
cable television association for a
number of years and before that he
worked for the grocery Manufacturers
Association so all of which has me
getting my like anti riot gear like that
is right your gear you know I'm like
ready to like you know go and experience
some tear gas protesting this guy like
hearing that resume like I am not happy
but there's a but it yes totally fair
and in the butt is that he is he is old
and has money and so that might is he's
an old rich like that hey a world where
our best hope for like openness and
government treating its citizens best is
that the guy that's going to be put in
charge is an old rich guy well hey it
worked for New York City and Michael
Bloomberg right uh you know that the man
finances his own campaign so he didn't
get caught up in any weird financing
schemes uh and I I think that you know
he isn't influenced by people who want
to pay him because he's wealthier than
than God so there's no like he is his
own man and that that makes him in many
ways a better leader I think makes him
dangerous makes him a wild card do
anything very true and I think that that
Tom wheeler could end up going the same
way what's very interesting about him is
that he he runs his own blog called
mobile I I mention it in the piece
mobile yeah that's right mobile musings
yeah and and and at first I was like oh
man this is a gold mine I'm gonna find
out all sorts of dirt on on the way tom
wheeler thinks and all these really
important issues but then you start
reading the post and you and they are
written as though they were written by a
sitting FCC Chairman like there's
but it is so pretty everything he writes
is so disturbingly pragmatic like he
doesn't actually say anything you just
like presents the issues is like yeah
that's a that's a good one and then no
that's that's a thing yes exactly so you
can't actually like deduce hardly
anything about the way he feels about
anything from this blog that he's been
writing for years so it's like he's been
prepping for the past decade to be FCC
Chairman and frankly I think that his
his confirmation is going to go very
smoothly because even though he was
nominated by Democratic president he is
uh he is his resume certainly indicates
that he's extremely pro-business so
that's going to appease the
Conservatives and the Republicans that
are on his confirmation um better
they're in it in his his confirmation
hearing so III I don't foresee him
getting rejected all of the companies
that you would think might have an issue
with a newly nominated FCC Commissioner
have pretty much throw their whole
weight behind him as as said very
effusive things as much love the pic
right which is disturbing in its own
right scariest thing ever for upcoming
things for the FCC yeah yeah Jim cecconi
who is up who's a tease bulldog of a
policy boss like he is his 18 tease main
guy in in Washington DC he he said
something like you know I've known Tom
wheeler for many years and he is a an
inspired pick was his his phrasing I
think an inspired pick for FCC chairman
which scares the crap out of my goodness
Jim cecconi is a scary man if I were if
I were working in Washington on anything
related to wireless I would not want to
encounter Jim cecconi is obvious from
the way that he talks on 18 piece public
policy blog that he that he reports like
he is he is a total wild card he's a
he's a dangerous dude who will get his
way and I and and of course is his most
famous misstep was the failure to get
the t-mobile merger approved but uh even
if you go back a couple years in town
wheelers blog even point he specifically
points out cecconi is like that
dude will like argue you under the table
like he he is one of them the best
lobbyist in Washington uh and and Jim
cecconi alone could very well push the
t-mobile deal through of course that
ultimately didn't happen but but that
that the the fact that tom wheeler
brought up cecconi a couple years ago I
think is very telling in a little scary
this look this is how this is going to
go wheeler is going to get approved his
nomination is going to become approved
and then the end of this year we're
going to see the 600 megahertz block of
spectrum get it auctioned off and
Verizon an 18th you're gonna walk in
shake hands and verizon's going to take
the bottom half and each context gonna
take the top half and they're going to
be the exact same situation that we were
in with the 700 megahertz auction and
the SEC is gonna like say okay done I I
wouldn't put it past that CC from doing
that but we'll see I mean again I think
wheeler the only thing we know about tom
wheeler is that we don't know anything
about it like yes he he he was a
lobbyist for all these years but his his
current position is unique his
appointment by obama i think is unusual
you know the relationship like you'd be
amazed by the president what does he
have a ward is he Batman did this time
what does is Tom wheeler Batman is that
we were asking yeah yeah Oh Batman so
are you saying that like at night like
he like goes into his basement and like
gets dressed up like a like a bat yeah
with nipples on his right suit and then
he goes out and saw you he goes out and
write some mobile musings right oh yeah
he solves mobile crimes you know this
conversation had so many red flags
already and so he freaked out and
worried and to have my mares and now
dieter adds some batman dressing up
action to as far as i know he is not
Batman but I could be wrong I mean I did
my research for that piece maybe I
missed some big important have an
alternate alternate identity you know
good could be a superhero in secret I
sue you sue I mean
from my perspective this is just so so
depressing because two things stand out
for me firstly this AT&amp;amp;T guy that
Christmas been talking about that
shouldn't matter you know about his
argumentative skills I mean I know you
say that but like ultimately the
decision should be made in basis what's
the best decision right because to me
the SEC and any other such making
organization should be making the best
possible judgment and they should be an
objectively justifiable one you know not
one that's just 50 by the arguments
presented by the AT&amp;amp;T loudmouth so
that's one thing but the other thing is
the thing that these were saying with
his wealth and his age and all that
stuff it is just so dispiriting for the
most positive thing for us we have to
say about wheeler is that well maybe
he's so old and so wealthy that he lacks
the ambition to do something really
really evil right why that's the problem
that's all problem oh you have we
complacency is the problem so like I'll
need somebody do to let to need the
ambition to do so but our best-case
scenario is that his was position is in
prison yes to see a gem German kiss
championship is going to be marked by
him being a benign influence that's our
best case scenario reading that we're
not gonna see somebody who's gonna push
an agenda aching to what t-mobile has
done with the uncarrier action like that
is not happening with this guy I don't
think that I agree is that one of the
things you need to remember about the US
wireless market and and the way that the
this regulation happens is we're still
like it we're in this weird for you know
a hundred years we had a
state-sanctioned monopoly ma belle 18t
controlled all telecommunications all
telecommunications are really mattered
in the US and we broke it up because
that's what we decided to do and then we
had a whole bunch of fractured stuff and
now like we're starting to see
consolidation again because apparently
American telecommunications love
monopoly's as now we've got verizon and
we got AT&amp;amp;T and that's just sort of like
in the the deep like history and the
zeitgeist in that whatever the context
of like how people think about phones
and stuff in the u.s. at this scale is
you know our it isn't that sort of
monopolistic or the traumatic stress
from breaking monopoly or reforming the
monopoly kind of thing and so this guy
having worked for the CIA having 18t
like him when this when eighties
lobbyists bulldogs act like a pt's
lobbyist bulldog he's doing it as a teen
t is today but he's also doing it with
the full force and weight of this
company that was like a good for the
country for a long time and then got
broken up so it's it's one thing to say
yeah this guy's terrible for ATT he's
terrible for us or whatever but there's
also losing my point but there's there's
a deeper history here that informs what
the FCC does and what their relationship
as a government entity is to these giant
wireless companies and another very
interesting point that people have made
about wheeler is that he was he was
involved with these trade organizations
necta and CJ a at a formative time in
both of those industries that Kate would
keep in mind when he took the helm at
nekton 79 or 80 cable TV was like this
this you know scrappy upstart that was
not the dominant player basically had
zero subscribers and needed laws to be
tweaked in order for them to be able to
get a foothold and and same could be
said for CTA I think that he took the
helm in 92 or 94 so around there and ran
until two thousand four so that's a very
different wireless landscape than
2008-2010 2013 right so it's difficult
you know III think that let's put it
this way I think that putting Tom
wheeler in charge of that CC is very
different from putting Steve Largent in
charge of the FCC who by the way sorry
as Steve Largent is the current
president
of ctia yeah if Steve Largent got a seat
on the board at the FCC I don't even
know that would be problematic there are
not enough tables in the world for me to
flip um I guess okay we already talked
about t-mobile and MetroPCS mergers
finalized fine and then it looks like
sprint and Softbank like that's still
moving forward slowly we're gonna have a
vote from clear what clear later on
softbank is saying they've got 4g
experienced dishes saying the culture
matters which is pretty xenophobic but
whatever but like it still seems like
that train is like coming into the
station despite the best efforts of a
whole bunch of companies to derail it
what what confuses me is why so many
people are so interested in sprint you
know a third or fourth place player at
this point well I think I think dish is
interested because it's it sees its way
into the wireless market and it's the
best opportunity it has but you know and
clear has said numerous times i think
that sprint is it's only hope so i can
 in i think that if dish can't buy
sprint excuse me can't can't buy can't
buy Clearwire then they are going to go
after t-mobile but we happen to
contribute to this is that I'm going to
drop some financial knowledge in you
guys and that's the fact that bond
prices pretty much around the world are
just bottoming out like any sort of debt
doesn't give the return that people want
so this is what we see in the stock
markets without any underlying strength
to them going up and up and up even
today the UK stock market index was up
like I don't know how many points just
because people there are actually vast
sums of money that people have and they
need to pull into something and they're
not happy with the return again from
bonds because the interest rates are
just flat zero the you lowered its
interest rate recently so now they're
just trying to find things
in the stock market that are relatively
reliable in ways to use their money it's
kind of getting to be as simple as that
like this loads of money that people
need to put somewhere so you can give it
to me that would be vibe they can he
could spend like two billion a week in a
week yeah hey I want you do sir okay
interesting challenge to spend two
billion dollars unlike consumer goods
what's the movie posters millions what's
the movie where the guy has to spend a
million dollars room I'm in billion
dollars spent a million dollars in a
single transaction are you kidding me no
no that's actually interesting one if
you don't if you get like two billion
dollars and you don't spend it on
investing on creating something like
this urn Large Hadron Collider or
something bonkers like that right or if
you don't launch your own rocket into
space if you're just buying consumer
goods can you actually spend two billion
dollars in a week yes yeah yeah because
you could buy houses you can buy real
estate you can buy and now we have the
shorter ari's uh risk and buy a bunch of
sneakers so put it in perspective if you
were to buy HP if you if you were to buy
the entire allotment of Ferrari
laferrari 'he's that alone would be 1
billion dollars ok I'm gonna put some
providers on it to make it interesting
right you have to buy unique things so
you can't just go and buy 10,000 of
something and the healthy things you can
carry so as you oh ok well then I would
just buy a lot of extremely large
diamonds yeah damn it this is just
foolish focus okay just just just work
with me so I mean my tea is like you
start off with a phone and then you get
a tablet
get every single type of ultrabook yeah
that is impossible my book well then
it's impossible I mean I think I could
live pretty comfortably for the rest of
my life on 2 billion dollars I don't
know if Chris hood but you know I think
I think if I had two billion dollars I
probably could make it last in my
lifetime and I might be able to put my
kids through college maybe me the second
part the mono sure about that i'm at if
if you can't put your kids through
college on that amount of money then
something has gone horribly wrong with
both your personal life and also just so
very clear it's just very clear i am
absolutely certain that i could live
more than comfortably just of the
interest of two billion dollars so you
can keep two billion just give me
whatever you get from the bank inches
basic interest ladies and gentlemen that
