next up on google's agenda watches
google announced android wear and march
and now at i/o we've got some details on
the first devices first up samsung it's
called the gear live and it'll be
available for pre-order from the google
play store later today LG's previously
announced g-watch will also be available
for pre-order and Ezra Motorola's
rounder Moto 360 which was first teased
months ago well that's still being
planned for release later this summer
the gear live actually marks a return to
android smart watches for samsung last
year release a galaxy gear smartwatch
running a modified version of android
but just half a year later samsung
abandoned android for the Tizen
operating system when launching the gear
to google also showed off a few Android
wear demos on stage day at i/o using the
Moto 360 which included everything from
setting reminders about double-sided
peanutbutter jars to ordering a pizza
this sudden and quick push into
smartwatches is no coincidence the space
has increasingly become a subject of
intense interest following pebble
smashing Kickstarter success and beyond
that Apple is reported to be working on
a SmartWatch release later this year one
that's believed to be able to measure
aspects of squares health to that gives
google and others good reasons start
getting ahead we should see soon how
well that first run aware devices holds
up
