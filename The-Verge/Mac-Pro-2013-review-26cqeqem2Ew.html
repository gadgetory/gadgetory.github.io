is Apple's new Mac Pro after years of
seemingly neglecting the professional
market releasing virtually no new
high-end hardware and even making its
software more beginner friendly at the
expense of some established features and
workflows the Mac Pro has undergone a
huge change there's a new chassis and
I'll get to that but ultimately it's
what the Mac Pro does that matters and
inside this machine for the base price
of two thousand nine hundred ninety nine
dollars is a quad core three point seven
gigahertz intel xeon e5 processor along
with twelve gigs of ram two AMD FirePro
d300 graphics chips and 256 gigs of
solid-state storage our review unit was
upgraded to a three gigahertz eight core
processor 64 gigs of ram a one terabyte
solid-state drive an AMD's fire pro d700
GPUs add in the 32 inch 4k sharp display
apple offers and the apple keyboard and
magic mouse and we're using eleven
thousand eight hundred and twelve
dollars of mac pro for the eight
thousand ninety nine dollar price of
this pro alone you could buy the highest
end iMac possible stick it on the floor
underneath your desk and hook up that
same sharp 4k monitor and save thousands
of dollars the pros black case is
removable letting you access a lot of
the devices parts you can swap out the
solid state hard drive the GPU or
upgrade the RAM all very easily but they
require seriously specific hardware it's
not nearly as expandable as the last
generation pro either Apple made
Thunderbolt for that it'll mean a lot of
messy desks next to the small Tower but
it also makes moving devices and storage
around a lot easier in most cases this
machine is clearly and explicitly made
for people who work with video for a
living so we gave our mac pro to our
video team along with a red epic camera
just to see how they felt what they
found basically was the de Mac Pro is
the fastest most impressive Mac ever
sometimes especially if you also use
Final Cut Pro 10 which was able to
playback for different 4k streams
simultaneously with color correction on
best performance mode dropping few
frames and looking really clean in full
resolution mode there were noticeable
drop frames though the new Final Cut Pro
10.1 is optimized to take advantage of
those dual GPUs they're really doing the
heavy lifting here and that makes the
experience of using Final Cut feel
extremely smoother than the Mac Pro but
for our video team and frankly most
video teams that doesn't really matter
The Verge video crew uses Premiere Pro
CC for editing and in that case what the
Mac Pro offers isn't quite so obvious
more than once a 2010 Mac Pro actually
rendered videos faster than the new
model up to 25% faster native non
transcoded 4k red footage only played
back smoothly at 1/4 or 1/2 of its
native resolution that seems to be
because premiere only uses the Mac Pro
CPU cores not its GPUs to handle video
processing presumably Adobe could update
its apps to address this specific
hardware but until it does premiere on
the Mac Pro is a story of diminishing
returns and in general premier is the
same experience it always is on any
other machine whether you're editing
1080p footage or 4k footage at half
resolution and once you're editing
footage at that resolution Premiere
feels like it always has the most
obvious improvement in this year's Pro
is the throughput with fast solid-state
storage and fast RAM the machine reads
and writes insanely fast a 30-second
clip from a completely rendered timeline
in Premiere exported to a pro res
QuickTime in two seconds when software
is written to take advantage of the pros
dual GPUs it screams that's why playing
for streams of 4k video raw from a red
camera is possible at all but when it's
not it shows BioShock Infinite still
stuttered at high settings and nearly 4k
resolution its benchmark scores are
spectacular but the pro can be a little
underwhelming in surprising places
of course it's early and Apple includes
two GPUs on every Mac Pro for a reason
so that developers will take advantage
they almost certainly will and a couple
of apps already have but until they do
the overall speed advantage of the mac
pro over the last generation or even a
high-end imac isn't all that obvious
the most striking thing may be the only
truly huge change here is how the new
pro looks instead of a big boxy silver
rectangle it's now an iridescent
obsidian grey cylinder with slits at the
top and bottom it's incredibly
reflective taking on the colors that
surround it at nine point nine inches
tall six point six inches in diameter
and about eleven pounds the pro is a
hefty computer while still being
infinitely more portable than the last
model it almost doesn't look like a
computer
more like desk storage or I guess a
trash can all that gives it away as a
Mac Pro is the Apple logo on the back
which sits above the computers many
ports on a single panel are four USB 3.0
ports six Thunderbolt 2 ports two
gigabit ethernet jacks speaker and
headphone ports and an HDMI port
everything's on the back which is nice
looking but it's also harder to access
than before there's a growing ecosystem
of Thunderbolt accessories and the Mac
was very much designed to be a hub for
all your add-ons not to have them all
inside what's inside the Mac Pro is what
really counts but there's no question
Apple's done something remarkable here
the new Pro is small and light enough to
be really easy to move around you can
fit four Mac Pros in the space of one
old one and in many cases that's really
important it's going to be a lot more
friendly to crews that have to
constantly move around on sets or
musicians that have to break down and
move their rig every single night it
also runs really quietly though it does
get pretty warm as it pushes air at its
top vents and you really shouldn't cover
its bottom or top slits so it can keep
pushing air through the new Mac Pro is
in a lot of ways exactly what pros have
been asking for it's faster it's smaller
more powerful yet quieter it has two
GPUs a fast processor though it's not
exactly a huge upgrade in that
department
plenty of expandability thanks to
thunderbolt and a pretty big bump for
all things graphical it's the fastest
Mac yet in most ways but it's not yet a
revolution or a total game changer for
anyone but the most space conscious of
video crews it's a really good really
expensive really cool-looking Mac that
should get even better as developers
start taking advantage of all its
hardware that's it to some people people
who probably already know who they are
that's worth upwards of three thousand
dollars but for others including just
about everyone on the verge video team
they're not throwing out their IMAX and
old Mac pros just yet
