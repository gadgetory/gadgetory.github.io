time coming in science fiction books and
movies for decades we've been imagining
a world where we're not looking at our
phones or tapping incessantly on
keyboards in the future we've learned we
do everything with our voice or maybe
even our thoughts our computers whatever
they might look like we'll project data
into the world around us will wave our
arms like crazy to move information
around like Tom Cruise data Minority
Report or maybe we'd be like Tony Stark
with a heads-up display permanently in
front of our face while we order around
our own personal Jarvis every author and
director has a slightly different vision
but they've all been on the same thing
technology is not going to be on a
screen anymore it's going to be out in
the world on top of the world inside the
world and we're going to be spending a
lot of time poking it prodding it and
especially talking to it so far Google
glass is a small cautious sort of
imperfect step in that direction it's
designed to use with your voice you say
ok glass and then issue a command take a
picture email my girlfriend show me who
won the yankee it's less like talking to
a friend than it is issuing a series of
dictates but glass obediently carries
them out well most of the time sometimes
glass goes to sleep and you have to wake
it by either tapping the side of your
head like your Cyclops or by tipping
your head upward at the exact degree
you'd use for a slightly exaggerated eye
roll and while glass understands and
executes its basic commands navigation
is a bit of a chore you swipe along the
temple of the glasses to move forward
and backward through the endless glass
interface from the home screen you can
swipe through every interaction you've
ever had with the device or swipe to
settings or Google now or to other apps
swiping upward takes you back and
tapping on the temples is like pressing
enter and that's all once you're
connected to your phone which you need
before you can do much of anything glass
can't connect to the internet on its own
so without your smartphone it's really
nothing more than an unimpressive camera
glued to your face once you've signed in
to your Google account and linked it to
your glass it uses a QR code and the
camera in the glass to connect and it's
probably the first time a QR code has
ever been the simplest way to do
anything but the process is still far
from over every contact you an email or
message you'll have to manually add from
your phone or computer every app you
want to install every place you want to
share images
you just can't manage anything from
glass your smartphone is the engine it's
the power source glass is just an
accessory attach to your face glass
isn't anywhere near finished and we know
that even if Google hadn't said it over
and over some of the gestures don't work
reliably and glass doesn't understand me
quite like I want it to it's like being
in a foreign country where no one fully
understands English and like The Ugly
American i am i still find myself
yelling where is mcdonald's into the
upper right corner of my eye line more
often than i should glass may come
straight out of science fiction but ok
glass doesn't begin quite the
technological revelation that Star
Trek's communicators or how 9000 taught
us to hope for actually now that I think
about it maybe Google followed Hal a
little too closely oh hell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
