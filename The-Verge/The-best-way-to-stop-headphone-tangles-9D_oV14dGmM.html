bag does it look like this
the length is rat's nest cable that's
disgusting Milosh of garbage you don't
deserve this it takes you five minutes
to HR headphones out what you deserve is
this one simple little tug and boom your
listen to music takes ten seconds to do
mache okay so this is really nerdy but
stick with me because I promise it's
worth it this work with headphones that
work with USB cables that I work with
lightning cables so the first thing you
do is you find the bigger end of your
cable so in this case it's a headphones
and then you make boyscouts loop three
fingers and you pinch the bigger end
between your thumb and your fingers and
then you just kind of loosely wrap the
cable around your fingers but not all
the way you want to stop leave I don't
know eight or ten inches left I'm gonna
put your fingers out but you leave one
in there so that you can grab it like
this and then you can loop it crosswise
and when you get to the end just give it
a little tug to twist it
tighten it up put the small one through
that hole where your first finger was
and you're done perfectly wrapped
headphones when it's time to listen your
music you just pull that little end out
give it a tug and tada so this method
will work with basically any cable it'll
work with headphones you just saw it'll
work with USB cables and work with
lightning cables leave them open power
cable here so again take the fat end I'm
gonna wrap this thing around my whole
hand because this little thicker leave
some out twist it the other way and
tighten and tuck and nice clean
organized cable get thrown in my bag
so I'm nerd I call this the Scout method
of wrapping cables and it's great I've
got five or six cables in my bag and
they're never tangled I can stick in my
pocket it's not a problem
I'm obsessed about this stuff so you
don't have to be you should give it a
try I promise you it's going to change
your life
