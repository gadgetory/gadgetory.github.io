Environmental Protection Agency in the
early 70s to document pollution in the
u.s. they show how dire the situation
was before environmental protections
were put in place now they remind us of
why we need those protections today the
future of the EPA is uncertain president
Trump is expected to slash the EPA's
budget the head of the EPA scott pruett
once wrote back many of the regulations
that empower the agency in a very short
billing Congress calls for terminating
the EPA by the end of 2018 literally
this is all it is but most Americans
aren't really on board a recent poll
showed that more than 60% of Americans
including Republicans won the EPA's
powers to be preserved or strengthened
under Trump there is tremendous public
support for clean air and clean water
and the basic mission of the agency is
tremendously popular and people are
counting on the government to provide
protection the EPA was created in 1970
by Republican President Richard Nixon
and there was broad bipartisan support
for it restoring nature to its natural
state is a cause beyond party and beyond
factions it has become a common cause of
all the people of this country that's
because back then many Americans could
see pollution firsthand most US cities
were engulfed in smog Los Angeles was
named a smog capital of the world in
1948 in the small town of Donora
Pennsylvania toxic smog produced by the
local zinc plant and steel mill kill 20
people many others got sick in 1969 a
layer of oil and debris floating on the
Cuyahoga River in Cleveland was
accidentally set on fire the Cuyahoga is
the most famous burning rivers across
the US were not an unusual sight back
then the EPA and the laws the Agency
enforces helped change all that now we
breathe cleaner air from 1970 to 2015
national emissions of pollutants like
LED carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide
have declined by an average of 70%
cleaner air means that 160
thousand people in the US didn't die
prematurely due to pollution in 2010
alone but that sorry all of it
86,000 emergency room visits and 30 new
million lost days from work were also
prevented that's good for human health
and for the economy since the 1980s the
EPA has also worked with local
authorities to clean up some of the most
polluted sites in the u.s. from
radioactive waste to illegal waste dumps
you know I think overall it's been an
incredibly important agency and I think
every way the way the environments
improved since 1970 it's hardly storing
you know to do counterfactual if it were
where we would be without the EPA but I
think UK is played a central role in
affecting those improvements in his
first speech the EPA
prutte said that he wishes to give
responsibility for environmental
protection back to the states but here's
the rub pollution doesn't respect state
boundaries just think about acid rain
acid rain was creating a lot of damage
in the forests in the northeastern US
even though the pollution was coming
from Midwestern states like Ohio
Illinois and Michigan so by setting
national standards the EPA can make sure
the one state's loser regulations don't
hurt another state nearby today
environmental challenges aren't as
obvious as those of the 60s and 70s but
they're still present climate change
will post new threats like rising sea
levels heat waves and more destructive
natural disasters we're in the middle of
a mass extinction and lead in drinking
water is a problem that still affects
millions of Americans across the u.s.
the environmental degradation recorded
by the EPA's photos in the 1970s wasn't
so long ago we often take clean air and
water for granted but we have clean air
and water because of agencies like the
EPA
