I'm really excited I want to talk about
why George Miller is a great director
and he takes a really different approach
to directing action scenes especially
car chases which are at the center of
the new Mad Max road warriors the best
example of this there are a lot of car
crashes in it and they're all physical
effects real cars real dusts often real
people inside there's something
viscerally exciting about seeing these
crashes and Miller gives them to us over
and over but what's interesting is how
chaotic it is there's an immediate
reason for each crash but there's no
real intention behind it they just sort
of happen
that's not how action movies usually
work usually there's a clear logic this
is what they teach in screenwriting
school think about the train chase and
Skyfall James Bond wants to catch the
bad guy but the bad guys shooting at it
the shooting leads to this giant shovel
which leads to the uncoupling which
leads to this train jump it's unexpected
but there's a clear logic and
progression to the whole thing now look
at this scene from Road Warrior it's a
simple setup max is driving the big rig
back to the refinery and the bad guys
are trying to stop him so what happens
first max knocks a guy off the road and
he careens into the enemy camp causing
this car to fall on this guy the Mohawk
bad guy shoots the tires but it doesn't
do anything so he jumps on the back a
guy throws a rock at the windshield but
it bounces off he tries to shoot the
muscular bad guy but the shells a dud
the muscular bad guy shoots the rig but
it doesn't do anything the Mohawk guy
punches through the window but they just
wrestle a lot the gunner shoots out more
tires but it doesn't do anything then
the gunner gets a snake dropped on him
so he shoots the driver who then almost
crashes into his buddy but veers into a
pile of burned-out cars you see the
difference right nothing works
there's a steady accumulation of danger
but nobody gets what they want and when
they do get what they want comes with
all sorts of collateral damage that
would be a real problem for a standard
hero like Superman or Luke Skywalker but
max doesn't care about a few extra
casualties it's the apocalypse
nobody cares about anything but the
climax the examples get even more
elaborate this guy's grappling hook pins
this guy's leg instead of hooking onto
the ledge then the buggy veers to the
side and flips over and the whole ledge
gets pulled off the truck and blows up
max hits the brake pedal so Mohawk guy
goes flying but then the hostages
strapped to the front of the car behind
him get their head smash max shoots a
driver so he falls on the gas pedal and
hits a dune buggy then two different
bikers crash into the wrecked buggy at
the end you get the definitive image of
the movie a car flipping over and OH
were out of control these people aren't
crashing because max is such a badass
what they're doing is just very very
dangerous and Max's in as much danger as
anyone else they all know what could
happen and they don't care because
they're out of their minds it also means
that when you're watching the movie you
genuinely don't know what's gonna happen
which is rare for an action movie every
car is just seconds away from careening
off the road to a fiery death and that
means even simple shots come with
incredible tension dangers exciting and
for Miller dangers everywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
