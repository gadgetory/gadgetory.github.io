and we're looking at the Nokia Lumia 720
s it was just announced today it's a 4.3
inch device and it's actually a WVGA and
but looking at the screen it doesn't
look too bad the site's got some fairly
good viewing angles on the device you've
got the normal sort of nokia music and
apps etc and this is the first unibody
device that luck is actually made with a
microSD slot which is on the side here I
mean it looks kind of similar to the sim
slot which is at the top here so you're
also going to need a sim removal tool to
to access that and there's no removable
covers on this particular device and so
the addition is basically a wireless
charging unit and that makes the device
the device into a little sort of like
hunt shape at the back to add wireless
charging there it also has a kohls
iceland's and it's a 6.7 megapixel
camera at the bottom you've obviously
got the normal USB port down there and
Nokia's trademark free button design on
the side of the camera power and the
volume rocker overall it's a fairly
light device actually and fairly thin if
you're going to compare that to the
Lumia 920 it feels like the sort of
device to the Lumia 920 perhaps should
have come in and yeah this is the Lumia
720 from looking next up is the nokia
lumia 520 so this is a Nokia's budget
windows phone 8 device so it's the
cheapest one that they've got out
coming out in this quarter as you can
see it's very small devices four inches
and it's kind of it's kind of a little
bit chubby not too bad but it's got the
the same sort of design and coloring as
the high level and Lumias you don't have
a forward facing camera on this one so
unlike the 620 you know we made to use
skype on this particular model it's got
a five megapixel rear camera at the back
here and in if we take the cover off
there's actually a simpler and a microSD
storage so I think this comes with eight
gigs of storage as default you can
obviously expand over microsd and that
was the Nokia Lumia 520</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
