and we're here at busy O's CES 2014
product demonstration area and they're
showing off their portable smart audio
devices today what's really interesting
about these is that there's a built-in
android tablet essentially it's a
display with internal storage it has
access to Google Play you can download
apps you can download music to it you
can stream things through other services
and basically it's meant to be a
competitor to the jam box and other kind
of bluetooth speakers with the added
functionality built in of Android its
stock Android right now this version is
running jellybean but when it ships it
will be running a full install kit kat
clean OS with no overlays this is the 7
inch model and there's also a smaller
4.7 inch aside from the size they're
essentially the same although the larger
my ovens have better sound we got to
hear them about demoed for us and they
had extremely loud extremely clear sound
and Vizio says there can continue
working to tune the audio quality
throughout the year but undies launched
by the end of 2014 they should sound
better and it will be running the latest
version of Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
