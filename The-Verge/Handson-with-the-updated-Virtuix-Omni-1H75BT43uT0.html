checking out the latest version of the
virtuix Omni it is 40 capacitive sensors
in space to monitor my every step let's
check it out
this is a really crazy experience almost
feels like I'm inside a holodeck every
step I'm taking is replicated on-screen
and I can even run if I want to virtuix
is saying that it's actually very analog
in terms of how fast or how slow you can
go it's not like they're only three or
four speeds you can go at it all depends
on how fast you're walking this is
absolutely a little bit nauseating but
also insanely compelling and futuristic
I think we're all going to want one of
these in our house someday whether
you're shooting bad guys in half-life 2
or going for a virtual walk on the beach
one of the weirder things is that I'm
actually aiming with my face using the
oculus rift so I don't necessarily feel
like that's the best way to do this but
for now it works pretty well even if
it's uh gives me a little bit of a
tingly feeling once you're inside it I
really have no idea which direction I'm
actually facing in the real world I feel
like I'm totally jacked in it's like
super immersive and I really don't know
which way is up or down I'm just kind of
walking in this virtual space the
virtuix Omni will be available this
coming May for around $499 it won't come
with the oculus rift however which is a
really big part of the experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
