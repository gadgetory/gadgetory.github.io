look at a motorola xoom to the stan inch
android tablet will be known as the
droid xyboard and so by verizon in the
US and also has a smaller sibling an
eight point two inch zoom to media
edition with almost identical specs
speaking of which the zoom to has a new
IPS LCD display at one point to give
hers dual-core processor gigabyte of ram
16 gigabytes of storage the xyboard in
the US will come with LTE connectivity
but a zoom too and it's media edition
both Wi-Fi only relative to the original
zoom it replaces the zoom to is
thirty-three percent thinner ten percent
lighter which means it matches the
measurements of the ipad 2 but it's
still a little bit thicker and about 40
grams heavier than the samsung galaxy
tab 10.1 the curved corners of the zoom
have been replaced by a more angular
trim down look which is distinctive but
doesn't really improve the ergonomics of
the tablet the quality is great however
I couldn't get it to creak or flex at
all the aluminum back feel strong and
the rubberized sides will protect from
bumps I do have to take issue with the
placement of the power button it's it's
too closer to the volume rocker and is
usually a massive pain to find and
activate as with the original zoom the
display up front is covered by Gorilla
Glass what's new here is that it's an
IPS LCD which looks far brighter and
more natural ian angles and resume to a
very good although the backlight
sometimes overwhelms the image will you
look at it from the side so i'm quite on
the level the ipad at the ipad 2 but it
matches the IPS panels they can find on
asus eee pad android tablets the cameron
resume is surprisingly good you can take
great photos in natural light and isn't
too horrible in low-light situations
either establish cameras go this is one
of the best I've seen yet video
recording is also good resume to does it
at 30 frames a second and 720p
resolution and usually produce his nice
and clear results the real coliseo for
this tablet as with most honeycomb
tablets is actually in software but
those responsiveness in the home screen
is improved from the zoo i found a lot
of lag and stutter in some of the core
apps things like gmail the official
twitter client and the browser
animations on the zoom to aren't
anywhere near as fluid as it should be
and scrolling and transitions rarely
look fluid that's a letdown when you
consider how much pro
sink power is it a zoom to disposal but
if you want to look on the bright side
Motorola has already promised an android
4.0 upgrade for this tablet so these
problems may be only temporary I'm very
good thing about the zoom to software is
multicast this app syncs up to your PC
and lets you remotely browse inside log
files onto the tablet you can stream
video or music over the Internet or you
can opt to download those files
installing is cinch or all of the files
you need on the tablet already and you
just connected via USB and it works
above PC and Mac it's going to roll the
second attempt at building honeycomb
tablet the zoom to is a vast upgrade
over its predecessor but the limitations
of its platform including a persistent
lack of tablet-optimized applications
and some sluggish performance of its own
hold it back the ipad 2 remains the best
choice on tablet market today but if you
have to have an Android tablet and
recommend Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 head
of zoom to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
