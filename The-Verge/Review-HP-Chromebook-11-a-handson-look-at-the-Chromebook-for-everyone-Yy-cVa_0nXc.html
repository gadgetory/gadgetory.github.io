this is HP's Chromebook 11 this is the
device Google calls the Chromebook for
everyone
it's the successor to Samsung's $249
series five Chromebook which has been
number one on Amazon's best-selling
laptops list since the day it came out
of course there's still no faster way to
the top of Amazon's list than to be
cheap that's why the Chromebook 11 is
just 279 dollars the Chromebook 11 has a
dual-core Samsung Exynos processor a
two-year old chip that's also in the
Nexus 10 tablet and in last year's
Chromebook it comes with two gigs of RAM
and 16 gigabytes of internal storage
which are roughly what you'd expect to
find on a high-end smartphone it even
charges over a micro USB port which is
actually awesome it comes with a
super-powerful long cable that can also
charge your phone and for most people it
means you'll only need one cable to
charge your phone tablet and laptop any
charger other than HP's will charge a
laptop much more slowly but there's no
chance you'll ever be totally out of
luck
from a pure hardware perspective the
Chromebook 11 is not that different from
just attaching a keyboard to a nexus 10
and the Nexus 10 has a better screen and
better apps but what the Chromebook 11
is is beautiful it's a thin light laptop
about two and a third pounds and about
two thirds of an inch thick it's almost
exactly the size of the 11 inch MacBook
Air it comes in white or black and the
white Waddle comes with four accent
colors blue red yellow and green the
accents are subtle and your computer's
mostly still white but it's a nice look
nonetheless it's all glossy plastic
virtually seamless on the back it gives
a really great really classy first
impression especially with the lid up
stripe of Google colors that looked so
great on the Chromebook pixel it's
well-designed more than well made though
the plastic is slick and gets oily and
full of fingerprints really easily and
it creaks and gives when you pick it up
in the wrong place the Chromebooks 11.6
inch 1366 by 768 display is really good
surprisingly so given the relatively
average resolution colors are great and
accurate especially the deep blacks the
screens glossy and reflective but is
still perfectly usable and it's a huge
upgrade over the dim muted display on
last year's model so are the speakers
which HP and Google embedded in the
colored stripe are on the keyboard
they're loud and surprisingly full
feeling like two distinct speakers as
laptop speakers go they're pretty great
in the middle of those speakers is the
full-size chrome specific keyboard with
a dedicated search button and a handful
of Chrome OS friendly function buttons
the keyboard is plasticky and a little
bit cheap feeling but it
clicky and comfortable and I got used to
it really quickly the trackpad was a
much bigger problem it's sticky and hard
to move your finger around and gestures
like to finger scrolling and pinch to
zoom or slow and laggy of course part of
that lag isn't just the touch pads fault
chrome OS is still mostly just a series
of cleverly disguised browser windows
and if you try to open more than a
couple at a time things start to slow
down really quickly YouTube videos start
to stutter and drop frames when you
watch them in HD same with local files
even scrolling is jittery and laggy on
heavy websites slightly higher and
hardware might also make for better
battery life for right now I got about
four and a half hours on our battery
test but we've been waiting for a
Chromebook that really truly lasts all
day this isn't that the overwhelming
problem for Chromebooks right now is
that it's still hard to justify their
existence that's why they're so cheap at
prices like the Chromebook 11 it's not
that hard to make a case for a device
that's best for email and web browsing
and not so great at everything else the
HP Chromebook 11 is I'm sure going to be
Amazon's best selling laptop for the
next year and if you know what you're
getting into if you're okay with a
computer that's fast enough nice enough
capable enough it's a great machine it's
certainly an upgrade over last year's
Chromebook with a better display better
keyboard and a much improved design for
$279 that's not really a bad proposition
just make sure you know what you're
getting into
even a $279 Windows laptop will do more
and run better than the Chromebook 11
though it certainly won't look as good
doing it I'm still holding out hope for
a slightly more powerful slightly more
expensive Chromebook that might do less
than my laptop but does what it can do
just as well and we're not quite there
yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
