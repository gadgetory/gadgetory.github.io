wearing the golden eye and what this is
is a wearable computer device that
actually puts the entire computer on
your head it's right now it's made by a
company called cop√°n but the technology
is licensed by motorola solutions which
makes a lot of rugged enterprise
products so basically what they are
seeing this of being in use is for
public safety or manufacturing or even
health care because it really allows you
to be mobile with your hands and not and
while still having complete control of a
computer so what is right in front of my
face below the line of sight is a point
four four inch screen that actually
appears as 15 inches when I look into it
there's a two microphones up top because
the entire thing is voice activated and
I can actually since there's an
accelerometer I can tilt my head to
scroll through the options you can see
on this screen over here that I can just
talk through exactly so go to top
go to top so this is the main general
interfacing you'll see if I tilt my head
to the left or right I can scroll or
we're having or and I can just jump into
separate applications pretty quickly so
go to top go to top public safety
so this is one use case they were
showing off where basically if someone
if a child is missing in on a convention
center floor a security guard or someone
wearing the gold and I can actually pull
up the security cameras and get
completely all the information on the
surrounding area before they even
arrived on the scene so command how do I
pull up the command core mobile so now I
can see the entire area and again by
panning I'm going all around view camera
one and now I'm looking at the security
camera right over there pan left zoom
level to pan down so again this just is
really like meant for offering
integrated solutions for any type of
on-the-go help so another thing that you
can see is that it has this camera right
on the side so another application
they're showing off is for medical
professionals where they can actually
integrate they can initiate a voice call
and basically it turns the entire device
into a Bluetooth headset and you can
essentially have someone over your
shoulder telling you what to do giving
you medical instructions or something
like that hardware-wise it's running a
TI OMAP 3730 processor running at one
gigahertz it has 512 megabytes of RAM as
well as 512 megabytes of internal
storage but there's also a microSD card
slot which can expand up to 32 gigs it
has bluetooth integrated and then also
we're in the verizon wireless booth
where they're going to be offering a 4G
LTE dongle that you can use on your belt
two offers can a connectivity wherever
you are as well as the option to tether
through your smartphone to get kind of
get online that way so this is the
golden eye and they definitely think
that in within a couple of years this
kind of technology is going to get
smaller and smaller and we saw it at CES
a couple of years ago but it eventually
will make its way down
in some form but for now it's just
targeted at the enterprise</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
