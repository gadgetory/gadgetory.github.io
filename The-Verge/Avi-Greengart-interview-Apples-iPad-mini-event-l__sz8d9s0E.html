here obvious a you know I would say with
the best analyst in the industry and
actually I heard you guys talking about
price points and obvi I want to kind of
get into it with you so apples got a
product 329 of the ipad mini they've got
a whole bunch of competition 199 and
kind of a mass of amorphous not so
successful competition at 499 and above
what's your take on a mini in its price
well I mean I think that it's a fair
price for what you're getting you're
getting a premium product I think you
that's actually what Apple is done here
they've created sort of a new segment of
the tablet market of the small tablet
market at a higher price point that just
that just does a lot more so that
doesn't mean that there isn't a market i
agree with what you were saying earlier
that there is a market for a 199 tablet
and that if you are for example if
you're just looking to consume content
and you're looking for a small tablet a
lightweight tablet for that then maybe
the kindle fire HD is the right product
for you maybe nooks color and the nook
HD is the right product for you or if
you want a little bit more versatility
and a little bit more complexity than
the nexus 7 is a great product there but
if what you're looking for is in entry
point into Apple's iOS ecosystem you
want those 275,000 I would call them
almost like bespoke experiences where I
look there are things you can do on an
iPad that you can't do on any of the
other products and then there are things
that you can do on the other products
that are just better on the iPad so let
me ask you this with a big ipad is that
we're gonna call it the big ipad for now
i guess there is a big market of people
who are saying it's a laptop replacement
this is the future of computers right
you've got cars and trucks and the
trucks are the laptops the tablets are
the cars everyone have a car sooner or
later this product is small I mean it's
physically smaller it doesn't feel like
you could replace your laptop with it is
that gonna dilute apples message there
or are they still kind of pursuing this
this post-pc strategy well I don't know
that that was ever really apples
explicit cars and trucks yes the cars
and trucks analogy is and there's no
question that swinging trucks by the way
others with the fire truck is going by
that's fried apples fire truck so uh I
do agree that you can't do some of the
things that you would do I mean I carry
around there have been times when I've
carried around the the big ipad with
logitech keyboard cover and used it as
sort of a laptop replacement but well
he's shoving the microphone my girls
okay all right you'll meet older them
all right is this better and we're
smelling look at the camera okay I'm
saying if you'd like me to so I do think
that there are there are use cases where
the the ipad mini fits where a regular
ipad doesn't i was just thinking now
this is just person this isn't industry
analysis this is guy sitting an audience
going i want one of these if you take a
macbook air and you take an ipad mini
you've covered all my use cases for for
when I'm on the road I can get my
writing down and I can consume media I
can use iOS apps um which don't really
have analogues on the full-size truck of
the of the air and so I do think that
you're right that this doesn't quite fit
as a full laptop replacement but again
it also depends on what you're talking
about in terms of of post pc laptop
replacement ism if what you're using
your laptop for is Facebook and YouTube
videos and Lord knows are a lot of
people who that's that is a reason to
use it then this then the smaller size
may be perfect and when you're looking
at a not an individual purchaser who's
going hmm i should buy an iphone and and
i've had taught shown you do all the
impressions it's the it's the enemy yes
now if you're we often think in terms of
well gosh
Apple has products this big this big
this big in this big and now they can
only expect me to buy one of each of
them but what if you're not talking
about an individual you're talking about
a household and you have kids I have
lots of kids and that's it that's a
confession and you want to give your
kids something so they leave your
full-size iPad alone or you have someone
who wants to get online and do a quick
Google search or if you have someone who
who wants to be on Facebook and there
are a limited number of devices you have
in your house that do that well the ipad
mini does fit into that sort of laptop
replacement post-pc paradigm and it does
so at a lower price than a full-sized
big ipad i just need to ask you another
question that you can he can go again so
before I let you go give me a rough
estimate I mean I how many of these
things you can think they're gonna sell
before for the holidays a lot just a lot
yeah I mean that's the one thing that as
an analyst the type of analysis I do is
I don't do forecasts thank God I will
say that when they first launched the
original iPad I I did come up with a
ballpark figure and I talked to my
contacts at apple and said yeah that's
what we think too and we were both very
very wrong okay well then I won't ask
her an exact number obvi thanks so much
for joining us today for a little bit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
