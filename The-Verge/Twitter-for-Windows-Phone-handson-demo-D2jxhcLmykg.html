we're looking at the new Twitter client
for Windows Phone 8
so Twitter's updated the UI 2 to
basically put it on parity with iOS and
Android and you can see you can still
swipe across between all the columns and
it seems to refresh the columns a lot
quicker than it used to and you can
swipe across all the columns like so
you've obviously got the the profile
column we can access your direct
messages your tweets photos and lists
and you've got the discovery tab where
it's way a highlight to the trending and
who to follow et cetera and in terms of
what's new if you go into the new tweet
section if you go into app and start
trying to fill out a Twitter Twitter
profile it'll actually suggest them and
you can just simply swipe across so
that's a change from the old version we
you'd hit the app sign and start typing
the person's name and have to remember
what their user name was this is kind of
irritating previously it's so another
change is if we back out of this message
chair this tweet you'll actually get
full draft support so I'll actually
notify you if you want to save it or
discard it
you can obviously save and then go into
the my profile and in a axis your your
drafts in there and so another change in
a Twitter application is you obviously
get the toasts on Windows Phone and but
you actually get a lock screen
notification now that you can set so you
can quickly if your phone's off and you
don't have the notification you can
quickly see how many tweets you go away
with you and the year setting sections
being cleaned up so you've gotten see
got those the same multiple account
functionality you can add an accounting
there and you've also got the ability to
change the notifications it's fairly
granular control there is also adding an
option to switch accounts there so it's
a little bit easier to switch accounts
if you're managing multiple accounts so
one thing that's actually missing and
that's available on the Android and iOS
clients is their photo filters so if we
add a photo and then add that into the
tweet it doesn't give you the option to
to apply a filter which is obviously
available on Apple's and Google's
platform so Twitter was still got a
little way to go
in terms of features to bring it on
parity with the rest so it was really
important for any sort of modern mobile
Ecosystem it's good see that the Twitter
guys have aligned the UI with Android
and iOS and hopefully the signal some
further updates in the future at the
same time that they come to Android and
iOS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
