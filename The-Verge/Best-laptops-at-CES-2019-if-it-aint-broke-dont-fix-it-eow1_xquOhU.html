cars, phones, trucks, Smart
Home stuff, weird gadgets,
and lots and lots of laptops.
But this year, we're
seeing a very different
sort of lineup of laptops
than we usually do,
one that's more focused on
subtle, more iterative changes
than these big, sweeping upgrades
that we're usually used to.
Take Dell's XPS 13 laptop, for example.
Last year's model, or
the year before that,
or the year before that, or
the year before that, honestly,
it was already a fantastic computer.
And Dell did update it this year,
but the biggest change was really small.
All they did was move the camera
from the bottom of the screen
to the top of the screen,
and don't get me wrong, it's a
notable and important change.
It looked terrible at
the bottom of the screen,
you had this weird nostril shot,
but no one's exactly calling this
a giant, earth-shattering update.
Or take Lenovo, whose updates
were a new, fantastic screen
for the Yoga S940, which,
again, looks great,
and new materials for
the ThinkPad X1 models.
They're not bad updates,
don't get me wrong,
but again, they're not big updates.
Asus had new thin-bezel laptops,
with bezels that are even thinner
than the already razor-thin ones
that they announced at IFA.
They're so small,
actually, that the company
had to do a reverse notch on top
to put a camera back on top of the screen.
They look great, but it's
again not a huge update,
and compared to the ones at IFA,
it's just not the same leap forward
as when they first introduced the design.
There's Samsung, which
updated the Notebook 9 Pro
with a new design, which
it really badly needed.
The old one wasn't great,
and this feels much better,
much crisper, and more professional.
But on an internal parts perspective,
it's still largely the same
computer as last year's.
Which, again, was a good computer,
but it's a not a big leap.
And there's HP, whose biggest
laptop update this year
was a new OLED screen version
of its Spectre x360 laptop.
It looks spectacular,
especially when you look
at it side-by-side with the old model,
but if you have the old model on its own,
there's really not such
a reason to upgrade.
And it speaks to a larger trend
that we're gonna see throughout 2019,
which is that our laptops right now
are already really, really good,
and that means that coming
up with improvements
or advancements going forward
is gonna be a much harder,
and much slower process.
Part of the problem is technical, too.
Right now, there just aren't
really any new Intel chips
to put in laptops,
and without those processors,
which will allow things
like improved battery life
or better performance,
seeing these sort of
big, monumental changes
with the same tech that
we already have now
is gonna be a much slower
and subtler process.
All the factors that were
leading to a slower development
of mainstream laptops this year
didn't really exist in the gaming PC side,
so instead of not having new Intel chips,
gaming PCs got brand new GPUs from Nvidia
with its new mobile RTX line.
And the overall lack of
pressure in that field
means that it's become a place
for really cool, fun experimentation
with wild and weird concepts coming out.
Part of those updates have
still been relatively ordinary.
Some of them have just
been simple spec boosts,
where they're just taking
advantage of these new GPUs,
things like Asus's new Zephyrus X,
or Acer's Predator Triton 500.
They're thin, they're light,
and they're gaming laptops
that look and feel closer and
closer to regular laptops,
which is honestly great, but the real fun
has come from the big, weird machines.
Things like Asus' ROG Mothership,
which is this massive 17
inch beast of a computer
that's basically a Surface Pro
that's been supersized and
plays games really well.
It's really a clever idea
when you think about it,
because instead of putting
the laptop on the bottom
and letting all that heat build up
between the desk and the computer,
Asus just turned everything on its side
so heat can vent out the back.
You have this nice, stand-up computer,
and the keyboard even detaches,
so you can use it just like
you would a desktop keyboard,
which, honestly, is kinda
what most gamers want anyway.
There's also things like
Acer's Predator Triton 900,
which is this wild two-in-one
$4,000 monster of a gaming laptop,
with this incredible 17 inch screen
that has this hinge, and
you can flip it around,
you can twist it around, you can tilt it
closer to your head, you
can flip it backwards,
you can just it use as a big screen,
if you're playing a
game with a controller.
You can even convert
it into a giant tablet
if that's what you want to do.
It's the sort of
technology that we've seen
on mainstream laptops for awhile,
but when you apply it to
this giant gaming laptop,
it takes on a whole new spin.
I mean, literally, a whole new spin.
And of course there was what might be
the most impressive
laptop at the entire show,
Alienware's Area 51m, which
basically is a desktop computer
that's just been shrunken down a bit
and attached a screen and keyboard to.
It takes desktop-class Intel chips,
so if you have a gaming PC,
you can literally rip the
chip out of your computer
and stick it in your laptop.
It has removable GPUs, which is a concept
we really haven't seen
on gaming PCs in years,
and maybe it'll work this time.
Maybe it'll be like desktops, where,
two, three years, you just buy
the latest Nvidia or AMD card,
screw it into your laptop,
and suddenly you can play better games.
It has just absolutely monstrous specs,
64 gigabytes of RAM, incredible screen,
and Alienware actually
made it look really good,
which is great.
And yeah, these big, ridiculous
machines are just that.
They're a little ridiculous,
but that's not entirely the point,
because the innovations that companies,
the designs that companies are trying out,
these, you know, fringe,
multi-thousand dollar machines,
will eventually make their way back
to the more affordable gaming laptops
and even regular mainstream computers.
That's really where the
interesting stuff's gonna happen
over the course of the next
year, and years to come.
With all that said, don't
write off 2019, either.
There's still plenty of
room for big jumps ahead
in the laptop space.
Intel has already started teasing
both its ninth-generation
chips for laptops,
as well as the promise that those
10-nanometer Ice Lake chips
will be out sometime this year.
Additionally, the company
also announced Project Athena,
its new, Ultrabook-style design language
that it's hoping to
work with manufacturers
to really drive that next leap forward
for laptop design as a whole,
and while details are still light on that,
if it's anything like Intel's
Ultrabook drive a few years back,
we could be in for another
really interesting,
innovative, and progressive wave
of revolutionary new laptops
in the coming months and years.
So, if CES is supposed to be this preview
of what the biggest and
best laptops of 2019 are,
then, yeah, they're gonna look a whole lot
like the laptops of 2018.
But, considering how
good those laptops are,
a future that's just more
of that sounds great to me.
