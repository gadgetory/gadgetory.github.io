Photoshop app for the iPad that's coming
sometime in 2019 we got to try out an
early beta version of that and what we
saw was pretty promising it's not an
exact copy of the desktop app but it's
big a selling point is that it uses real
PSD files
Adobe's actually created these new cloud
PSD files that although you work
seamlessly across all your devices and
automatically syncs any edits you make
to the cloud so if you're retouching a
photo on the desktop and you need to
adjust some stuff on the go you can open
up that same PSD file on your iPad and
continue working on it so here's what
happens when you first open up Photoshop
you have all your cloud documents here
and I'm just gonna open up this file
made by our illustrator Alex Castro on
the left here you have all the tools
that you may be used to seeing in
Photoshop there's brush gradient eraser
everything you're used to seeing and
here on the right you have your layers
panel which is collapsible giving you
more space to work and what's really
cool about Photoshop is that you can
have as many layers as you want compared
to some other apps that might limit how
many areas you can have or make you buy
more there's really no limit here so
keep in mind this isn't the finished
product so a lot of the features like
text or crop have interface elements
here but just don't work right now and
there's other features like timeline
which aren't included here at all so
we're assuming it won't be in the first
version when it launches which is kind
of unfortunate for animators who are the
ones who could really benefit from a
mobile device for such a labor-intensive
process so we're gonna try to use the
functions that are available and see how
far we can get with that based on the
tools they've prioritised on having in
this first build Adobe's focus for
Photoshop on iPad is mainly for
compositing so I'm gonna take a photo of
carly Rae Jepson and make it look like
she's building a sword I'm gonna go
ahead and import some photos and this
version of Photoshop can let you import
photos from iCloud Drive Google Drive
and Dropbox I'm going to go to my camera
roll and open up this photo of Carly and
then I'm gonna add the picture of the
sword
and I can resize the sword and rotate it
and bring that closer to her except
she's holding it and I'm going to just
hear it and this might take a while no
need to be too precise
we got the idea to undo you can tap with
two fingers I'm almost there
this is gonna look so good and now I'm
gonna adjust the opacity of the sort so
you can look through and see the part of
the hand where she's actually holding it
and then I'm gonna erase that there you
have it
carly rae jepsen holding a sword I'm
mostly an illustrator so while Photoshop
stand missing from the app store
I found an alternative apps like
procreate and clips to do that work for
me same goes for the photographers
designers and motion graphics artists on
the Verge's art department who each
found their own preferred apps to work
on but we've asked them to take a look
at the new Photoshop to give their
thoughts and what if they can see
themselves using the half what's going
on it's Al's Castro from the verge of a
no shooter and designer hi my name is
Michelle and I do photo retouching hi
I'm will I'm the design director for The
Verge I was able to test out the new
Photoshop program on the iPad it was
actually really fun because I got to
leave my tusks and work on photos which
normally I don't get to do I have to
stand at my desk or sit at my desk and
work but this time I actually got to
pick up this iPad go to the couch sit
down and I've got to edit which is
really fun and really exciting so you're
kind of tracing something or you're
drawing you can just rotate it so if I'm
outlining something I want to get really
close it's just nice to be able to like
turn and coloring I think we've all
grown up coloring on paper so doing
something like this is kind of just
instinctual as somebody coming from a
desktop environment using professionally
every single day coming to a touch-based
UI for Photoshop is really confusing on
the computer I have a lot of the
keystrokes so the keisters that I've
memorized in here I can't I don't have a
keystroke I didn't have a keyboard to
use and so I had to click around to try
to figure out how do I invert a mess and
for a retoucher who gets lots of images
a day time is of the essence so it does
have this modifier button that allows
you to toggle between say paintbrush and
eraser so let's say your paintbrush and
your coloring in Andrews hair and you
went too far over you can just press it
says you grace now I can just erase one
thing I did notice
my hand got a little bit sort using this
pen the Wacom pen that I use a little
bit more cushioned molds to my hand a
little bit better but I felt my fingers
on my palm getting a little bit sore
with how I had to grip this pen I can
see us being very useful in the future
once Adobe adds and a lot of their
features that nobody else can get type K
integration Creative Cloud integration
and the mere fact that you can open up
Photoshop files natively on the iPad is
huge so I currently use Adobe sketch and
adobe draw and one of the benefits of
that is that I can save these files as
PSD and they upload right to Creative
Cloud which is kind of what their Google
Docs for Adobe once it's uploaded I can
just go to my desktop open that folder
and jump right in the PSD automatically
what's going to be nice is I'm going to
be able to work the other way that I can
save something on the desktop save it to
the Creative Cloud and then I can open
it up in the app itself something you
can't do right now as for pricing it's
gonna be included as part of the
Creative Cloud bundle so if you already
pay a subscription for Photoshop and
you've already invested in an iPad pro
great if not there might be one-time fee
for the app maybe another monthly fee we
don't know yet and what does this mean
for other Creative Cloud apps does this
mean that illustrator and after-effects
could be coming to the iPad someday
Adobe says it's definitely something
it's considering in the future so that's
our first look at Photoshop for the iPad
coming in 2019
something we're not going to replace
your entire desktop but it's gonna be a
really great extension of your workflow
speaking of workflow you can go check
out our newest episode of workflow in
which you can learn how to make an
animated gif in Photoshop but you
actually can't do on the iPad because
it's not there yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
