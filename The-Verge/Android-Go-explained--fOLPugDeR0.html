eight hundred dollars on a phone they're
using specs like octa-core processor is
four gigabytes of RAM 64 gigabytes of
storage just really top to your stuff
that's gonna run great for there are
live huge markets like India where
people can only afford much much cheaper
phones we're talking $100 or so and in
those markets Android doesn't work so
well it can be sluggish and unresponsive
now Google is trying to fix that
hundred-dollar phone experience with
something called Android Go
technically Android oreo go Edition but
that's a mouthful it's a new
stripped-down version of Android they're
supposed to make the operating system
run better on phones without a lot of
processing power and ramp here's how it
works first
even though Android Go looks just like
normal Android it's been optimized to
work phones that have one gigabyte of
RAM or less this is actually the first
time the Google assistant has been able
to run on hardware just basic which is
an important addition now I've been
testing these bones in the past few days
and they don't run as smooth as a pixel
but that's not the point
they still run pretty well and in the
past phones this cheap have had trouble
just opening apps
the real question though is how they're
gonna perform a year from now and right
now that's just impossible to say the
second big change we can see much more
clearly Android and Android apps now
take up way less space the default
install size is a little over three gigs
that's as opposed to 5 or 6 to go bytes
a forehand which is a huge savings
especially considering these phones like
we had 8 gigabytes of storage to begin
with a lot of that storage saving comes
from apps Google has replaced all of
androids default apps with go edition
apps says Maps go Gmail go Google go
there just like the normal version of
the apps in the most part but Google is
stripped away extraneous features that
it thinks won't be that useful in these
markets and in doing so they know they
will bring the size of them way down if
you do have a go Edition phone it's not
like you're limited from getting the
normal versions of these apps either you
can still go and download the full Gmail
if you want it it's just gonna take up
more space
these apps also help you save on mobile
data one of the big ones is YouTube go
it lets you download videos for offline
viewing and it'll tell you exactly how
much data you're
use when you go to stream of video
that's a huge help if you're in a
country with a very limited and
expensive data plan here at Mobile World
Congress Google introduced the first six
Android go phones it's expecting a lot
more in the future so far my favorite is
the Nokia one which has these colorful
interchangeable back shells it's not the
nicest phone in the world but it has a
decent screen and a nice design and
compared to some of the other options
that's definitely a standout ultimately
performance still comes down to the
hardware manufacturer and how much extra
software they choose to bog down the
phone with Android goat isn't a silver
bullet for all the problems with low-end
Android phones most Android go phones
will be in the 50 to 130 dollar range
though we sold everywhere including in
the US but Google is really targeting
markets where people are buying their
first smart phones and even a $200 phone
is seen as a luxury Android go needs to
run well enough to convince people to
not go and buy another feature phone if
all this sounds familiar it's probably
because you're thinking of Android 1
that was a similar program Google
started a few years back to help
manufacturers make good cheap Android
phones but the program kind of died off
and it's since been revamped as a stock
Android program which is cool but not at
all what the program started out as
Google seems to have learned from that
failure instead of approaching things
from the hardware side it's now going in
through software and after all software
is Google's strong suit
Android goat isn't going to fix cheap
smartphones overnight or even this year
but it does seem to be moving Android in
the right direction now Google just has
to convince consumers the Android Go is
a good thing to have on their phone hey
