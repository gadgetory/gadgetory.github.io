we're looking at moto maker this is how
you design your Moto X it's available to
no one right now but eventually it's
coming to 18t customers and hopefully to
everyone soon after that this is the
real hook of this phone so it's a very
sort of nice looking googly tool on
those do you click get started and it
shows you this is what your phone looks
like right now so you can see on the
back you can pick any bunch of different
colors they're sorted out by you know
the boring colors the warm colors the
cool colors it's just there are 18
different options and this is how it's
showing them to you and you can pick
your color and it automatically shows in
real time what your phone is going to
look like and then you can go to the
front and you pick either black or white
and the phone will automatically change
what it is depending on which you pick
so then you pick the accent now you have
lots of options to the other two and
these are sore their own unique colors
it's not totally clear why you can't
pick these for other things but you get
different options here then the next
thing is if you want to have an
engraving on the back of your phone and
what we've discovered is i can write
this is david's and let me do that it'll
show me what it looks like on the back
you can only have it on one line so you
can't write a novel if you want to but
there's lots of things that it won't let
you say so you can't write the word
apple says we'd rather you not say that
how about another tribe doesn't like
samsung very much i can try huawei
huawei is cool but basically the honest
truth is you probably shouldn't put an
inscription on here because whatever you
put three months from now you're
inevitably going to eight so throughout
the whole process it jumps to whatever
things you want to look at the accents
or the back or the front but any time
you can just turn on the 360 view and
it'll actually let you just move around
the phone as you want to this tool is a
little bit buggy and slow right now but
I guess that's why it's not available to
everybody so this as of now is exactly
what my phone looks like from every
imaginable angle the rest of it is
picking which kind of phones that you
want here I'm just getting a 16 gig you
can have it say something when you turn
on the phone you can say like sup bro
and that's what my phone is going to say
to me every time it turns on so what's
kind of cool is you can automatically
have it all personalized for you when
you first turn on the phone which is
kind of neat so you can pick your
wallpaper there
cool ones I like some I really hate a
bunch of the other ones and then you can
set it to sign into Google account and
once you're logged in this means it will
all be set up on your phone as soon as
you turn it on so once you've set up the
phone the exact way you want it to you
can style some of your accessories you
can get a wall charger that looks the
way you wanted to and you can have
headphones in a bunch of different
colors Sol Republic is the partner here
and they'll actually select headphones
that they think match your phone so I
had those the order they're 3995 extra
it can change that however many times i
want i can choose between a white and
black wall charger and then once you're
done it's just a matter of checking to
make sure your phone looks exactly the
way you want it to you can change any
options you want obviously right up
until the very end so then all I have to
do is click process order and because
it's made in Texas or assembled in Texas
anyway this phone will be to me in four
days that's how it's going to work for
all 18t customers when it comes out and
hopefully be expanded to many more
customers very soon so that's the moto
maker tool it's not super different than
what you might have thought but it's
pretty cool and I'm going to spend a lot
of time customizing this phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
