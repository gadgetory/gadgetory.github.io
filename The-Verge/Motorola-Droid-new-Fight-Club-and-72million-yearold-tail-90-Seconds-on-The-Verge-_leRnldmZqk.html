cycrin I just saw the sixth sense for
the first time and nights awesome this
is 90 seconds on the verge Motorola
unveiled three new phones today and no
none of them are the oft rumored moto x
droid ultra droid mini and Droid Maxx or
verizon exclusives these phones feel
transitional from what we've seen
they're more Google infuse than anything
Motorola has done before and seem very
close to stock Android probably the
biggest software change is touchless
control the trigger is ok Google now at
which point it will listen for
instruction as for the Moto X that's
still expected to be revealed next
thursday at its own event it looks like
enough people broke the first rule of
fight club because it's coming back
author chuck palahniuk confirmed on his
website yesterday that he is in the
early stages of planning a graphic novel
series set ten years after the events
the first book while there's no word on
a release date anytime soon palahniuk
says we may see it earlier than 2015
being released in serialized graphic
form now we just wait to see if he'll
bring meat loaf back and finally big
news for dinosaur fans and no it's not
another land before time film scientist
in Mexico unearthed the tale of a 72
million year old dinosaur and it's a
nearly perfect condition the 50
vertebrae that were dug up once formed
the basis for a 15-foot tale that was
attached to a 40-foot dinosaur the
species is still unknown but it's
believed to be a hadrosaur a duck-billed
dinosaur scientists can uncover a 72
million year old dinosaur and I can't
even find my phone when it falls on the
couch and that's it for today's top
stories coming up tomorrow i watch lady
in the water the happening the last
airbender and after earth it's going to
be awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
