who is in charge of this project because
you're now blaming it on the contractors
in saying it's Verizon's fault so who is
responsible for overseeing this project
we are we on the site the site has had
serious problems I who is in charge
Madam Secretary the person now in charge
as an integrator is Q SSI one of our who
was in charge as it was in jail was in
charge up to that that team who is the
individual L Schneider is the Michelle
Snyder is the one responsible for this
debacle well excuse me congresswoman
Michelle Snyder is not responsible for
the debacle hold me accountable for the
debauch I'm responsible thank you I
yield back the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act came into effect in
2010 and now every American is required
to have health insurance the government
set up a website that was supposed to be
the easiest way for everyone to shop and
get enrolled and that was healthcare.gov
which is arguably the largest consumer
facing web app the government has ever
built I'm covered we're covered now
we're covered enroll now at the health
insurance marketplace at healthcare.gov
and on the first day October 1st 2013 it
didn't work today was the first
opportunity for millions of Americans to
go to these new exchanges and sign up
for insurance under Obamacare and it
turned out so many people tried to do
that Computers crashed you've probably
heard that healthcare.gov hasn't worked
as smoothly as it was supposed to work
there were major problems all over the
country web sites were slow or crashed
all together leaving a lot of folks
angry and frustrated healthcare.gov as
the website is known that's some serious
glitches into its system yesterday
there's gonna be a lot of evaluation of
how we got to this country
healthcare.gov has been called
disappointing frustrating a fiasco and a
debacle and it's
when most people are used to using lots
of websites that are well-designed and
pretty much work well all the time the
terribleness of healthcare.gov is
frankly scary especially when you
consider that the government is only
gonna have to build more web sites not
fewer
now everyone from the President to his
Republican critics to Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs are talking about what's
wrong with the federal IT process and
how do we fix it I think if you look at
this from a long-term perspective we're
in a really dangerous spot when it comes
to government so think about Moore's law
so Moore's law says that technology gets
twice as good or half as expensive every
18 months and that's that's an
exponential law so there's a you know a
curve that's sort of you know the sort
of quintessential hockey stick curve and
the problem is is that government has an
efficiency problem when it comes to
acquiring technology and so it's sort of
behind that curve and as we progress
through technology's growth that gap
between what government has access to
and what the public has access to is
growing further and further and further
apart I don't care whether you're a
Democrat or a Republican a conservative
of socialist of libertarian whatever you
want to call yourself I think what you
want is for your government to be able
to operate well the problem is is that
if the gap between the public sector and
the private sector grows too wide then
government's not able to provide
services to the public well or it has to
spend an enormous amount of cost to try
and keep up with the private sector's
expectations and I think that's really
dangerous long term for the health of
the country there is a larger problem
that I probably could have identified
earlier and that is the way the federal
government does procurement and does IT
is just generally not very efficient I
think it's fair to say that we have a
pretty good track record of working with
folks on technology and IT from our
campaign both in 2008 and 2012 we we did
a pretty darn good job on that on my
campaign I could simply say who are the
best folks out there
let's get them around a table let's
figure out what we're doing
and we're just gonna continue to improve
it and refine it and work on our goals
if you're doing at the federal
government level you know you're going
through you know 40 pages of specs and
this and that the other and they're all
kinds of laws involved right now the
procurement process basically says that
you have to buy a website like you buy a
battleship how many different companies
ended up working on the final product
the contract that CMS ended up using to
fulfill most of this work had 16
contractors on it and if you go through
and look at all of their subcontractors
there's you know at least a dozen more
it was basically everyone you would
expect in terms of big government
contracting players so a bunch of these
technology contractors and contractors
who just kind of do everything so you'll
see them contracting for pretty much
every agency oftentimes you see things
like healthcare.gov pop up where you
have subpar vendors who have subpar
talent working on projects because they
don't have to compete and regulation
prevents them from hiring some of the
best talent to work on this stuff
building a website for the government
isn't as simple as building one for say
a startup not only are there rules such
as the Federal Acquisition regulations
that limit how the government can buy
things but there are many archaic
regulations you have to navigate as well
like relatively low salary caps for
employees of government contractors and
onerous laws like the paperwork
reduction Act for every information
collection that the federal government
puts out they have to put that
information out to public comment before
the before that information collection
can sort of be put out so wording of
every question yeah in 2009 the
president tried to tweet a question to
the public and was prohibited from doing
so because that would have been
considered an information collection now
those rules have since changed a bit so
the president can now end a tweet in a
question mark but it's still a
preposterous law and a preposterous
amount of legislation that really
prohibits you know if you're a web
designer half of what you're doing with
web design is making forms and those all
require these arduous public notice
processes that don't make any sense the
contractors that built healthcare.gov
all large Beltway insiders like CGI
and Lockheed Martin were actually
selected years before the Affordable
Care Act passed before anybody knew we'd
be building a health insurance exchange
that's because the government likes to
buy things using broad indefinite
delivery indefinite quantity or IDIQ
contracts that can cover all an agency's
projects for up to 10 years this speeds
things up a bit but it's not the way any
technologist would decide who should
build a website technology evolves
quickly and critics say these long-term
contracts ensure the government gets
left behind I think that just encourages
entrenchment and it makes them less
likely to embrace some other concepts
that are fundamental to technology so
iterating quickly and you know popular
one among startups is failing hard and
fast so the idea is to fail before you
scale so large that you affect that many
people I think in a time right now I
feel like in the age of the Internet
where technology is changing by the
month that that's totally inappropriate
the exchange is comprised of six complex
systems and involves 55 contractors
including CGI federal five government
agencies 36 states and more than 300
insurers with more than 4,500 insurance
plans all coming together in healthcare
gov right now there's no central
technology authority inside of the
federal government that doesn't exist
there's nobody who can say hey you know
that except for the president I guess
could probably get on the phone with
with Secretary Sebelius and say hey fix
healthcare.gov I'm pretty sure that
conversations already happened but for
the most part the staff of the White
House can't just sort of Trump over to
an agency and say hey you do this that's
not the way the government works the
insurance marketplace at healthcare.gov
is a keystone of the Affordable Care Act
it's supposed to allow anyone to shop
and compare plans from different
insurance companies guaranteeing the
best rate and then actually purchase
that insurance for themselves and their
families now the laws opponents are
trying to use the busted website as an
argument to repeal the entire law for
want of a website health care reform
could be lost
anything that the federal government
does usually ends up being too expensive
to afford and that certainly is what we
have seen with the website and
unfortunately what our constituents are
beginning to realize it's going to
transpire with their health care what do
you think is the fix at this point
there's only one fix for Obamacare got a
repeal it
this is his Network gun I mean it's
that's the only fix we tried to delay it
we had a big fight about it now people
know why we fought so hard I'm gonna see
how bad it is when they see what's the
notices they're getting your policies
being dropped increase in premiums
you're not gonna be able keep your own
doctor the website doesn't work you
can't compare price now they know why we
fought so hard the only answer is to
repeal this the president had to
apologize for a website in the Rose
Garden
like you know that's never happened
before this is a significant moment for
information technology and government
but that doesn't have anything to do
with the Affordable Care Act other than
this was the vessel you know for the
Affordable Care Act's implementation
that law has been passed I don't think
that because the website broke it
nullifies the spirit of the law or the
the intent behind it I think that it is
indicative not of repealing the
Affordable Care Act but fixing the
procurement policies and regulations
that caused this failure to happen
because they will happen again and again
and again there's probably no bigger gap
between the private sector and the
public sector than IT and we've seen
that in for example the VA and the
Department of Defense trying to deal
with electronic medical records for our
servicemen as they move into civilian
life we've now had about a decade of
experimentation spent billions of
dollars and it's still not working the
way it should so what we probably needed
to do on the front end was to blow up
how we procure for IT healthcare.gov has
become more stable since its launch but
its failure highlighted a bigger problem
the administration failed to bring the
same technology literacy that helped
Obama get elected with them into the
White House missing an opportunity to
reform outdated policies and set up the
federal government for success pretend
America is a car and it's sputtering
down the road
it's a big car and we're having a debate
in Congress about how we can make that
car go faster what the Democrats say is
in order to make the car go faster what
we have to do is put more gasoline in
the engine what the Republicans say is
no what we need to do is throw half of
the car go out the back of the car what
I'm trying to say is none of you guys
are paying attention to the fact that we
have a one mile per gallon engine and
maybe what maybe the gains to be
realized aren't in cutting spending or
increasing taxes but increasing the
efficiency of the way that we spend the
money this idea of how government uses
technology isn't like a backroom issue
that's for the management wants it's
something that we've all got a care
about like we care about global warming
and climate change and like we care
about the deficit and the budget think
about what good it would do if the
government was spending its money not on
you know 16 giant contractors CGI
federal is a Canadian company but on
small homra are our own small homegrown
technology businesses that have been so
innovative and and smart in the past
