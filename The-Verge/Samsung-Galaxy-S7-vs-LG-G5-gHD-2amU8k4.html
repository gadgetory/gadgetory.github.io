in Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
and in front of me I've got one hour
probably the biggest announcements from
the show
I've got Samsung's flagship that were
just announced and then LG's flagship
phone that was just announced these are
probably the biggest Android phones of
the year short of Google's own Nexus
program which will probably see later in
the year but in front of me I've got
Samsung's Galaxy s7 edge then the
Samsung Galaxy s7 and the LG g5 what's
interesting about these is there's a lot
of similarities but then there's a lot
of differences where the two companies
kind of went different directions with
what they're going with Samsung's
obviously you've got two different sizes
the s7 is 5.1 inch display and the s7
Edge has a larger 5.5 inch screen with
the curved edges on the sides they're
giving it that edge moniker there the
back is all glass on Samsung's with the
metal edges you see on both of these
devices whereas LG has a full metal
design all the way around as opposed to
a glass back there's a couple other
differences in the displays themselves
LG has a partial backlight display LCD
whereas the Samsung's are using the
Super AMOLED two screens they're all the
same resolutions quad HD of course and
they do all have an always-on component
so when you turn the screen off you can
see you've got always on display for
both of them Samsung's is a bit more
advanced you can do a bit more
customization you show the clock you can
show calendar you can show an image it's
full color obviously and it's quite a
bit brighter but these are make it
easier to see the time and notifications
and things like that in terms of build
design the chief 5 is definitely a
little bit smaller than the s7 edge but
the S of an edge is curved design really
makes it really comfortable to hold even
though it has such a large display it
really doesn't feel as big as it does in
when it's in your hand
Samsung's screen is also frankly a bit
brighter and more brilliant than LG's
but both of them are very sharp screens
LG has a fingerprint scanner on the back
Samsung's is down here at the home
button but they both kind of function
the same way around back of course is
the cameras LG is doing a
little bit different of an approach this
year it's got two camera modules you got
an E major pixel camera for wide-angle
shots and then a closer camera with 16
megapixels and then Samsung's is a
single 12 megapixel sensor it has been
newly revamped this year with better
low-light performance and a brighter
lens of course the other thing that's
really different between these two
devices is LG's g5 has a modular
component so you can actually take the
bottom off of the g5 here you can swap
the battery you can put in other modules
such as an audio enhancement a camera
grip in addition to just an extra
battery so you can kind of have more
flexibility there Samsung's phone
doesn't have a removable battery but
it's got very large 3600 milliamp hour
battery in the edge model and it also
has quick charging and wireless charging
the g5 has quick charging but no
wireless charging on this model a couple
other big differences between them
the Samsung's are water-resistant so you
can drop it in some water or get it wet
without worrying about damaging your
device and then LG is using a Type C
charging port whereas Samsung is using
microUSB these devices are going to be
probably the most interesting and
biggest Android devices this year you'll
be able to get them very soon you can
pre-order Samsung's right now and it's
expected to hit stores on March 11th
LG's pre-orders are going to be opening
up in the near future and we expect to
see that in April so you go that's quick
look at the Samsung Galaxy s7 galaxy s7
edge and the LG g5 here at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona for more be sure
