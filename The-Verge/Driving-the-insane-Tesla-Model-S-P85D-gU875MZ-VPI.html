CitiField where it is 13 degrees it is
definitely not baseball season the
reason we're here is because we're with
the tesla model s p85d which in addition
to being all-wheel-drive is the fastest
production sedan and one of the fastest
sedans ever made it's absurdly fast and
we have the luxury of testing it today
in one of Citi field's parking lot so
we're gonna do that right now oh I need
to remember to now I can't do that cuz
that's too far back I'm just gonna go
ahead and take the whiplash let's do
this
the break sign is late enough so that it
freaks you out just a little bit you're
like I need to stop accelerating
I just got a reminder that I'm going
over the speed limit because it saw the
25 mile an hour sign maybe next time
we'll push a little harder but according
to the display here I'm an Elon Musk's
car so I don't want to do anything bad
oh my god now we're gonna go through the
snow we're gonna stop and then see how
the all-wheel drive performs on this
very snowy surface here let's see what
happens I kind of want to do a donut but
I don't think Tesla Yard would
appreciate that tonight what would
happen if I were to floor it right now
okay this car is stupid fast Tesla
literally calls it insane in the
settings menu and I think that's a very
apt description for it the car is over
$100,000 so it's not cheap but if you
need something go 0 to 60 in 3.2 seconds
you had that kind of money you can go
get get this car right now and hopefully
it's not the last time that I'm gonna be
able to drive it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
