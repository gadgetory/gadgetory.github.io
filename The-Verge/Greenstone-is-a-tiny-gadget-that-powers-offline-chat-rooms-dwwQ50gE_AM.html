and that today we're looking at green
stone
it's a sort of weird hardware widget up
from the chat app fire chat fire Chad
does everything through mesh networking
so if you don't have connectivity to the
larger internet you can just connect
directly from phone to phone the problem
with that is there's a really limited
range so unless you have a lot of phones
in one place it can be hard to make any
kind of network so their answer is this
thing which is going to sort of fill the
gap between the phone so you can see
there's instructions on the back on how
to use it so this is basically the thing
if you shake it it lights up to kind of
wake it up and look for connections to
other phones the idea is instead of
having a lot of phones in the same place
all the phones will connect to this now
everything's happening over bluetooth
which doesn't really reach very far they
say 90 feet which is optimistic but
basically you want a line of sight it's
the same way your phone connects to a
SmartWatch or a headset any sort of
short range wireless tech so you need a
lot of these in one place if it's going
to work at all there are best successes
being in basically crowds of people they
do a lot of electronic music shows
burning man that sort of thing if you
get that it means all of you can be in
the same chat room and the chat room
just lives on this it can hold a
thousand messages at once and it never
needs to connect to a cell tower or a
satellite or sort of any larger server
everything's just on your phone and in
this guy and also you can leave and come
back so I could you know message Jake on
this walk out of the room Jake comes
back and connects to this and the
message would live on this and then send
to him which is great because Bluetooth
connections are kind of flaky so this is
still a prototype they're not selling
these but they're probably gonna be
handing them out at some electronic
music shows over the next six months
it's cool I'm excited to see if it works</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
