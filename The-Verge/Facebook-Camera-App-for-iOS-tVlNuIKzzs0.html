checking out facebook camera for iphone
which was just announced and is rolling
out to the app store in the next couple
hours the app is built to be the best
way for you to bulk upload photos and
browse photos that others have posted to
Facebook so when you open it up you see
there's a camera icon up here that pops
you straight into a camera app that lets
you turn on and off the flash you can
flip around to the front facing camera a
video team and you can also look at the
photos you just shot and inside this
screen the key feature is that you can
actually tap these green checkmarks to
upload up to 30 pictures straight to
Facebook and these will all be within
one story on your timeline so you can
see there's all and selected which lets
you just view your selected photos and
if you tap an individual photo you can
actually crop without constraints you
can crop the photo you can rotate it
every direction you can add filters
which is really interesting because
Facebook just bought Instagram and there
are 15 here and none of them are as good
as the ones you'd find in Instagram but
they are interesting and provide a way
to add some color to your photos so once
you're done messing with your photos you
can upload them using this blue button
right here so let's say I'm going to do
these three of the verge video team so
I'll say video team and for now since
this is top secret I'm going to make
this available only for me you can add
photos there if you want to add a
location tag people inside of your
photos and then post so once you post
those photos they pop directly into your
newsfeed which is actually pretty cool
and is a nice segue into the next thing
I want to look at which is just the
photos nude feet newsfeed in general you
can browse through photos that other
people have posted and tagged and you
can like a photo you can comment on a
photo in a brand new interface that's
actually really nice as you scroll down
you can just keep going and browse so
it's kind of like a newsfeed just for
your photos if you
do tap a specific person like James here
you can view just photos he's uploaded
and if you tap that arrow right there
you can actually launch straight into
his profile on the Facebook primary app
you can also pick me up here to view
just photos on your wall or photos that
you've been tagged in which is nice
because it's a lot more streamlined than
through the normal facebook app and
there really aren't any settings to be
had right now there's no video uploading
but it works pretty great for batch
uploading photos one of the thing is
that you can tag people inside the
photos and they actually stay stay
tagged to even if you so let's just do
this for example they stay tagged even
if you move to another photo which is
nice in case you want to upload it later
and that is facebook camera for iphone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
