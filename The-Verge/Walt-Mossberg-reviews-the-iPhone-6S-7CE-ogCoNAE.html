deal
he's been reviewing consumer tech
products for 24 years you know how there
are tech reviews on the internet meant
for actual humans yeah he basically
invented that and now he's here with us
at the verge reviewing the iPhone 6s
it is this fast I gotta tell you hi this
is what Mossberg columnist for The Verge
and this week I want to tell you about
the best version of the best smartphone
on the market new iPhone 6s the
principal new feature in this phone is
that they have built the screen in such
a way that it now recognizes the
pressure of your touch it actually can
figure out that you're pressing and how
hard you're pressing and it can do
different things for instance we ran a
list of emails here if I press hard
enough you can see that I get a peek at
the email I press a little harder the
whole email opens and that Apple calls
that a pop point is I can quickly go and
get a better sense of my email without
the tedium of opening it then going back
to the list and then going to the next
one and so forth while the iPhone was
already I think the best smartphone
camera around they've actually improved
the camera significantly this time
they've gone from 8 megapixels to 12
megapixels and that by itself doesn't
always mean you get better pictures but
they've taken some steps in the sensor
and the optics to give you better
pictures
pictures on this unbelievable the front
camera is going to 5 megapixels you see
you get better selfies 4 videos get an
even better feature which is you get 4k
video and you can see the difference
they also have a new kind of still photo
alive photos the phone takes
one-and-a-half seconds of video on
either side of the still picture and the
picture actually moves and you can even
get sound overall the phone is
significantly faster without sacrificing
battery life it had about the same
battery life as the phone last year but
there must be some downsides to it and
there are a couple number one budget you
don't have 650 bucks for the base model
of this you don't buy it the carriers
and now Apple itself will sell you this
on an installment plan with no interest
but it is a $650 thing and that's just
for starters
secondly memory it's time Apple to not
make your base model have only 16
gigabytes of storage it should be at
least 32 gigabytes and it shouldn't cost
more for the base model than it does now
but all in all I don't have any big
complaints about this and I think this
is a terrific</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
