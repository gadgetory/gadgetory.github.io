we are here at the New York
International Auto Show i standing right
behind me is quite possibly the most
expensive SUV ever made this is the
Jaguar Land Rover SV autobiography when
if autobiography that's a Range Rover
term for really really expensive we're
talking just under two hundred thousand
dollars we'll get you a five liter v8
550 horsepower engine
really loving the outside we can see
it's very nice it's got a what they call
a Santorini black on top
someone will match black on the bottom
but the real story here is the interior
and it's just nothing if not luxurious
everything looks a little sewn together
it's a lot of like cables that will
deploy and twist and turn and cup
holders that are or portably chill the
back itself has a deployable fancy table
for ride I don't know
really nice beer pong in the Hamptons
and I joke we're like this is the thing
they said this is a card meant to be
seen at the Hamptons it is as he put it
it looks expensive because it is I'm
pretty sure to what they're saying is
the price itself is a selling point and
in Jaguar Range Rovers case that is
probably a pretty good selling point
there aren't a lot of luxury cities out
there right now there will be a bitly
it's been talking about making one aston
martin might do a rolls-royce Maseratis
that a lot of big luxury car makers
looking to get the sv game and so at
this point Jaguar a Range Rover is kind
of sitting alone at the top of the pile
and by that I mean a giant pile of cash
it's exactly what you're gonna need if
you want to buy this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
