adrianne jeffries wishing compact disc a
happy healthy and prosperous 30th
birthday this is 90 seconds on the verge
as expected Twitter is now laying the
groundwork to take back Twitter last
night the company unveiled version 1.1
of its API which has much stricter
guidelines and ultimately gives Twitter
more control over how third-party apps
use the service current and future apps
will now have a user limit that will
require developers to work with Twitter
directly the best way to avoid all this
of course is to use Twitter as it was
intended via SMS 18t is confirmed it
will offer facetime over cellular
without any extra charges that's the
good news now here's the catch the
feature only works if you switch to 18
tease new mobile share plan which lets
multiple devices use the same data
bucket all other AT&amp;amp;T plans including
legacy users with unlimited data are out
of luck net neutral not really but hey
there's always skype HP is returning to
the consumer tablet market according to
an internal memo the new Mobility unit
will be run by Alberto Torres who
previously headed up amigo operations at
Nokia torrez's team will be focused on
consumer in small business tablets but
that mysterious slate recently teased in
commercials is still coming from hp's
notebook group we wouldn't bet on a
return to webos or me go but we're
really hoping they double down on Tizen
that's it for today's top stories tune
in tomorrow as Apple and Samsung return
to the Supreme Court for the 11th time
to fight for your right to text and
watch video at the same time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
