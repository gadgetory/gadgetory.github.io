most important phone but you'd be wrong
it's actually the Moto G which is become
Motorola's most successful smartphone
ever thanks to a killer combination of
high quality features and a bargain
price now one rule is for finding the
Moto G yet again for 2015 and a new
version is just as impressive the first
thing you'll notice about the new Moto G
is that motorola isn't taking shortcuts
on design anymore
this is a good-looking phone in fact
it's basically a plastic version of the
flagship Moto X you can even customize
its face back and accent colors to make
something really flashy and fun the
backplate can also be swapped out later
if you want to keep changing it up I
didn't choose this combination but it's
pretty nice for a tone down look this
year's Moto G is also water resistant
that means it should be able to survive
splashes and spills into small puddles
or the toilet you can't actually use the
phone when it's underwater but you
probably don't want to test that out any
more than you have to
my one real gripe about this year's
design is that the Moto G's back is just
a bit bulbous a lot of people probably
won't have a problem with that but it
makes the phone's 5-inch display harder
to use one-handed then on a phone with
slim bezels and a flat back the display
is also one of the Moto G's weaker spots
if 720p resolution is fine enough but
the display is set back just a bit from
the glass and its color to me a bit
muted the end result is that you often
feel like there's an imperceptible haze
between you and the screen it's entirely
usable but it's clear that this is part
of what it took to get the Moto G's
price down you'd think the same would be
true of the funds performance but it
actually does a great all-around job
weather-wise browsing Chrome or playing
games pretty much everything launched
quickly and ran smoothly its battery
lasts me well through the day too but
it's important to note that I've been
using the upgraded model of the Moto G
which costs $40 more and has twice the
amount of RAM so I can't speak to
performance on the entry model the Moto
G's solid performance is probably helped
by the fact that Motorola doesn't bloat
it up with weird software the Moto G is
basically running stock android 5.1 with
the few bonus motorola features like
discreet notification pop-ups when you
turn the phone over what I really loved
was its gestures especially one that
lets you twist the phone to activate its
camera the camera starts fast as it is
so this made it incredibly quick to
start shooting a photo
unfortunately the actual
photos aren't quite as amazing photos
look pretty good when you're zoomed out
and they're filling up the screen once
you zoom in they start to fall apart
basically nothing is sharp and they look
really digital you'll get some solid
instagrams and snaps out of the Moto G's
camera but it's nothing that you'd want
to print out the final thing I want to
mention is one of the biggest updates to
this year's Moto G every model now comes
with support for LTE it might seem weird
to praise that in 2015 but LTE hasn't
really been present in low cost phones
until recently LTE was a huge help for
me too especially when the Wi-Fi in my
apartment was having trouble the Moto G
starts at 170 $9.99 for a model with one
gigabyte of RAM and eight gigabytes of
storage for two $19.99 you can double
that to two gigabytes of RAM and 16
gigabytes of storage the extra RAM is
probably worth springing for but in both
cases you can always have more storage
with a micro SD card that pricing is
what makes this phone so impressive at
$600 these shortcomings would be a huge
problem at 200 it's surprising just how
close the Moto G gets to all-around
success motorola has been searching for
a winning smartphone formula ever since
the join button fizzled out we all
expected it to be something just as
expensive and flashy but we were all
looking in the wrong place
Motorola's new winner is inexpensive
it's unassuming it's the Moto G</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
