at CES 2017 I'm checking out Samsung's
Chromebook plus and Chromebook pro
they're pretty much the same looking
computer this is the latest Chromebook
from Samsung it was built in
collaboration with Google and it
features a couple of things that we've
not seen on Chromebooks before for
starters it's super thin it's just over
half an inch thick
it's an all-metal finish it's just under
two and a half pounds so it's really
light as well it's got a twelve and a
half inch screen quad HD resolution it's
full touch screen if you notice you can
see you can flip it around to make it a
tablet it's got a full 360 hinge now
that's all kind of good and well but
what really makes us different from
other Chromebooks is the fact that's got
built-in stylus so it's got support for
writing on the screen you can take notes
you can draw you can capture screenshots
and no tane annotate Google's actually
built some special technologies that
uses the cloud to improve writing on the
screen it can predict what you're trying
to write to make the response better
than before otherwise it's got a full
keyboard a trackpad up to eight hours of
battery life and it runs Chrome OS and
has access to the Google Play Store so
you've got tons of Android app so you
can install on it you can use Google key
you can use Evernote you can use other
note-taking apps with the stylus so that
this kind of device can flip between
productivity and entertainment and back
again really easily it's really google's
answer to the iPad pro and Sam the
Microsoft Surface pro but it's in a
Chromebook which means it's a lot less
expensive so this is about four hundred
and forty nine dollars for this
Chromebook plus Chromebook pro it's
gonna be a little bit more expensive the
only really difference between them is
that the plus has an ARM processor and
the pro has an Intel Core processor so
if you need a little more power you'll
want to go with the pro when that
becomes available but the plus is going
to be available next month starting at
449 bucks we'll have plenty more to say
when we get
it then</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
