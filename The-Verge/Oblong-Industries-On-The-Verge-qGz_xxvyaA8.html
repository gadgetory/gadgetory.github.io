art forms and one of the great languages
of obviously the 20th century and it's
still serving as well here in the 21st
century I think it's actually important
to study cinema for anyone who's
building you eyes anyone who's building
anything and it was interesting the
communication it's been ten years since
the film Minority Report came out it is
still the hallmark of the future of
interface these people at oblong
industries in Los Angeles they are the
minds behind it they may the interface
and they're building it and making your
reality let's check out what they're
doing as much as oblong is about
products and technology it's about ideas
and it's important to be expressing
those in every form that it's possible
to think of my name is John under
Koffler I am co-founder and chief
scientist of oblong when I first saw
John's work it completely blew my mind
and changed my view of what what you
could do with a computer you can take
the user interface and put it all over
the room and you know make make the the
interactive experience sort of part of
people's real world not part of people's
you know beige box is starting me in the
kind of early 90s so barely a decade
into modern UI based computer
computing it seemed foolishly and
naively to me that it was time for the
next one right why why aren't we
building the next UI 10 years seems like
long enough and it seemed important to
me that the that the UI was the focus of
attention right because the UI at the
end of the day is all we have do you
speak as Minority Report made flesh this
is a kind of typical installation of the
sort that we've been providing to our
early adopter customers like Boeing and
GE for for many many years now and it's
a kind of development system inside
which you can solve problems that you
can solve any other way you speak the
platform is fundamentally input and
output agnostic but in this case we're
using motion capture sensors that are
specifically configured to look for
these little tags each tag has a unique
constellation of retro-reflective dots
so it's basically 3m scotchlite material
and it allows the system to recover the
identity and the the three-dimensional
position and orientation of each finger
it was an early revelation that the
combination of incredibly detail
position and orientation information
with harshly quantized pose information
makes a really really robust system
that's what makes it so that it's user
independent anyone can put on these
gloves and immediately be using the
system we don't have to train it per
user and we went from command line
computing to graphical computing and
that was a big wholesale shift in and
how you think about what it is to use a
computer we are making that same shift
happen for today from just graphical
computing on one screen to computing
that is multi-user multi screen and
multi device so this is mezzanine this
is a conference room collaboration
product that we make care it oblong so
what you're looking at is a shared
workspace where we've got a collection
of sequence content which is a slideshow
that's what you're seeing in the the
middle of the screen here a collection
of assets that can be manipulated and
added to the slideshow like this one
where we've manufactured a set of three
sided wand input devices which are used
spatially to control our special
operating environment so you use these
things as handheld products to drag
something in space from one screen to
another or to manipulate an interface on
one screen there's two ways to build out
new technologies you can build kind of
top-down the most capable possible
version of the technology and starts out
expensive or you can build bottom-up
with inexpensive consumer class devices
that are probably not that capable but
get better and better every year we made
a decision early on a table that we
would build further for a while at least
we would build top down so we would
build the most capable systems we could
imagine and we would rely on Moore's law
and good engineering to sort of push
those prices down here over a year is
what we what we knew we would see is the
cost curve and the capability curves
intersecting I think we're right on the
edge of that point and you can see that
that intersection between the cost and
the capability curves our goal now is to
kind of push through that barrier and
get our version our fully capable
version of these spatial gestural multi
user interfaces out to everybody so this
is seismo and it's an earthquake
visualization in sandbox
there is no gloves involving this one
right so this is usgs data and it sits
about 128 thousand data points so as
you're noticing you can you can sit here
and just grab and interact with the data
and there's a couple different ways that
that we can interact with it so one is
to just kind of grab it if we flip
around we can set it back to kind of an
equi rectangular normal world map do
easily what was that I'm actually white
so it's okay
a reverse el yeah okay and I can just
pull my fist and kind of move around
correct all right let's go forward this
is going back the operating environment
thinks of role of pixels so you can put
screens in your environment and
basically use them as windows into a 3d
virtual space as opposed to this kind of
a continuation of a 2d space it's been
interesting for us to watch the
evolution of interfaces around tablets
and phones because there's been a lot of
interesting work from Microsoft and
Apple and and and the Android vendors
for us what all that works so far is
missing is the idea that it's an
anachronism to look at one screen at a
time and you know view that as you're
computing experience the next version of
all of our computing experience is going
to be multi screen and multi device we
have all these powerful screens and all
these pixels all around us all the time
we need to use them more effectively so
in the next year or so I think we're
gonna see a huge kind of efflorescence
of gestural and spatial input and more
and more understanding among lots of
different folks building computing
experiences that multi-screen is really
interesting
oblong is dedicated to the idea that
technology alone is no longer enough
technology and design have to be
conjoined have to be inseparable and
have to be part of the same development
process otherwise we're not going to get
anywhere valuable at all</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
