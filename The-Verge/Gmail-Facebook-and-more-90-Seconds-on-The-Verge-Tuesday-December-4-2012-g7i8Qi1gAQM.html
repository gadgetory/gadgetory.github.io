bugs of the gmail app but at least
you'll be able to search your inbox

messaging is rather crowded there's a
very popular and horribly named whatsapp
there's blackberry messenger kick and
even apples iMessage and although it's
only android for now it seems as though
facebook Messenger is destined for every
platform with a phone number basically
it's facebook Messenger without Facebook
