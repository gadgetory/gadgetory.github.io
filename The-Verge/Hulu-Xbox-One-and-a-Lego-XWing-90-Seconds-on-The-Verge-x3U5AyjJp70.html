group led by the former head of news

Morris Endeavor but it's not all doom
and gloom arrested development is
returning this weekend as an online
series oh right that's on Netflix it
looks like Microsoft is keeping some
xbox one feature secret for now polygon
reports that the new console will be
able to leverage skype for remote play
letting users hand off gameplay to a
friend if they're stuck at a
particularly difficult point the new
Kinect will also be able to participate
in more involved two-way conversations
noticing when a new player enters the
room and asking them who they are for
example it's not clear whether the new
features will be available at launch but
we wouldn't be surprised to hear more
about them at e3 and finally there's a
life-size x-wing made of Legos in Times
Square 32 people using 5 million lego
bricks created the replica at 43 feet
long and almost 46,000 pounds it's the
largest lego model in the world the
