every me for iphone a new part Google+
part path social network that tries to
build circles in a way that no such
social network has ever done before so
when you first open the app you can
actually connect it to your entire
address book which is the upper bounds
of everyone you're ever connected to
using every me so anyone in your address
book is going to make it into your
circles that you can share with but no
one else it takes the people in your
address book cross-references them with
Facebook Twitter and LinkedIn spends
five seconds doing some super intense
number crunching and comes out with
circles like family the verge for the
place that you work University of
Michigan New York for people who labeled
that they live there in facebook
Business Insider for my old co-workers
and even the auto created sweetheart if
you have anybody listed as your
significant other on Facebook so the
point of every me is to be able to share
with people in intimate circles just
like on google+ so you go to family
let's say and you have a cover photo
kind of like on facebook and the app
just really looks a lot like path which
is a good and a bad thing so you do
compose at the top you can tag it with
location a picture some text and as soon
as you hit share it's actually going to
be shared to everyone in my family via
their email address via the app if they
have it or if all else fails via text
message so that's one of the cool things
about the app is that all of this
information gets pushed out to people
even if they don't have the app and
that's one of the real cool features
here if you can get people to engage
with you on it so when people respond
via the app via email or via text
message all of the comments get
aggregated in one thread which is
actually pretty cool so if you want to
create a new circle to share with you
hit the plus sign and let's call this
one Disney hit next and you can choose
people that you want to put inside your
circles so the app hopes that it kind of
got down your basic circles that you
want to share things with on a
day-to-day basis but let's say I want to
add Billy do
knee to my circle I just want to share
with him I want a private thread for all
of our photos and text correspondence so
once I've checked them off I cancel and
I'm going to hit create so because I
have his email address information it's
going to default to that so if you see
sharing with two people here at apt
sharing and it says Billy Disney and
then there's Billy's verge email address
so i will say hi share and it's going to
share it with Billy so here's something
that I'm glad this came up it's called
magic stories so for any of your circles
you can turn this on or turn this off
and magic story is what they are is it's
kind of like a side note feature of the
app what it tries to do is look at
Facebook LinkedIn and Twitter to see
which things in your life might be
important so let's say a tweet of yours
got retweeted 10 times it might share it
with this circle or if you made an
announcement got a new job posting on
linkedin or let's say change your
relationship status on facebook it would
populate your circle with that
information so it's cool but it's also
kind of scary because while you can
choose which circles receive information
from magic magic moments magic stories
it's still kind of weird because it's
kind of like you'd want to share this
with these people anyway but you can't
always control what it deems is popular
so let's go back out to the settings you
can change the push notifications so
which is good because you're going to be
getting push notifications with this app
you can change your profile and add to
remove email addresses and phone numbers
you can change your circle settings too
so let's say for Disney I can change the
name of it if I want it to populate with
magic stories if I want push
notifications and but let's say there's
another scenario let's say my grandma
doesn't have a email address and doesn't
have the app so what you can do is add a
person manually so you add it with their
phone number and let's put brown put the
phone number and you hit ed and now
grandma
is going to be in a circle with you and
when you share something with Grandma
sit hi it's going to actually get pushed
to her phone which is interesting
because if it's a picture it'll get
pushed to her phone as a link and if
it's text it'll get pushed her phone as
a text message which she can reply to
and if she replies let's see if we can
get this working right now via grandma
if she replies it should pop right back
up inside of the application so every me
is cool but it's kind of a novelty
concept we kind of feel like it's more
of a feature that could work with in
something like Facebook and Google+
because not a lot of people want to
spend time picking which circles they
want to share with especially when it's
only on their iPhone so it's cool it's a
great concept but we're just not sure
this is the kind of thing we'd want to
use every day especially since it kind
of turns see there's every me hit read
so now hi cutie from Grandma inside of
this thread so I can love it which is
also kind of like how the emoticons work
on paths so it definitely takes
inspiration from that app so on the
whole we're just not really sure what
every me is it's cool but it just
doesn't have a whole lot utility because
you don't want to spend that much time
inside of the app making decisions about
where you want to send data to so let's
say I post a picture here it's not going
to be going through to Facebook or
Twitter or anything like that a couple
other issues with every me are one what
type of situation are you in where
you're only going to want to share with
a small group of people that you
couldn't just send them an email because
really this is kind of like a glorified
email chain like if you look at the
verge I have I'm sharing with five
people here none of them have the app
and even if they did it wouldn't be that
much different than this so it's a nice
like flexible space where you can do
this and magic stories can populate
information but besides that it's like
if you use a nice email app like sparrow
your email thread is
going to be pretty good looking anyways
and it's going to have pictures in line
and it's going to look good and so
that's that's kind of a question of
utility another problem is that the
issue with something like Google Plus
isn't in building circles because
building circles is easy and every me
assumes that that's the hardest part
like for example the University of
Michigan circle would surely be
difficult to make in something like
Google+ but what type of situation am I
going to want to share with all 240
people inside of my cell phone's address
book that all have University of
Michigan listed under their their school
they've attended so right now if I
wanted to I could easily send something
whether it's a picture or text to all
240 people that I know from the
University of Michigan and it would pop
up on their phone if I don't have their
email or would pop up in their email and
the emails from every meter actually
pretty nice looking but it's just kind
of something that I wouldn't really want
to do very often and the best feature
here really is that it does a great job
building these but what's the real
situation for using them and small ones
like family only take five minutes to
make anyways on google+ or on facebook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
