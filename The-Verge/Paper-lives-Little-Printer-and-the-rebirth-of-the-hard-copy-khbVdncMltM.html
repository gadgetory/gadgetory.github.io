here with Matt Webb CEO of Berg London
who are designed consultancy company
take for joining us Matt and we'd take a
look at your new little printer right
here so can you give you like the
elevator pitch for all this product is
and what it does so a little printer is
a connected printer it connects to the
web it's not like a regular printer a
prince automatically and what it prints
is a miniature personal newspaper for
you every day well you speak for you but
you also plug in in quite a few other
things I as you have an Instagram feed
some other things that word of the day
and things I love you mmm food which is
the joy of connecting to the network so
you know a newspaper is like a regular
thing which is printed you know by the
hundreds of thousands the same to
everyone the way little printer works is
you subscribe to publications each
publication is like a tiny bit of
content you know a couple of inches and
that can be a puzzle it can be headlines
but neat thing is because it comes from
the web it can be from your social
network or it can be something which is
really timely or based in your like your
location so could you just walk us
through the initial setup process once
you bring a little bit too hung sure so
you get a little brighter home it comes
in the box you take out the bridge you
plug the bridge into your home Ritter
yeah supply the ethernet cable and power
some lights come on you take little
printer out you plug it into the wall
you need to be with them at 50 feet of
the bridge and when it's found that the
light comes on here you press the button
and out comes this claim code at this
point we go to Berkeley opcom on your
smartphone and at that point you can
start choosing your publications you
know I've already I've already claimed
little printer on my phone and I've
given it a name given it a location I
can hit share and that will give me
another code which comes out to the
printer you can then go onto the onto
burg cloud yourself and you you too can
be an owner of that same little printer
one of the things we found when we
originally talked to people about side
areas that people would want to have it
for that for their parents or for people
who didn't know how to use computer so
well um who lived quite some way away
because they wanted the way of being
able to send the messages and so those
kind of things are answering the
question of what the little printer is
kind of involves answering a question of
why it is as well doesn't it and my
understanding is that you also trying to
kind of simplify a streamline all of the
information that we do get from the 1
i've been using little printer at home
for some time i have it sitting on my
shelf and I find there's a few things
that's really good at so one thing is
things I can scribble on and take with
me so it's really good for birthdays and
it's really good for puzzles cuz I can
keep them in my wallet carried them on
the bus with me those kind of things one
thing that had tried out earlier on it
hopefully it works again is sending the
right message so if we try doing that
now it'll take a few seconds so what's
going on here is this a there's a mobile
website which you can use in your iPhone
Android or Windows Phone and that's
that's kind of running in the cloud some
I don't know where you point to when you
point to the cloud my kind of out I
somewhere it's usually up here and it
kind of gets rendered sent down by the
bridge to the printer and here it
actually gets to us sort of you said
hello from the verge keeping it simple
there you go when you're scheduled feeds
come down they like that white light up
you hit the black button your
publications print out when you are
collecting news feeds are you collecting
RSS feeds or how do you get information
from no we're encouraging people to
format bear content specifically for
little printer okay so when you when you
look at the content what you're actually
seeing is a very thin black and white
web page we've made it as easy as
possible to create content for it to be
a publisher where you're basically
making is just a specialized kind of
website it's you know
page 4 pixels across and you have to
return some HTML when we when we asked
for it yes I but basically how it works
there's some kind of neat magic built in
which means you can authorize your
publication so for example with we've
built just a test one using instagrams
API and so when I subscribe to it i
authorize against instagram and it
prints out the most popular photo from
my friends so for the moment what we're
what we're going after is publishers
people who want to make content with
people subscribe to and the the
publishers handbook we call it it's the
star guide it's the API is all built
around kind of that idea so we look to
what was in common between the products
we had and we saw that they were pretty
much low complexity low bandwidth they
would do pretty much only one thing and
they were network connected so we
developed this technology berg clouds
bound by this thing that would make it
very easy for us to make all of those
products so the bridge can connect to
you know fifty plus products and those
products don't need to be connected to
the power light little printer is but
they can be battery-powered too so we
kind of see a future of wearables of
connected devices for the home of
connected signage in the business of
connected city blocks it doesn't really
matter but we'd like to have a hand in
all of those kind of things so we see
little printer is just just the first
thing that we're doing
