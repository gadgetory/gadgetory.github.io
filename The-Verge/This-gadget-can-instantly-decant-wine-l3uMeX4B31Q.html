product here is the problem we need a
bottle of wine okay we have a strange
request we're here with the event why
narrator and basically if you want to
aerate your wine instead of point it in
the decanter and waiting several hours
you're supposed to just be able to put
this on the neck of the wine pour it and
it will be able to aerate it to the
equivalent of anywhere from 1 to 24
hours so the aerator has a super simple
interface you just choose how many hours
when it's aerated by tapping so you can
go as high as 24 hours worth of aeration
in a pour it's an equivalent so you know
it's it's sort of hard to test if it's
actually going to give you a precise 24
hours worth of aeration but the company
all has an app that is supposed to kind
of estimate for you how much you should
aerate the given bottle of wine you're
about to pour it through and you just do
that by taking a photo of the bottle of
the wine
it'll analyze what you're pouring and
then give you a recommendation about
what you should set it to but it's
really easy to control on your own you
gotta just dial in your preference so we
have two glasses of wine here this one
has been aerated for the equivalent of a
few hours this one is fresh out of the
bottle I'm gonna taste them both see if
I can tell the difference I am NOT great
with wine so we'll see but it's to be
interesting do what I guess I'm gonna go
with the regular first
I can't describe it as wine smell I
would say it's like a good one as far as
that goes
this does smell different it's it's I
don't think this smells as strong it's
like a lighter smell yeah dang what the
heck man this is my reworking it this
smell is just like mostly gone it's like
not there as much straight out of the
bottle first
Oh
then the front of that says spine and
then it
as much more pleasant that's this is the
aerated one it tastes much more pleasant
this one was like very sour this one I
think most the sourness is gone on this
one I was extremely skeptical of this
unless kept going out I think it I mean
listen I'm not a wine expert I would
make that very clear but this one is
everything much much smoother than this
one and it literally just like went
through this aerator before we poured it
so that's pretty neat so the event
aerator is going to launch on IndieGoGo
in March it'll sell for $100 I suppose
start shipping in June so you can be
aerating your wine with this thing by
the summer our producer says it's strong
and bold it's got some Malbec some I
can't remember what else you know all
