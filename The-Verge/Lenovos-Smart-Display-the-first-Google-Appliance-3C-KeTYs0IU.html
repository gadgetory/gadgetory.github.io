assistant are here and this is the first
one it's the little Nova smart display
it's a Google home with a screen sure
but it's something much more interesting
than that it's basically a brand new
operating system so here's a question
what will Google do now that it has this
brand new clean slate to work with so
what you're looking at here is the
10-inch Lenovo smart display it's $249
and it has a really nice design it's got
this bamboo on the back and a sort of a
wedge shape it looks way better than the
Amazon echo show you can also get $199
version that's 8 inches but it has a
really boring grey plastic back honestly
though I'd be happy to have this on my
kitchen counter especially if it were
standing up like this because it has
little feet to do that but yeah you can
see the software is not designed to work
with it yet Google hasn't finished that
the only thing that works in portrait
mode is duo video calls
anyway let's suss out the rest of the
hardware here my favorite feature
surprisingly is this little tiny switch
right here which covers up the 5
megapixel camera now people can't drop
in on you like they can on the echo show
but being able to cover up the camera
means I'm much more likely to put this
thing in my bedroom or my bathroom I
keep the Google home in my bathroom and
it's great so come at me anyway the
speaker is it's fine it's a 10 watt
speaker with to passive tweeters and if
you're hoping that this relatively big
size means relatively big bass well
sorry it sounds about the same as any
other basic smart speaker it's nowhere
near as good as a Sonos one or an Apple
home pod a smart display can do
everything that a Google home or a
Google home Mini can do but the really
important thing here is obviously the
screen this thing runs on all new
software called Android things which is
technically based on Android but this is
completely different now the core UI is
still your voice but you can do stuff
with the screen and the main thing you
need to know there is swiping in from
the left left edge serves as a back
button it takes you home then to your
photos and then ultimately to the
ambient
display now when you're on the home
screen you can tap on the weather look
at that and then there's a bunch of
cards that basically serve to show you
what you could do and what you can ask
and you'll notice one of these cards is
my personal calendar it does show
personal information on this screen
luckily when you set it up with your
phone one of the little options on there
tells you that if you don't want your
personal information visible to
everybody in your house you can just
leave that off so one of the things that
Google home can do that's great is it
can recognize your voice and set
reminders or show you your specific
calendar stuff but it has to recognize
your voice for it to do that and that
doesn't always work here so far to just
sort of speak weirdly hey Google remind
me to buy cheese on the way home I
couldn't verify your voice so I can't
send any reminders hey Google what's
next on my calendar your next event is
called dinner it's today at 6:30 p.m.
located in Rosa Mexicano hey Google
video call Felicia making a video call
to Felicia Sivakumar hey how's it going
hey Google show me pictures of veer and
pav ik showing your photos there is what
a guy one of the big things to know
about this platform is there's no apps
per se there are some third-party
integrations so for example here Spotify
and there are a handful of other apps
that can have stuff displayed on this
screen but there's no app store and the
touch UI here is pretty basic it's
pretty basic but it's also pretty pretty
in terms of how software design can look
this is the clearest example of where I
think Google is going since they didn't
have to deal with any of the legacy
crafts like they did on Android or
Chrome Google is free to just make what
it wanted to make and so what you end up
with is fairly fluid animations really
nice fonts good drop shadows it just
looks great if you ask it a how-to
question you might get a YouTube video
instead of just like a web link so hey
Google how do I darn a sock okay playing
how-to darn sucks on YouTube now I'm a
YouTube TV subscriber which means that I
can just use the
thing as a television by saying
something like hey Google watch CNN
all right here's CNN on YouTube TV and
as soon as this place I'm just watching
live television it also works with HBO
now if you ask for a specific show what
it doesn't have is Netflix or Hulu which
is kind of a huge bummer but as long as
you have a phone that has a cast button
like this Android phone you can still
cast off to it you put it all together
and this thing makes a really great
kitchen TV but it only comes into its
own if you're fully bought into the
Google ecosystem so for example I'm a
Google Photos user and having Google
photos in my kitchen on the displays
really really nice it also makes video
calls with Google duo which is also
really good but not that many people use
it basically I see this thing as a
really good Google appliance which is I
don't know fitting because it goes in
your kitchen with other appliances oh
hey one more thing it also makes regular
old phone calls which is kind of a neat
feature now my favorite feature of this
thing might be recipes if you start a
recipe it shows each step one by one it
doesn't move to the next step till you
ask for it and it stays on the screen
it's really great and I hope that
someday Google allows us to put our own
personal recipes on the thing because
right now just pull some recipes on the
web actually that's a lie my very
favorite feature this is super dumb but
my very favorite feature is still timers
because on this thing the timers stay on
the screen the whole time you can even
set multiple timers and they all stay on
the screen it's not how the echo showed
us it it's not how the home pod does it
it's the most basic thing and Google
actually got it right everything here is
pretty simple it's clean and it's fast
if you aren't put off by the price
having a screen on a smart speaker is
definitely better than not having one if
you're already bought into an Amazon
echo ecosystem should you switch to this
thing yeah probably not but if you're
using Google assistant I think this
thing is great it's my favorite smart
speaker with a display by a long mile
even though I still hate hate saying a
new rule compared to just saying Alexa
more important to me I hope that Google
expands this platform to work with more
third-party software fairly soon maybe
the most fascinating part of this smart
display is that just by adding a screen
to the Google assistant they've
completely changed how the Google
assistant answers questions so if you
ask it how to do something you might get
a YouTube video if you ask it for photos
you might get your photos instead of
something from the web if you ask it for
a recipe you'll get a web page
completely remade and two step-by-step
instructions for you it's the
culmination of everything Google has
been trying to do a search making it
give you answers instead of just sending
you to webpages so what happens when
Google actually does have a clean slate
to work with turns out it makes our
really great Google appliance hey
everybody thanks so much for watching
and I don't know if you've noticed but
we're at a whole different space here
we're gonna build out a set we've got
this cool graphic behind us and also you
should check out vox coms video on road
diets i've been really into smart
scooters lately and a road diet a really
good way to make roads safe for those
scooters so take a look at it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
