we're here to look at office phone today
we're not running this particular app on
an iPad and there's good reason for that
and much less only released in an iPhone
version today that works exclusively
with office 365 accounts so you need to
sign into your office 365 account and
then the first thing you'll notice just
how basically this application really is
and you can see the recent documents
initially and then you can tab across to
the files which obviously gives you
access to your SkyDrive there's also a
new tab that provides access to creating
Word and Excel documents B can't create
a PowerPoint from there and the settings
there really simple you can literally
just add your name in for comments and
access stuff like the help and support
center and the sort terms and view some
pro C so really simple stuff every time
you navigate back to the recent section
they should refresh from SkyDrive to
provide the latest edited documents and
viewing the documents really simply just
tap on it and it goes in and the default
view lets you pan around a document with
all the changes kept intact and also all
the images are there and the text
formatting and there's also options to
share and save a copy of the document
alongside some editing tools and now the
editing tools are where this gets are a
little bit confusing to say the least
and you can simply tap on the editing
tools option at the top which gives you
text input initially and then you can
select words in a document and
manipulate the colors and it's not
obvious how to select text initially and
and you have to actually double tap on a
word to get the normal iOS options to
select like multiple words and then you
can get to the editing tools and change
the fonts etc so if we double tap on a
word here you know so I have to edit the
go to the editing options and then we've
got like the colors and bold italics and
all the sort of sort basic stuff and you
can also change the size of the font but
that's pretty much it if you want to go
back you have to click on the little
arrow to get back there's no real quick
easy way to switch between view and edit
there's also a viewing tools option that
lets you quickly pan for you to document
or find text within it a final option is
available to place comments on a
document simply by double tapping on a
word and once you leave the document you
can in save or discard changes and it
all be saved directly to SkyDrive
allowing you to access and edit
documents from the full desktop version
of Office Office Web Apps or another
mobile device next
his Excel and now I found mini plate and
data here and selecting cells really
difficult on the small screen of the
iPhone once you get a hang of it and
then you can quickly like jump directly
into the Edit tools and then you can
create charts based on those cells and
Microsoft has included these sort usual
tabs at the bottom here so you can
quickly switch between a spreadsheet and
the chart data there's even the ability
to edit single cells and change formulas
etc it's kind of useful if you're on the
go and you want to amend a mistake in a
spreadsheet quickly and like word you
can also go into the editing tools and
change the colors and fonts and there's
also options specific to excel there's
also an option to create filters on this
mobile version of Office you can select
an entire range of cells and in access
to viewing tools to apply a filter that
will then let you filter individual
columns and it's super useful if you're
a heavy spreadsheet user who filters out
columns wrigley but for most power users
they'll likely do this type of
manipulation on a desktop version of
office in terms of selecting cells I
eventually found that dragging from the
center provided the best results but
initially it's a really frustrating
experience and the viewing tools are
rather limited again and but it's also
an option to search for your spreadsheet
for a specific text and once you leave
the spreadsheet you'll be prompted to
save changes and the document will sync
up to SkyDrive the final office for
iPhone application is PowerPoint at
first you're greeted with options to
flip through and view a presentation but
there's also a viewing option at the top
to quickly navigate to individual slides
however overall I found this to be one
of the most basic in terms of editing
and manipulation there's an edit option
but it doesn't really let you do much
you can select existing text on the
PowerPoint document and change the
contents but it's no control over its
color or style there are also options to
move or hide slides overall it looks
like this is really designed for
last-minute changes to PowerPoint
presentations rather than the full way
to edit them you can also get the usual
file options to share and save if you
use the app in landscape mode you'll
also be able to view the presentation
fully and access the speaker know top
shion's you can add in basic notes and
they'll sync up with your document
changes and this view is more of a
presentation mode really and it lets you
sort pan around the document and zoom in
too I like all the apps before it any
changes that you make will be synced
fully up to SkyDrive overall office file
iPhone is really basic
we'd love to see some changes to allow
for images to be swapped in and out and
just to make text editing a little less
confusing but for now it's a free
application that comes part of office
365
Microsoft has no plans to open it up
outside of that subscription and iPad
users will have to make do with the web
app versions of office for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
