we are here with the guys behind the
design for the all-new well LG webOS TV
and one bring in to talk a little bit
more about it because we've got a lot of
questions yeah yeah each I'm on track
Colin job yep hey guys how's it going
yeah how's CS gonna stay one Wow it's
been awesome you know what kind of
running on fumes here adrenaline and
coffee of course but it's been very
great to be at the booth they're
explaining a product to people and
having them really get to make TV simple
get message you know people just get the
UI people just understand how to use it
and that's been super fulfilling all
rights
yeah the booth is full people are really
coming in very excited there's a lot of
good will towards webOS and all the work
we've done so that's a great it's a
great launch well that's interesting a
good will towards well s because CS the
the biggest thing that's ever happened
to me to CS was the launch the original
launch of webOS and everyone loved the
product and the idea and the the the
theories of the operating system and
then a lot of stuff happened and now
you're relaunching webOS here as a TV
product which is I don't think anybody
could have predicted that when palm
originally introduced what was here
what's it like to sort of relaunch a
product like this yeah it's great the
the feeling that we've worked on it for
so long and finally being able to show
it to the public and also explaining to
people why we thought webOS makes sense
on a TV so that was one of the the
questions that we always people asked us
why why are you doing a TV it makes
total sense once you understand that TVs
are about switching mm-hm
TVs are about being doing one thing one
minute and then going doing something
else and it was always struggled with
bringing the the message of why
multitasking is important to the public
but people multitask all the time on TV
to just don't call it that way they just
switch yeah and that was the core and
that was the thing that we realized and
that's why we're so excited about
bringing it to TVs well the number one
thing you switched on TV is channels
right like live television channels
because that's where content is whether
you are on switcher you want to switch
between your the game you're watching
and maybe something on Netflix if it's
boring and then you're done you want to
go somewhere else this is what you're
switching and then you might want to go
back check out what's happening in
TV so yes they are switching channels
with your also in the few the more we
talk about over-the-top content you're
going to switch between different
sources and and so the web less on TV
you try and treat all sources as sort of
equal citizens are all just inputs right
so you can switch between you know
Netflix or your HTML one or your Xbox
one H by three or whatever it is but the
the TV input is a really complicated one
because there's cable boxes and they've
got their own UI for navigating channels
there's live TV there's DVRs so it makes
really good sense for understanding how
I'm going to switch across that line
past present and future with you know
between you know Netflix and Hulu but
I'm wondering like that that simple line
if you guys are trying to make it very
simple how are you dealing with a very
complex world of everything else that's
happening with with channels on TV
nothing so let me give some thoughts
there there's really three things we
need to solve first its control then
discovery then integration so let me
talk about each one so you know
obviously if you have a TV set-top box
or something like that you mean ways to
control it and you know magic remote
control and she comes to the IR blaster
built-in and so you know as you sell
about TV and we recognize a set-top box
or you tell us what set-top box you have
we actually have a way to make sure that
you exist you're using one emote control
to control your set-top boxes so you're
not like swapping emotes right but
you're shorting you ice right I mean
you've got the webOS UI which is the
beautiful well-designed interfaces I
want to use which is beautiful all the
time and then you've got your cable box
which is awful and you're using the same
road to control both of that it like are
you did you guys think about that stuff
or did you say look that problem is too
hard let's do the best job of solving
the problems we can
so solve how is solving that issue the
discovery component yeah so you know you
really have a lot of content you can
watch you know that's a cost your your
you know your over-the-top content as
well as your live TV and we come up with
various ways to solve harmonized this so
if you look at our today menu for
example you can actually discover
content across live TV and your
streaming content so you know you could
you know of course choose to go to your
set-top box into the EPG to find out
this data but we're trying to integrate
this and to
helped use this out with the discovery
aspect as well by making sure that from
a metadata standpoint we have this
completes our metadata and for modeling
it for modeling this melody retreat
raius use experiences you know which you
know help users put down the barriers
between what you can watch on live TV
how I can stream so these are where a
lot of the challenges need to be so yeah
and the question I've always had since
LG purchased webOS was why does it you
need webOS to solve these problems
because every TV manufacturer here knows
these challenges right like there's
discovery there's so much content now
there's so many sources of the content
the content is different like Netflix
and Hulu have different things then
there's a cable box and there's DVR you
can't even talk to you but what is it
about whether lesson a so we said one
thing is it's about switching its
switching superclone you can see that
worse sub ones second right now switch
between things and and that's great and
it feels great it feels right
but webOS is is it as a philosophy more
than anything else or is an operating
system but it's mostly it's a feeling
you know what well actually I'm like
when people think of webOS they think of
like that card interface right so that
but it's translating that is weird I
mean on TV it's not about apps it's
about content yeah and what we as LG
want to make sure is that content is
available to everybody not in closed
Gardens unpossible or Gardens that I buy
it here I can't watch it there I want
everything to be available on the web
all the time and in that respect web us
is the best thing for that we want
everybody to build html5 apps we want to
make sure that HTML is a first-class
citizen and all the devices and once all
our partners build things for the web
they're available everywhere
and that's the right path for this
industry and that's what at what LG
wanted to do they really wanted to make
sure that they have the ability to
continue innovating as a hardware based
company and making sure that software
and the web are available for everybody
that way you push Khan
here's a really weird question do you
have it you have a browser and on
this-tv your web browser so that is
never as far as I can tell that has
never truly worked in a television right
the brat I mean it's almost like you
have a browser because you're you're
betting so big on html5 that you can
just have one because it's gonna be
there right
what what is it about the browser on the
television it's ever worked but then
what is it about html5 that works so
well like yeah it's it's a strange
question but that's because Google
that's so big on the browser with Google
TV right yeah fell down completely for
them cuz nobody wants a browser on a TV
but I see the bet on html5 is an app
platform for television it's being
really smart I can't quite figure out
why do you guys think about this stuff
yeah so I can I can start the product
common has any other thoughts so what is
the what's the usage scene here so you
come home you click and then browse and
no CNN and you don't want to go through
the it's not the same thing as a browser
and we have browsers on TV today because
it is there is some sort of segment of
people that actually want to do that but
it's not the court that you you'll see
we're not promoting them the difference
is that apps can be optimized for the TV
and they can be placed at a different it
just so much more accessible place in
the browser where you have to go and
start typing right there all that
essentially where Boris is the browser
that is the browser that is the chrome
of a browser it allows you to switch
between tabs cards call them whatever
you want it's the same thing it's
accessing the web it's just where Boris
is the browser yeah so yeah I think it's
kind of about double-clicking on the
statement making something a first-class
citizen and so what we've done right now
already you know back in the day TV was
the first-class citizen on the TV I know
your your content apps were the
second-class citizens and we brought at
an equal level and made those
first-class citizens oh yeah I mean for
sure massively me TV is still a cable
box or satellite box for most people
right true so how do you bring but once
you start using your cable box your
shunted off into a different interface I
mean that to me is the challenge of
making it
television is it somebody else owns a
big chunk of it and you have no way to
get at so how do you how do you fight
that with something like webOS which is
I mean you basically bolted a smartphone
to the back of the TV and made it run a
world-class mobile operating system
right I mean that's effectively what
you've done right no I think that I
believe actually does sound very
different from that really oh yeah we
were actually figured out what the right
experiences on a TV powered by this
mobile operating system sure what used
to be a mobile operating system but
we've what's somewhat portable with two
people yeah why it's really about how
we've redefined the TV as a form factor
yeah and so yes you know TV and cable
box is very important and we have some
ways to sort control the cable box but I
do think you know as we've seen for
example Reed Hastings announcement in
our auditory press conference that 4k
content now is available as the first
pipe to the Internet
you know when we're so previously you
know regular content you know the first
part was cable boxes so we do see this
evolution to you know online streaming
content and that's why I saw bringing up
you know all these different content
sources and equalizing the paling feel
there you think people like whatever has
content right so right now that comes
from their great service from those from
the cable companies and cable companies
also want to be integrated into smart
TVs there are more and more cable
companies that are moving towards apps
right wait a dish app right is that
coming to the web most platformers that
absolutely yeah
cuz they announce it first so you never
know at CES it's always like when when
they announce a partner announces
something first and then you make the
big announcement it's always like was
that coordinated but so it's definitely
coming yes
so okay so using HTML to make apps for
TV seems to make really good sense and
you guys have got a really nice
interface and we've already tried to
talk about the challenge of like the
horrible interface from the cable box
but one of the other problems with smart
TVs is everybody's making their own apps
in html5 or wherever and they look and
feel very different and you kind of lose
your way to like navigate it and like is
it this is gonna pop over is gonna take
me different screen how are you guys
managing that are you enforcing
guidelines or let people do whatever
they want
we will have the open web and we want
people to innovate however you're right
it does create a bit of a mess so we're
gonna talk a lot more about that
confetti and in Apps world but we're
working really hard on creating great
tools for developers that they can start
with patterns that we've done for them
it can be a lot more about that coming
soon so okay you're in a lockdown kind
of UI elements you're gonna happen or
not so you know you know a lot about n
you know and our heritage there and
we're continuing and taking that forward
it's not locked
ok so you're not gonna provide like UI
parameters to people or we are okay you
know I think it's really more about
education so if you don't take a page
from history and you look at the mobile
web the mobile web kind of had different
kinds of design patterns and all to some
one man issue do you find a category and
you find the curved designs that we see
today like you know big buttons easy to
tell but in the back idea yeah I look
back and stuff like that and I think
that's what we're trying to do here
which is we're not here to enforce
something you know we really respect
openness and we believe in it but we're
here to stop educate and come up with
the best practices for designs on the TV
I'll give you an example so a lot of
what we're seeing is people do they they
translate their interface from a tablet
so they put you know something there's
some options here it's like an option
click something else and then you get
finally to some piece of content and you
click it and then it plays then if you
want to bring up the UI you take away
the content again what's a full screen
it's probably not the right way to go
yeah so we've we're really trying to
explain to people ok you can actually
have the kind of running in the
background you can have UI overlay it
should overlay from this direction
there's a lot of attention to that level
of consistency so actually that's kind
of my big the overarching question is
you guys did have a mobile operating
system it's actually hard for me to stop
thinking of web less as a mobile
operating system that's about whereas
its roots when LG purchased webOS and
you guys met everybody for the first
time what was what were those initial
conversations like about how to take
something that was about being used in
one hand
tactile with touch to LG's remote which
is one of the craziest remotes in the
market right it has a good scroll wheel
is like
motion-tracking what was that
conversation like in the early stages to
bring something that was all that touch
to something that was a UI too much
farther distance so we actually started
doing that before we were required
really yes because we really believed
that TV is a great space we started
working on it and we we we looked at the
market and we definitely identified that
the d-pad or five-way is what's most of
the people are working on but we like
LG's approach because it allows us to
have a better cross-platform story in
one hand or you can take web apps or web
thinking and bring them over it's easier
and the second thing is that we did
notice that it's pretty good
like people do use it over time they get
used to it and actually use a video so
the story was for us to figure out how
do we optimize for two interfaces
together mm-hmm
since we didn't want to just copy the
webOS interface from phones to TV it was
never about adapting the UI to a TV it
wasn't just reinventing the guy from
scratch
and you were doing that before you got
acquired by yeah Wow well what what did
that look like where you just blue sky
like maybe we'll both the TV someday so
it does the story sort of the story of
SVL and how s VI became jl s VL can you
explain what that is it's sort of a
fatty lab right so we were working on
reinventing web boys with partners and
and it was clear trust that you know we
need to figure out what partners want
yeah and LG was one of the the best and
earliest partners that we had in they
were so good that it makes sense to but
if we started working with a little bit
probably if you see that ones before the
acquisition yeah so we're like I don't
know 15 minutes and then we haven't
talked about the the banner thing that
everybody noticed about webOS TV which
is bean bird so it should always people
people do like being Birds so the idea
behind Beamer is that it's there to help
you get through set up because you don't
set up your TV then your experience
sucks so like how did you come up with
this character and why why did you
decide you want the character to go away
after set up
so being burped is auralic from like we
really started experimenting with this
idea of a a UI that is a little bit
snarky has a voice it's cute but it does
it's not overly cute mm-hmm and what we
wanted to put it to use as figuring that
okay how can we create an emotional
connection and people being excited
about their TV that's why we wanted it
at the beginning the other thing is
remember all that cool stuff Connor was
explaining about how the remote can talk
to your cable box well right you won't
get that if you don't go through all the
steps at first you know so we know that
can give you a much better interface the
more you go through first years so
that's where we decided to focus it so
it's about production value making you
just realize oh I've got this great
device and it looks different in
business level of newness but personally
I think people expect from where voice
right and then okay you're done and now
we're just a worth TV we're about being
quick and yeah and about no fuss just
moving building things here's my idea
and I just put out there you can take it
don't take it the emergent always be
there then it turns into Clippy
listening for what you want to watch so
if you want to watch a movie it should
be invert I want to watch this movie and
then it should help you locate what
streaming services it's on how much it
costs where it's free if it's on
television that should be like bean
bridge should always just be there kind
of like having suggestions and ideas so
last year called and they want their
idea back real yes it works LG last year
had that with avatar okay great idea
Wow my last year's are eating to be away
but it wasn't being burned it wasn't a
few wasn't that avatar I mean I know you
guys work for LG now but LG saw for last
year was awful
right that's why they bought webOS and
this is like a big theme right is these
big hardware companies
understanding that they need to get
better design understanding that they
need to hire real software engineers
this is a big reason they acquired webOS
and I'm saying now that they've done it
they've got the talent
the clear blazing talent here it's time
for that idea to be resurrected as being
done nope being burped is the brainchild
of one of your own orphans are totally
flowers it was a great compliment waste
thank you and credit so bean bread is
the brainchild of LaRhonda mere art
director and I think we are looking at
how do we make the the design more
emotional yeah getting people connected
it's not just about being British we are
gonna do more things I think one of the
things that happened this year for web
wise is that we were able to merge with
a company that really understands
Hardware mm-hm and distribution yeah and
how to get things done but doesn't
understand software at all I think we're
helping they're coming there and we're
helping differently not just in software
but also how to think about software as
well we're trying to bring the best of
Silicon Valley to OG and LG's really
investing in the Silicon Valley presence
there too that when in San Francisco in
Santa Clara and it's been a great
experience like trying to bring those
two cultures together not just that like
Korean versus them like an American
culture it's more of a manufacturing
yeah a company and then like this
innovative software group how do they
work together are you gonna take over
their phones anytime soon well that's
yeah the obvious question I mean hey
that's for you calling so definitely
focusing on TVs right now
yes and I think you know as a lawyer I
think the more important thing you know
as you've said just now it's really more
about you know what how the problem
solving approach at webOS as a whole
without team as a whole takes to you
know dealing with the different devices
you have you know we are open we are we
believe in openness and we want to be
what we call proactively open which is
we actually go out in a very source
oh no not open sourcing but it's about
how you deal with your ecosystem of
devices so you know basic openness is
about allowing things to run in your
platform or no one on your devices
I think being proactively open is about
doing the extra work to make sure that
devices work better with with our TVs
for example are different it are
different you know consumer electronics
devices we make yeah you know we've
and you will see you know in apps world
art is a bit here that we are creating
this thing called the LG connect
second-screen api's which really allow
you know phones and applications with
integrated to immediately push stuff to
a TV without pairing you know completely
simple experiences and so we are doing
the extra work to create stuff that
allows our devices to work better with
what you have out there what your video
yeah okay so what what is an extra web
or I can on the phone
discussion and also on that I can
promise you this what we want to do is
we don't want to do devices just for the
heck of doing another phone or just for
we want to understand why webOS would be
the great thing there like we try to
really figure out for a TV okay why
would this be great on TV how would we
do device that would be so much better
because we use robust that's the first
thing we want we really want to nail
that before we touch it and that's also
some of the approach that we trying to
bring to LG say a product of a thinking
yeah it's not about adding features it's
about getting the right features in yep
so what's next I think we're going to
continue working on TV we have a lot
more to do with cable and integrating
content sources and then we have a lot
more to do with ecosystems and how do we
bring more devices in sure okay cool
well I think we're out of time but at
ICON thank you so much for coming in
talking so much and we'll we'll keep
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
