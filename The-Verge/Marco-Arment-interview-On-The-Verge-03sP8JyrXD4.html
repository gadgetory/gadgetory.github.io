dudes I want to bring out our next guest
he's a really smart very creative guy
and frankly I'm a little bit in love
with him please welcome welcome Marco
Arment I works right thank you thank you
yes nice weird like we're stepping up
the nerdiness we're going that we're
going yeah we're getting increasingly
nerdy at the end of the show we're just
gonna be sitting here coding is that
cool well as long as we put two big top
windows on the screen and one red one
green yeah two inside baseball all right
is that a coding thing I'm confused to
some people I'm totally confused right
now
so Marco we're just gonna pretend that
ever happened I didn't get confused by
that joke we're just moving right along
here
Marco you're an interesting man you are
one of the people who created tumblr yep
which as I said we've all used many many
times multiple times a day your bosses
I'm sorry and an inch of paper which now
everybody it price says Instagram to you
every time they talk about it right but
like you created Instagram that's
awesome
how's it feel to have a billion dollars
yeah can you believe I actually I heard
a few of those yeah that was an
interesting day so I'm sure you did
Congrats yeah so tell me I want it but
tumblr a little bit I mean tumblr has
become a phenomenon I mean everybody
uses it like every new site I see is
just a tumblr site and and obviously
it's been great for the porn industry no
I'm sorry it hasn't been but for porn
users but but where when did that start
how did that start what was your role
just can you give me like a little bit
of background I'm sure you know spice it
up
sexy sexy stuff as sexy as two guys
written code in an office for a couple
years that's very sad that's very sad
vibe so focused on sex right yeah I did
see house a little bit in love with you
it is late at night you know that's true
so yeah so what where did that start it
started as me and David Karp
David had a consulting company just
making websites for people and one day
we were between clients for about two
weeks and he said hey I've had this idea
I want to work on it let's see what we
can get done in the next two weeks
before we got into this next project and
that was tumblr and that was late 2006
and we built the prototype and it took
off we kept iterating on it as we were
doing client work until eventually the
client work had to be dropped because we
had to do this thing full time he had
tumblr work yeah so so what was the idea
was like I I I mean it's like this weird
halfway place between WordPress and
Twitter you know it's this kind of like
was the idea like blogging is just too
complicated but that was basically it it
was that a lot of us especially if you
were a nerd playing with the Internet in
2006 chances are you had started and
abandoned a blog I write a lot of people
did yeah
and the problem is that the at the time
what was really the traditional
WordPress movable-type style format is
more like a magazine column where it's a
lot of work you know writing these
longer pieces lots of paragraphs and
throwing in images and stuff every day
or once a week or least you got to you
got to do as you know it takes a lot of
time yes
and every time conserve it right and and
if you're doing it as just like a little
side hobby and you only get like one or
two comments in a week and one of them
spam and the other ones telling you that
you know you're stupid it's kind of hard
to keep the motivation going to keep
something like that up so tumblr was
created to to lower the the friction to
make publishing online easy and to lower
the expectation that you had to produce
this giant magazine column every day
because in reality most people just
wouldn't and they would abandon it and
with tumblr that wasn't really an issue
because what the platform cultivated and
expected was much more sustainable
because it was so much easier right did
you did you think that I mean I know
maybe I don't know the answer to this
but did you think it would become this
this kind of default almost I mean
that's what it's become really but now
when people start something I mean it
feels like they're moved away from like
oh I'm gonna start a wordpress blog too
I'm just gonna start a tumblr and I like
I have seven tumblr
and they're all like I one day I was
like I'm gonna do a tumblr just of
pictures of bags I like why not cool
right and I just started it I did one I
was gonna add film trailer reviews I was
just gonna do film trailer reviews
that's good
I did like six and now it's abandoned
but it but tumblr makes it so it's so
easy did you expect it would be this
default or were you like well just be an
easier way to do a blog I knew that you
know once we had the product at a usable
stage pretty early on I knew that people
who used it we're going to love it but I
think what surprised me is how much it
took over outside of people who used to
be the ones blogging you know that
people who were blogging almost mostly
nerds you know now it's a lot more
people it's like normals it's everybody
there's nobody here probably maybe who
wandered in by accident maybe yeah they
have a tumblr though we can agree or
seven of them yes that's right and one
is about the one is about bags so so you
you stop working at tumblr when 2010 and
a 2010 so pretty recently yeah and and
so talk to me about instapaper this is
your your next big sure project what
why did you where did Instapaper come
from and how was it were you sitting
there one day you do I mean you really
bookmarking something you're like
there's got to be a better way to do
this basically yeah I mean what happened
was in in late 2007 I got an iPhone and
I was still working at tumblr and I was
commuting every day on the train not the
subway you know the suburb train you
know nobody here knows about an actual
train an actual tree the the LIRR or the
Metro North Metro North which leads up
to what most people consider a farmland
upstate even though it's like 10 miles
you live on a farm pretty much no but
everyone thinks I do we'll keep that up
yeah so you know I had this long train
commute and I would be browsing the web
at work like I wasn't supposed to be
doing but when you're making a platform
about browsing the web it's really hard
not to while you're testing it so I was
browsing the web at work and I would
find links to read and I wouldn't have
time to read them because I was supposed
to be working so I I would want to save
them and read them sometime
and at the same time I was on the train
and I had this new iPhone that had this
terrible edge connection and was offline
half the time for the ride and I wanted
to read things on the train but by the
time I got there the connection was too
slow to browse much to browse around and
I would have already gone through RSS
feeds Digg which at the time still
mattered you know I would have gone
through all these things and so it was
like I was burning through my queue when
I couldn't read it and when I could read
it there was nothing there so I made
Instapaper to bridge that gap to solve
that problem to be just a temporary
place just the one-click bookmark just
save it I don't want to tag it I don't
want to like categorize it and reference
this forever in a giant you know library
of things I've ever read it was just a
temporary like I haven't read this but I
want to you know save it until I have
read it and then get rid of it do you
feel it's the highest form of flattery
that that Apple has completely ripped
you off
oh yeah I mean is that it is that weird
for you I'd be really upset if I reading
because you're you know you're just a
guy yes a guy living on a farm right and
here comes big bad apple and they're
just like oh hey we're gonna make this
other thing that does exactly what
Instapaper does that's gonna be default
in all of our browsers well it helped a
lot that they really did kind of a
half-baked job it's interesting do you
think I did a half-baked job I mean the
first version had pretty much no the
first version was basically a bookmark
folder right so you know now and they're
adding offline support in mountain lion
although I'm not suppose to know that
but I'm not officially a Mac developer
so I'm gonna have to tell you that
you're not a you're not a Mac developer
right right I actually even seen
mountain lion uh-huh you probably have
seen more of them I don't know anything
about it
but it's but you're but you're telling
me that they're adding offline yeah
that's somebody on Twitter told me they
were adding offline it lets do I assume
right that's good on the Internet oh
you're sure I'm sure a person like
Wikipedia uh-huh always right oh yeah
but no it seems crazy to me has it has
it hurt has it hurt business it's hard
to tell my business is fine it would
that way feature was released a year ago
the main reading list feature and then
you know we'll see this summer when they
released the offline version of it it's
hard to tell I mean the reality is
that's only useful if you
use safari everywhere right and only
about 1/3 of my customers do well and
you're using mobile everybody's using
mobile safari right but I think that the
desktop sinking part is very important I
mean there are a lot of people who both
get and save the links on their iOS
devices right but there's also a lot who
we're doing what the way I originally
made it which was you save it on a
computer and then you go read on your
devices later right so so on the topic
of instapaper there's been a lot of
controversy about your if I want to call
it allegiance to iOS but you you have
not you won't make an Android
application let me just say I'm gonna
say bluntly yeah and you even you even
had this like challenge which was if
somebody makes I'd want to make sure I
get this right it's like it's so
misunderstood some buddy makes a good
Android Instapaper client you'll call it
Instapaper for Android and you'll split
the profits close it was if that what
Ravello per that I was linking to made
it it wasn't it wasn't intended to be an
open challenge because I don't like it
open challenge the use of paper of
course forever in the design world spec
work is considered a very bad word which
is the idea I'm sorry designers I'm
getting this wrong the idea is like you
kind of put out a call hey everyone do
something you know work for free and if
we like your thing we'll pick it and
we'll pay you yes you have a whole
people working for free and most of them
just get nothing out of it I didn't want
to do that I thought that's why I didn't
intend for it to be like a hey everyone
try and whoever gets there first wins it
you know cuz I don't want people to
waste all their time so this guy didn't
do it I guess yeah it didn't happen what
about anybody else have you looked yeah
why don't you want to just admit why why
don't you just make something for
Android it means it is so I feel like it
is it is in the market in a big way
right that's agreed I totally like
literally half of smart-shower
blackberries yeah so I mean don't let's
not be don't give me that straw man
argument of course I mean it's a real
platform it is a real platform and it's
big no question but the thing is you
know if you are in the business of
trying to get as many users as possible
something like Instagram that actually
makes sense to spread to Android get as
many use
you can usually it's for free some kind
of free service that makes sense tumblr
has to have an Android app totally makes
sense but when you're in the business of
selling the app the majority of its
papers revenue comes from the app sales
so I'm selling a five-dollar app on iOS
that's pretty expensive on Android
that's probably impossible and I don't I
buy Android apps all the time and
everyone's just like you well I mean
there are people buy an Android app okay
I mean there are more than more
developers make it after a I'm somewhere
no I mean there are there definitely are
I've tele to UIC I know people with
Android phones that buy apps of course
okay I do yeah you know April don't but
you think that all the other people who
are doing one go right for the verge
right are like no way I don't need it
well it's not all of them it's a
question of really just economics and
how to allocate limited resources which
is the most limited resource that I have
right now is my time and everyone's most
limited resource you know you I only
have this one awesome version of the app
that I'm really focused on if I were to
take time off and either even either do
an Android app myself or pay someone
else a whole bunch of money to do it
that would significantly detract from my
ability to make the iOS app great and
now in the face of ever increasing
competition I can't afford to let up I
have to keep making the iOS app awesome
I mean you're competing with Apple so
you can't really screw it I'm computing
with everyone who doesn't charge any
money right
and pocket and would readability yeah
Evernote clear what do you think spool
what do you think grabs balloon thing
well and which one which one do you like
the best out of all of your competition
honestly I've seen very few of them you
might want to check them out yeah I tell
you something I mean it all seriousness
I've talked to people in our industry
there are other people they're like yeah
I don't really check out the competition
John Rubinstein from palm famously was
like yeah I haven't really seen an
iPhone well that went well so my
suggestion the big ones okay there's a
whole bunch of little ones I've seen the
big ones and are you are you gonna add
do you think you're gonna add features
or try to compete on any of the stuff
like pocket does a bunch of stuff that
Instapaper doesn't I mean it does some
things on a bunch it does more things
that it does no I you know I
I highly value originality and we have
to distill have to distinguish there was
that awesome HP Envy whatever that came
out you know we have to distinguish
between there's HP Envy whatever the you
mean the computer look exactly like a
MacBook yeah that thing yeah that's the
HP MacBook Air yeah you know we we have
to distinguish with originality you know
the the problem of simultaneous
invention versus true originality now it
you know I I want to be the original in
many ways of what ins paper does it is
the original and I I like Apple products
cuz many of them are very original not
all of course but many and you know I
value it a lot I'm I get a lot of
satisfaction out of that and so I don't
want to copy other people's products or
features if it's not something obvious
but I think if it is something obvious
like okay I have a read later app and if
you tap on a link should it just open or
should it offer you an option to read
that link later you know like that's it
once you're building a read later app
that's a pretty obvious feature right
and so if someone else did that first
and then I copied it later I wouldn't
really feel bad about that so when I
look at other competitors features and
you know if some if a competitor doesn't
feature before me and I'm getting a lot
of pressure to add it I try to be
original as much as possible in the
sense that if I try to not just copy it
directly I try to you know only do
things that only copy things that I
would have come upon anyway right that
were obvious you're walking a fine line
there or or if I can't do that if it's
something that someone else just made a
really good point and did this awesome
feature that I never would have thought
of it I'm like I really have to
implement that to stay competitive I'll
try to do it differently I'll try to do
it like in a substantially different way
somebody has a grade you'll make like a
wheel
I had the grid first okay no you're
owning the greatest way yeah I'll flip
or beat everybody well you know I I try
to be original so even if I have to copy
someone else's feature I'll try to do it
my own way and so I respect other people
who do that same thing so like I see in
like the PC laptop space or the Android
phone space versus Apple and
you know other people I like when
Android and when crazy PC manufacturers
come up with their own solutions to
problems like I respect that even if I
don't like their solution as much I have
more respect for that oh my god I want
to have another separate conversation
just about like what you don't like
about Android cuz I've been I mean I'm
sure there's some fascinating I haven't
used it that much well there's your
problem
Android is not in my world it's not in
my attention span most days yeah I don't
spend that much time thinking about it
because thinking about iOS and the
website which even that I barely think
about thinking about the iOS app is a
full-time job right and stay competitive
on the iOS app is a full-time job all
right I'm gonna we have to wrap
unfortunately cuz I have a bunch more
things I want to talk to you about but
I'll quickly want to know just a couple
of I mean you're obviously very focused
you just talked about being original and
you obviously appreciate beautiful
design what are some apps what are
things that you use everyday that you're
like I wish I could have made this or
I'm in awe of this or this is a
beautiful you know really smart design
that I love like what's something free I
madla just like you know yeah I have a
long answer but if we don't time for a
long answer you know design my opinion
of design is very different from what
most people my opinion of design is you
know to quote Steve Jobs how it works
most people think design is putting
textures and gradients on everything and
so for me apps that work really well or
solve the probably well to me that's
great design so I think a good example
that is Instagram it Instagram took
mobile it was basically Twitter for
photos which ends up being a really big
deal what it did Facebook should have
done that the reason why they bought
Instagram is because it freaked them out
because it attacked that one of the
biggest things people use Facebook for
in an area that Facebook was not doing
very well in addressing Instagram solve
that problem so well and by the way the
way to use Instagram I'll give my secret
to everybody never use filters seriously
changes the app makes you a better
photographer unless you're terrible at
photography in which case you
but you know it but the purpose of the
of Instagram photos is not to look old
it's not to look like you took them took
them wasn't it with an SLR and if you
did and imported it that's kind of dirty
don't do that people do that I know it's
rude
they take pictures of DSLRs and then
import the and they're like hey check
out this awesome picture I took Phil
Schiller did that did he yeah and then
he quit no wonder there he was like I'm
sure I've been shamed into quit it yeah
mark oh I wish I could talk to you
longer you got to come back thank you so
much thank you Mark our man everybody
