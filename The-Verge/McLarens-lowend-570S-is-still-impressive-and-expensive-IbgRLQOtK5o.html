front of McLaren's 570 x which was just
introduced here at the new york
international auto show it's their new
low end car and just like the Porsche
Boxster Spyder I used to term low end
very loosely it's still going to be a
very very expensive vehicle we're
talking six figures but its lower end
than the 650 and 675 which are sort of
in the mid range of their supercar
portfolio with the p1 at the top this
car has over 560 horsepower the 0 to 60
in 3.2 seconds just marginally slower
than a 650 and obviously it's extremely
beautiful the five-cent vs goes over 200
miles an hour which is impressive even
for a car in this range so you'll be
cross shopping against things like a 911
turbo when it comes out later this year
this isn't only car the MacLaren's going
to increase this year there's also the
540 see which is basically an
entry-level version of the 57 yes both
cars fall into what McLaren is calling
the sports series which is their low-end
portfolio of cars but again low-end
doesn't necessarily mean what you think
it does you have a hundred fifty
thousand dollars lying around this might
be the card that you're shopping for
later this year but for now that's it
I'm here to McLaren booth at the new
york international auto show</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
