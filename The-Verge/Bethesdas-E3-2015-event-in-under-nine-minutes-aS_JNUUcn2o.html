first-ever III showcase I assume that
some of you in the audience I've heard
of a game called doom before doom is a
special part of each of our individual
gaming histories both personally and
professionally but the foundation of any
doom experience is unquestionably combat
that's centered around three things
badass demons big effing guns that's
right and moving really really fast do
multiplayer this fast-paced arena-style
combat in locations ranging from UAC
facilities on Mars to the depths of hell
you'll be challenged in exciting modes
like domination freeze tag and clan
arena to annihilate your enemies using
your own personal blend of skill fast
vertical movement awesome guns and very
unique power-ups we wanted to provide
more and allow our fans to do more so
with this doom we asked what if every
player regardless of platform or past
experience had the ability to build and
instantly share their own creations we
are proud to announce doom snap map a
custom designed built in gateway to an
endless stream of doom experiences
created by you it's an easy to use
in-game tool with uncompromising depth
and capability
without any past experience or special
expertise any player can easily snap
together and customize intricate maps we
can't wait to get doom into your hands
in the spring of 2016 on xbox one ps4
and PC over the last year we've been
working on how to expand at how gamers
create and share that content to our
communities how they connect both to
each other as well as to us the result
of that work is a new digital platform
and it's called Bethesda net this is a
home for all things Bethesda Bethesda
net builds on our commitment to
developing and supporting great triple-a
quality games in fact it was that
commitment to quality and innovation
that inspired us to found battle cry
studios and their upcoming game battle
cry
we'd like to say thank you to the
millions of fans who play dishonored on
behalf of our entire team i can tell you
your passion was deeply gratifying you
inspired us and so the reason we're here
tonight is that we're super excited
about showing you what comes next from
us in dishonor to the Empire of the
Isles is in jeopardy once more when an
otherworldly usurper seizes the throne
this time you have the choice to play as
poor vova tano or Emily called when a
new character both have their own unique
sets of powers their own weapons and
gadgets and of course you can combine
these things creatively to eliminate
your targets as you see fit will tell
you more as soon as we can but what
we're here tonight to say is that
Dishonored 2 is coming and will be
available for pc xbox one playstation 4
thank you so much hi and while you wait
for the new game we have more of the
original dishonored for you to enjoy it

comes with all the original game plus
all the other content and all of it has
been graphically enhance for Xbox one
and ps4 five days ago we launched the
elder scrolls online Tamriel unlimited
for the ps4 and xbox one consoles we're
excited about what fans have to look
forward to next so here's a peek at what
the team at ZeniMax online studios is
bringing to Tamriel unlimited this year
tonight we are pleased to announce the
Elder Scrolls legends a strategy card
game that builds on the rich legacy of
skyrim the elder scrolls online and
brings the world of the Elder Scrolls to
a completely new genre we we did we did
doom right we didn't battle cry and
please give a warm welcome to the game
director of bethesda game studios and my
very good friend todd howard there are
very few things as good as fallout one
of the great things about fallout is the
world that existed before the bombs fell
and that is where our game starts and
this is where you create your character
by simply selecting part of the face and
sculpting and of course you can play as
a female this is an enormous dynamic
world where you can create any kind of
character you want go where you want and
do whatever you want you want to come
with me better okay then let's stick
together hey head over there
now to the cool stuff this is a very old
photo from the future of course of the
invention of the very first Pip Boy and
of course we have a new one in fallout 4
this is where you find it when you leave
the vault we do have a layered armor
system now there are holotapes you can
listen to and some of these are even
game tapes we made a real one this comes
with our collectors edition and yes you
can put your phone in it
and yes we made an appt for it but we've
also done something else for your
smartphone and your tablet's a totally
new game it is called fallout shelter
and in it you get to make your own vault
and you are the overseer controlling
everything
this game is going to be free but don't
worry there are no paywall timers so you
don't need an internet connection this
game is coming out on the app store
tonight so back to the big one you know
we love building stuff in our games so
like many things we have gone completely
overboard and here's how it works in the
game we're allowing your character while
playing to rebuild and this crafting
system carries over to other I things in
the world let's say you want to build
this scope and the game will tell you
you need these components and those
components are found in all of the items
in the world so you could decide to
build this scope out of these you know
say the microscope a toy car or these
you know duct tape an alarm clock and
such so we like to fill our worlds with
thousands of items that you can interact
with and now all of them have purpose we
really appreciate everybody's patience
you know we didn't say anything for
years in this game while everybody
waited and we don't want you to wait too
much longer so we're happy to say
fallout 4 is coming out November 10 to
this
okay that's it folks we hope you enjoyed
our first-ever III showcase thank you so
much
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
