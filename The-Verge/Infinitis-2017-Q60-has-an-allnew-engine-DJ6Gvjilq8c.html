verge and we were standing in front of
the brand-new 2017 model of the Infiniti
q60 now this thing has been completely
redesigned from the top to the bottom on
the outside you have a totally different
look a little bit more reserved than we
usually see with some of them fin of
these models and on the inside we have
an all-new engine we've got a three
liter twin turbo 400 horsepower engine
at the top-end 300 horsepower in the
middle and then there's an all-new
option for a four-cylinder 208
horsepower
single turbo engine now this is the
first time that Infiniti has actually
changed that engine in a long time it's
been since 2008 since they put something
new in here well let's get back to that
design for a minute they've got the same
sort of scooped really heavily angled
front grille there's some really awesome
looking LED lights in the front but
otherwise we've got a much smoother look
than we're used to at some infinities
they've really tweaked the inside of
this thing - we've got a new look
interior and we've got some features
that you expect going forward to a 2017
model like Lane Assist and forward
collision warning now that stuff's
really important considering this car is
the kind of car that competes with
things like the Mercedes c-class or the
BMW 4-series
we don't know pricing yet but you can
look for this car later this year for
more from here at the Detroit Auto Show
