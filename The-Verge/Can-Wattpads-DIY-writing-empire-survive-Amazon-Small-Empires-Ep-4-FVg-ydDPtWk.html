carved their exploits and visions in
stone and play and traced them in crude
ink over parchment and papyrus striving
to live in eternal memory through the
written word as history began with
writing it is continued with printed
records books were the great treasures
of the earliest civilizations today they
are the great means of communication
between people and nations oh I didn't
see you there I was just reading this
book I know what you're thinking Alexis
that's not a book it's a phone and
you're right it is a phone I'm reading
on an app called Wattpad which allows me
to read millions of e-books written by
people all over the world just anyone
can start writing in fact the one I'm
reading right now is called High Times
at City Hall it's a fictional account
about Mayor Rob Ford which is
appropriate because I'm here in Toronto
home of Wattpad and I'm intrigued
because I've got a bunch of questions
for this company like how are they so
huge in the Philippines and what are
they going to do now that Amazon has
gotten into their space and is trying to
eat their lunch and finally how they can
turn this passion for writing into real
maple scented money for their users and
their company I'm Alexis Ohanian
start-up founder and Y Combinator
partner over the last year I went on a
200 event book tour and met people
building small empires all across
now I'm back with a new season
revisiting some of my favorite stops
from the tool don't build a feature
that's a mantra many startups here from
experienced entrepreneurs and investors
if your whole idea for a company is
something a tech Titan is likely to
simply bolt on to their immensely
popular product then your entire company
is at stake for Wattpad which built a
platform for collaborative writing this
challenge takes the form of Amazon's
newest venture right on Amazon is a
history of squeezing smaller competitors
out of business and right on we'll
connect with the companies immensely
popular ebook store and Kindle devices
Wattpad has a big lead with millions of
users already contributing writing
regularly now will need to figure out
how to stop Amazon from stealing its
thunder so anyone can be a writer do you
really believe that I think everyone has
a story to tell
mm-hmm I think too you know to tell it
in a compelling way in a way that is
interesting for readers takes practice
you need to learn that right and I think
what path becomes a tool and a platform
in which you can do that you have an
idea right that first chapter that first
paragraph and put it up there and see if
it resonates with people see if people
want to hear more it kind of gives you a
lot of motivation to continue doing that
the way I described Wattpad is that it's
a place for people to escape connect and
express through stories and Wattpad
stories are really unique they're made
for mobile
they are highly serialized and they are
place for writers and readers to connect
with each other so how many people are
sharing or writing stories right now a
lot better well a lot of writers are
also readers and readers are also
writers so if not on a monthly basis we
have over 35 million users we've created
a community in which writers and readers
are extremely positive about the entire
active storyteller so as a writer why
pad is a really safe place to be to not
just get feedback about your story but
get a lot of positive encouragement
about the whole process of writing
you'll find this audience you find this
community and it's it's a way of sharing
your writing with a low low risk kind of
a way
you know my wife did my cover design for
me I kind of started out slowly I was
getting you know 10 20 reads a day and
then the day I got like I was on the
feature on the main page yeah it was
like a thousand reads a day overnight I
think I found that my calling isn't is
in writing and Wattpad has given me the
platform to grow as a person as a writer
without Wattpad I wouldn't be writing
and now it's sort of my full-time
aspirations my full-time passion what
are some of your biggest success stories
Anna Todd she started writing a One
Direction fan fiction on Wattpad last
year that was giving my idea she's gone
over a billion reads on Wattpad and
Simon Shuster published her book man
paramount announced a film deal okay
wait so they're making a film out of fan
fiction she wrote on Wattpad about one
direction right all right so what pads
got millions of users traffic is booming
when that happens I usually get the
attention of large companies like Amazon
which is just unveiled a new product
called right on which looks suspiciously
a lot like Wattpad historically large
incumbent companies don't kill startups
even if they copy them feature by
feature they can't replicate what that
startup does right there's just too much
inertia too much momentum and that big
company to adapt
so it's always flattering when an
incumbent tries to copy a startup right
Amazon's got their right on
product what's the argument for using
Wattpad continues wipeout as opposed to
and Amazon's new thing that Mazon is
right on is very interesting they really
kind of repackage their their Kindle
it's still very much transactional based
on the finished piece of work mmm so
with right on writers are writing the
whole story handing it over to Amazon
and praying that Amazon picks it up and
decides to publish it for them most
writers on Wattpad are not looking for
that most writers don't want that they
have a story to tell
all right and the way to do that is now
from day one start connecting start
building readers so I think Amazon's
approach is very much kind of based on
their existing model of getting content
and selling it to readers yeah Amazon
has done a very good job certainly an
e-reader market and in getting
penetration there but they still started
out as a logistics company and in many
ways they still are like moving physical
things whether it's by drone or by
messenger whatever their Sheila move its
physical Adams going forward without all
of the baggage of physical infantry
infrastructure you all are seeing the
world pretty much how I I think most of
us will assume it is going to be in 10
and 20 30 years so I wonder what is the
new world of publishing 10 years from
now when Wattpad is the incumbent five
ten years from now the content is going
to be free and then it's about how do
writers make money after they've given
away their free content not you know not
all that different from musicians today
so started back in 2006 alright this is
imagine time 2006 I was a lot Warner
remember before iPhone before the Kindle
before and so I didn't really exist
exactly I loved reading I read a lot and
I want to read wherever I happen to be
and now there was really no other way to
do that all I had on me was my old Nokia
candy bar phone and I thought well I'm
an engine I can figure out a solution to
this so over a weekend I put together
this prototype that was really the first
cloud-based ereader that is you go to
the website upload your story and then
poof we can read it on your phone and I
think you know a bunch of people that I
knew reach out to Alan my co-founder and
he said you know what I'm working on a
similar idea we need to get together Wow
and in cloud wasn't even a buzz word
back then like this ahead of the game we
were really excited and then you know we
blast out to all our friends posted on
you know on blogs and forums and the
like and then and then nothing happened
nobody was using it nobody everyone
thought it was crazy like why would I
want to read on my tiny mobile phone it
didn't make any sense right so I would
say the first couple years was you know
a pretty slow grind and then when did
you know you were on the Sunday I think
as the s devices Scott was sophisticated
the screens got larger data plans became
more available that's when we started
seeing users kind of really adopt this
in the way that we had originally
envisioned not in or using a mobile
phone as your primary reading device no
matter where you were
this is what that this is what pad and
I'm told there are millions of authors
using this to write stories and they're
all here no they're all over the world
we have about a hundred people who are
full-time employed here okay all of the
titles that are on here are titles of
actual stories that are on watch zombie
rock that's really good product team in
here with that community team working in
here no office is really open concept
open layout and that just allows us to
all collaborate and connect with each
other how did you end up here um I
actually wrote a story on Wattpad what's
the story called what's next I made it
sound fictional and tone but it was
essentially going over my resume it was
two chapters long the third chapter said
look II can't hear the rest of the story
if you don't bring Danielle in for an
interview so right then in there I kind
of followed all of my potential losses
on Wattpad I said this is the story of
why I want to work for rock pad and I
got called in for an interview that is
such an unconventionally awesome way to
apply for a job how long ago was that
that was two years ago Wow
and I was playing number 23 these are
real quotes from Wattpad users about
their connection to walk path so you'll
see that throughout the office I have
always loved reading but never had
confidence to write anything myself that
feeling you get when someone leaves a
nice comment on a little file oh so rare
in the internet these days
anytime you create a platform there's no
way to know how people are actually
gonna use it when Wattpad started out
they thought people would love to just
read eBooks it turns out they wanted to
write them too now no one could have
predicted that it would be so popular in
the Philippines it's such a success
Wattpad it's actually got a TV show
where every week they take one of those
user generated stories and turn it into
a TV episode the thing about the
Internet once you put something online
you lose control and that's a good thing
Aussie Felicity sandal but you can call
me city the city I live in is MP city is
the Wattpad shown the Philippines in
Tagalog or is it an alien it's in
taglish it's happening law yeah so you
can watch it and figure out what's going
on until I go in these monologues again
no idea what's going on what is mad
mullah naman and super heart scrubs a
campus that it's just a really
particular demographic really particular
audience
I will tell you'd say that except it
trends worldwide so it is what you're
massively social because of expats I
know because the Philippines the
Philippines is that strong socially they
drive worldwide trending on Twitter with
white hat presents
did the show come about because some on
a producer in the Philippines was like
this thing is amazing everyone loves
this content we want to produces show
out of it like which comes first as
Wattpad see all the traffic and then
find people in the Philippines to boost
the show or is it the other way around
this one was pretty organic cliff
Wattpad was already really big in the
Philippines and so it was sort of
already at that household name say is
where you know people are spending with
billions of minutes on Wattpad and so
they really already knew about Wattpad
and then within the philippines like
many of their top movies many other top
films all came off of Wattpad and so
sort of the natural extension was to
bring it to the small screen I mean did
you all go out of your way to try to
build this community in the Philippines
I think one of the things that we did
early on was really made sure that the
localization the translation in Tagalog
worked really well on Wattpad and that
sort of fostering some of the community
and we had a community specialist on our
team who's Filipino and that helped as
well and so what's funny is that if
you're on Wattpad it's not very long
before someone writes you from the
philippines and says welcome all right
so you guys obviously don't produce dead
tree books and it is quite lovely to see
here this sculpture of a tree featuring
what appear to be Wattpad stories yes
that's right so all of the leaves on the
trees are all Wattpad stories actually
if you look all around the bottom these
are all stories that originated on
Wattpad this is our Joe Gibbs and if you
look at the inside inscription for
Wattpad calm HarperCollins ended up
publishing this book but probably never
would have looked at a draft of anything
she would have mailed in no and and you
know in Abigail's case she wouldn't have
mailed in a draft she wasn't writing at
all before Wattpad so doubly cool
what does this mean about the role that
traditional publishers are playing where
you know in theory right you have these
taste makers who are very smart very
hard working people who sourced the
great idea who knew AHA that's gonna be
big right
does that threaten the status quo is
that threaten their industry I think
their diversify their bets so to speak
so they still do a lot of more
traditional publishing but at the same
time they they see that stories like
Anna's after is getting over a billion
reads online they know okay this is
there something here and they want to
make sure that they're in tune with the
current audience space right but also in
a sense a safer bet for them they know
automatically yes there's going to be
millions of readers from the get-go so
I'm mark young I'm writer and father and
professional in the insurance industry
and been a writer my whole life but
always have had the full-time job thing
going as well you know feed the family
all that but yeah my writing career is
kind of taken off in the last few years
and what has been a big part of that
what did what had do to change the game
the platform and how the reader
interaction was kind of so so easy to
have happen if you get a lot of readers
on Wattpad it's almost like you have a
huge team of beta readers you can get
feedback you can get encouragement and
that's all that's important to writers
you know if you imagine the physical
bookstore there are some viewers who
have never been inside of a physical
book table until you're right from the
oldest there were shelves there were
spaces that were divided in sections by
genre yeah it would have been rare I
think in in a purely physical world for
someone who is into you know young at
all One Direction fan fiction to have
stumbled in to say your section yeah
what does it mean that you get exposure
to just a broader audience that that's
sort of serendipity is that helpful for
you or is it frustrating you just like
get off my lawn yeah not at all no I
think that's it's good and I think that
kind of
genre pollination that Wattpad allows
it's like everybody's all in there
together and somebody follows you today
and you kind of go and look on their
profile you see what's on their reading
lists it's it's a very collaborative
kind of everybody's sharing interests
and then enthusiasm everybody's a really
enthusiastic reader which is amazing
like this day and age like teenagers are
out there reading a lot again they're
just not readin in the way people used
to think about what reading meant what
kind of feedback you get from the
Wattpad community it makes it mean so
much more because the stuff I write
sometimes may be limited in terms of
what I've envisioned but readers come in
with their own perceptions their own
backgrounds their own education and
ideas and it becomes a collaborative
process what does a company like Wattpad
do for you as a writer when you could be
publishing every day so it kind of
liberate Smee from the need to have like
perfect writing right off the bat and
just bring out the first draft and it
takes a lot of courage to do that
but I think when you keep practicing you
can get a lot of techniques and and
learn a lot of skills that you need even
in an age where you know we all have
mobile devices now that are full of
games and distractions right how does
something like Wattpad compete against
candy crush it has been that's the fun
thing I guess maybe part of it is this
this gamification of it like getting
more reads getting more likes getting
more comments maybe it's a way of people
putting up their own fiction and they
would go and read six pieces of fiction
and try and get those people to read
them and yeah so there's an incentive
for authors to even be reading because
that that virtuous cycle yeah exactly
uh-huh and as a reader I would just say
to you why not add a Kraken or some
zombies maybe that's possible
what what kind of stuff is spiking right
now so one direction is still definitely
very strong but we're seeing other
pop-culture references come up for
instance vampires was a very hot topic a
couple years ago right but not so much
now what about where werewolves also on
the decline these zombies more sighs
yeah so you're looking at all this
you're looking all this data if you see
here's an area that's clearly on the
rise are there things you do to
encourage writers to draw writers in to
help get those things moving a couple of
things I would try to do we certainly
promote that to you know to readers we
know that this topic is very popular
amongst certain demographic people in
certain in certain countries and then we
can promote that to them so that we're
kind of pouring through to fire so we
can connect them with the right audience
and writers respond a lot of this
because at the end of the day they want
to they want people to read their stuff
so you're giving them the forecast for
what they should be writing by so that's
something that we're spending a lot of
more effort on is how do we you know
make use of this data how do how do we
make use of this information that we
have to make it you know to make it
better for our readers and our writers
it's easy for user-generated content
platforms to put making money on the
back burner while they have high growth
that's what what pads been doing but now
is the time for them to start thinking
about how to actually make money now the
last thing they want to do is do that in
a way that just ruins the user
experience because after all the users
are the ones who are creating all the
value on Wattpad but the best-case
scenario is one where Wattpad makes
money and their authors do too
let's go a few years in the future right
let's assume this momentum continues and
this continues what is the next logical
step are you thinking ahead
how can I make this into a career I
would love to find a way to make it into
a career but I mean it's a it's a
crowded space and as you say we're
always in competition with the latest
app latest game latest TV show people
are watching on the subway you know and
there's a lot of content out there so I
mean I think storytelling is a kind of
content driven thing no matter what the
space is you're trying to fit it in to
keep on working on that are you making
any money from it um currently not yet
but hopefully soon what is your dream
scenario I mean this like you're putting
in serious hours producing stuff that
people clearly love it seems like there
should be a way for you to be able to
get compensated for this in some way so
that you can keep doing it I was acting
you just in a meeting with another
Wattpad staff talking about ways to
monetize the writing process and and
help authors out on a career so I think
that's something we're still working on
I have a lot of multimedia work that I'm
doing I've created with the local artist
collaborated on these cell phone charms
coffee bean cell phone charms we want to
really help writers close a loop so for
the writers that are very very serious
about writing and want to make a career
we want to give them options and
opportunities to actually monetize
mm-hmm
so what are what are some of those
options yeah so there's a number of
things that are we're experimenting with
right now and that we you know I don't
really know if I can talk about it in
too much detail but really the main
motivation is that we want to help
writers make money off of not just their
story but also the relationship that
they built with their audience last year
we tried this experiment that was sort
of a fan funding initiative where we
gave writers this platform where they
could sort of activate their fan base to
help them fund their next story or their
next book that they were writing so that
was one way in which we helped writers
actually
make money off yet watch that community
so so kind of like the crowdfunding
model right and so a writer because she
already has the relationship with her
fans doesn't have to take them to
another platform can say right within
their platform hey I want to write this
book yeah all right
what motivates writers people love other
jobs in some cases to spend all this
time and energy writing for free to get
their story heard in the old world you
write you know you spend weeks months
years writing your manuscript you send
that around to the publishers and it you
know they reject it and you know letter
thanks but we're not interested that's
very demoted so the main motivation is
really telling story having people read
it and appreciating it that's a more
main motivation for writers and like you
said at the end of the day yes they're
going to be people that are that they're
looking to make money from their work
but I believe first of all that's a
small portion and secondly we're going
to evolve new ways for these types of
writers to make money and after they
have given away they felt differently
what do you want to be doing what is the
dream gig for you five years traveling
the world and writing a novel in every
country I go to do you think is what Pat
gonna be part of that vision
definitely yep I think reaching out to
readership online is a part of the
industry now like we can't be separate
from that people no longer just pick up
a book and read it but they they're
involved in the social media they're
involved in the author's life so that's
definitely going to be part of it I
think first drafts will always go on
Wattpad and see what readers think about
it I always believe in what Cory
Doctorow says is that the worry is not
that people will read you for free is
that they won't region so just getting
your work out there just be read ya be
read it's fitting that here in an
international city like Toronto Wattpad
has been able to build a global platform
for authors to write works that can be
read all over the world
they've been able to connect Millions
give people a voice that doesn't require
a book deal that's awesome
they've built a great platform the
question is can they build a great
business to Wattpad thrives because of
its devoted users who continue coming
back to the service whether you run an
online community like Wattpad or a
brick-and-mortar retail store building
customer loyalty is essential to getting
returning customers try giving your
business a personal touch by sharing
photos of you and your staff and your
company website or why not offer
specials and online discounts for
returning customers loyalty cards and
giveaways are easy ways to bring back
customers and costs next to nothing if
you have a brick and mortar store use
the space to host special events for
customers from workshops and demos to
guest speakers these events are a great
way to offer more and remind customers
why they should be coming back for more
