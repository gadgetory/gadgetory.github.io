robertson and this is 90 seconds on the
verge from the set of on the verge
apples sold over 3 million new iPads and
ipad minis and their first weekend of
availability the company says that this
is double the previous record for 1.5
million Wi-Fi only ipad apple does not
break down how many of those three
million were iPad minis and how many
were 4th gen iPads we think it's safe to
say there probably weren't a lot of iPad
to sales the iPad Mini is currently sold
out with a two week wait for online
orders Windows Live Messenger is now the
walking dead the verge has learned to
several sources that the service will be
retired in the coming months and
integrated into skype microsoft has
slowly been moving people over to the
messenger backend for skype over the
past few months according to sources the
company will announce the retirement of
Windows Live Messenger soon possibly as
early as this week finally CBS is
embracing hulu sort of the network has
signed a licensing agreement for over 26
hundred episodes that includes those
classics like The Twilight Zone Star
Trek's as well as newer shows like CSI
Miami some caveats though shows
currently on the air like Big Bang
Theory are not part of the deal and what
shows are available at require a Hulu
Plus subscription the deal is
non-exclusive so there's no need to
worry about CDF's content vanishing from
netflix anytime soon considering who's
uncertain future it's probably good to
keep those options open that's it for
today's top stories if you're in New
York join us tomorrow for the taping of
on the verge and remember to write in
soon-to-be overlord ross miller on your
ballots</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
