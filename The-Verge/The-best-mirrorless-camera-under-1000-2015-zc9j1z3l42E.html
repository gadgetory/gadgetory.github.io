smartphone it takes good photos and it's
always in our pocket or our hand and
makes an ideal portable camera but a
smartphone isn't a particularly capable
camera and if you want to do something
like take photos in low light or a
fast-moving subjects you're going to
want something better that's something
better is a mirrorless camera there are
a ton of mirrorless cameras to choose
from and every single one of them takes
better photos in your smartphone for
under a thousand bucks you can get a
great camera with a lens that can
actually really expand your photographic
capabilities a great mirrorless camera
not only takes great photos it's easy to
carry around as fast and reliable
has lots of buttons and dials to help
you control your photos and has lots of
different lenses that you can attach to
it when you want to change things up for
under $1000 you can't do better than
Fuji films XT 10 it's not the smallest
mirrorless camera but it's compact
enough to fit in most any shoulder bag
the size is easy to hold and there are
lots of buttons and dials on it that
make it easy to adjust things when
you're shooting of course there's also a
dead simple Auto mode for when you just
want the camera to do the work for you
the xc10 is a great viewfinder which not
every camera offers it also has a
tilting screen which makes it easy to
get shots from various angles the
autofocus system is quick and reliable
and it can take great photos and all
sorts of lighting conditions at your
smartphone won't even touch the lens
that comes to the xc10 is a basic zoom
but it's optically stabilized which
helps with low-light shots
fujifilm also has a wide variety of
really great lenses that you can add to
the xc10 when you outgrow the kit lens
and when it's time to edit and share
your photos xc10 is built-in Wi-Fi to
make it easy to transfer images right to
your phone the X de 10 is not the
smallest or cheapest camera you can get
but it does offer the all-around best
package but if you do want something
smaller and cheaper you should look at
Olympus's brand new e/m 10 mark 2 the
e/m 10 mark - as many of the features we
look for like a tilting screen great
viewfinder and built-in Wi-Fi Olympus
also has a broadest range of mirrorless
lenses to choose from when you want to
add to your arsenal its controls are
slightly less intuitive however and it
can be daunting to pick up if you're new
to photography
there are many other options to look at
such as nikons weirdly compact 1 j5 or
Panasonic's beefy g7 neither of which
hit the ideal size we're looking for
sony has been making great mirrorless
cameras for years but its a6000 is
nearly 2 years old and due for a refresh
samsung packed lots of technology into
the NX 500 but forgot to add a
viewfinder which makes it less appealing
than our winners no matter which camera
you pick you're going to get something
that takes great photos in all sorts of
lighting conditions but if you want
something that you can grow into with a
great selection of lenses and lots of
controls you're going to want the
Fujifilm XC 10</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
