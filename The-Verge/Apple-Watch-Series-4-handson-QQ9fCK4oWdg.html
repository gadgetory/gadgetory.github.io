for what you're looking at here is the
new 44 millimeter version so it's a
little bit bigger I've got it compared
to my old Apple watch here so you can
see that the screen is a little bit
bigger but also more importantly the
screen builds closer to the edge it's
30% bigger than it was before now if
this larger size isn't for you it is
also available in this smaller 40
millimeter version so there you go those
are the two sizes they're things that
are new here besides the larger edge to
edge screen is that the new larger
screen allows you to do more things so
you can see that you can fit just but
ton of complications on this thing and
they all can do stuff so if I tap on
music here go through music and so
you'll see I'm scrolling on this digital
crown and a digital crown this little
wheel here has been updated and it has a
haptic feedback to it now you can you
can kind of feel it when you scroll it
around there's just a little bit of
vibration there's
pretty fascinated it has a stainless
steel casing and other things that are
different they've moved the microphone
over to this side because they've moved
the speakers over here and made them
much much louder so it's more convenient
for making calls but of course the
biggest deal with the Apple watch are
health features and there are a bunch of
new health features here one of them for
example is they can detect an irregular
heartbeat they can also tell you if your
heartbeat is too low and all-new here
the FDA has approved an ECG
so there's sensors around the ring of
the heartrate monitor and then also on a
digital crown here and so when you're
wearing it you should be able to hold
your finger on there it'll read sensor
here and underneath and you'll be able
to get an ECG unfortunately that's not
running on these models yet now there
are of course new watch faces so you can
see these crazy complication field watch
faces but if we wanted to take a look at
what else we got here
these cool vapor watch faces so this
like shows you how cool the screen looks
we couldn't even go here's the fire it
is just super fire
another thing that's new is fall
detection so if it detects that you fall
down because you've flailed your arms
around it is able to say hey it looks
like I'm falling do you wants to call
emergency services and if you do it'll
do it if you don't you don't answer at
all in a way to beat and then they will
call emergency services for you which is
a pretty nice feature it comes in silver
gold Space Gray they're aluminum and
this finish here is the brand-new gold
finish pre-orders start on Friday and
they ship on the 21st the smaller one
the standard one it cost 399 with GPS
and if you want you could spend $4.99 to
get an LTE everybody thanks so much for
watching this has been a crazy packed
hands-on event we're gonna have way more
coverage of all of the iPhone news and
all of the Apple watch news so keep it
locked to the Virg</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
