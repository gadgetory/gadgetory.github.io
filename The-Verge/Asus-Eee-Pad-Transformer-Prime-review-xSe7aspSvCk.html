this is Susie's eat pad transformer
prime which is one of the most exciting
tablets to hit this holiday season and
that's because it's got a brand-new
design but is also the first tablet to
have a quad-core Tegra 3 processor so
the transformer prime actually is a lot
like the original transformer in that it
has an external keyboard dock which
turns it into a laptop of sorts a sous
has done a really nice job redesigning
the entire tablet they've not only
slimmed it down but they've also created
sort of a nicer look and feel here the
back now is made out of aluminum and has
a concentric circle pattern just like a
seuss's ultrabook on top of that they've
actually added an eight megapixel camera
to the back it actually takes some of
the best shots I've seen yet on a tablet
and that's not exactly saying much but
the pictures really do come out quite
clear but my favorite new thing about
the design of the tablet itself is
actually it's 10.1 super IPS plus
display not only is it more readable
outdoors but inside the viewing angles
are great and it is really really bright
and crisp but of course the standout
speck of the transformer prime is its
Tegra 3 quad-core processor this is the
first tablet to have this processor
which promises three times the graphics
performance of the Tegra 2 processor
overall I've found performance to be
pretty snappy you'll see that menu
transitions are really fast however
other things like browser performance
doesn't really seem to be all that much
better it's with gaming though that the
performance increase can really be seen
there are some new games that have been
optimized for tegra 3 including
shadowgun and glow ball and with those
you can really see new lighting effects
and water effects also Tegra 2 games
look pretty great on the system and when
you out put it to a 1080p TV things look
even better Nvidia and a sous have also
added USB host support to the tablet so
you can actually add a game controller
which is pretty cool still software is
the real issue with the transformer
prime well as sous is promising an
update to ice cream sandwich or android
4.0 before the end of the year it's
launching right now with honeycomb and
the biggest problem with honeycomb
continues to be that it isn't all that
polished and there just aren't that many
Android tablet apps my complaints about
honeycomb aside the software actually
works really well with the keyboard dock
the keyboard dock you can pick up for an
extra one hundred and fifty dollars and
actually adds a lot of functionality to
the tab
not only is there the keyboard but
there's also a touchpad which supports
multi-touch gestures as well as a USB
port and an SD card slot there's
actually also an internal battery which
adds about 10 hours of battery life when
paired to the unit for six hundred and
fifty dollars for the tablet and the
keyboard dock the transformer prime is a
pretty great piece of hardware you get a
quad-core processor really fast gaming
performance a beautiful 10 inch display
and a great keyboard dock that adds a
totally new dimension to your tablet
that being said the software is still
the major issue for this platform for
those that want the better app
experience and the better software
experience the iPad is the way to go
however the transformer prime definitely
provides something totally unique in a
new package</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
