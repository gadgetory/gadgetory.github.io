next-gen console this is the year of the
next-gen game last year Sony and
Microsoft showed off launch titles and
very early previews for the PlayStation
4 and Xbox one a Nintendo well it
doesn't matter but this year developers
have had much more time to work with
these new systems and there's going to
be a lot more to play let's start with
Microsoft last year the company put more
focus on the xbox one's entertainment
features and left many of its upcoming
games in the backseat this year we can
really expect the company to put a focus
on its games that in the 399 dollar
connect free xbox one or how microsoft
plans to compete with the ps4 we've
already gotten a brief teaser of the
next entry in the Halo series but next
week we can expect to see a full look at
halo 5 Guardians the first main game in
the series since 2012 let's do to hit
the xbox one in the fall of 2015 there's
also a good chance Microsoft will tease
the next gears of war games since the
company now owns the rights to the
series sony is also going to talk a lot
about big name games leaving with a
couple of key exclusives Naughty Dog's
critically acclaimed Uncharted series
continues with uncharted 4 we saw a
teaser last year but aside from the
title haven't seen much that's likely to
change we also make it a better look at
the Victorian steampunk action game the
order 1866 and the witness a new
adventure game for the makers of brave
remember those Island puzzles but maybe
the biggest question this year's what
Nintendo will do to save me you sales to
start Nintendo just released mario kart
8 last month and it is dove bomb and
next week the company will show off the
latest entry in the Super Smash Brothers
series a long time staple for Nintendo
it's also dedicating a 90 minute
presentation to a single 3ds title so we
can expect it to be pretty big maybe a
new 2d Metroid who knows now let's put
exclusives aside this year we're going
to learn a lot more about destiny the
massively multiplayer first-person
shooter designed by the guys who first
made halo the studio is confirmed will
see a playable competitive multiplayer
demo and more details about a summer
beta program meanwhile Ubisoft is
expected to show off more on Assassin's
Creed unity set during the French
Revolution and far cry 4 which moves the
series from a tropical island to the
Himalayas Activision will be showing off
the next call of duty game titled
advanced warfare while EA is going to
give fans more details on the
unexpectedly police themed battlefield
hardline which will officially be
unveiled on Monday also despite being
delayed until next
the final part of the mostly critically
acclaimed series of Batman action games
Arkham Knight is still highly
anticipated at e3 and finally we've got
a lot of franchise installments on the
table there's a new Mortal Kombat and a
new alien game but probably the most
exciting is the new Star Wars
Battlefront the game had an awesome
teaser at e3 last year and the last main
battlefront game came out in 2005 so
there's a lot riding on this new entry
now putting games aside for a moment
this might be the first time in a while
we see some major updates in the virtual
reality field oculus has been pretty
hush-hush since being acquired by
Facebook earlier this year it's possible
though hardly certain that we'll hear
details about a final consumer version
of the oculus rift which is expected in
2015 oculus is also branched out from
hardware to publishing and it's
supposedly working with a number of
major developers on dedicated VR games
so seeing some new games isn't out of
the question either and then there's
project Morpheus Sony's virtual reality
headset while things still seem to be in
the very early stages any details about
pricing release date or final design
would be welcome additions III is always
full of surprises and even without the
prospect of a new console will be hoping
for big reveals of games we've never
heard of and virtual reality that's more
than just hype we'll be back starting
Monday with a big day of Sony Microsoft
and more and until then we'll keep our
fingers crossed</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
