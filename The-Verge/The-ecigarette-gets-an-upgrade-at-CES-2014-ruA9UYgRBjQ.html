electronic cigarettes proliferating in
bars and restaurants in your city or
maybe you're in a smoker yourself the
ecig industry is booming with sales more
than doubling in 2013 and the
acceleration is with more than just
adoption that transition is visible here
at CES in previous years the e cig
vendors at CES tended to be Chinese
manufacturers peddling unremarkable
unbranded disposable cylinders basically
a battery tied to a heater but this year
r.j. Reynolds one of the four largest
tobacco companies in America has an
enormous booth built up around their
flagship reusable ecig what we're seeing
is that the adult smokers preferences
and the type of alternative products
they're looking for has changed
dramatically over the last decade and
we're seeing this e cigarette category
grow exponentially it's already a 1.8
billion dollar industry I think
cigarettes will always you know be in
existence and but I do see and believe
that e-cigarettes will over time start
replacing the cigarette industry these
tech companies are also starting a thing
of themselves as technology companies
about fitting their devices with
Bluetooth microprocessors fingerprint
scanners and soon gyroscopes when we
thought about how does the product look
and how would she designed it the
thought was it shouldn't look like a
product made over a hundred years ago it
should look like a product that reflects
the unique componentry inside these
companies also have a special swagger
this year as if they know that their
industry is on the rise but while it's
true that we're at the beginning of the
next generation of e-cigs the trend is
still Nissen the Food and Drug
Administration has yet to put out
official regulations for ecigs and the
research on health impacts is still
being done this uncertainty hasn't
stopped companies from innovating and it
definitely hasn't stopped people from
vaping we're seeing ecigs in the
hallways on the show floor and even the
bath
even though technically vaping isn't
allowed inside the Convention Center at
least not this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
