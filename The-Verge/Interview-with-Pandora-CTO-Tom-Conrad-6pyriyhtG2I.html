here at CES in our studio and in studio
with us this morning is Tom Conrad the
CTO of Pandora we're to talk about a
bunch of music stuff Tom thanks so much
for coming by the studio it's great to
be here so you told me earlier that this
is your tenth CES it is and do they give
you like a watch out of a catalog at
that point or anything or yeah you get
it yeah and you've been working on
Pandora for just about ten years yep so
take me badly what was what was CES like
for you ten years ago when you first
showed um let's see we we stayed at the
Excalibur wonderful which is very nice I
think three of us came we we had a
single meeting with a brick and mortar
retailer and talking about putting music
listening kiosks into their CD
Department so yeah we've come a long way
since since ten years ago
CES and I think you know pandora has
evolved a lot of interesting ways since
then obviously any tech company over ten
years is going to change a lot but can
you give us a sense of just like how big
the scope is of Pandora on consumer
electronic devices yeah I think pandora
is on more than a thousand different
consumer electronics devices today and
you know it's funny I I was looking back
at some some some photos that I took
that that first CES ten years ago I was
like a kid in a candy store you know the
first time on the showroom floor and and
you know it's amazing the stuff that was
on the showroom floor you know ten years
ago was you know digital cameras big
flat-screen TVs cell phones that were
increasingly looking like little
computers I mean it's the same exact
stuff that's you know on the show floor
this year but it feels like the world
has changed a lot so I've been kind of
thinking but well what's what's driving
that sense of change other than the TVs
are getting bigger and flatter and or
less flat I guess here there this year
they're all curved and I think that one
of the big transitions is that 10 years
ago none of that stuff was connected to
the Internet
I mean literally the only thing in my
life that was connected to the Internet
10 years ago was you know my laptop my
personal computer in today like
everything on on the show floor is is
connected to the Internet every TV every
speaker we have a refrigerator that
streams Pandora and a jacuzzi that
streams Pandora there's a smart vacuum
now too so you might want to look into
that that's great yeah that's great I'd
like to be able to control my vacuum
from the office with my smart phone what
are we all who wouldn't yeah and and
then of course the other thing that's
really changed over the course of the 10
years is the services that we use I mean
10 years ago there was no Facebook there
was no Twitter
there was no Netflix streaming there was
no Pandora and so you kind of sum that
together I think that least for me
that's what's driving the sense of
innovation and change and at CES is the
Internet connectivity being kind of
ubiquitous and and these services that
have come along in the context of that
ecosystem right and as the Internet gets
connected to more devices that creates
more opportunities for companies like
Pandora to put their services on board
at the same time it can create
challenges because every implementation
is a little bit different but you guys
have done a lot of stuff around html5
like can you talk a little bit about
what you're doing to try to make all
those implementations a little bit
easier on yourselves so for the first
many many years you know going back six
or seven years now in Pandora's history
we had a strategy that said like you
know let a thousand flowers bloom you
know one of the strengths of radio
generally is that it's ubiquitously
available pandora is gonna you know kind
of step into the opportunity to defining
what the next generation of radio looks
like we have to enjoy that same level of
ubiquity and so to get there we
developed a SDK and a platform and
instead of developer tools and services
that would allow a partner to implement
Pandora on a television or a connected
speaker or set-top box and they you know
they build the Pandora client so kind of
to our specifications they send us an
example we'd run it through a set of
certification tests and so forth and and
tell them okay go ahead and ship it and
they're a bunch of advantages that
approach it's meant that we've you know
been able to get Pandora into tons of
and tons of devices with a relatively
modest amount of work on our end
the downside is you know there are
probably hundreds of Li hundreds of
different Pandora implementations that
are baked into firmware sitting on
devices that will never evolve that will
never change occasionally in the worst
case they end up looking more like a you
know Korean karaoke machine then then
the Pandora that we know and love or
fortunately that's fairly rare but it
occasionally happens and so about 18
months ago we started to think about
like what is the next generation of this
look like as it becomes more mainstream
it becomes increasingly important that
we can evolve the experience for our
consumers for our advertisers and kind
of get back and control the user
experience and so we made a bet that web
standards things like html5 and WebKit
and some of these things would make
their way into the consumer electronics
world starting first with with
televisions and set-top boxes and then
migrating to other things and we're
either prescient or lucky I think we
were just kind of lucky frankly but
that's really really happened so we've
got a great version of Pandora that's
built entirely out of html5 and other
web standards that we can target at any
devices capable of rendering a webpage
and so we chromecast is a great example
of that
chromecast of course adds the additional
kind of wrinkle that your smartphone
becomes a really interesting remote
control for the content sony has blu-ray
players and televisions that have a
great html5 engine that runs this native
Pandora platform we've demonstrated with
Samsung we're working with lots of other
players as well which you know
accomplishes that goal of putting this
back in control of the user experience
because every single time one of our
listeners activates the Pandora
application what's really happening
under the covers is the device goes out
to the internet says - Pandora's data
center what's Pandora today and we can
change the answer to that question you
know every day
if we want to experiment and so just a
mess with people sometimes and just a
mess right right you know where the
reason that's interesting to me is that
in the mobile world html5 based apps
never really took off right like
Facebook famous famously made this huge
bet on html5 apps and eventually Mark
Zuckerberg said this was a mistake this
didn't wait for us went back to native
apps why do you think that HTML wow that
could be hard to say when you go that
fast what anything html5 has been
successful for Pandora on all these
devices where maybe it native apps seem
to be succeeding more in the mobile
world you know that's a good question I
think one one dimension that at play is
that we're just really good at html5
development no I don't know the
experience really is indistinguishable
from what the native applications on the
same platform so there's there's there's
no kind of deficit to the user
experience and I think in some of the
things that have been done in mobile
it's really obvious that you're not
dealing with a native experience and
some of that maybe even comes from the
fact that in the mobile environment
there's a whole kind of aesthetic to the
user experience that's delivered through
the native platform in the context of
the television we don't really have that
you know there's not a set of native
user interface elements and things
that's consistent across applications
and so you're not we don't find
ourselves trying to mimic platform
behavior through HTML so there's a bit
of that I don't know it's working now
yeah so it's working let's talk about
advertising a little bit advertising
normally a boring topic for me
personally but I'd read a really
interesting story in The Times over the
last week about some of the things that
you guys are doing around targeting ads
of people based on their music
preferences and I think that you know
most of us think of ourselves as unique
little snowflakes but from from what I'm
reading the times just by knowing a
couple of the things I like you can
actually tell a lot about maybe my
political preference maybe about where I
might like to travel like can you tell
me about like some of these insights
that you're getting about
your listeners just from the music that
they're listening to yeah so it's been a
really interesting year for us in that
dimension you know we've got an
incredible team at Pandora whose job it
is you know just to make the best
playlist in the world so these are data
scientists and machine learning experts
algorithm guys big data guys like it's a
it's a really best in the world kind of
team with respect to the the task of
personalizing the Pandora listening
experience but it turns out that the
skills that that group has is are really
easily applied against the the data
science problem of how do you deliver
exactly the right ad to the right user
at the right time right song to the
raise you at the right time the right
add to the raise we're the same great
time which is really the goal right we
no one wants to put an ad in front of
you for product or service that's not
interesting to you just like we don't
want to put a song in front of you that
you don't like and so you know penned or
and those a handful of things about you
you know um you know when you register
you tell us you know the year you were
born you tell us the zip code that you
live in you tell us your gender and then
of course as you interact with the
service we've become familiar with your
musical preferences as well and it does
turn out that the combination of that
data a sense of what part of the country
you live in and the kind of music that
you listen to we can use to extrapolate
to lots of interesting things political
preference household income ethnicity
which allows us to do kind of you know
smarter mmm
infer to targeting for advertising
beyond what you know you might be able
to do just from the obvious things that
we collect like gender in it and so
forth do you ever like try to log in as
a 95 year old woman just to see how the
ads will change yeah all the time yeah
all the time yeah yeah mostly he's pen
doors in 95 awesome so I would be really
curious to know what you have coming up
on the product side this year like it's
it's a new year I'm sure you've done a
lot of strategic planning over the past
couple of months about what you're going
to be up to and I'm here to tell you all
about it let's just lay out the program
I have the whole brother
the whole project map that's a few jobs
don't exactly well I think one of the
things that's it's uh you know that's
we're working on here at CES and isn't
like a really important sort of
dimension of the evolution of Pandora is
he's getting Henry into the automotive
environment right about half of all
radio listening takes place in the car
if we're to reinvent radio as a medium
like we have to have a really strong
presence and automobiles
and so we have over the last few years
develop really close working
relationships with all the major
automotive OEMs I think you know more
than 20 we're in 130 different
automobiles today and I don't mean like
you know use the aux cable you know to
listen to Pandora bluetooth streaming
these are these are custom Pandora
implementations where your cell phone
provides the data connectivity and
actually runs the application but it
connects to the dash and all of the user
interface is facilitated by the car so
if you're in a car that features voice
control you'll use your voice to control
Pandora if you're in a car that has a
touchscreen you use a touchscreen if
it's a hardware you know centric
environment you use the hardware buttons
to control Pandora and so we've done a
lot of work to get pandora into that
kind of generation of the automotive
internet but we're just at the cusp of
the second generation which we call the
connected car and and the connected car
really is the the fulfillment of the
vision that we had in 2004 when we
started designing and building Pandora
which is that like you know everything
in your life is going to be connected to
the Internet including the automobile
that you drive and so we're talking
about cars that are fundamentally and
constantly connected to the Internet
just like your television and your
blu-ray player and everything else in
your life and what that does is it
really makes Pandora appear to FM radio
you know there's a FM antenna there's a
cellular antenna and so the consumer
gets in the car turns the key and you
know you know Pandora starts streaming
you know right right where you left it
when you got out of the car the
time and so we're really excited about
that but what it means is that it's an
entirely new runtime for the application
you know in the the first generation
scenario we are able to take advantage
of the fact of the applications actually
running on your cell phone Android or
iPhone in this connected car scenario
it'll be the cars platform and so what's
interesting is that environment is is
shaking out to be very webs web
standards centric html5 centric as well
as we're able to leverage a lot of the
investments we've made in that
technology platform in the context of
the car but there's tons and tons of
work going on at Pandora around just
just making sure that you know we have
best in the world implementations of
Pandora and this next generation of
connected car scenarios right well cool
so a few years from now we'll have
self-driving radio in our self-driving
cars exactly
I wonder exactly Tom thank you so much
for coming by the studio thanks super
fun all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
