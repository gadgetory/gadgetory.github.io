I'm here in Soho now this neighborhood
is usually known for shopping for
fashion for lots of tourists but I'm
here because of a very special building
on Broadway which is home to a bunch of
very famous New York tech companies
startups like Foursquare Thrillist and
ZocDoc which is a company I'm here to
see this is a company that was started
here in New York to tackle a really
really tough industry healthcare and to
revolutionize it by making it just as
easy to set an appointment with your
doctor as it is the order delivery and
that story has now grown that company
has now grown and it all began right
here in New York City I'll get the next
one I got a bunch of cameras hello I'm
here to see Cyrus you guys either have
very lacked security or you are
expecting me more this is a lovely
office you guys have here it'll be like
an episode of cribs so Cyrus right off
the bat thank you for taking the time
building a company on the one hand is
hard building a company in a sort of
historically not tech-savvy industry as
the health care profession is even
harder so so how when you were getting
this started why why did you even
consider trying to go into such an
industry that was not at the cutting
edge and then how the hell did you do it
my entire family is in health care and
so I think at a very early age my
parents are disappointed that I didn't
want to be a doctor but I grew up with
houses they grew up with health care all
around me and so I understood the needs
of I think doctors very acutely people
traditionally prior to ZocDoc would
always say doctors don't want to pay
money for stuff and they're gonna be
slow to adopt stuff and it's actually
not true doctors are really very smart
and they're only going to adopt things
that make financial sense for their
practices a lot of the technologies that
people have tried to introduce to them
may have been good for healthcare but it
may not have worked economically for the
practice and so it doesn't get adopted
very quickly I think that we can all
agree that the US healthcare system is
fundamentally broken
it's frustrating it's complicated and we
at ZocDoc
are doing our small part to fix the US
healthcare system by making it simpler
thank you very much of this opportunity
great job great job
another strong and a performances may be
tough to give so many fifty thousand
dollars I can tell you that honestly it
would just never occur to me to go to
any site to pick a doctor you go to a
site and just oh you know Lisa McIntosh
looks cute she went to Harvard I'll have
her operate on my heart I mean from
obviously from a heart condition that's
a very unique issue but I can say that
if you had a rash on your butt you
probably would come to our site a
because you wouldn't want to hear anyone
making that call and B it might be after
six o'clock and maybe the doctor's
office isn't open okay yo man don't you
end up the Kawasaki dude why don't you
deposit this cheque if you look at the
date this is the heart of the financial
crisis that we won this competition we
entered this competition with forbes.com
it Forbes gives us 100k here's what
we'll do we'll build a customer service
team across the USA appointments will be
made online from New York to LA so cast
your vote for ZocDoc a company in rhyme
will give you easier access to health
care in no time and we actually use this
money after we made New York successful
we didn't really have extra money to
very quickly launch into the next market
and we weren't able to access investors
because it was a financial crisis we use
this money to expand ZocDoc outside of
New York oftentimes we think about
consumer apps right if you build a site
like Reddit as long as you make it
useful for a user there are a user right
you have a sales cycle you actually have
to call up a doctor and convince her she
needs this so what like when you're a
nobody no offense but you're just
starting this company it's got a weird
name ZocDoc like how do you cold call a
doctor how do you get your first client
so we went it was through pure grit I
was the original sales person for ZocDoc
so I have two other co-founders as I
mentioned and I was responsible for
selling the doctors during the day and I
do QA on the website at night and
basically we had a month before we were
going to launch we started onboarding
doctors and our goal was to get enough
doctor said there would be a scroll
our search results those and we only
dislike there's plenty yeah we only had
Dennis back then and so we started with
Dennis in Midtown in downtown we ring
the hyperlocal we're gonna get people
near their work in Midtown in downtown
and I remember it was a couple days of
poor launch we only had maybe three or
four or five dentists that were on the
website and I didn't really have much of
a scrollbar going on that was my one
major strategic class people exactly so
I back then I I spent six hours in one
Medical one one dental practice trying
to get five dentists on and I got them
all on and it was literally I've been
thrown out of other doctors offices in
the past so so we launched me at least
had a scroll bar that we were able to
function correctly on the site and then
I proceeded to sign on the next 50
doctors myself in that process I was
probably thrown out of three doctors
offices with security and I'm proud to
say that every single one of those
doctors now uses dot doc we're here in
midtown visiting a doctor that's been
using ZocDoc for a few years now he's
sort of one of the OGS of the platform
hello I'm here to see dr. Ramani oh yes
of course that's good ah yeah about that
I don't lovely office you guys have here
all right thank you very much doctor
will see me soon
hello oh hey doctor just testing the
equipment I've always wondered what the
stuff uses this just show up in giant
spools at the office we buy them by the
case yeah ok then by the and what is how
do you what do you call this table paper
table painted okay okay I give you a
purple ribbon to give thank you then
this is my office where I am if I need
to consult with patients or where I do
all my work okay so you got a very
lovely office here now how did you mean
how do you first learn about ZocDoc
I start getting faxes not get your name
on axes faxes bats then cutting out is
just started there's actually faxes huh
and what I do with the fact is I do them
out captain trying them out I probably
got a dozen finally someone started
calling me
they said it's going to help your
practice doc it's a small price if you
don't like you can cancel at any time I
say you know it doesn't hurt I'm moving
when I moved to the new place I'll use
your service yeah and when I moved to
this office we started using it and you
know immediately we noticed that there
are a lot of benefits from it and today
I'm still using it and really taking
advantage of it interestingly the
doctors are often not the people who are
using the doctor facing that we call it
doctor facing but it's really its
receptionist its
office managers they're used to the
consumer web they're not necessarily
used to like professional tools so you
can trying to make it as easy to use and
simple as as the consumer web without
making it only a power user can use it I
actually put on my business card please
make your appointment via doctor there
it is yeah that's true you know what so
I actually put it on the card and sure
enough my returning patients are using
Java it didn't tie up the phones for my
staffed everything would be made online
patients will get reminders so myself
doc patients actually show up all the
time on time and if they need to cancel
the cancel online so we get a quick
pop-up window that it's cancelled so we
are in are notified in advance so in
that sense it really it was great art
all right I think giving you a cut for
all this free advertising you're giving
them talk to someone I will change they
don't but you know like we cyrus let him
know yeah I feel so often and you can
please please level with me when when
building a product that has two phases
one sort of consumer and one to the sort
of user whatever that might be
usually the the sort of internal not
widely consumer facing side languishes
because it's the afterthought right it's
like let's make this good to the masses
and we'll make these internal tools or
these tools for users just sort of good
enough yeah where that like that wasn't
all of that so we've been here for Ally
I mean the company's been around for
like five years right so I've been here
for only two years and it was kind of in
that state when I when I until you
showed up and figure it's not that but
no it's like as the team grew we got
enough bandwidth that we could you know
isolate a team and be like alright now
you have to improve this thing and make
it awesome so that's what we're doing
now I don't know we don't need to
necessarily role play here but like so
I'm a doctor I'm a dentist I'm spending
most of my time you know just trying to
make sure my patients are well along
with running a business and managing
employees everything else how do you
convince me that this is worth me giving
you money yeah so learning literally at
the beginning it was me with the
PowerPoint deck we didn't even have the
website live and so that was the first
thing I would doing you were sure you
were pitching it before the site was
even built yeah or live yet that's great
because we had to do both concurrently
in order to launch at this conference
and that took me a lot you know I
probably to get the first ten doctors I
probably spoke to like several hundred
and it just kept getting no after no
after no but if you know something about
sort of how the conviction we had this
is the future this is like the way that
everyone's can be booking their
healthcare appointments and people would
latch on with that and you know there's
a certain sub segment where they really
love that idea so it took us three years
to really get to the point where
everyone thought that sock-doc
we owned
who would succeed in our heart of hearts
and we had this conviction we powered
through but it took us three years to
really prove it to the outside world and
then there's only been for the last two
and a half years that everyone says I
wish I thought of that for the first
private three years people wishing you
know they'll get out of my office at my
office if we never we never go away
finding a doctor isn't ulti getting an
appointment in the timely manner seems
to be even more difficult than that but
there's that for that now there's not
for that there's an app for that there's
now an app for that
zOC dock dock dock dock dock dock dock
dock dock dock dock dock dock dock dock
dock dock dock dock dock dock dock dock
dock you know the great thing about
these apps is that they're in our phones
so they're always with us kind of like
our tissues oh right so what is this
three years running cranes best place to
work in New York three years in the row
we've made the cranes best places to
work list this past year we were in the
big fortune top 50 best places to work
in America
list and second year in a row best place
to work in healthcare and so it's
something we really pride ourselves on
you know we're not lavishly putting
Aeron chairs throughout our offices etc
a lot of our furnitures refurbished we
bought it we got it for free and so it's
not about like how much money we spend
on the actual physical infrastructure of
the space it's really about what we do
to enhance people's lives number-16 best
small places to work in America from
Fortune magazine so who are the other 15
ma'am I don't know yeah gotta crush them
yes but surely it has to be more than
just handing out some beers and playing
ping pong like any a lot of companies do
that but they aren't winning
back-to-back Awards so we what what else
when there was a hurricane hurricane
sandy came put a lot of our employees
out of a place to fight to live we found
homes places basically for all of our
employees who were displaced and we
actually made sure we found every single
employee there was one employee who
actually was went missing and I went
with my co-founder we actually found her
during the aftermath of hurricane and so
that was something that they know we
really care about everyone that works
here
lots of startups talk about hey you're
never more than a few feet from a snack
but it's usually not that healthy a lot
of candy a lot of chips whatever you
guys have one of the healthiest walls of
food that I've seen that a start-up and
it really it shows you guys really do
believe in you know being well eating
well and all that other good stuff we
feel as though improving people's health
is something that's paramount to our
brand and so we're gonna give away
snacks you want to get away healthy
snacks and try to make our lunches as
healthy as we can with salads except for
folks if I came to you and I said listen
I really want there to be a hidden cache
of snack junk foods because all this
healthy stuff is great and I know it's
good for me but sometimes I just want to
eat in a hundred Snickers bars many
think you're always welcome to go out
and get what kind of food you want yeah
you guys really do care I mean one of
our healthy granola bars of chocolate in
them does that count
a little a little I don't I string
cheese yeah maybe if it were covered in
chocolate so if you rewind a little bit
in my professional history I started my
career in tech and so Raab College I
work for a software company and then a
year out I started my first Internet
company that I ran for three years I
learned a lot of what not to do mean the
company had a great premise which is we
made software for e-commerce companies
to help them manage their e-commerce
returns and back then no one really
cared about managing returns effectively
they didn't care about customer service
like they do today
they're very oriented around only
focusing on top-line so it was very
difficult for us to sign up the initial
sets of e-commerce companies and then
the commerce bubble burst and all the
e-commerce guys wanted business so it
was really tough and I think recovering
from failure was one of the most
difficult things I ever had to do in my
life and I end up going to grad school
spent some years at McKinsey and I knew
that I wanted to go back in to something
entrepreneurial but I didn't know what
it was clearly the entrepreneurial
spirit was still there clearly it was
just waiting for the right thing but how
did you go about evaluating what the
hell you were gonna do so the first
thing is I had to I was living in Austin
Texas at the time and I was a 25 year
old failed CEO and I remember actually
what I did is first I wanted to revert
the maturity like there was weight on me
a lot no I had 35 very close friends
that were working
with me and I had not been successful
and I feel like I failed them and I put
so much everything I had into this first
company and I remember I went out I was
out with some friends and literally they
were I think they're even older than me
and someone asked why they brought their
dad out because I think it looks so so
just like whether in Encino does age and
so I went I went backpacking across
rural China for six months and I
literally wanted to just shed that old
responsibility and sort of start from
the beginning and that's sort of what
led me to grad school and then Mackenzie
and the night you know I felt like I had
that aha moment and I had to jump in all
the way as the guy who created the
Hipmunk chipmunk and the reddit alien
like I think a lot about building brands
and branding and your two adorable
cartoon doctors must have a story right
these are ollie and be there maybe after
my co-founder his wife Oliver and Vita
and we thought that it was a great way
to humanize what ZocDoc
that was about and we're friendly brand
and you know these are very friendly
doctors when I and I think it does
really matter because most people are
used to you know having pretty sterile
online experiences with anything related
to medicine like it's either the awful
stock photo of the doctor with the
stethoscope or just like it just feels
janky there's no other way to describe
that's how we started about three years
ago we redesigned the site and we
literally introduced the cartoon
characters we did a couple of tests to
see what people responded to well we all
will for all AMD to sort of wind a be
test I'm not sure if our developers may
have just like rigged the test so they
would win but we haven't looked back and
they've been a cool part of what we've
done
we always think about how we can replace
repetitive tasks with software one of
the common ones that I as a patient
always forget is like oh yeah every
syncs six months I got to get my teeth
cleaned every year I got to go for a
physical software makes this trivial I
don't need to remember no one in your
office needs to remember I just get a
notification how important is that
preventive medicine how important is
getting those checkups for maintaining
our long-term health I actually was born
and raised in Japan and Japan preventive
care is very important to the point that
you can't go to work on January 1 unless
you've done your previous year's annual
physical what the company requires it
so I grew up in Japan with the thinking
that we all have to go for annual
physical every year they come here there
are many people I've seen as patients I
haven't had a physical for 20 years I've
never had a physical which for me it's
mind-boggling you get a physical yeah
when you're young you're probably
healthy but later on you will probably
detect something that you're going to
get eventually early on get it early on
you get a couple warnings you can avoid
pills medication getting admitted to
hospital so it does make a difference
what stops you from getting complacent
when you feel like all right we really
know we're doing we treat our customers
very well we treat you know we've built
this this startup that has now achieved
you know a certain amount of success by
no means done but how do you keep
everyone hungry how do you stay hungry
so we're as I mentioned before we're a
mission driven organization and there's
a big problem United say it's healthcare
in my opinion is the problem of our
generation and something that people are
not aware of is that there's a huge
shortage of doctors and that people
expect not just the United States but
worldwide in the next 10 years I think
that there'll be a shortage of about
150,000 doctors in the United States you
have the baby boomer doctors that are
retiring you have other countries that
were previously economically not as
vibrant that are becoming more vibrant
where the doctors would normally never
great the United States they're staying
there we're not producing more doctors
in the United States we actually don't
actually graduate enough doctors to
satiate the demand that we have so we
need influx of physicians it's a huge
issue and it's one that I know that we
can solve and we by no means have solved
it every doctor in America is
not yet on ZocDoc every patient in
America does not yet know about ZocDoc
and yet they're waiting on average
because of the shortage of doctors if
you look at Massachusetts where they've
had similar health care reform then
we've had unites the rest of the United
States they had it since 2006 and it is
spike a five hundred thousand patients
right as a result of the new health care
reform laws we have a spike of thirty
million new patients the United States
coming you spike demand
you haven't even spiked supply and you
have these other things that are really
harming supplies there's all this and
balance and people are waiting in
Massachusetts 60 days to see a doctor
like people are dying as a result of
that like literally if you can't get
into the doctrine you need one there's
lots of things that going to get regular
preventative health care if you just do
it routinely they're going to prevent
you from from from passing away and and
we're not we have the potential to solve
all these problems and we haven't done
it yet and so to be honest I feel guilty
that we're not nationwide in every
single doctor's office yet and and
that's what drives us because ultimately
this is good for health care it's it's
our way of changing one part of the
health system and making sure the access
is solved across the country you know
Steve Huffman and I started reddit right
out of college and that's sort of the
typical idea that we have for startup
founders but you know ultimately there
is no blueprint we met a guy in Cyrus
who started sockdoc years after starting
and failing his first company after
getting an NBA after even working at
McKinsey and so it just goes to show
that it takes a lot of hustle takes a
lot of cold calls and cold faxes but it
can happen it is happening as software
is eating the world and really really
the question is you know what the hell
are you waiting for
Clif bars good for a hike
just like skittles Luna yeah
introduce you to my friend Reese's
Annie's cheddar bunnies yeah meet the
tiger actually where's your leopard no
cheetah right
Snickers better
Oh
the doctors pay a monthly fee the gave
you patients and they're happy in four
cities and then stir on the growing fast
