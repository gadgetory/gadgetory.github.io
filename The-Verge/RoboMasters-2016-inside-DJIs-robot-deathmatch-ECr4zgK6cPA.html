most complex and completely over-the-top
student Robotics Competition over five
days students from 200 universities
around China compete in front of tens of
thousands of fans while millions more
watch online the whole thing takes place
inside this colossal Stadium in Shenzhen
an arena that usually hosts the
country's biggest rock stars it's all
being funded by DJing innovation science
and technology company you probably know
them as DJI or at least you know their
flagship product the now iconic phantom
drone the students are competing not
only for cash prizes but a chance to
audition their talents for jobs at DJI
DJI on the other hand wants to use this
competition to become the most
successful revives company in the world
this is Robo masters this competition is
like it's like a battle between robots
we make some would make some robots to
fight against each other
each man puts two teams of robots
against each other the unit's maneuver
around the field collecting power-ups
and ammunition ideally without tipping
over
the goal is to reach the opposing teams
base station the robots can shoot at
each other with cannons aiming for small
pressure-sensitive plates enough hits on
those plates and the bot automatically
shuts off the teams can also
successfully deplete the enemy base
station of all its health and win a
sudden death so each team will do their
own robot and the robot is many consists
of three systems so the first one will
be the driving system which has a four
wheels we saw which enables the car to
move around the second part will be the
weapon system and the last part is
actually the charging system provided by
the organizer the competition eji the
charging system consists of different
components the sensors to detect coming
damage that's one part and there's a
sensors for monitoring speed is another
part and we also have another cameras so
the view of the camera will be
transmitted back to the operation room
where the operators will only use this
first-person view to move their robot
our team has eight robots including four
infantry a here a hero a drone and a
base and also a station that can provide
bullets like a recharging station for
this one is an infantry it has a cannon
and it can shoot bullets bullets coming
from here and it can shoot out there the
small infantry robots can only fire
little rubber pellets while the drone in
the hero can use golf balls doing much
more damage with every strike golf balls
are tough to get and that's on purpose
in order to access them teams have to
design a mechanical system for
collecting and launching them
efficiently teams that were reliably
able to get the golf balls were
consistently able to take out the enemy
and win the match some teams created
smaller faster hero robots and relied on
their drones to collect golf balls using
the aircraft to arm their hero or bomb
the enemy base others built large hair
robots that could scale a central island
climbing over a sea of spikes teams
developed a wide variety of mechanical
solutions everything from arms and
vacuums to wheels on stilts
the mechanical engineering that went
into the tournament was always a big hit
with the crowd but the really high-tech
stuff was actually happening out of
sight in the software we forced students
to design base robot as fully autonomous
so the base robot can shoot 17
millimeter plastic balls as well but it
Hecht's who do is automatically in this
way we encourage students to involve
those high technologies the high
technology is referring to is something
called computer vision it's the same
kind of tech that lets self-driving cars
navigate roads computers must be able to
scan incoming visual data recognize what
it sees and then perform actions based
off that information so for an
autonomous vehicle if it comes to a stop
sign knows to stop at Robo masters
computer vision was used to enable an
autonomous base allowing it to identify
the enemy and return fire without human
help I think the vision is really the
key to enable new application of robots
so that's why we want to integrate this
kind of technology into our robotic
competitions that's Frank Wang he's the
CEO of DJI and the mastermind behind
this competition and the big feature of
their latest drones you guessed it
computer vision
the phantom 4 can see the world around
it and autonomously avoid crashes that
drone and DJ eyes new handheld camera
stabilizer can also identify and
automatically track subjects keeping
them in frame even if you're not moving
a muscle but Frank sees this technology
as the future for much more than drones
we will face the u.s. division in a gym
itself but later we can expand to other
applications like maybe sometimes
autonomous driving sometimes agriculture
also known as the cherry-picking these
kind of things lots of human very
labor-intensive things and can be
replaced by cheap and the fishing enable
the robots over the last three years DJI
has emerged from obscurity to dominate
the booming market for consumer drones
but if it wants to make the jump beyond
quadcopters to driverless cars and
farming robots it's going to need to
compete against much larger companies
the students at Robo masters are hoping
to score jobs at DJI for the company the
stakes are reversed its battling with
much larger tech Titans
when top talent and some of technology's
hottest fields computer vision and
autonomous navigation the 200
universities competing in Robo masters
were in effect training their students
to work with DJI products and they were
bringing these passionate students right
to DG eyes doorstep that's the logical
explanation anyway the one a public
company would give if his investors
raised a stink about the cost of putting
on a big fancy over-the-top tournament
but for Robo masters creator the real
goal is about sharing his passion for
robotics with the new generation lots of
all people can be become famous like a
sports star I do not think other than
entertain people they do not have
creates too much of it but I think if we
can put engineering and entertainment
together not only they can entertain
they can educate lots of people even
they are not becoming superstar they are
very good engineer they are very good
innovator maybe some of them become
entrepreneurs we just have to make
something exciting for people to watch
we're trying to let robot competition
and the robot engineers be noticed by
general public because you early
robotics engineers the only working
laughs and they build very they do
rocket science but the general public
cannot appreciate what they are doing
you could see the way the tournament was
designed to make stars out of nerdy
teenagers the competition featured live
feeds of them operating their robots
documentary films on their preparations
and even an anime series that turn
contestants into action heroes Robo
masters made these students
larger-than-life I was pushed to this in
front of the spotlight and I was invited
in the center the first time I see the
poster I was also a bit shocked
it's amazing to me I below is amazing to
a lot of other people's or souls
especially young children if they see
these kind of things
you must be like whoa I'm going to do
something like this when I grow up I
really encourage more girls to try it
could Robo masters ever be as popular as
a mainstream sport well kids one day
aspire to be engineers the way they
aspire to be rock stars hmm that remains
to be seen but in the final moments of
the competition when the champions
successfully use their hero robot and
its golf ball cannon to take down the
opposing base station and the crowd went
wild it sure felt like a roaring success</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
