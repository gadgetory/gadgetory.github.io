Chromebook pro and before we even get
started talking about this laptop tablet
stylus thing there's a few things that
you should know first
it's a $549 Chrome OS device that can
run real Android apps second it's a
pretty darn good Chromebook even though
it is a little expensive and third this
pro is not coming out until April 4th
it's actually a really good thing that
it's not coming out until April because
everything about those Android apps that
I just mentioned are in beta and this
isn't the good kind of Gmail or iPhone
beta where you get to try new stuff with
just a few bugs here there no this is
the bad kind of beta the kind you don't
actually want to use yet so what's it
really like living in beta
okay let's dig in here Samsung is
actually releasing two different
Chromebooks this year this is the pro
which has a faster Intel processor it's
going to be black when it's released in
April this is just a pre-production unit
but there's also the Chromebook Plus
which is four hundred and forty nine
dollars and has a slower ARM processor
but it's coming out right away we tested
that too and it's fine it can't handle
quite as many browser tabs but it does
way better than you might expect from
its pokey processor you may have noticed
that I can flip this thing around and
use it as a tablet except well it's a
really crappy tablet you can't split
screen stuff yet and Android apps on
Chrome are still in beta it's just
incredibly buggy here's one example
Altos adventure it's a great game it's
pretty simple but when I tried to play
it the framerate was so low that I kept
on crashing it just doesn't work yet the
same thing happens with other games like
asphalt 8 you just can't play it I hope
that Google gets it all fixed and soon
because the idea of a Chromebook with
real apps is enough to make me wonder if
I even need a Mac or a Windows PC and
some of the App basics here are actually
good Microsoft Excel and Android is
surprisingly great and adobe has begun
to optimize some of its apps for the big
screen they're not as powerful as the
real thing but they might be enough for
me just as a Chromebook the pro is solid
I can get 15 tabs or more going without
a hiccup and the battery life lasts over
9 hours for me which is more than enough
and the hardware is fine it's solid and
it's really well built but it's not the
prettiest thing it's fairly light it
weighs less than 2 and a half pounds and
it feels really sturdy you can charge it
from either of two USB C ports there's
one on either side and it even has a
memory expansion slot it is annoying
that the keyboard isn't backlit but
that's really my only major complaint it
comes with a stylus which is pretty cool
when you pull it out it lets you screen
grab stuff and then draw on it like this
or you can just take quick notes and
then Google keep will translate your
scribbles into text now the input lag
isn't very good it's nowhere near as
good as you'll get on an iPad
Pro or a surface but Google says that
it's going to start using machine
learning to make it seem better
it's a neat idea but again it's just not
ready yet you buy a Chromebook because
it just works and it stays out of your
way and the Chromebook Pro definitely
does both of those things with a few
more months of software work there could
be something really great here and there
going to be a ton of Chromebooks that
are really compelling really soon with
Android apps and styluses touch screens
and the whole works if Google can pull
it off it could give cheap Windows
laptops a run for their money
but Google has not pulled it off yet
what you're looking at right now is just
a bunch of promises</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
