might notice that's new about the Xperia
z1 is the design you've just seen the
aluminium frame and the solid aluminium
block it comes from here it is crafted
around the edge of the device the
familiar aluminium on and off button now
a hard camera key and a beautiful
alameen and design around the outside a
new headphone jack has now exposed
whereas previously you had a flat one
headphone jack is now exposed but the
device is waterproof so you can still
drop the Xperia z1 into up to 1.5 litres
of water leave it there for 30 minutes
if you like and take it out happily the
water jack will simply fill up there
these big at the audio jack will simply
fill up with water but they'll still
work alright and did a big new
improvements you have the neutral
luminous display technology which
introduced with your Bravia TVs exactly
so in that five inch full HD 1080p
screen now is a triluminos display
straight from our bravia technologies
that gives you the best color ever a
wider range of colors and with the
x-reality engine for mobile which is
operating lower resolution footage to
make it even sharper on this full HD
screen alright and you have a new 20
megapixel camera under that absolutely
so in this new Xperia z2 on smartphone
we've bought the very best of Sony's
imaging capability into a smart phone so
that includes the Sony G lens which
comes from our cyber-shot division
includes the buy-ins processing engine
an external RS sensor and is that
combination of the lens the sensor and
the processing engine which will give
you the best overall images of any
leading smart so we've got three times
clearer zoom so if you go into the
camera and I can't have to show you here
on this one here's the camera if i zoom
in you can see me zooming in you can see
the bar here on the left hand side up to
around there which is three times zoom
you retain the sharp pictures and that's
done by that combination the lens the
processing engine in the sensor all of
which is unique sound
okay and in terms of physical dimensions
the Xperia Z is a tiny bit smaller than
this even though they have the same
screen size can you tell us why the news
that one is a bit bigger yeah it's a
very little bit bigger but it feels very
comfortable in your hand
due to the new bevel that we have on the
outside with the aluminium frame the
slight increase in the size is a result
of the the strong camera capability we
put in the device the excretes size of
the sensor which is going to give you
those super sharp pictures from the 20
megapixel camera gives you a very slight
offset in size I think if I hold Xperia
Z and experience that one together you
can see the size is very very similar
yeah and as you can see we have you go
to have it in black purple and white
when is it going to available and where
so you can buy this all over the world
this product will will be announced at
Aoife on the 4th of September and you
can buy that across the world before the
end of September release dates will vary
by market but if you really want one you
can certainly get your hands on one
before the end of September does that
include the United States so we still to
reach agreements with carriers in the US
about how we bring this product to
market that you will be able to access
the product there's certain stores in
the US and water pricing is similar to
the Experian yeah this is a premium
smartphone he brings the very best to
Sony together as you said played our
best screen our best camera our best
audio design and waterproof technology
so these are similar pricing positions
the experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
