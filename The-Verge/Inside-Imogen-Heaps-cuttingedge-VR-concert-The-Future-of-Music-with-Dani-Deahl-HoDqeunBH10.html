one of the best feelings in the world as
a performer myself I love the energy of
DJing to a packed house what if that
feeling could be replicated in virtual
reality watching a concert in VR is not
a new concept many artists have done 360
videos of their shows by Imogen Heap is
taking it one step further by creating a
hologram like version of herself in VR
Imogen has always been at the forefront
of emerging music technology and her new
project is no difference we're here in
the UK to learn about an immersive VR
experience she's created with the way vr
so welcome today the underground of West
yeah it's so cozy it's nice it doesn't
feel like you're normal in contact
anything studio Imogen Heap is a Grammy
Award winning musical artist producer
and audio engineer known for her
boundary-pushing electronic music both
as a solo artist and in groups like frou
frou her interest in technology has led
to projects such as her gesture
controlled me Moo gloves and my Celia a
blockchain project for musicians
now she's tackling virtual reality you
know keyboards I don't really use that
much anymore dad is cool Bundoran
working
[Laughter]
so why did you want to create a VR
experience well it was always on the
cards eventually in my life I suppose
for me when it really clicked it was
when I I had my first proper immersive
VR experience thanks to wave VR and Adam
Arrigo from wave er was doing a demo but
actually for me the real magic came when
I was interacting with Adam in the space
and I realized that I felt so much
closer and more connected that it wasn't
this kind of distant magical space it
was this real like human interaction
there was a sense of Oh actually it is
quite normal but this is there's
something everyday about this there's
something you know that I could bring
into my music life with this
experiencing music in VR has been around
for a while but unlike other companies
the way VR features a social components
and designs custom environments where
users can interact with each other while
at the same show they've also created
these social virtual reality experiences
for artists such as Toki Monsta The
Glitch Mob and kill the noise I went to
talk to Adam at the wave VR to learn
more so why do you think VR is the
future of music you know our central
mission is about kind of harnessing the
power of VR technology and leveraging it
to create a visual experience and
interactive experience social experience
that you just couldn't have at a real
show so we think that the future of
music is probably something that
combines all of those elements it's not
just about how music gets performed or
distributed in a new way but how people
socialize around it how its visualized
and you mentioned something about the
social aspect of it and I think that's
really interesting because I think
people find going to a concert to be a
very social experience and it's also how
does that change in VR yeah I'm one of
the cool things about the wave we just
launched internationally and when you go
in there for these shows you actually
meet people from around the world one of
the cool things about social VR is that
it kind of closes the distances between
people one of the shows we did last year
was actually for an Iranian artist named
ash Cuccia who was banned from coming to
the u.s. due to Trump's travel ban and
we actually let him perform his show for
the first time to u.s. audience he was
exposed to this totally different type
of art and both Musical and visual Wow
so you think it can close borders and
that's what's really exciting the
building that we're about to go in was
actually a bomb site we it had tons of
like old furniture and old paintings and
rats and hay she was mainly a hay bond
whoa wait I was not expecting for this
so the way VR has actually shot you in
this space before yes this is where we
had my 40th birthday bash
there was a middle kind of space divided
here where you know all the cameras were
and the VR guys had wavy all had their
camera here they had a camera up there
they had cameras everywhere and they
were taking data feeds from my gloves my
keyboard and taking obviously they've
got the audio and all the other kind of
however else they depth detects the way
VR team used the data from images
performance and also recorded her in
front of a green screen
to create what they call a hologram in
VR this data allows the VR to manipulate
imagens image and add visuals to the
performance you can't get in real life
while she's singing she might break into
a million pixels or dissolve into orbs
of light
walk me through all the different types
of files and things that you have to put
together in order to make this image and
hologram happen sure yeah we went to
imagens house in December and recorded a
terabyte of data which is on this Drive
here so that includes depth videos which
is what this is which is 3d so instead
of color it has a distance for each
pixel so you can actually get 3d
information out of like a Kinect and
then sync that up with an actual video
camera and overlay a texture on top of
the 3d which is how we pull off the
hologram effect so once you have the
depth information where do you go from
there so we run all of these depth
frames and color frames through the
depth kit software and we get this sort
of double video where the left side is
color video and the right side of the
rainbow represents the distance from the
camera for each pixel so we can take
this information and put it straight
into unity to create a 3d hologram
effect
are there any firsts in either for your
company or to your knowledge with VR in
general with this particular image and
hate project yeah I mean I I know it's
the first show I like kind of a VR
social experience to host a you know a
three-dimensional hologram that's one of
the things that that we were trying to
pioneer in the show and you know one day
we imagine being able to do this live
this hologram is then placed in imagens
home which the way VR recreated in
virtual reality the end result is that
fans can put on a headset and attend an
intimate concert in imagens own living
room as much as I love the idea of space
travel and you know these magical worlds
there's something about the real world
that and we shouldn't forget and that
what can we bring into that space for
that to be you know magical and one of
the spaces in my life which is so dear
to me is this house and it is a truly
magical
beast so this idea that the venue that
the fans experience the VR concert in is
my home so they're actually on as if
there were no walls and they've just got
me the height of the building so taking
out all the ceilings so you just have
the shell of the house so I was like
could we have just the floorboards just
so that you can as if they were really
the floorboards and can we have paint on
the nerves and just make it it like a
home because within that you know just
simply breaking apart the walls it's
just amazing enough I think when you're
in that space you feel quite calm and
relaxed but you know that you have
superpowers so I think you don't need to
wow people I think that can happen in
the VR space where you just get
bombarded by all this new stuff for
hitting your senses all the time it's
actually quite exhausting and you know a
bit like shouty so I think I'm really
enjoying how to bring everything really
close do you think VR will become an
integral component to how we experience
music in the future yeah I think we are
an AR and God knows whales are maybe
what it might do is it at the moment I
feel music has become more of a kind of
background you know thing goes on most
of the time it's from in clubs it's
talking it's like it's not really
experienced very few people sit down and
listen to music because it's it's so on
tap also as a musician we have like lots
of different stems lots different
versions of songs I like the idea that
you could explore an earlier version of
a song by peeling back an old bit of
wallpaper or something or you know you
might be able to take an apple from a
tree and walk into somebody else's VR
space and that Apple might be the drum
pattern of this song that you could kind
of walk into another room and
that were to suddenly turn that song by
Pharrell into like rubbish Imogen Heap
drum pattern compared to visit em but
you know how would that affect that and
or drag you know some string
arrangements from of your soul into
whatever else you know I just like that
idea that in time that could become that
kind of flow this video was presented by
loft different by design if you enjoyed
