verge and I'm standing in front of the
Genesis G 90 the Genesis brand has been
around for a while with Hyundai
releasing the cards for the last seven
years under that name but now they're
splitting it off into its own luxury
brand and this is the first flagship car
from Genesis now the Genesis G 90 is
going to come with two different options
you got a 3.3 liter v6 twin turbo engine
or you can go up to the 420 horsepower
five liter v8 engine you're also going
to be able to get all-wheel-drive on
both of those models now of course a
luxury sedan like this you're going to
get amenities in both the front and the
back seats and the back seats especially
you've got power seats speakers a whole
nine yards
this is just the first flagship car
Genesis actually gave us details on
what's coming next we're gonna have six
cars by 2020 we know the G 80 is going
to be the next parts an executive class
sedan and then we're getting the G 70
which is a much smaller sports sedan all
of those are going to be front engine
and rear-wheel drive standard now this
thing looks really cool it's actually
kind of reminiscent of a Chrysler 300m
or even some of BMWs larger series cars
you've got a driver seat that sits way
back in the car with a nice long hood
we're more here from the Detroit Auto
