when I look ahead at where computing is
headed it's clear to me that we are
heading evolving from a mobile first to
an AI first world at the heart of these
efforts is a goal to build a googler
system which is why today we are going
to bring the assistant to two new
surfaces one in the context of the phone
which you always carry with you and one
in the context of your home so today I'm
very excited to introduce you to a new
phone made by Google
we call it pixel the rear glass creates
a bold iconic element that gives pixel
personality and character and there's no
unsightly camera bump
pixel is the first phone with the Google
assistant built-in show me my photos
from last October play me a song by the
Lumineers
now the assistant knows I like to listen
to music on YouTube so that's the app it
opens up there's actually industry group
DxO market that rates camera quality and
almost all popular DSLR and smartphone
cameras on the market we're proud to
report that pixel received a rating of
89
that's the highest reading ever for a
smartphone this isn't only the best
camera we've ever made it's the best
smartphone camera anyone has ever made
pixel has a 12 point three megapixel
rear facing camera featuring an F 2.0
aperture a smart burst is a feature that
lets you capture just the right moment
by holding down the shutter button you
can capture a continuous stream of
images and let Google intelligence
select the sharpest clearest photo of
just the right moment there's HDR plus
it's built to work in any light so you
get clear vivid pictures even in
challenging conditions that our camera
has a shorter capture time than any
smartphone camera we've tested which
makes action shots like this possible
finally my favorite feature are
incredible video stabilization it means
that videos turn out some movies even if
you're not of course pixel comes with
Google Photos built-in special bonus for
pixel owners we're including free
unlimited storage for photos and videos
at original quality pixel can get you up
to seven hours of power with just 15
minutes of charging we've also made the
update process easier when a new update
is available it will be downloaded and
installed in the background so we've
built 24/7 live customer care right into
the phone and to make it easier for them
to understand and help solve your
problem we've added a screen share
option we've also made it super simple
to transfer over everything you really
care about
so we built a new tool to let you
quickly and easily transfer your
contacts photos videos music texts
counter appointments
you're iMessages we even put a quick
switch adapter in every box we're also
excited to introduce a brand new range
of cases and accessories for pixel
finally pixel comes in two sizes a 5
inch and a 5.5 inch display all the
great features you've heard about today
work on both and both of these sizes
come with all of these amazing hardware
specs pixel is available in three colors
descriptively named quite black very
silver and a limited edition really blue
pixel starts at six hundred and forty
nine dollars or twenty seven dollars a
month on the google store here in the US
it's available for pre-order starting
today in the US Australia Canada Germany
and the UK and in India starting on
October 13th the first phone made by
Google inside and out and the pixel
phones which are the first which are
dangering ready so let's talk about the
VR headset and so I'd like to introduce
you to daydream view well you'll notice
immediately that it doesn't quite look
like other VR headsets and that's
because in designing it we weren't
inspired by gadgets we've looked at what
do people actually wear 30% lighter than
similar devices so we made sure that the
headset fits nicely over my glasses
really you just want to pop your phone
in and be in VR that's the way daydream
view works
you open the latch you drop your phone
in you close the latch and you're ready
to go the headset and phone say hello
wirelessly so there's nothing to connect
we wanted interacting with VR to be easy
to and that's where the daydream
controller comes in but there's more to
it than meets the eye hidden inside are
a bunch of sensors that respond to how
you move so you can point you can swing
you can aim
it's so precise that you can draw with
it you can write your name happen so the
controller has a home inside the headset
when you're done just kind of snuggles
in there like this but there are a lot
of other daydrian ready phones on the
way from our partners too and the
headset will work with them as well at
launch will have slate and later this
year we'll add two other colors snow and
crimson we've been working with the
likes of Netflix HBO and Hulu to bring
their entire entertainment libraries to
daydream with Street View and daydream
we've built 150 curated tours of the
world's most amazing places but where
the YouTube experience really shines is
with 360 and VR videos now all of this
will come together in November when
daydream view and the controller go on
sale together for $79 let's talk now
about the home today we're excited to
announce Google Wi-Fi designed to
support the new ways we use Wi-Fi unlike
a single central router Google will have
multiple Google Wi-Fi points work
together to do a much better job of
delivering fast throughput to every
corner of the home simply add Wi-Fi
points to expand coverage Google Wi-Fi
is going to be available in it for
pre-orders in November and it's going to
ship in early December Google Wi-Fi is
going to retail for $129 for single pack
and for larger homes we're offering a
three pack for $299 so today we're
introducing chromecast ultra our most
premium TV streaming device today you
will now be able to cast your favorite
content in up to 4k Ultra HD resolution
with HDR and Dolby vision support and
we're happy to announce that Google Play
Movies will be rolling out 4k content in
November chromecast Ultra comes with an
Ethernet port the chromecast ultra is
going to be available in November for
$69 and that brings us to Google home
Google home lets you enjoy music get
answers from Google
managed everyday tasks and control
devices around your home in those rare
moments when voice won't do the top
surface is also capacitive touch panel
you can simply use your finger to pause
the music adjust the volume or trigger
the Google assistant the mic mute button

is only listening for the hot word when
you want it to be the speaker in Google

Heights finally we made it really simple

music services including google play
