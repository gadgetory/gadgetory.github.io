making it through several layers of
ornate casino doors I'm trying out the
vive pre the second-generation
development kit for HTC and valves
virtual reality headset the Prix is
coming at a weird time it's only going
to be around for a few months before the
consumer design of the vibe comes out in
April but there's supposedly a good
reason for this the designers came up
with a big new feature that they wanted
to put in a front facing camera that
shows you real reality inside virtual
reality if you move outside the space
that the vies two sensors can map you'll
see a blurry monochrome version of the
real world
a feature called chaperone mode lets you
see everything like this so I can see
and sit in a chair instead of tripping
over it if HTC and Valve's answer to how
do you drink a glass of water in VR the
current demos don't do much with the
feature but developers could also use it
to blend real space with a game besides
the camera the vive Priya's redesigned
controllers that look a lot more
polished although they work about the
same we don't know how much is going to
change between the pre and the final
vive but it's at least possible to
imagine it as a finished product if you
want to see more cool stuff from CES
