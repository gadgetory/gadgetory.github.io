weird scary fun thrilling year of
discovery it's been it's been insane
like all of tech has kind of changed in
the last 12 months I think that we have
in the last couple of years in
particularly this past year seeing just
a total acceptance of technology as an
important and obvious part of our
culture technology and culture and art
and science are all coming together so
if we're looking at guys who are hacking
their bodies in order to find like a new
level of sense if we're looking at for
easy to convention you know if we're
looking at k-pop fans or if you're
talking to Philip a dick fans who've all
come together in San Francisco to
celebrate the guys work he ultimately
what it comes down to is not the
technology and it's not the gadgets it's
the people behind it
camera continues to be a deeply
fascinating piece to me because it
exposes something that I had no
knowledge of I had no understanding of
before I read the story that Joe put
together what's so incredible about it
is that world is so spread out and so
insidious and so connected to lots of
other pieces of our culture it's a bunch
of these guys that are living in kind of
a post Tony Robbins world they're
basically setting up these sites and
these these fake products to prey on the
unassuming so we're a lot of this stuff
would have been on TV would have been at
you know massive conventions like 10 15
years ago a lot of the stuff is now
moved online I think it's a story that's
important I think reading the comments
on that and reading what happened on the
web after the story went up and seeing
how many people sort of woke up to these
guys and their existence and how many
people were reviled it was a fascinating
trend to watch this is another one of
those stories that you've never heard of
before and then when you hear if it it
sounds like the most insane thing in the
world then a writer tells you they're
gonna go and get a magnetic planted for
their finger Ben's idea was to look at
the subculture of people that were
pushing limits of human perception we're
going to continue to try to bring you
the craziest you've ever seen in
your life it's the easiest way is just
to embed magnets directly into your
finger after it heals very able to feel
magnetic waves and electrical waves I
wouldn't exactly call it science it's
more like a mad desire to be a cyborg
which is a weird odd crazy thing to want
to be whether it's augmentation for
human vision or embedded electronics
these concepts that have really been in
our sci-fi for the past couple decades
are increasingly closer to reality
I left the internet this year and I do
think it was an indictment or Alisa a
chance to judge how valuable the
internet is to me the question of
boredom is very different now and it's
very easy to like to push all those
buttons and never be bored and it's
increasingly difficult to focus on
anything and I feel like there's culture
wide there's there's a feeling that a
lot of this isn't caused by technology
and I think what Paul did is pushed it
to an extreme where he was forcing
himself to focus for a year by
completely avoiding an event you've been
on the internet for a super long time
you're most of your adult life right and
you want to write you want to write
about like what his life is like without
the internet in it yeah this I mean
internet fills most of my life and has
filled most of my life since I was a
teenager and so I don't really know what
it's like to be an adult or be in
civilization without the internet what
we like to look at is not whether
technology is good or bad but it's like
it's how are people actually using it
how is it actually affecting people's
day-to-day lives when you think of a
computer's I think you have to sit down
at it's very different than when it's a
computer something you have in your hand
all the time that you put in your pocket
you know this constant companion and I
think that as our minds shift to
thinking of Technology in that way as a
companion unless as a thing you take
action upon that is really significant
the things that we think of as pcs this
is their last year of like dominance in
the industry I think from here on out
it's all tablets cell phones cell mobile
devices the pc only ever was the primary
computing device for a very narrow range
one generation smartphones are reaching
this maturity whether it's like they're
selling them to you like cars got better
engines and your your family will be
happier and your wife will love you
smartphones are the norm it's not weird
for somebody to have one now the
ownership has skyrocketed so it's
obviously become very competitive but
it's also stratified you have two
players right now in smartphones iOS and
Android Windows Phone is trying to get a
word in edgewise rim is on a steep
decline and so it's interesting to see
how quickly people get tired of options
all these companies kind of want to have
their own isolated experience where it's
like this is what Google thinks you want
in a phone or a tablet and this is what
Apple thinks this is what Amazon face
and we're getting increasing the end of
that world and I think it's how we're
gonna go going forward for a long time
we try to find ways to cover an election
from angles that I don't think a lot of
people have explored technology and the
new way that we communicate as human
beings played I mean it could be argued
that it played the most important role
in deciding who won the presidential
election in the United States in 2012
which it seems insane to me
you know conversations that are
happening on social media are now just
part of the news and nobody thinks twice
about election coverage this year for
example was driven a lot my Twitter i
watch the debates on Twitter basically
and then I would watch the news
afterwards and it was news anchors
reading what I just seen on Twitter
that's sort of thing where the new ways
we have of communicating each other are
beginning to completely overtake the old
ways tracking that story was really an
interesting learning experience and
really kind of a fascinating rabbit hole
to dive into it because it's you kind of
politics you could go in a million
different directions and there are a
million different stories that all seem
vitally important
this year we saw a lot of the patent
wars hit android in the mobile landscape
which you expect to happen with any kind
of technology sort of explodes into a
real industry I think we've seen a lot
of our industry get bogged down in legal
wrangling when they should be focusing
on making great technology that's good
for consumers the states may be somewhat
high in some of these cases but
ultimately they're they're not table
stakes for these large companies there's
a lot of open questions about what kind
of inventions we want to protect we want
to issue patents and let people see each
other for things like slide on long do
we want to waste our time in the courts
letting these companies argue over
smartphones when I should be making
better better smartphones and trying to
win the war in the market place inside
the courtroom I don't know if any of
these companies are looking at it going
this is the way forward there are
politics at play but there's also actual
negotiations happen and I think that's
really valuable and important if we
expect to have any innovation in
technology some of these things you
can't just hold on to in perpetuity you
have to be able and willing to share
what you've created with the world
for me it's been really important to try
to put into perspective how much
technology really matters and how much
my obsession over technology is healthy
and useful versus just done for its own
sake I do hope that that as going
forward we're going to look at the
internet and start picking and choosing
and not let the internet dictate to us
how it wants to be used it's such an
early young technology that it's really
still a wild west and I look forward to
a maturation of the internet it seems
like everything changes kind of all at
once and then it changes again then
changed again we're in these funny like
waves of crazy technology happenings
we're just at this crazy pace of like
everything is different and better all
the time as well
for the last few years there's been a
huge boom in types of devices and form
factors but I think that's going to wear
off pretty quickly and people are gonna
start to think of what is the best way
for me to interact with the stuff where
is the best place for it to be what is
the best size screen that actually makes
sense for a human being now that we know
we're going to live with technology
think it'll be a year of us figuring out
how to live with technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
