the HTC EVO 4G LTE for Sprint it's the
successor to the Evo 4G which was one of
the best phones Sprint's ever had and
when it came out in 2010 was one of the
best Android phones on the market period
this phone's basically the One X just
with some new styling and slight tweaks
for Sprint the back of the phone is
what's most noticeably different there
are two different ports to the back
there's a matte black piece on the
bottom which is really smooth and feels
really nice and up top there's a glossy
finish with the red ringed camera lens
inside it and it's a really nice look
when you first take it out of the box
but after about five minutes of using it
the top part starts to pick up a lot of
fingerprints and just really doesn't
look as good and you'll find yourself
wiping it off constantly trying to get
it back to a clean finish in between the
two pieces there's a red stripe which
actually houses a kickstand sprint
really loves kick stands for some reason
and this one's a pretty good one it'll
actually hold up the phone in a couple
of different positions and orientations
and it's totally unobtrusive so you
really won't even see it if you don't
actually want to use it it's kind of
hard to get out but is a nice feature to
have if you want to watch videos or use
your phone at your bedside table other
than that this is a really well-built
phone just like the One X and the one s
before it it's really solid and sturdy
and has kind of a metallic feel thanks
to a metal ring around the edges it's a
really nice phone and just really good
to hold in your hand even though it's
enormous
other than the look the Evo 4G LTE is
basically the same phone as the One X it
has a 4.7 inch 720p Super LCD display
which is just fantastic it has amazing
viewing angles it and Kretz incredibly
accurate and it's just one of the best
displays we've ever seen on a smartphone
there's also an 8 megapixel camera in
the back along with HCC's image sense
chip which makes the whole app
experience really fast the camera can
actually shoot in a burst mode up to 200
shots all at once which is pretty crazy
for a smartphone the app itself is
really good and it works really well
there's a ton of options for shooting
photos but the photos that come out are
good but not anything to write home
about there's some dynamic range issues
and in low-light it's not great so it's
good for a smartphone but you'll
definitely know you're taking pictures
with a phone there's also a 1.3
megapixel front camera which is fine
it's totally average for a smartphone
and the camera will shoot 1080p video
which is pretty much the same story it's
good and the app is great but the
results
are not exactly mind-blowing also like
the 1x the Evo 4G LTE is running Android
4.0 with Sense 4.0 the latest version of
HTC is UI skin it's the best version of
sense we've seen yet but it's still kind
of an overwrought skin that causes some
problems on Android 4.0 and really just
disrupts the design language that
Android and Google have worked really
hard to build and it's not a huge
problem and it's definitely not as bad
or a drag on the phone as it's been in
the past but it's not as good as just
pure stock Android the performance on
all of the HTC One series phones that
we've tested has been pretty amazing and
the Evo 4G LTE is definitely no
exception it runs games really well if
the browser performance is great it's
just a really solid phone that I had
almost no issues using reception call
Claudia are both pretty much what you'd
expect from a sprint phone though thanks
to a new technology called HD voice it's
about to get a lot better HD voice
basically makes phone calls sound like
Skype calls much clearer and richer and
fuller but you'll need both a network
and a phone that supports it and those
aren't really rolled out yet and that
that same it's coming mantra is a common
theme with the Evo 4G LTE right now it's
network performance isn't all that good
you're on Sprint's slower 3G network but
Sprint's in the process of upgrading its
network to LTE so what you're buying now
is a phone that should be great and fast
a year from now but right now is
definitely lacking in data speeds even
without LTE killing the battery the
battery life on the Evo isn't really
that great we've got about 8 hours of
moderate use with pushing email and
Twitter and some web browsing and video
watching and the huge culprit is
obviously the enormous display you
should be able to get a full day out of
it but you're gonna want to be careful
the evo 4G LTE is absolutely the best
Android phone available on Sprint right
now it's also maybe the smartest buy
since its future proof and will be able
to be on Sprint's LTE network when it's
finally ready the only problem is we're
not really sure when that's gonna be and
the rollout is likely to be slow over
the next couple of years if you're
committed to Sprint you should
absolutely buy this phone now but if you
have your choice for right now you're
probably better off with a phone like
the One X which is a really similar
phone and can already connect to 18 T's
LTE network</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
