the mode of the z2 force this is the
closest thing to a flagship smartphone
that Motorola's put out this year and
it's got all the specs to show for it
it's got a qualcomm snapdragon 835 64
pics of storage and 4 gigs of ram
gigabit data it runs Android 7.1 and
that stuff is all status quo for a
smartphone in 2017 but the z2 force does
things differently in three areas the
screen the camera and moto mods this 5.5
inch quad HD AMOLED screen is
shatterproof so if you're somebody who
drops your phone a lot you don't have to
worry about breaking it even with no
case now the trade-off is that this
screen picks up scratches more easily
than most common phones now the z2 force
is much thinner than last year's model
but that's partially and unfortunately
due to a much smaller battery last
year's z4 s had a thirty-five hundred
million power battery this one drops
down to twenty seven thirty now that's
pretty significant frankly I don't quite
get Motorola's obsession with swimming
down their phones we're not really
gaming much and this film doesn't even
have a headphone jack which gets
annoying
now the other new and different thing
about this new Moto Z is the camera
Motorola is now using two cameras one
shoots monochrome and the other suits
color and both combine for what should
hopefully be better quality pictures now
you can blur the background behind your
subject like the iPhone and other
smartphones do but frankly Motorola has
never really been too great at
smartphone cameras so the company has
really got to prove itself here and show
that it can compete with the pixel with
the Galaxy s8 with the HTC u 11 and so
on
so as soon as you look at it's very
apparent just how thin and sleek this
phone is I mean it's crazy thin which is
a nice design the Motorola ceasing 7000
series aluminum so it's very strong and
rigid it's not going to fail any pen
tests it's very durable so the screen is
a 5.5 inch AMOLED screen it's very
vibrant very colorful it's got good
viewing angles so they've done a good
job there you can't really tell that
it's shatterproof but it looks just like
any other smartphone screen so the
zgforce has this front-facing flash for
your selfies and that's going to balance
the light around you for better pictures
so the z2 forest is coming August 10th
and it's
on every major US carrier Verizon AT&amp;amp;T
Sprint and t-mobile so no matter who
you're with you can have the
shatterproof screen
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
