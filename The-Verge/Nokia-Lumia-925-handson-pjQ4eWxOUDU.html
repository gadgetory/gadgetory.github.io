we're looking at nokia's latest
smartphones the Lumia 925 so if we look
at this sort of see an aluminum triangle
windows winning sort of slanted front
facing camera from
the real star of the show it's the
actual aluminum man that runs all the
way around the device so when we don't
have any connection was there but the
aluminum runs all the way around and it
meets at the very top you got your sim
sort of
you were curious with people and the
head Ranger at the Ramirez advice is
actually polycarbonate and so it's not
aluminum across the entire device so
obvious or the Met neelima polycarbonate
right here and in this slight sore thumb
in the eighth with seven megapixel
cameras it was the same sensor as the
Lumia 920 Lucas added on an extra in
sick lens which is the last one here
that many of the standards would do
leave
and this free sore points contact here
where the wireless charging sleeve can
be sorted on the very rare that was and
you've got the usual allows people their
overall is kinda the Lumia 920 this Rudy
slim down and its really lighter than
the 920 and then it's going to come in
two colors here so you've got the white
and end the soft parade here is a great
color and if we compare it quickly to
the Lumia 920 you really see how much
thinner those same Saudis place is 4.5
inch Itachi an AMOLED screen this time
that's the Nokia Lumia 925</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
