we're here with a writer director david
to e of the upcoming riddick thanks to
taking the time to sit down with us
Brian hello hello sir and just real
quick the restricted red band trailer
just came out there's a head gag it was
going to watch that is awesome as I want
to say that once again it's it played
well on a child plays big an H all ok
cool so now so let's talk about you know
about Riddick in general right it's been
nine years since chronicles came out
there's always been talk about anyone
coming up you know you've mentioned it
Vince mention it what made 2013 the time
for attacks you come together well we've
been you know for all we didn't think it
would but slowly we heard this drum be
from the fans of more ridic please
alright I hear it but then here's a la
because he's got that big ass facebook
page right right and so you know it was
something that's look I love the
character in the world's we create vind
us to and and the fans were out there
saying the same thing so we wanted to
pay them off and you know to not do a
third Riddick movie would have felt
unfinished it would have felt unfinished
in terms of the story the macro story
we're trying to tell and it would have
been unsatisfying for us and our fans
mm-hmm so we said we're going to do this
even if it's over the you know the dead
body of you know some people so we did
it is not a studio movie this time but
is in the independent movie this time
and we raised their own money I wrote
this the spec of the the script on spec
and only when it was going right as an
independent movie does the studio step
back in and say well okay can we
distribute it for you yeah we'd like the
help that might be good and that's
actually a good place that's a good
relationship because it gives me total
freedom on the set you know I had rights
one past the script one tweak and then
we were shooting and then when it came
to lock in the picture I didn't have to
focus group it to death I didn't have to
modernize my movie like that I didn't
have to turn it into milk you know
modernization is fine for milk but bad
movies didn't have to do any of that I
just like locked picture when I wanted
lock picture I said there's the cut
let's go there were there are things
that you would have had to cut out I
mean obviously there's you know I'm sure
after judging that trailers I'm going to
be some great you know violence or there
if the math we reach a 13 or if you're
pg-13
we have sacrificed a lot but one of the
things by by making for less money this
time closer and budget to pitch black
and chronicles it gives us the freedom
to go our gives us freedom to do
whatever we damn well want I want to
talk about that because it is you know
modestly budgeted compared you know to
the Chronicles in this other big movies
but you know it's not skimping on scope
at all you know how are you able to go
and like you know bring both of those
together on the smaller budget is it
affects is that you know advances in
technology it still affects have come
down in price but it still affects can
blow a budget real quick too and i still
have 850 visual effects shots in the
movie but it's just about you know care
for that not running to ilm to do your
effects not running to whether to do
affects even though we all wish we could
it would be the easy way to go I've got
to go for the smaller companies that
have talent and actually bring them up a
step you know so and some of the
Montreal houses the canadian house we
looked out with their so it's a matter
of like helping these guys these effects
houses these small effects houses taking
them with the movie to the next level
and saying that if you do this well and
if you guys burn around the clock on
this movie you know you can you can be
stepping in for the bigs 2 and they'll
understand it and they'll embrace that
that's excellent you know that's one way
to do it and you shoot quick I shot this
quicker than pitch black I've shot this
in 47 days now how are you able to go
and pull that off is there I know you
shot this one was shot digitally correct
yes u.s. position on the Alexa LX oh
yeah okay that did that help just
because you can keep rolling not to call
you know I guess though you know it's
like a comedy show where you just say
keep keep coming up with gags right it's
not that kind of speed it's maybe you
speed up the lighting process a little
bit and you streamline the post
production pipeline but that really
doesn't help me move fast so much faster
on the set what I also moved faster is
that you know I go in with a short
script I go in with 106 pages something
like that not trying to shoot 120 125
because I know I'm going to lose time
anyway in the editing room I'm always
losing scenes so I do better with a
short script that I can embellish on the
set right that's one way to keep it down
and actors who want who want to work you
know I could show up on time we want to
work you see yourself shooting like a
native imax if you have the budget the
time to go into it in the future you
don't need to
they may argue with that but I've seen
the results and the quality holds up the
resolution holds up what kind of karkans
back tied the film versus digital
conversation at certain point almost in
this film you know it's definitely for
what I've seen so far on the trailers
definitely feels grainy it feels you
know has it has a real visceral
aesthetic some people think about in
digital do you as a filmmaker I mean you
feel like we're completely beyond the
point that's even a conversation there
are aesthetic differences between the
two mediums I'm just doing it because I
know I have to move fast I know my I
know I have 850 visual effects shots so
I know my post production pipeline will
be streamlined if I shoot digital sure
so there's the call for me right there
plus area just come out with the Alexa
it was a beautiful camera by all
accounts we could afford it we could for
two or three camera bodies so we jumped
on it we've jumped up and my DP who is a
film guy says next show Alexa there you
go yeah cool I think the the tide is
turned on that they're not I think we're
done bit thank you so much as a pleasure
meet you youtube</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
