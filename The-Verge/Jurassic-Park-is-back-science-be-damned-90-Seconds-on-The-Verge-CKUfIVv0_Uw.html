siker tanned this is 90 seconds on the
verge Jurassic world a cage or a spark
for is still a year away but director
Colin Trevorrow went ahead and confirmed
a wealth of general plot points we're
gonna get to those in a minute but let's
take a step back first Steven
Spielberg's original Jurassic Park film
based on the michael crichton novel of
the same name was about a group of
specialists who traveled to an island
near costa rica to sign off on a new
theme park chock-full of living
breathing dinosaurs Jurassic Park was a
billion dollar box office success the
sequels the lost world in jurassic park
three also proves successful at the box
office but didn't really capture the
magic of the first film that brings us
to the new film and this is where the
spoilers come in Jurassic world is going
to be set 22 years after the original
and takes place around a fully
functional theme park and resort on that
original island but here's the thing now
that everyone is used to the whole
dinosaur thing the park is looking as
science to spice things up with a brand
new dinosaur created by the parks
geneticist but if you're hoping for
scientific accuracy you're gonna want to
stick to the history channel Trevor o
confirmed last year in a very brief but
direct tweet that we won't be seeing any
feathered dinosaurs see since the first
drastic park was released in 1993
there's been a flood of research on
dinosaurs evolutionary connection of
birds but look it's a film Raptors can
actually open doors a Dilophosaurus
doesn't spit venom okay I mean the third
film did put some feathers on Raptors
but I'd rather just forget that movie
for more on jurassic world check out the
verge coming up i discover that i have
feathers and i can actually fly</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
