and we have roughly I'm Joe who wrote
the article we just sorry we just
discovered i just i was in meetings all
day and we heard that you were upset
about the piece that we wrote and want
to get your thoughts on it what you
thinking um the main thing is I
understand that there's this segment of
scammers who calls this whole thing
internet marketing and I loved the piece
that you're serving it I think that
stuff is terrible and just heartbreaking
what people get involved with and how
people get taken into that sort of tough
but there is a much bigger much more
long-standing segment called internet
marketing that has made up of people who
do everything from social media
marketing in st owed a third to display
advertising they they're all internet
marketers they always just under this
umbrella term just like you have
television marketers of print marketers
direct marketers right so i saw that and
my you know my entire heart spunk i mean
i have an entire site called marketing
on this about internet marketing right
but like who do use an internet marketer
that I mean give me an example of
somebody in that industry I don't know
you know in on the up-and-up who's an
internet marketer some of you described
as an internet marketer who is like you
know completely on the up-and-up I'm
just trying to understand who you're
specifically talking about your you've
got people who do social media for you
right looking media marketing no no we
have a guy to have some time we have our
editors like man the twitter at hand
stuff okay but that's marketing you're
running social media account or social
media marketing and as part of internet
marketing I mean we're we're trying to
trying to get our I mean I don't
wouldn't call that marketing exactly I
mean I'm I see social media as an avenue
to reach readers write like when I think
of it I'm like if people are on Twitter
and see that we have written a story
they'll come and read the story and I
want that cuz I want people to read the
stuff i mean it is we're marketing our
content I guess but we're not like we
don't pay someone to to get the word out
um you might not do that right now but
as you grow there's an excellent chance
you're going to be doing that
or a thing we can do it and engadget I
don't think yeah we didn't do it then
gadget I mean we had a sales team that's
all ads but well but that's advertising
when you're selling it on your side and
marketing is I'm trying to help people
discover our content and sometimes
marketing is underpaid which is you know
often referred to as paid marketing or
so on sometimes it's done through in the
marketing world would be called earned
marketing everything it sounds weird but
it's the idea that you have somehow
burned the idea that people were just
really mention here so for example a PR
firm that helps get an article to me
favor I'm doing a really good pitch and
you guys know this right you can give it
the PR firm fugly marketing right now
they can't they can't guarantee that
anything to happen to can't force you to
do anything but you know the difference
between a good PR person who helps you
get the information East versus you know
some scumbag and comes along picking any
cuz if I an ad and it'll go up on the
site it doesn't work that way right no
no and I sorry go ahead so so you have
to discipline of marketing and where
where is probably something strange to
you is because you know you guys aren't
coming at it as thinking about it is
marketing but the people who perform
these types of things they are marketers
people over zag right you know they make
the skins are going your phone sorta
thing yeah they have people who do both
social media marketing and do a search
engine optimization yes that is their
job they're they're hired to do that
sort of stuff right and they think about
themselves as marketers sure the ad tech
the app that offers that happen is is
filled with big companies and small
companies of people who are the internet
working you know so here's here's my
question to you so these guys refer to
themselves as internet marketers and
yeah I don't see you know what they they
what they call what they do they call it
internet marketing and in video after
video these guys are like become an
internet marketer this is how we do
internet marketing this is the world of
internet marketing you know over and
over again they use the phrase so so I
guess like I think what you might have
and I said this before I feel like what
what what we could have done
and you know maybe we'll add an addendum
to this uh somewhere and I'm not saying
I'm not putting words in Joe's mouth
because it's his piece Jojo flatly who
wrote it is on the line as well but you
know I think you're looking you're
looking for a paragraph somewhere that
said now look there are on the up and up
internet people call themselves internet
marketers who do real internet marketing
that are you know SEO people or
marketers that are that are you have
real products and get paid real money by
real clients to do specific things that
are totally on the up and up and repeat
exactly and the and these guys call
themselves internet marketers but what
they really doing is it's a pyramid
scheme essentially yeah I mean they're
not you know if they're just trying to
get rich fast no no more give you stop
of people in it you know if I guess the
the best equivalent that could say is
it's as if somebody is doing a spam
email sound right but they're going
around saying that they're an email
marketer you've got people who are
actually doing actual email marketing
maintaining email miss for their
companies and sending out offers people
that they're interacting with so on that
that would think oh my god I'm not a
spammer that's a completely different
person right well but Joe you know but
there is a fine line Joe made a good
point here and I think that you'll have
to agree that there are people who
probably see themselves as legit I mean
a lot of these guys seem to see
themselves as legit and think that
they're selling a service and don't
actually crap seem to recognize that
there that they are spamming you know
they are spammers right absolutely oh
 so i can say is this a much bigger
group of people who are actually i think
doing legitimate internet marketing that
has nothing to do with this scam that
has taken that name and what community
well so here's my question for you and i
think this is something that i'd really
like to know and i would like to what is
the legit internet marketing community
doing if anything or what can they do
about these guys co-opting this name the
term and the idea of it and the success
right because legit in our marketing can
be me yes i think you do a search for
internet marketing you're not gonna find
it's not you're not the first guys you
see aren't going to be the up and up
the guys you're gonna see are going to
be frank kern and he's like then we have
better yeah anthony morrison and get
rich quick scheme so what is the
internet marketing community the legit
marketing community doing or what do you
think they should they do to combat this
you know viola this is the first time I
actually encountered them calling them
so God this kind of a name I think they
really surprised because the last time I
was looking at the first two resources
stuff on internet marketing probably
about months ago and I don't remember
running into me they suck at all so you
know I don't know if it's just something
shifted to this more or recently and or
no that's been out there may just have
their own but you know this is my first
guy going when they're calling missiles
internet marketing where does that come
from yeah i mean i'm king other people
treating an e going why I've never heard
of this as well so you know I suppose in
part internet marketers out there may
not have been doing anything because
these paths it's just not really called
right right Joe do you do you have a
sense of how long they've been actually
I mean cuz obviously these businesses
coming from sorry are you on a plane
right now Danny yeah we're gonna get
them like totally Baldwin it's very yet
you're gonna get kicked off the play Joe
Joe collagen Joe do you know how long
they've been using internet marketing
specifically or kind of trending towards
this well I mean we turned Danny guys
once again sorry now check out your good
day what we'll do around there were six
months ago but I a lot of this material
because they keep reusing the same
material you see youtube videos for two
three four years ago its internet
marketing right or and also the skype
marketing's like an umbrella turn the
stuff is not new honey brother Danny
this is ross classy question me um
you've read the piece is there anyone
that any person or group that we called
out that you thought was unfair like in
particular people not the term itself
but like people organizations we called
out no I i just was what threw me off
was coming in during the internet
marketing was you know think oil
because I just had not seemed that term
being used at these kinds of scams and
I've always seen that term used for
legitimate stuff that I know what term
is your word for these guys yeah what
would you call these guys I mean because
what's interesting is that they've
definitely been around and doing this
for years calling themselves internet
make money work at home I mean you know
I think I would have to go back I me or
Joe right it's not like he knows you
know the history of of how that first
developed much better than I these kinds
of scams hoping to be new maybe the
names are changed right and to the
degree that the degrees of the article
raises awareness of our people who may
be actually confusing that internet
marketing with you know this broader
discipline it with a net marketing
that's great I I applaud that it's just
that there's no acknowledgement that
there's this other kind of internet
marketing yeah I think I mean when I
first got onto the internet in like
nineteen ninety-five iris part of the
inet marketing mailing list kriko which
that was how we all talk to each other
and we were all people who are trying to
help everybody else understand how we're
going to be getting onto the internet
right and and how we were going to be
you know marketing websites and how we
will get a part of marketing was
building why fight for people right you
couldn't you know did it that's how far
back i know of internet marketing going
as a name as a pipe to the internet
right that's interesting i mean i think
that you know i think i get i get i get
what you're saying and i think that
there's probably some room for I mean
this it feels like the thing is the
problem is these guys call themselves
internet marketers I think that the idea
that it's a blanket that all internet
marketers are like these guys is
obviously a problem that wasn't the
point I don't think that was the point
of Joe's peace at all right we were kind
of focusing on particular people and
stories I can see how yeah we used like
what 46 people to kind of as extreme
cartoonish illustrations but like not
every single person's story not every
scammer that every con artists like
operates the exact same way not every
person that uses their tactics is
strictly using their tactics a lot of
them are legit what alleged companies
buy into that well like part of the
problems we have to define term
because everybody describes themselves
differently and really tries to
obfuscate what they're doing so internet
marketer was the most universal so
that's what we pick I I compare them and
you know when I talked to quite a few
people in the SEO world in a legit world
and they didn't identify themselves as
internet marketers they all seem to shy
away from that yeah I feel like it does
seem like there's a difference between
you talk about PR and advertising an SEO
the term internet marketing is not a
term I've ever associated with I even
with your site internet marketing as a
phrase is not something that like I
think of at all I guess there's this
weird disconnect between on your side
there's this disconnect between what
these guys are and being internet
marketing on like the side of the main
more mainstream I think there's a
disconnect about the idea of internet
marketing is a thing at all that this is
something you're associated with I mean
when you talk about look like somebody
run what I'll say is she get over the
tech mean you'll see matt has over
google expressing the same kind of
surprised that I'm having and he has
lived in the dirtiest darkest trenches
of the internet and if you know if there
is nothing terrible he is not seeing
about marketing having to run family for
her google right and even you seem to be
surprised you know what right so I I
totally think it's fine that you use
that term to apply it to the way that
it's being used within those that kind
of genre with what those people are
saying I just think it would be really
helpful to employing that there's this
whole other discipline of internet
marketing sometimes it's called digital
marketing sometimes it's called internet
marketing but there are people who do
this range of activities and you forget
the ways Wikipedia page and explain the
sort of stuff know that are composing
distinct from the hannan a look at
people but actually they were that far
off no I mean for all we know Frankie's
guys right perfect record by the big
hand out of the end of Wikipedia page uh
yeah they're busy at it you know what
Danny I hear I hear what you're saying I
know you're
plain and and it's it's you know you
probably have to go soon but I'll I hear
what you're saying and what you will
discuss it i may be there some way you
just give me a thousand dollars i can
make sure that i'll consult with you
gibble we got a package Danny who do you
work better with Visa or MasterCard
because we want to get you in on the
right level American Express so you know
in all serious is all joking aside I
hear what you're saying I think that's
totally legit like what you're saying is
like there are there's a segment of
people who have a real job and it's not
ripping people off and they call they do
some of them clearly referred themselves
internet marketers or else you wouldn't
be upset about this yeah so maybe
there's some way that we can clarify
that in the piece it may be wondered you
know what I mean it may be as simple as
saying now look there are there's our
legitimate business called internet
marketing these guys are not it and
maybe we can point to your your post and
say Danny Sullivan wrote something you
know about the legit internet marketing
but this is something else and you yeah
go ahead if you want and I I I tone the
post channel a little bit so a subset
yeah what did you like you refer your
dress is all things that project which
is a smooth I better insult it's ever
been delivered I will say Danny just
just really on that one point I will say
if you look at us from launch day we've
been doing big pieces thought pieces
like this that aren't just about like
gadgets you know one of our earliest
pieces was Joe did this thing on
survival condos we've done those long
form pieces on rim which is like much
more about the business side we've done
stuff on art and on music and on culture
that are not so you know like this is
not a new thing for us this is just an
evolution of where I i think i think
that features are all great and one of
the things that I find interesting is
that I think your announcement went out
in the new name and everything in
November and we launched our marketing
hook we launched our marketing land site
in the same kind of way that we have
long run search engine land which is
about search marketing though is that
people who do things beyond search
engines with internet marketing so we've
launched an internet working right this
really has nothing to do with this other
kind of it right well well well we're
gonna know dude I totally hear you on
this and I think that we're going to
talk about and figure out if there's a
way to get that just that clarify that
point because I think that the fact is
these guys are calling themselves
internet marketers and I think it almost
helps to to point out
that what they think is internet
marketing or what they're trying to sell
people as internet marketing is clearly
not the real business event at marketing
so I think that's you know it I think
it's a good point and we'll talk about
it we'll figure something out I
appreciate the time and large things got
heated a bit there no it's fine about
one last week I was like what no no
we're look we don't get we don't get
riled up I i I'm actually glad to hear
i'm glad we got a chance to talk to you
things really interesting to hear the
other side of this which is not evident
that's the thing it's so crazy that
other side is like the voice has been
drowned out by these guys when you do a
search for internet marketing you don't
get Danny Sullivan you don't get that's
not the first thing I mean maybe it is
you know I don't know where where your
site ranks but it really is these guys
are drowning out what you know the
industry you're talking about is so so
maybe it's time I may be time to mount
up against these dudes get lawyer up
either bad or maybe that if it grows
that degree you're gonna have been a
larper say hey you know what weird is
all workers or something else but they
may very well do it this may have woken
up a lot of people who have no idea that
they were even calling themselves us
right it was good be right the
clarification be great if you guys
decide you want to do it i think that
would help and anyways it's good my keys
i can't say enough that the piece was
was great in exposing this kind of stuff
and i think that you would find a ton of
the legitimate internet marketers help
if you will yeah i want to want to
endorse that same sort of thing to say
this is crap you know it's just don't
let us be able to say it miss you're
like oh but you're the same kind of crap
III think that was definitely not our
goal and and and we can draw a finer
line i think pretty easily so Danny
thanks so much and have a safe flight
wherever you're going and I hope that we
talk again soon sounds good okay Kara
