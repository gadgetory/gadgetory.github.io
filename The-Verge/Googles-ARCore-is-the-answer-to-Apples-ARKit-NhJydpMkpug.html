smartphones for years
it offers the promise of putting
futuristic technology on a device that
billions of people already own but it's
only recently that reality is started
catching up with companies like Apple
Facebook and lots more onboard now one
of the biggest players here is Google
and today it's introducing a new Android
based augmented reality platform that it
calls a our core now wait a minute
doesn't Google already have an augmented
reality platform well yes
in 2014 it revealed tango which Maps the
world with depth sensing and motion
tracking cameras but tango is only on a
few devices and air whores appeal is
that it doesn't need special components
it's launching on the existing Google
pixel and Samsung Galaxy s8 and Google
promises support for a hundred million
Android devices by this winter a airport
can't do everything but dedicated tango
hardware but it's supposed to offer a
lot of tangled like experiences to a
much broader audience a our core is
built around three basic capabilities
there is environmental detection which
looks for flat surfaces or other
recognizable features there's motion
tracking so you can put an object to one
place and walk around and there's scale
and lighting estimation which makes
objects more realistic we match their
environments aircore isn't magic things
pop out of place if say you lower your
phone and walk around a big ground but
it nails the core experience of putting
down a digital object and keeping it in
place while you look at it from any
angle or distance without drifting or
jittery you also get some basic
environmental awareness like shadows
falling in the right direction or
virtual characters reacting to the
lights going out
Google is trying to attract a our core
developers who may not think of
themselves as dedicated 3d app creators
people can important models made with
its simple blocks gr design tool and
there's an experimental version of
chromium with air core so you can use
augmented reality features in ordinary
websites it's trying to make Google AR
development easy in a way that until now
it hasn't been the flip side is that you
can't use every tango out in AR core
either that dedicated depth sensor for
instance can capture more detail than an
ordinary camera right now though AR
cores real competition isn't tango it's
apples AR kit we couldn't directly
compare AR kit an air core in Google's
offices but they offer similar
experiences while Google hasn't shown
anything that would massively outshine
AR kit that's not really the point
Apple has shown that people will trust
fun experiments for augmented reality if
it's easy to access if Google can let
Android users get in on that fund it
makes AR as a whole a lot more
attractive for developers on both
platforms of course that's the big
question will air core be common enough
that people take it for granted ubiquity
was supposed to be a big selling point
for Google's daydream VR but a year
after launch
it's still pretty neat AR core has some
advantages here it's launching on a
popular existing phone runs with both
Android and Android N and doesn't
require extra hardware like a headset
google says it's working with Huawei LG
a soos and other manufacturers to put
air core on new and existing phones
given how much Android has suffered from
fragmentation though it's still a valid
concern google has a roadmap to a world
of ubiquitous high-quality augmented
reality but it also has a long way to go
over the next months we'll be watching
to see if Google can make AR core feel
like a real part of Android not just a
special feature on certain phones if it
does that's great news
for Android users augmented reality fans
and really anybody with a phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
