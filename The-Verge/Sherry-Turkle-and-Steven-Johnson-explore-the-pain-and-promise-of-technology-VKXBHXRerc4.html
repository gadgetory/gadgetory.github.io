Johnson and sherry Turkle about
technology I'm interested in technology
because I'm not using the internet right
now they've written books about
technology whether technology is
progressive or not what it's doing to us
what it's doing to our minds and what
it's doing to our society I think it
should be an interesting talk also I'm
hoping to get my copy of time so you
guys are here to discuss each other's
books and the concept of technology is
technology for progress or progress and
technology yeah particularly networks I
think the way that networks are kind of
steering us both as individuals and as
friends and families and also then as
societies and political organizations
how far are we getting pushed in
positive directions and how much do we
need to kind of steer the ship in other
directions
something I saw kind of both of your
books but that technology gets what
technology wants I'm teasing
one of the issues on the table I think
is the degree to which it makes sense to
have a technological determinist
position and the degree to which we get
to say not so fast not so fast and have
a little bit more steering of the ship
and saying that there are human purposes
that may need to override some of the
ways the technology would have it if
technology were totally in control so
you would both agree that technology
wants something I think well I would say
the technology has there's this kind of
technical term of affordances right
certain technologies are developed and
they have kind of default settings where
you know if you live in a society with
television
your political system will get more
concerned with the way politicians look
then society built around the written
word but that doesn't mean we're slaves
to the technology because one we can
invent new technology and particularly
with software it's incredibly malleable
so we can always kind of change the
rules of the software and two we make
informed decisions as citizens or as
governments or as corporations about
what kinds of behavior and uses of the
technology we want to encourage and what
kinds we want to discourage and it's
some sense what sherry is trying to
point out is that there are ways in
which we've started to use these new
technologies that we seem to be kind of
falling into that we need to just step
back and say is everything we're doing
here in the long run kind of good for us
and are some of these usage patterns may
be you know a mistake I think of it in
terms of technological affordance and
human vulnerability that technology
makes certain things possible and we're
very vulnerable to certain of those
things that it makes possible but just
because you're vulnerable doesn't mean
that that's the direction you need to go
you can get a little less vulnerable if
you think something is bad for you so
for example cars you know you drive them
fast enough you get into really a lot of
accidents you don't put in seatbelts you
don't develop an infrastructure for
rules of the road they can get you into
a lot of trouble at a certain point you
decide you know these cars let's think
about how to make them safer let's think
about how to design highway systems that
will you know make it less likely that
we get into accidents and I think over
the course of hundreds of years you know
I mean it doesn't happen overnight but
you gradually develop those can't that
kind of infrastructure for dealing with
this new technology and I think the one
of my favorite lines in my book actually
is just because we just because we grew
up with the internet we think that the
Internet is all grown up yeah you know I
when I when that line came to me I said
that's it you know we have this sense
that somehow what we have now is is that
it's very early days and we're just at
the beginning I think of thinking how we
need to change it and shape it and mold
it to make it conform to really what our
social and psychological values are what
we think the good life is yeah a line
I'm sorry good well I was gonna say one
of the things one of the problems we
have is you know just as you start to
have that informed conversation about
what this new technology is going to
enable us to do there's a new technology
writing about this stuff you know
between us for quite a long time and you
know when you were first looking at you
know muds yeah you know the expectations
about what people were gonna do online
you know it was so much of it was about
creating kind of role-playing I didn't
it identities for yourself and the idea
of you know a social network graph and
using social networks to share family
photos with your you know extended
family what was almost not on the you
know kind of landscape then and so you
know we do we have to kind of have this
conversation fast because you know who
knows what the next paradigm is going to
be in five years from now I hope you
don't mind you have a lot of myspace
references in your book MySpace those
are the days but you've got a lot of
facebook too but it took a while to
research your book obviously and this is
this is moving very fast I really like
this line that you're saying is talking
about robots but we're delegating what
was once loves labor changes the person
who delegates and I thought that was
interesting in juxtaposition to the idea
that a network can make a lot of things
very easy and warm media and quicker and
this idea of loves labor that there
might be just something that requires
that the very quality of it is the labor
yes well one of the one of the themes of
my work when I subtitled the book why we
expect more from technology and less
from each other is that
we are delegating both to sociable
robots but also to social networks or
displacing on to technology some of the
things that were better done and
face-to-face person-to-person to me
sociable robotics to be your best friend
to be in conversation about intimate
things is the the ultimate the ultimate
example of something that shouldn't be
delegated because a sociable robot no
matter how clever doesn't know about
loss it doesn't know about love it
doesn't know about thee it can know
about it in a kind of way that really
isn't a way of human meaning and
experience so you know why if I want to
talk about the loss of my mom I really
don't want to go to a social robot no
matter how much it knows how to make me
feel that it knows what I'm talking
about no matter how clever it is at
doing that so that would be to me the
ultimate example of technologies that
are built to get me to delegate loves
labor but I'm looking for love and I
think we do similar things although less
dramatically in social networks and I
think that's a human vulnerability
something that stuck out to me in your
book related to that was that concept
the example that sewer construction or
the there's the foundation of the house
that was and the sewer construction
happening on that block would really
mess up the house and dangerous to the
inhabitants and he found out about that
basically word of mouth or overhearing
and it was you know lucky he overheard
so what is the role for just talking
face-to-face with your neighbors versus
you know the peer network helping you
with them well that's
something I want to make pretty clear
here so I'm actually not really arguing
that the technology is driving this and
in many ways I have the line in the book
somewhere that you know the Internet is
not the solution of these problems the
Internet is just a role model like we
can look at the way that the internet
was built and the kind of kind of
decision making in collaboration that
went into the creation of the Internet
and the way that the internet was
designed and the kind of architecture of
the internet and take that success story
and say we can solve other kinds of
problems many of them not involving
technology and so it's not just about
you know if we put everybody on Facebook
the world will be better I don't think
that's true at all and one of the places
where this kind of pure networked
philosophy I think works the best is
precisely in local neighborhoods and
communities because it is anchored in
that kind of knowable community that
face-to-face community and it may be
augmented by new digital tools and by
you know kind of pattern detection
software and tools are allowing people
to make decisions kind of you know
online but it is embedded in the
physical world of shared sidewalks and
communities and that's the space
actually that I'm most excited about
it's a place where that technology is
kind of layer it over the the kind of
physical world in a really positive way
not just being a kind of a layer that
causes you to not pay attention to
people and check your email while you're
talking to them which I'm tempted to do
now my leg is been vibrating this all
tied up you guys get quoted so often
sure especially see you because I I read
a lot about how internet is you know
making us lonely or doing this or that
to us can you guys just talk about what
how you see your work used and quoted
versus what you would like people to
take away from it
I'm not a Luddite I really am not trying
to take your toys away so whoever is
watching this wherever you are Jerry
wants you to have your toys keep your
toys and I think that's very important
because I think that by by calling a
serious critique I mean also my book is
fieldwork base and it's been 15 years
it's as I'm reporting I'm reporting and
I'm commenting on what I see but I'm not
just reporting on the good I'm you know
I'm reporting on things that disturb me
I I I think that there's a a tendency to
take a report that is critical or says
look developmentally this could be a
problem for kids or reports on kids
describing problematic things and
absolutely go ballistic so I've been
reading some of the early reviews of
Stephens book and some people like it
some people like it a lot some people
like it a little less but nobody says
that ignorance watch how dairy waiting
for that they're not going to yeah you
know because it's a positive book and
they might like it not more or less some
people really love it some people like
it a little bit less but they don't
they're not furious
and some people read my books at it I
believe these reviews on Amazon it's
terrifying what people say about me I
mean really makes me think I get police
protection from Amazon I mean yeah I
mean there's something about and I think
that's very interesting I mean to me to
be serious about it I mean you know how
does she how do she and I think that
that is the reaction to you know I'm you
know I put it out there I'm pretty self
confident and I have all this work that
went into it so I'm you know I'm I can
take it but I think that's that is
something that I would say about the
reception of the book and what people
say about the book is really where does
that come from that's interesting
because I got some surprising reactions
from people being defensive just me
saying that I wanted to leave the
internet and taking that as an attack on
them and feeling like they needed to
defend or how they use the internet as
if I was saying how dare you use the
internet everybody should stop it's
interesting that people take it so
personally
as it's as if you're attacking them yeah
well I think it's very I think it's very
important that we have serious work that
critiques technology and your your you
need to encourage that work and my
professional career is to encumber I
teach at MIT and try to encourage that
work at MIT and other places and you
don't want to you know what's
interesting if when you write that work
after a 15-year ramp-up you really do
get was that old Saturday Night Live
saying you know Jane you ignorant
so I I'm happy you asked that question I
think happy to have given a pretty
honest answer now you should answer well
I think the one thing about just to talk
more about Sheree's experience the you
know I think people want to see a critic
of Technology as someone who is stuck in
the old way of looking at things
and hasn't you know fully embraced a new
technology because they don't understand
it and the great thing about Sherry's
career is that she's been she's way
ahead of everybody you know and she was
sitting there and you know with Eliza in
1978 or whatever that was you know and
and so she it's not like she's coming at
it as a Luddite at all she's just coming
right exactly
from my perspective you know I agree
there's no there's not a need in society
for people to be optimistic about
technology and the latest gadgets we
have plenty of that well we don't have
as a lot of optimism about our capacity
as a society to solve important problems
and come up with interesting new kind of
collaborative architectures to solve
those problems and we have this very
pessimistic sense of how we're doing as
a society on a lot of fronts it actually
isn't warranted we have a lot of
economic problems right now but we have
a lot as I start the book with that kind
of long list of kind of social health
trends all of which have been steadily
improving over the last thirty years in
fact over the last hundred years for the
most part and so I'm not trying to just
be a cheerleader for technology and I
think if I were to write a book just
about technology I would have much more
sherrystown in it which I think it's
incredibly important I'm trying to say
that there's actually a new vision of
how change happens and the institutions
that are responsible for that change
that as I said is inspired by technology
but it's not kind of reducible to it
what do you think about me and what what
can we be doing about these things that
you're talking about both pros and
well I I want to just address your
leaving the internet I personally don't
like talking about internet addiction
because I think encourages people to say
I have to leave the internet I have to
throw away my phone I prefer to think of
it in terms of our vulnerability to go
not using our phones wisely and go into
the kind of digital diet to get the
balance right I think if you decide to
leave the internet for a time of
stepping back and reflection I think
that's to the good but I hope actually
that you use the time for reflection and
kind of a resent ring and come back to
the Internet to make the internet a
better place for all of us
so my that would be my hope for about
how you use however long you stay away
from the Internet
so that's just my perspective I would
say we missed you one the internet when
we're having a huge party there and not
really missing out yeah
sherry and I are having a great time on
the internet you would not believe
what's going on there we go
the one year I leave the internet
everybody else a party thank you so much
guys
