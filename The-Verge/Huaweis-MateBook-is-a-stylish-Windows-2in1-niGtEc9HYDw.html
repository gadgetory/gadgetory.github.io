and this is the huawei mate book now
first glance this looks just like almost
any other two-in-one but the closer
inspection there's actually some really
cool stuff going on here first of all
it's 6.9 millimeters thick which is
about the same thickness as you'd find
on an iPhone 6 and it's only 640 grams
so it's pretty light considering that
you have a 12 inch LCD screen here the
LCD screen takes up about 84% of the
entire device you can see the bezels are
actually pretty thin around here and you
get a 2160 by 1440 resolution so not 4k
but still looks really nice beyond that
will always put dual speakers here on
the top that uses Dolby surround sound
but maybe the coolest thing about this
is that the volume rocker on the side
actually borrows the fingerprint sensor
from the mate 8 phone while weighs
touting that this takes 2 or 3 step
process to wake a PC down to one it's
also got a USB type-c port in Huawei is
going to be selling a dock with a whole
bunch of different adapters for that
inside it's going to have options for
the Intel's newest core m3 five or seven
processors and it's going to also be
available with Windows 10 home or
Windows 10 Pro Huawei says it's going to
get about 9 hours of battery life if you
run HD video straight through up to 13
if you're just doing things like
browsing or listening to music so you
can expect an average of about 10 hours
on the may book now the keyboard is
extremely thin and the class track that
actually moves around really well it
feels really nice now another thing that
always going to be doing to bump up the
productivity of the mate book is selling
what it's calling the mate pen you can
expect this to work basically just like
the surface pen with the surface book or
a pencil with the iPad pro it's got 2048
levels of pressure so it draws really
accurately and reproduces your
handwriting really well
it also has buttons on it that can do
things like quick launch apps like
OneNote the pen connects via bluetooth
so you can use it to control PowerPoint
presentations and it even has a laser
pointer in the back now always gonna be
selling the mate book the mate pen and
the doc and different bundles depending
on whatever region you live in a little
later this year so head to the verge
comm to find all the details on pricing
and availability and make sure you go to
youtube.com slash the verge and click
