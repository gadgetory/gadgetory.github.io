laptops for the past few years and now
tells introducing a new version of it it
is the XPS 13 2 &amp;amp; 1 which is just what
it sounds like a convertible laptop that
can be used like a tablet as well
this really is an alternate version of
the XPS 13 and not a replacement or
successor that's because it is going to
be a distinctly slower computer if you
remember Intel's Core M processors from
last year which were a little bit slower
than the Core i processors
it's basically running one of those
except until once to confuse you so it's
named core I even though it's actually
basically a core M just with a different
name so the point being this is going to
be a slightly slower computer than the
XPS 13 that's sitting right alongside it
now Dell says that you probably won't
notice a difference and it even will
ramp the power up a little bit to try to
make it closer
theyÂ´ll says that the new generation
processors of the Core M style are
actually be as fast as last generations
4i but we'll have to wait and see if
that really pans out because on numbers
alone that probably isn't going to be
the case boots that slower processor
though does let Dell do a couple of
other cool things this is actually a
slightly lighter and slightly smaller
laptop in the XPS 13 you won't really
notice it but it is there if you line
them up the change also makes this a
family's computer so it's going to be a
little bit quieter and should run a
little bit cooler because the impede is
a little bit smaller the port situation
is a little bit different there aren't
full-sized USB ports instead you have
two USB C ports one of those is
Thunderbolt there's also a headphone
jack still here mercifully but you lose
the full size SD card slot and instead
you get micro SD which I guess is useful
Dell will also sell you this dongle if
you want it which is not the most
beautiful thing in the world but doesn't
a lot of ports on it so if you feel like
carrying surround
you know another thing that some smaller
about this laptop is the battery Dell
says it's about 70 percent the size of
the standard XPS 13 battery which means
it's probably not going to last as long
now they're quoting 15 hours but I guess
we'll have to see about that because
they also it's going to be shorter than
the standard XPS 13 battery and that
does not necessarily last 15 hours the
laptop is going to start shipping this
month it's going to sell for $9.99 which
is $100 moving with standard XPS 13 so
when you're looking at Dells computers
you're gonna have to choose between
whether you want something that is very
much a laptop and a little bit more
powerful a little long lasting or if you
want something that's a little bit more
mobile but a little bit weaker but let's
do this</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
