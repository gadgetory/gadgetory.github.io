guessing that at first glance you have
no idea what this thing is
and I don't blame you it's
funny-looking it is a health device
it's a thermometer it's an infrared
thermometer probably doesn't look like
the thermometer that your mom uses to
hear your tongue when you were a kid but
this is the newest connected medical
device from the Withings and it works by
well - you stick this thing against your
forehead really against your temple and
it detects the kind of hot spots and
then it flashes your temperature on the
display here it supports different
members of the family so if you have
kids or they're just more than one of
you that's consistently taking your
temperature it will store that in the
Withings mobile apps you can see what
everybody's temperature is and in a lot
of ways this is a little bit more
comfortable I guess it's supposed to be
more comfortable than using a
traditional thermometer the question I
have is about accuracy the jury is
really still out on how accurate
infrared thermometers really are and
this thing is still not fda-approved
living says that it should be up to you
a group by the time that it's supposed
to shift in March but it is not yet FDA
approved livings also says that it is
within the accuracy range that the FDA
has sex as a standard but like I said we
really won't know that until you see
whether or not it gets approved and
comes to market cost $100 ships this
spring and yeah I don't know about you
but I'm just kind of sick of looking at
it to look let's get them to try it and
see what my temperature is so I'm
supposed to press this button one stick
it on my forehead by my eyebrow so I
feel it vibrate
doing anything fell
is it working
I don't think it's down the hotspot my
head doesn't have a hotspot I just put
it on an artery or something I look
stupid something vibrated is their
number 37.4 I'm guessing that Celsius
what is that in Fahrenheit I don't know
I don't know either case I don't feel
particularly feverish right now I'm
guessing I'm okay as we have the end of
CES I might be saying something
different especially if I get the CES
flu but so that's the new Withings
infrared thermometer called the thermo
