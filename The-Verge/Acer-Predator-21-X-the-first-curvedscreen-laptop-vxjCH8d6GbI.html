and this is one of the first new
products that have been introduced so so
probably going to be one of the craziest
ones of the show it is a 21 inch gaming
monitor and it's the first of its kind
because 21 inch display is cooked first
of all it has this illuminated window
over here we can see one of the fans
it actually has five so we're living in
an age where everybody's cutting away
the fans and get rid of things a so we
just put in more things in so five fans
two graphics cards geforce gtx 980 you
got SSDs you can get up to four drives
you can get up to 64 gigabytes of ram
this is a mechanical keyboard with brown
switches which feel great the number pad
on the side it actually flips over and
it turns into a touchpad if that's where
you want to have for your controls we
also have a subwoofer a four point two
sound system in here the resolution of
the screen is 2560 by 1440 the only
issue we have is that this is a mock-up
right here and it doesn't turn on so I
can't tell you how awesome the curved
screen looks the other thing is it's
actually lighter than it looks it's only
eight kilograms you know which is fine
it's made out of metal and a little bit
of plastic because it's got wireless
connectivity over here in the top got a
few illuminations because it's part of
Asus predator gaming series which means
it has to look like game machine which
means it has to look scary you've got
all the usual HDMI and other video
output ports Thunderbolt
has Toby eye tracking which is
integrated just on the display over here
the processor it's actually not
announced yet it's going to be Intel
seventh generation K series because this
laptop is going to available in January
February and next year by which time
inter will have those two Jack into this
so this is our first look at Asus
predator 21 X here at E for 2016 thanks
for watching for more videos from here
ready for 2016 including X's ultra-thin
laptop basically the antithesis to this
giant thing here stay tuned to the verge
