probably already know how to use
snapchat but there's a bunch of stuff I
bet you didn't know existed here are
some so the first thing you should know
about are let me show you so I'm gonna
take a snap of Ryan at the Bark with
Ryan and if you press the T button and
you leave the cursor there you can
actually drag your thumbs across the
screen and change the size of the
sentence right so you can have one word
per line you can have all the words on
one single line and then afterwards you
can drag it and make it really small to
sort of like hide it in your photo also
you can change the colors of every
single word and even every single letter
so you just make this nice and colorful
here to give your snap that extra little
bit of flavor so now at the park with
Ryan looks more beautiful than it did
before okay next let's talk about so you
probably already know about these
filters right you have your location
filters you have the time filter you
have the temperature filter but what I
bet you didn't know is that you could
just add a little emoji here let's grab
this this little fruit and zoom it in
humongously and if you grab one of these
pixels at the edge you can actually put
a nice coat of paint over your snaps
using literally one pixel of an emoji
and just blow it up huge and then once
you've got your off OnGuard filter grab
your pen and give yourself some more
flavor
next let's discuss so traditionally you
can record snaps by pressing and holding
the bun on the screen you can also
record snaps by pressing and holding
either volume key and now you can double
tap the screen to flip cameras and you
can do that as many times as you want
purse snap you can also zoom during
snaps by sliding your finger up and down
and as an added bonus you can actually
zoom in before you start recording to
get that great shot so this film
technique is called za Liang or vertigo
zooming and if you do it properly it
compresses the foreground and background
and it gives it kind of like this
dramatic zoom feel
and you do it by getting your subject
sort of in center frame and the idea is
to keep that subject the same size in
the same position and as you're moving
back zoom in and it looks like this I
was kind of good and this next one isn't
exactly uh but you should know about
snapchats
boo our codes and yes I said so while
you're in the snapchat camera interphase
you tap the yellow ghost and it brings
down your personal boo our code and if
someone scans that it adds them as a
friend
super seamlessly and you can share this
little boo our code on Instagram you can
post it on Twitter and anyone that goes
into their snapchat camera interface and
scans it you don't have to press any
buttons just scan it and it adds them as
a friend and for this last let's go into
the room do you ever find yourself
trying to snap in places with less than
ideal light well guess what snapchat has
a solution built right into the app
inside the camera interface if you're
trying to shoot in the dark a little
moon will pop up in the top left corner
if you tap that moon it turns white and
it increases the ISO of your image thus
allowing you to take those selfies at
the club and here's a little trick if
you want that moon to pop up if you want
to just add that little bit of extra
brightness you could just cover the
camera with your finger and it'll trick
snapchat into thinking you're in the
dark and you'll get the moon and you can
brighten up your photo so those are the
snapchat secrets I wanted to share with
you today I hope you learned something
for watching this video and if you know
of any other secrets
leave a comment but be careful down
there it's a nightmare thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
