video okay so FCC Chairman AGP is on a
huge crusade to repeal net neutrality
the very popular law that says your
internet provider can't slow down your
connection or give special treatment to
websites they own like Verizon's go 90
which is a pile of garbage put
everywhere
algae pie likes to say things like the
internet was not broken in 2015 when he
argues for the repeal of net neutrality
I think that's hilarious because in 2014
I literally wrote an essay called
the Internet is fucked in 2014 Verizon
was blocking apps on phones Comcast was
excusing its own apps from data caps 18t
was asking startups to pay for sponsored
data for better access to customers this
was a mess and the FCC didn't have the
juice to stop it until President Obama
got involved and the FCC finally passed
a net neutrality rules in the 2013
anyway all cheer but now PI wants to
repeal net neutrality and all of the
olla arguments are back there's a huge
day of action happening online Google
and Facebook and Amazon and Netflix are
all doing stuff on their websites but
look you know what we don't have to do
all of the exhausting activist stuff we
can just say true obvious things about
the state of Internet access in America
and then we can demand to know why the
government seems determined to make it
worse it's not really about policy it's
just about whether or not you are
getting what you paid for already number
one the broadband market in America is
not competitive 51% of Americans only
have one broadband provider 38% of
Americans only have two choices of
broadband service add it up that means
89% of Americans have at most two
choices of ISP and one is often much
slower than the other that is terrible
America is not in the top ten when it
comes to average speeds America is not
in the top ten when it comes to lowest
prices and you can argue that the United
States is huge because it is but the
problems are the same whether you live
in New York City or the middle of
Montana and when there is competition
America even just a little bit things
get better so there's only four national
wireless carriers but t-mobile is
furiously competitive with 18t and
Verizon and that means prices have
gotten lower and unlimited plans are
being offered again but mobile isn't a
replacement for wired broadband it's
more its
pensive it's less reliable and you can't
run your smart home and stream Netflix
and 4k off a fucking MiFi
we need wired broadband competition and
we don't have second broadband
competition is dominated by a tiny
handful of corporations so this is Ajit
PI's big argument he says that net
neutrality regulation holds back
Internet investment and he has to say it
because the government isn't allowed to
just to change policy on a whim he has
to offer substantial evidence that
market conditions have changed and the
number he's banking on to provide that
evidence is something called capital
expenditure which is the amount of money
the carriers spend you invest in their
networks but if you really look at it
what a jeep is saying is that AT&amp;amp;T
should dictate US Internet policy here's
a chart from USA Today the total
broadband investment from 12 largest
carriers was down 3.6 billion dollars
from 2014 to 2016 but 3.4 billion
dollars of that drop was 18 T all by
itself
why did 18 t go down because the company
had just spent a ton of money on network
investments and then told investors that
was gonna slow down for them let's not
forget that most people are 2016 thought
Hillary Clinton was gonna win the
election and net neutrality would stay
on the books what were all those big
companies saying to their investors in
the SEC during that time in December of
2015 18 T CEO told investors the company
would deploy more fibre in 2016 than it
did in 2015 and that title too would not
impede its future business plans in
December 2016 Comcast chief financial
officer said to investors that any
concerns it had about net neutrality
were based only on the fear of what
title tube could have met instead of
what it actually meant by the way
disclosure Comcast an investor in bluffs
media which owns the verge by Comcast I
was going to see it look that same month
Charter CEO told investors title - it
didn't really hurt us it hasn't hurt us
it's illegal for these companies to lie
to their investors in the SEC so you
have to assume they're telling the truth
a GPS saying if you let ice please
squeeze more money out of their existing
networks by charging for fast lanes and
blocking services that don't pay up they
will dump that money back into expansion
but remember there's no competition so
it's way more likely they're just going
to take the
some walk right now net neutrality
protects against these monopolies
screwing you because you have any
choices pi wants to take away that
protection and hand these companies more
profits without spelling out exactly how
his plan will increase competition it's
definitely like that scene from Ferris
Bueller only this time it's Vudu
broadband policy instead of due to
economics anyone third the more
successful a company becomes the less it
cares about net neutrality so net
neutrality is important for two big
reasons one it protects you from
monopolies ISPs but second and more
importantly it makes them market for
apps and services on the Internet fair
so the best products have the
opportunity to win in 2014 Netflix
really really cared about net neutrality
they were super loud and a bunch of
lobbyists that made statements that went
to war eons comcast the works but now
netflix is huge and as they've gotten
bigger they've backed off
we made an entire chart is Netflix
subscriber count grew over the years
their statements on net neutrality got
more and more lukewarm and then at the
code conference in May Netflix CEO Reed
Hastings just up and said we think net
neutrality is incredibly important it's
not narrowly important to us because
we're big enough to get the deals we
want the pattern is clear net neutrality
is great for the little guy and not
really that important to big companies
doesn't that seem like a rule we need
okay so here's four it looks like FCC
Chairman Ajit PI has already made up his
mind like I said he can't just change
net neutrality on a whim yes have
evidence but it's pretty clear he's
going to ignore the evidence he doesn't
like so the process is open right now
and you can go to the FCC's website and
leave a comment and millions of people
support net neutrality and mostly only
big ISPs want it gone so the comments
are pretty much in favor of net
neutrality but I keep saying things like
what matters most are the quality of the
comments not the quantity yeah it turns
out that corporate lawyers for ISPs
leave higher-quality comments than
regular people who just don't want to
get screwed on their bills when PI and
his team say things like we have to make
a decision based on the facts and then
also say things like make no mistake
about it this is a fight that we intend
to wage and this is a fight that we are
going to win it's pretty clear dude has
already decided what the facts are
and this process is a huge sham and
that's just kind of bullshit look this
fight is still on and the truth is still
the truth
we live in an uncompetitive broadband
market that market is dominated by a
handful of giant corporations the big
Internet companies that might challenge
them are doing it half-heartedly
and a GPI seems determined to offer up a
massive corporate handout without
listening to everyday Americans but you
can still participate and you should you
can go leave a comment at the FCC
website you can call your
representatives and ask exactly how pie
thinks his plan will work to make our
prices lower and our speeds higher and
you can demand that our government's
policies reflect the concerns of actual
Americans because I got to tell you
right now it really sounds like the
Internet's fucked all over and sprint
just found enough money to buy 33% of
title give it an additional 75 million
dollars in marketing money and buy a
million copies of jay-z's 444 which
guaranteed it would go platinum that
doesn't seem like the smartest use of
money if your network sucks does it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
