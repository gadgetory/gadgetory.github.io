want to send a text message what do you
do well if you do what most people do
you just open up the messages app and
you tap on an SMS but SMS sucks it's
only 160 characters and you never know
if they get it the pictures are bad just
everything is bad about it well what
else do you do well you hope you
remember what messaging app your friend
uses and open up whatsapp or messaging
or whatever and send it that way this
whole situation is a mess it's been that
way since the very beginning of Android
and guess what Google says that it
finally basically for the first time
ever has a fix to this whole conundrum
and I want to talk about it but to do
that I want to go inside because it's
noisy out here and tired of walking so
let's go chat okay so we're in a quieter
place and I want to start with the
basics of what is happening here because
it sounds really complicated when you
get into it but the end result is really
simple at some point in the next I don't
know six to twelve months we don't have
exact timing yet the default texting app
on Android it's called Android messages
is just going to get upgraded so that
it's going to feel more like iMessage or
facebook Messenger or whatsapp or
whatever you're going to get read
receipts you're gonna get high quality
pictures and video that you can send
you're gonna get really good group texts
it's not a brand new app it's just a
feature and it's got a really simple
name it's called chat it's gonna be
called chat on every single phone that
it's available on so when you open up
your texting app you'll send a text and
it'll just magically be this nicer
version of it so I'm gonna explain it in
more detail but you know what honestly
before I do that I just want just humor
me a little bit I want to do a brief
history of all of the crap that Google
has tried to make messaging work on
Android come with me okay so in 2005
Google launched Google Talk you might
know it as google chat it was really
popular it was really good so when
Android launched in 2008 they included
it alongside SMS because that's what you
do in 2009 the iPhone got pushed
notifications which made apps like
whatsapp get super popular and then when
they came to Android also it got popular
there so Google had a problem to solve
so in 2011 they didn't solve it they saw
Facebook and they're like we want some
of that so they launched Google+ which
had yet more chat apps in it
had puddle for text and hangouts a video
for video chat not the same hangout such
you know though it was just confusing
anyway in late 2011 iMessage and
Facebook message are lost and they were
way simpler than Google what Google had
so Google had to fix it again and so a
couple years later in 2013 they launched
hangouts which took all those other apps
and combine them into a single app and
everything was great for a couple of
years and then hangouts didn't get
updated Google+ was like failing and
they pulled texting out of it and it was
just a big mess again and so in 2016
Google's like we're gonna fix it again
they launched a low for text chat and
duo go for video chat duo super popular
a low
mm-hm not so much meanwhile hangouts
turn into this like enterprise slack
competitor thing I don't know whatever I
haven't even mentioned Google Voice and
Google Wave and all the other crazy
experiment schools have been doing it's
been a rolling ten-year disaster and
Google has to fix it I mean look at all
this stuff
what the what yeah okay all that's
ancient history
you don't need to know about it anymore
it's still interesting though right I
think it's insane here's how our CS this
new chat feature is going to work it's
actually relatively simple if you have
Android messages and your carrier
supports RCS you're gonna send a text
and then it'll rip shoot up to your
carrier server and then they gotta
figure out where it goes so it'll go to
a hub
that'll reroute it to the other carrier
server that other carrier be like oh the
recipient has our CS too and they'll get
the rich message if they don't they'll
get a standard text message if they get
a text message they've a text messaging
rates if they get this special new chat
message it won't cost anything because
it'll be the same races all their stuff
on their data plan but if you are
sending it to somebody who doesn't have
RCS their carrier hasn't supported yet
or yeah if they're using an iPhone it's
going to fall back to SMS if you look at
this graphic of all everybody that's
supporting it it's a whole lot of
carriers all around the world it's a
whole lot of Android manufacturers
Samsung is gonna support it in their
default text messaging app LG and Huawei
are on board and then if you look at the
operating system providers we've got
Google obviously and hey
look at that Microsoft is there I wonder
if that means there's gonna be a texting
app on Windows that all sounds great but
there's one problem
our CS chats aren't protected from
government snooping in the same way that
a fully encrypted chat system is so if
you need something fully encrypted
you're gonna need to use something like
iMessage or signal the reason that
happens is our CS chats basically follow
the same rules as SMS so the data gets
stored on the server and if the
government goes looking for it the
carriers are probably more likely to
give it up and it's not like I message
where everything is encrypted and they
couldn't possibly give it up even if
they wanted to I want to shift gears
here a little bit because earlier we
looked at all of the folderol that
Google went through chasing its own tail
trying to figure out messaging and it
seems like they've tried everything but
they haven't actually tried everything
even right now they're not doing what to
me seems like the really obvious thing
they're not just making an Android
equivalent of iMessage where you text a
message and it goes up to Google Google
figures out whether or not you're in the
system and if you already get it and if
you're not it falls back to SMS that's
how I message works why aren't they
doing that at Android the answer if you
ask Google I did is they'll tell you
that Android is open and they can't make
the default the thing that's just a
Google thing they actually have to make
it available for other people to build
on and if they were to you know swing
their big Android cloud around then you
know people make it mad and that's not
what Android is about and it's a hard
situation that Google's in like do we
fight every single carrier on the planet
by taking away like one more piece of
their control over what their customers
do or do you partner with everybody and
if your Google like you're more likely
to partner with everybody because I
don't you play ball in a way that Apple
doesn't if it works if all billion of
those people have this new text
messaging standard I don't think Apple
can not get on board like they're gonna
happen they're gonna become the green
puffle and that would suck for Apple so
I do think that there's a really good
chance that the iPhone is gonna pick up
our CS support the billion users of
Android are going to have their own
version of the blue
and they're still I don't know a
trillion text messages sent a year and
so if they can make that experience not
suck because it's us right now they can
make that experience not suck they could
win and if Google controls the most
popular text messaging app on your phone
Android messages they can get all the
stuff that they want they can do Google
assistant inside that thing and they're
gonna do that they can have crazy Google
stickers they can have it tie end duo
for video chat stuff the bottom line I
hope is that if you have an Android
phone you're gonna get chat and your
text messaging experience is gonna get
way better is it gonna be as good as I
want no it's not it's not going to be as
secure as iMessage or signal but it's
gonna be a huge upgrade over SMS and
honestly Google deserves some credit for
managing to get 50 something carriers
and a few dozen manufacturers to all
agree on something that never happens
so SMS is gonna get a huge upgrade and
hopefully if we're lucky this rcs thing
is gonna finally kill SMS dead so what
do you think is this crazy plan of
Google's actually going to work or are
you just gonna keep on using whatever
text messaging app you use right now let
me know in the comments and hey while
you're down there hit the like button
that's fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
