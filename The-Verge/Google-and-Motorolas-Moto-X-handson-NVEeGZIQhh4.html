today in new york city we're getting our
first look at first device they built
together this is the Moto X and it's
really what happens when Google becomes
a hardware manufacturer but this story
really goes back a week to verizon's
announcement of a lineup of new droids
Motorola made clear to us that moto x is
the future of the company that it's
where Motorola is headed but it's
hedging that future a little bit droids
have a special place there they go after
people who are looking for a lot of
power top end hardware specs they're
looking for phones that have a unique
design character to them new phone isn't
quite as angry as your average droid I
still don't know if it's called the X or
the Moto X but whatever you call it the
phone is beautiful it's curved glass and
plastic front has tiny bezels and a big
bright display and the back curves from
flat edges to a slightly convex Center
that nestles perfectly in your palm
nearly everything else about the phone
is negotiable you can choose how much
storage you get your Moto X you can also
choose the front panel either black or
white there are 18 options to the back
panel which you can also engrave plus 7
for the access which are the ring around
the camera lens and the buttons the
colors look and feel different from a
woven black to a matte and rubbery grey
and if you don't like the one you pick
just send it back within two weeks and
get another assembling phones to order
like this is complicated and it takes
time so Motorola moved its operations to
Fort Worth Texas in a huge factory where
it assembles all its phones we realized
that it was really critical to be able
to deliver phones to people in less than
five days and so that's why we moved
manufacturing we took all of our supply
chain and we made it based in Fort Worth
and there's approximately 2,000
employees that put the phones together
it's a very it's a complicated assembly
process and and they're working at our
partner flextronics who we do our
manufacturing with we also course have
most of our designers engineers most of
our employees at Motorola are in America
as well and so putting our manufacturing
close to our engineering is a really
really nice feed
loop for us buyers get to help decide
what their phone looks like but the
specs themselves are left up to Google
and Motorola the two companies made a
big bet they essentially built a
mid-range phone it has a 4.7 inch 720p
OLED screen in an era of 5-inch 1080p
panels and we had a lot of debates about
what the right what the density of
display 1080 versus 720 what the right
size is so started with size to really
find the sweet spot and then we decided
the resolution to be what we thought was
idea we could go and make you know a
higher resolution screen but it would
just suck battery and no one would feel
the difference right because we saw that
we knew that the screens a little pink
to our eyes but otherwise looks really
good the Moto X has Motorola's x8 chip
which really is little more than an
off-the-shelf Snapdragon processor plus
a couple of additional course it's not a
bleeding edge or even necessarily top
knocked processor but it goes back to
the simple message of the Moto X it's
not about what your phone can do
theoretically it's about what it does do
and what you do with it one of the
things we found is a little bit of a
curious behavior was people turning
their phones off and on about 60 times a
day and so so we developed something we
think is really cool and very useful
which we call active display it lets the
user know that real basic information
and it shows it sort of right on the
screen in this case like it comes on and
I can just go right up to the text
message it'll take me right to the
message so it's really fast part of the
reason we use the AMOLED display is that
we can selectively illuminate one
portion of the display which gives us a
very kind of energy efficient way to to
show this the Moto X knows when you're
in a car and jumps into driving mode
automatically it knows your voice and
only your voice just say okay Google now
and command your phone as you please you
can make an end calls get directions or
look up almost anything without ever
needing to touch your phone or even turn
it on the phone runs nearly pure stock
Android version 4.2 point2 somehow even
though it's owned by google motorola
still can't get the latest version of
its software there is a clear separation
between motorola and android but we also
of course have quite a bit of google
influence it doesn't help us per se
upgrade any faster there's no difference
in operation there than any other
but our strategy does motorola strategy
does which is to remove a lot of the
customizations that have plagued android
phones for a long time and really just
focus right on the core android user
experience which we think is evolved to
a great place it has unlocked an
opportunity for us to pursue a path that
before we thought about but really
wasn't wasn't really going to work for
us at motorola given what our products
weren't what we stood for it allowed us
to design in a different way google's
been involved with the moto x design
throughout and there's even a program
for sharing employees between the two
companies it's almost like motorola
hasn't figured out what to do with
google yet and google hasn't figured out
how to use its new hardware arm either
it may not be a google play edition
phone unlocked and an android purists
dream but the Moto X is fast smooth and
powerful the only thing that didn't work
very well with the quick launch camera
you wiggle your wrists like you're
jimmying a lock and it'll jump straight
to the camera no matter what it was
doing before it's great it just doesn't
always work the camera takes good
pictures too but it has very few
features it might be too simple but
Motorola believes in simple in making
phones that fit our lives perfectly
without changing them it believes we
want phones that do what we want them to
do and they look the way we want them to
look and everything else from spec
sheets two SKUs is secondary I think two
years ago the company made 45 phones
we're we're obviously down to a much
smaller set and we think it's critical
to do a smaller number of things much
better at a hundred ninety nine dollars
on contract and available in all four
major US carriers we're gonna find out
if simple can win Motorola's taking on
the galaxy s4 the HTC One the iphone 5
and even its own line of droids those
phones all have more power and more
features Motorola's fighting fire with
glow sticks here but it's glow stick is
pretty it's really easy to use and it
doesn't go out so quickly maybe there's
something to be said for glow sticks
