autonomous vehicles in operation across
the country and ways that we imagine
today like individual cars owned by
individual families but in other ways
with some of the ride-sharing services
making conversions to autonomous
vehicles families that will be able to
walk out of their homes and call a
vehicle to them and that vehicle will
take them to work or to school or to a
doctor's appointment or something like
that this is something that's going to
transform just about every way we move
so I think you're going to see trucks
for example that are driverless and
you're going to see because of the
technology those trucks and went and
running much more closely together which
actually will have fuel savings and
climate impacts on the positive end in
the future you're going to see ships
that have more self-driving features
trains that have more self-driving
features and just about everything other
than walking is going to have some
self-driving aspect to it there's
another opportunity for us in this era
and that has to do with data and
analytics you know today I Drive over
our pothole and if you happen to be
driving behind me and see what happens
to my car you glean that understanding
and you think to avoid that pothole well
if an autonomous car runs over a pothole
will it be able to communicate and share
that data not only with cars of the same
type but can that information now be
shared to all autonomous vehicles
regardless of who made it the industry
working with us again we're going to
have to answer that question together
because I want us to have as broad an
imagination of how data and analytics
can help improve what we do in
transportation and frankly lift the
safety advantages
autonomous cars I do think the age of
technology and transportation that we
ran is going to revolutionize the way we
think about transportation but we don't
take leaps that much I mean it's been 50
years since we've taken the last big
leap and transportation and that's why
this moment is so important back in 1956
we were a vastly different country we
were a country that had laws of
segregation we're a country that did not
have Voting Rights Act passed and so
there were projects that were designed
in the 1950s that ultimately got built
along racial lines or long economic
lines so you look at our freeways you go
to New Orleans or Syracuse or Los
Angeles and you can see those distinct
lines that have been drawn and highways
that have been built and overpasses that
are still there that are actually walls
between people here's a challenge with
self-driving technology is that I think
left to its own devices any technology
is going to end up going to those who
can afford it the most first the
difference here with transportation is
that so much of the infrastructure that
driverless technologies need is coming
from the public sector so here in this
instance the public sector actually has
a lot more control than would be the
case with something like VCRs for
example and we can create the incentive
structure for the demand to wrap around
the wide swath of socioeconomics that we
have in this country so that perhaps the
existence of a staging area for
rideshares
attracts new housing new neighborhood
services like pharmacies and grocery
stores into those areas and then begins
to provide an underpinning of
mc-- activity in an area that previously
didn't have as much we have an
opportunity to press a reset reset
button in a certain sense we also have
an opportunity to just completely drive
forward an entire global transformation
of the relationship between human beings
and machines that's just an amazing
opportunity for a society but we've got
to seize it and we've got to be
intentional about
