is the iPhone 5c the 5c is an
interesting phone
it's basically an iPhone 5 in a new
candy colored plastic show Apple is
going to advertise the hell out of this
phone so get ready see with every new
iPhone since the 3GS Apple's kept the
old model around at $99 and the 2 year
old model around free so last year when
the iPhone 5 came out the old 4s dropped
$99 and the even older iPhone 4 was free
this year Apple's trying something
different instead of keeping the iPhone
5 around Apple's replacing it with the
iPhone 5c which is almost exactly the
same inside but comes in a cheaper
plastic shell that plastic shell means
the 5c comes in a bunch of fantastic
looking glossy colors a fun trend
started by Nokia in recent years you can
get it in green blue yellow pink and
white and it looks and feels great it's
a little bit bigger and heavier than an
iPhone 5 or 5s but it's much more solid
than other plastic phones like the
Samsung Galaxy s4 or whatever it is that
LG is doing you can also get apples
official rubber case in a bunch of
colors so you can mix and match it's a
little weird that the case Clips the
word iPhone to none on the back but it's
not really a big deal
inside the 5c is almost exactly the same
as the iPhone 5 it's the same a6 chip
the same Retina display the same 8
megapixel camera on the back if you've
ever used an iPhone 5 nothing about the
5c will surprise you except for the
colors which are really colorful there
are some small internal differences the
FaceTime camera on the front is a little
bit better the phone supports LTE in
more countries and the battery is a
little bit bigger
although battery life itself seemed to
be about on par with the iPhone 5 when
you first turn on the 5c you'll be
greeted by the swoopy minimal iOS 7
which takes some getting used to but
otherwise seems made for film is
colorful out of the box the backgrounds
are coordinated to the color of the
phone and everything runs extremely
smoothly especially the camera which is
much faster in iOS 7 than before the 5
C's carry over rear camera is still
among the best in the industry really
only the 5s in the Lumia 1020 of any
claim to being better and that new front
shooter does a far better job in
low-light for all those late night
FaceTime sessions and ill-advised
selfies in the bar and that's pretty
much it the 5c is a very attractive new
case for what is ultimately a very
familiar phone that's not a bad thing
but if you're looking for the state of
the art you'll want to look at the
iPhone 5s or
competitor like the HTC One or galaxy s4
but if you're feeling like a pop of
color on an otherwise grey day and you
don't want to spend anything more than
$99 and two-year contract the iPhone 5c
is clearly your best choice</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
