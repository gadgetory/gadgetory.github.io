- This is the HoloLens 2 and
compared to the first version,
it's a little bit lighter
and little bit smaller,
but when you put it on,
what you see is way bigger.
It's due out much later
this year for $3,500,
but that's only getting sold
to companies, not consumers.
Still, the tech inside this
thing is seriously impressive,
let's talk about why.
By the way, I should just say now
that if you've ever
listened to The Vergecast,
you know that I always disclose,
when I talk about these things,
that my wife works for Oculus,
which is part of Facebook,
but that doesn't affect how
I think about this tech.
So a lot has changed with the HoloLens
in the two years since the
first developer version shipped.
Even though, what Microsoft is showing off
is still pretty early as a prototype
and it has a bunch of
half-finished software in it,
I think it's a big leap forward,
at least from a tech perspective.
All of those changes began with a decision
that Microsoft had to make,
to fix the original Hololens'
biggest problem, the field
of view was just too small.
You'd see holograms in front of you, sure,
but only directly in front of you
and they'd clip out of existence
if you just turned your head a little bit.
To fix that, Microsoft had to go with
an entirely different kind
of display technology,
like the Vaunt and the
North smart glasses,
Hololens 2 uses lasers
to create a MEMS display,
but instead of shining an image
directly into your retina,
Microsoft's laser goes
into these wave guides
that sit in front of your eyes.
It works by having lasers hit mirrors
that scan 54,000 times per second
and they direct photons
into the wave guides.
So to make a bigger image,
all Microsoft has to do
is increase the angle of the mirrors
and it can get really bright.
The images that I saw were at 500 nits
and each eye had the equivalent
of a 2K resolution display,
the result is that you
get a wider field of view,
the holograms don't clip as much
and they just feel more natural,
they have a higher density too,
they just feel more real.
Microsoft is thumping its chest
about this technology too,
here's quote, There is no competition
for the next two or three
years that can come close
to this level of fidelity.
Yeah, they believe in it.
There's other tech inside here too,
it has these tiny cameras
on the nose bridge
that authenticate you via retinal scan
and they adjust the image to fit
the pupillary distance between your eyes.
It runs Windows of
course, but it's doing it
on a Snapdragon processor
to maximize battery life.
Now, the difference
between AR and VR and MR
gets really fuzzy, depending
on who you talk to,
but for Microsoft, this is Mixed Reality
and for it to be real, the digital world
needs to sort of interact
with the real world.
In order to pull that off,
there's a new Azure connect sensor
right here in the front
that can scan the room
and it can do so at a much
higher level of fidelity.
- On a spatial mapping, Hololens
1 was just one big mash,
it was like dropping a
blanket over the real world.
- Right.
- With Hololens 2,
we go from spatial mapping
to semantic understanding of space,
as you understand, what's a couch?
What is a human sitting on a couch?
What's the difference
between a window and a wall?
- For starters, Hololens 2
understands something
really important, your hand.
The first Hololens made
you do these really awkward
little pinching motions to select stuff,
the new one can see how you actually
articulate your fingers,
so you can just naturally grab objects
and resize them and move them around.
If you see a button, you can just push it.
I just hit a button,
which was actually really impressive,
because there was a little three-dot menu
and whenever there's a
three-dot menu, I'm a nerd,
I hit the three-dot, I
hit the hamburger menu,
there was an X and I just pushed it
like it was a real button
and away went the hologram.
It's a much more instinctive
way of interacting
and you don't have to learn as
much to use the new Hololens.
So that's how some of this new tech works,
but that brings us to another question.
So who's this for?
- For the first-line workers.
- Okay.
- As a matter of fact,
if you think about seven
billion people in the world,
people like you and I, knowledge workers
are by far, the minority.
Majority of population of
workers is not doing that,
they're not all designing
cars with clay models,
but maybe the people that are fixing
their jet-propulsion engine,
maybe they're the people
that in some retail space,
maybe they're the doctors
that are operating on
you in an operating room.
- [Dieter] It's designed
for a different use-case.
For workers who don't
sit at computers at all.
- People that have been
in a sense, neglected,
or haven't had access to technology,
because PC's, tablets, phones
they don't really lend
themselves to those experiences
and in the world that we
live today, where technology
is pervasive and ubiquitous
in our environment,
devices like Hololens empower you
to have access to that and
to be productive with it.
- Yeah, the way that most
people think about consumer--
I mean, it's right there in
the name, Consumer Technology,
but you're not thinking of this as
a consumer technology product,
- That's right, not yet.
- it's a technology product.
- That's exactly correct.
- Is it because you don't think
that the experiences are ready?
- Never positioned it
as a consumer product.
- Right.
- And that's having intellectual
honesty on this state,
this is the best, highest watermark
of what can be achieved in Mixed Reality
and I'm here to tell you
that it's still not a consumer product.
- Now that's not exactly true.
Microsoft definitely showed off
a lot of consumer use-cases
with the first Hololens,
even though it was technically
just a developer kit.
It showed games and even like
a traditional web browser,
but the point is that Microsoft
is pivoting away from all that,
now it's for people who need
to work with their hands
and so, have been stuck using computers
in really awkward ways up until now,
if they got to use them at all.
If the Hololens is going to
get used every day, all day,
in situations like factory
floors or out in the world,
it needs to get a hell of
a lot more comfortable.
That's why the computer guts
of it are in the back now,
so that center of gravity
is exactly the middle of your head,
that makes it way more
comfortable and also by the way,
it also works better with glasses now.
Now when you put it on,
you put it on kind of just
like you put on a baseball cap
and then you just dial it in
a little bit to tighten it up,
but you don't have to get it that tight
to make it feel comfortable on your head,
there's a couple of speakers right here,
so you can hear sound and you know what?
This is probably awkward for you to watch,
so let me just do this
and now you can actually just look at me
while I talk about the rest
of the stuff that's on here.
There's a whole lot of
other really clever things,
the way that it dials in to your head
is a lot more comfortable,
you can put a top strap
on it if you need it.
This foam here on the
front on your forehead
is custom designed to
fit multiple body types
and it also comes off
if you need to clean it,
'cause it ges sweaty.
So that's Hololens 2, it's
coming out later this year
and again, it's gonna cost
companies that wanna buy it
about 3,500 bucks a pop,
but it's meant for workers
and I like the idea of bringing computers
to people who haven't benefited yet
from having PC's or phones at their jobs.
It might not be something you
can go out and buy in a store,
but that doesn't mean that
it doesn't have a real shot
at changing our understanding
of what computers could look like.
(slow intense bass music)
Hey everybody, thank you
so much for watching.
Do you think you could use
this thing in your job?
Let me know in the comments
and if you're sad that you can't go out
and buy a Hololens yourself, don't fret.
There is a ton of new
gear coming this year
at Mobile World Congress
and we have full coverage
of all of it right here at The Verge.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
