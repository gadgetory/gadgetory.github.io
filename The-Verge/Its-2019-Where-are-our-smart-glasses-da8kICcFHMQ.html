- [Narrator] For years the
tech world has been fantasizing
about replacing your phone with
a pair of electronic glasses.
You might remember the hype
around Google Glass back in 2013.
But you might also remember that people
weren't exactly thrilled by the idea.
In fact, they were pretty creeped out.
And a lot of people today,
think of Glass as a failed experiment.
But Google didn't
actually give up on Glass.
In fact, earlier this year,
it's parent company Alphabet
announced a revamp Glass headset
and said it was no longer
in experiment at all.
It's now a full fledged product.
Meanwhile, Facebook and Apple
are interested in building
augmented reality glasses.
And AR start-ups like Magic Leap
are getting huge investments.
So why don't you see people
wearing them on the street?
Well, the reality of AR is a lot more
nuance than the fantasy.
To see where these smart
glasses live in the real world,
we need to look at the big picture.
(techno music)
The term AR glasses or
AR headsets usually means
something that overlays
images onto the real world.
As opposed to virtual reality,
which completely changes
what you're seeing.
On one end of the spectrum,
you're got products like
Microsoft Hololens which
produce detailed 3D objects
that look like they're
actually sitting in real space.
These incorporate tracking cameras,
an advanced optics tech,
but they're often bulky and expensive.
On the other, you've got simpler devices
like Google Glass.
Which can look much more
like normal glasses,
but often just provide
a flat visual overlay.
And some products split the difference
ending up looking like bulky sunglasses.
Tech companies and pop
culture spend a lot of time
speculating about how AR glasses
will change everyday life.
You could replace your
TV with a virtual screen,
for instance.
Or hang out with a holographic
friend in your living room.
Or see your entire world covered by
invasive estopim advertising.
But whether you thing these
ideas are cool or creepy,
they've all got one thing in common.
They still haven't happened.
So why did Google announce a new Glass?
And while we're at it,
why is the US Army giving
Microsoft 480 million dollars
for Hololens headsets?
It's 2019 and we keep hearing about AR,
but we don't see these
glasses on the street.
There are some pretty obvious reasons
to not wear AR glasses everywhere.
A lot of the options are
uncomfortable or expensive.
And most of them have a
limited field of view,
so they're more like
looking through a window.
Then, totally changing
your view of the world.
AR glasses with cameras could enable
a kind of nearly invisible surveillance.
Especially when you add a technology
like facial recognition.
And things that block
your eyes are often just
fundamentally alienating to other people.
So most AR companies
don't think of glasses
as the new smart phone, at least not yet.
They're content with
smaller and they're focusing
on specific context
where there're very clear
benefits that outweigh the costs.
Microsoft, for example,
only sold around 50 thousand
Hololens headsets in it's first two years.
And it's said, it's
happy with these levels.
These days Alphabet isn't
trying to sell glass headsets
like pixel phones or smart speakers.
It calls headsets enterprise editions.
Instead of the explorer
edition, it used to pitch
as a prototype for consumers.
Industrial work is probably
commercial AR's biggest market.
In fact the term &quot;augmented
reality&quot; usually gets credited
to a scientist at Boeing
named Thomas Caudell.
In the early 90's Caudell
prototyped a heads-up,
see-through, head-mounted
display that would let factory
employees get information
about aircraft overlaid
on the actual planes.
They could see important
points marked on the body,
or read documentation about the planes
incredibly complex wire harnesses.
The idea didn't pan out
bad, but Boeing started
experimenting with
Google Glass to help with
harness wiring a couple of decades later.
Boeing announced an official
AR glasses test on it's
factory floor last year.
Companies like Ussex
have also been selling
AR glasses to these markets.
The military is another big AR market.
It's been involved in AR for decades.
The 80's Air Force super cockpit program
built fighter pilot heads-up displays
into some really bulky helmets.
In 2018 Microsoft got
that 480 million dollar
contract with the US Army.
Which could get up to a hundred
thousand hololens headsets.
Both for training and for
giving soldiers a heads-up
display in live combat.
Marines have already used the headsets
for training simulations.
Unlike with consumer AR
glasses these are situations
where people are already
used to surveillance
and bulky specialized equipment.
You don't have to convence
a bunch of individual users
to each spring for a headset.
And the hardware's used
for specific task where
companies can measure their effectiveness.
The same goes for other
places where AR is used.
Including surgeon's operating rooms and
research institutions.
But some companies have
been trying to bridge gap.
The National Theatre in London
uses absen overiane glasses
for closed captioning.
If you're hard of
hearing you can still see
what the actors are saying.
Now we're talking about
using AR headsets for fun.
But it's still limited
to a specific place and
a specific use that doesn't
make other people uncomfortable.
Also, it's the theater
so no body should be
looking at you anyway.
When companies try to build
all purpose mass headsets
things get dicier.
Intel and North both designed
sleek, relatively cheap
glasses for smart watch
style notifications.
But Intel decided that there
wasn't a big enough market
for it's product right now.
And North also faced
lay-offs earlier this year,
although it's still been
rolling out new features.
Microsoft used to show-off
consumer hole lens Aps,
but these days it's almost
totally focused on professionals.
There's one big outlier.
AR start-up Magic Leap,
which has gotten more than
two billion dollars in funding
and focuses on mass market entertainment.
We've seen Magic Leap
goggles in art installations.
And it's hiring developers
to make cool Aps and games.
But we're still waiting
to see if Magic Leap has a
sustainable business model.
Do people want to wear
AR glasses all the time?
Right now the answer is still a clear, no.
But are people wearing them?
Absolutely, if you know where to look.
Hey, thanks for watching.

a new AR headset in 2019

Microsoft's hole lens two.
