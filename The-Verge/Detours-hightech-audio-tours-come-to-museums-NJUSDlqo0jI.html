interesting people in Silicon Valley for
me is Andrew Mason he's the guy that
founded group on the site that let you
join with your friends to buy coupons
well it was a wild rollercoaster ride
for that company and Andrew eventually
decided to get off when it's one of fell
from its heights he became one of my
favorite people though because
immediately after he quit he decided to
report an album of what he called
inspirational business music and only
then did he move on to his next big idea
and that idea was it's a company that
creates audio tours for you to
experience in the real world these
technology to figure out where you are
in space of time and they have super
high production guys but today he's
announcing something new true for the
first time he's bringing his audio tours
indoors so if we're headed to the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art which is
just about to reopen after a huge
renovation and Andrews gonna show me
what it looks like when you bring
teacher inside of the museum you've been
here working on D tour for the past
couple of years until now it's been an
outdoor phenomenon
today you're bringing it indoors tell me
a little bit about what you've been
working on about a year ago we met up
with the folks at SF MoMA he said look
the stars are perfectly aligned we're a
block away from you like let's work
together and reinvent what the indoor
audio tour experiences for our Museum
and so this tour that we're about to
take no matter where we go
Detra will follow us and give us sort of
the right information in the right place
yeah so we've built basically now a
platform for third parties and the SSF
MoMA is our
first customer it knows what room you're
in and it'll automatically show all the
artworks in the room on your phone
there's one tap and you can play the
audio associate those artworks or we
have these these these walks that are
maybe 15 to 30 minutes and there's going
to be about 10 of them when the museum
opens in a couple of weeks this would be
one of the first times that an outsider
has taken one of these deep yeah indoor
detours so it could go great or could go
disastrously wrong they could good is
that's really wrong but you'll edit that
all out of course of course
all right let's go check it out come
with me over to the glass railing and
let's look out onto this grand atrium
come in you will see Picasso's and
Matisse ISM or the early modern artists
keep going straight ahead and look
closer even closer it's plain it's like
you know one thing that I was thinking
as we were talking about detour is that
like a defining facet of modern urban
life is that we're all constantly always
like walking around with ear buds in
like so I'm having these private
experiences no we're having a shared
experience because we have sync just
wait til oculus gets in here and
everybody's just we see our role as
cock-blocking oculus so that like we
create something that's entered
I don't know if that's usable but the
big name of your company is hoc oculus
is what I've actually heard in this
pensive self-portrait Andy Warhol's
easily recognizable face is linked to as
equally identifiable painting style when
you find yourself having to make an
important CEO decision do sort of find
yourself sort of instinctively well I
will now yeah it's definitely an upgrade
from from the jobs and now I'm gonna
pause because I'm saying here it says
did a murder-mystery inspired this
painting and I'm hoping that it did well
will this actually answer that question
I guess and he was responding she told
me to a story that happened at the time
a murder of a woman that was mystery so
a murder mystery didn't spiral emanating
and we're gonna have to solve it before
we leave the museum so a lot of times
when an entrepreneur leaves the company
they started they wait a little bit and
then start another version of the exact
same company that is not what Andrew
Mason bid with teeth war and that's kind
of what I like about it by creating
these sort of very personal handcrafted
audio tours they've made something
that's very hard to reproduce I still
don't know how big a business there is
in detour but walking around the
galleries today with him I was having a
lot of fun and with more people
listening a podcast every year it seems
like his platform that he's building may
actually turn out to be if found as big
a business as Groupon than something
that lasts a lot longer
