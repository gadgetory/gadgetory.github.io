we've all received a bunch of them
lately because of the new GDP our
privacy regulation in Europe but what am
I supposed to do with all this info how
do I even begin to process this thing
privacy policies are legal documents
that are designed to shield companies
from lawsuits and because of this most
of us probably don't even read these
privacy policies if we're being totally
honest we're also probably going to use
these services regardless of what their
privacy policies say anyway but you
should try to care about your data
because it's not only important to know
who you're giving it to in light of the
Facebook Cambridge analytic a scandal
and major data breaches like Equifax but
also because you might find some
interesting tools in these policies that
will give you more control over your
information privacy policies do have
some value that's Joseph jerome he's
going to help us learn about privacy
policies as is Nate Cardozo the senior
staff attorney at the Electronic
Frontier Foundation so before we get
into their hot privacy policy tips
let's first establish who actually has a
privacy policy it's basically every
company you know when you're saying a
pro loyalty card in your grocery store
that's a huge data collection point your
grocery store might not seem like the
pinnacle of technological achievement
but if they're collecting your
information they have to let you know
some parameters around how they use it
understanding what's written though
isn't easy
humans write them with the notion to not
make them clear and readable but to make
them legally bulletproof Joseph suggests
looking for the word control to find
what data settings you can change he
also looks for bullet points that sum up
a policy a company can't even give you
some high-level highlights of what's
going on that suggests that they
probably aren't as mature in their
privacy thinking you can also easily
check the date the privacy policy was
published or last updated you'll want to
see something relatively recent to show
the company takes privacy seriously
finally and crucially Joseph says we'll
want to figure out what information is
collected about us he's skeptical of
companies that collect location
information even if it's technically
stored in the aggregate meaning that
location data isn't directly tied to
your account basically he just treats
location information as sensitive and
doesn't readily share it
Nate's searches for the phrase such as
in the policy which is actually a bad
thing if a privacy policy uses the term
such ads that means they're collecting
all sorts of stuff and they're not going
to tell you what they're collecting just
out of curiosity let's look at some of
these privacy policies and try out these
tips all right so let's of course start
with Instagram this privacy policy one
word that Joseph mentioned is the word
not the reason you want to search for
not is because companies typically won't
put that in because that means they
cannot do something and that really
limits them this is interesting it says
we will not rent or sell your
information to third parties outside
Instagram but then it lists a bunch of
exceptions including giving this
information to third party advertising
partners which is not good and that's
probably what you're most interested in
how about trying such as there's such as
there is such as there's five such as is
here so here we have a such as that
means we also share certain information
such as cookie data so that means
they're sharing they could be sharing
cookie data but it also leaves it very
open it could be other stuff too Nate
would not be happy now what's
interesting about Instagram is they
actually have a separate policy called
the data policy we're gonna check that
out I'm interested in the controls that
Instagram offers like Joseph mentions so
I'm searching control and immediately
you can see learn more about how you can
control who can see the things you share
so brought me to this page on Facebook
because Instagram is owned by Facebook
and I can actually go to my privacy
settings and change them and I can
actually edit who can see my future
posts right now it's public which is not
good we can actually make it to friends
so now only friends will see my future
posts go back to this data policy this
is interesting is this facial
recognition so if I click that it takes
me straight to this facial recognition
settings page and says do you want
Facebook to be able to recognize you in
photos and videos I'm uncomfortable with
that so I would say no a lot of people
probably don't know that these pages
exist so it's actually a nice feature
that Instagram slash Facebook calls your
attention to these if you know to search
for in the data policy again is any of
this going make me not use Instagram
probably not because I like Instagram
but it's good info to have plus maybe
vocal users can make a difference in
company policies alright is there
nothing else we can do what if I really
really hate this policy keep in mind you
could always say no to giving a retail
store your email or phone number you can
even ask why they need it you could also
set up a burner email account that you
only use for spam mail that at least
segments your online identity a little
bit Nate also says we can request our
data from companies because after gdpr
was enacted they have to give you your
data if you request it they'll often
still give it to you even if you don't
live in Europe so now we're privacy
policy professionals sort of but
honestly even still privacy policies are
a mess and no one wants to spend forever
reading them except for maybe Joseph and
Nate now this is where things get
interesting
Joseph believes AI will help us
eventually parse through these policies
it makes sense of them I really hope we
can get to what I think are standardized
machine readable privacy policies
long-term we really need these policies
to be machine readable so they can be
digested at scale Nate and the EF F
however aren't proponents of these a I
assisted readings Nate believes that AI
would actually be terrible it could
easily be gamed certain phrases like
such as and not would trick the system
which does make sense given that were
just looking for those phrases too
instead he thinks the privacy policy
itself needs to be solved with more
information on data and how it's used
maybe then he says AI would work for now
we're going to just have to use our
brains a little bit and try to
understand what these privacy policies
are telling us advocates for researchers
or even you know the general public read
something in a privacy policy that is
alarming to them that has a way of
trickling upward to companies and a lot
of the stories that we read about that
are like what is this company doing that
usually is first reveal that through
some sort of public statement they made
oftentimes in their privacy policy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
