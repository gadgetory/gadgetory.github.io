here with the brand-new Nokia Lumia 800
Windows Phone smartphone it's very much
like the Nokia n9 as you know before the
MIGO Hamilton device but there's a
couple differences he have a physical
camera key and around the back the the
LED flash is repositioned still Carl
Zeiss lens still the great optics that
Nucky's very proud of and happy with it
looks to be about the same thickness
about the same size still three point
nine inch ClearBlack AMOLED display
loudspeaker down here at the bottom
nothing on the left side and exactly the
same port on the top is your micro USB
three-and-a-half millimeter headphone
jack and a SIM card slot over here
we should actually check some micro SIM
card slot on the n9 and so micro SIM
card slot over here as well on this new
Lumia 800 okay so we're here in the
Windows Phone 7.5 interface a couple of
the nokia specific applications that
have been added things like Nokia Drive
over here there's no key music and Nokia
have just announced an exclusive with an
ESPN sports tracking application
evidently it's not on this particular
phone that we're looking at here but it
will be exclusive for Nokia on Windows
Phone I mean the way that Stephen Elop
described this is that the Lumia 800 is
the first Windows Phone so let's take a
look and like a drive I think this is
driving navigations to turn-by-turn
navigation this is something that we
harness the Nokia Maps application which
is going to be integrated into Bing in
the whole Windows Phone experience so
while this is still loading we can
actually take a look at this set side by
side with the n9 the mega device it is
basically the exact same chassis
physically looking at the front and the
side exact same buttons apart from that
camera key and then you Lumia 800
come around to the back you can see the
Geo LED flash has been shifted from the
side to the top here and this is a
navigation here we're not gonna risk a
because it's a bunch of connectivity
issues here at the event but what can I
should do is set this also side by side
were a couple of other devices we've got
an HTC Titan which is the biggest
Windows Phone device around this can
give you sort of an idea for
the dimensions of the new leave me 800 I
mean in terms of responsiveness it's
typical Windows Phone performance it's a
very quick and snappy actually go into
the camera application and take a look
you can launch that with the physical
key there
it's exactly the standard windows phone
camera application
except to focus and shoot
speed is pretty much on par with all our
windows phones I mean you couldn't
expect anything different this is
Windows Phone 4 improve so performance
will be exactly as you would get with
other devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
