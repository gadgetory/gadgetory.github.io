with joint displays for years.
If you've ever seen an
older future vision videos
that they've produced, you
would have seen joint displays
hanging on walls, with
people interacting with them,
collaboration, that kind of stuff.
Well, the future has
well and truly arrived.
This is Surface Hub 2.
At first, this looks like
a beautifully designed TV
on wheels but it's what's
inside and out that counts
and it kind of puts this beyond
what a TV does right now and
even the conference room TVs
that you might use at your workplace.
So let's start with the hardware.
Compared to the original 55 inch model,
Microsoft has now opted
for a 50 inch display
with a three by two aspect ratio
instead of the 16 by nine before.
This display runs at greater
than four K resolution,
thanks to the aspect ratio.
And it has integrated speakers
and 20 15.5 millimeter bezels.
The whole unit is 60% thinner than before
and Microsoft is using (mumbles)
glass with a matte finish
to bring down some of that
glare that you might get
off the usual TV that's
in a conference room.
You'll notice this display
is mounted on a stand
which Microsoft has
developed with Steelcase.
It allows the display to be
moved around room to room
and they've also carefully
designed the four K camera
on the top so that if you move it around,
you smash it into the wall, it
snaps back so that it doesn't
completely crash off of
the top of the device.
There's even an optional
battery that you can slot in
to the base of the stand that'll give you
around about two hours on battery life.
So let's dig in to exactly what you can do
with all this hardware.
Like the Surface Hub before,
this display runs Windows 10 Team.
It's designed to run Microsoft's
universal Windows apps
and that means apps like Word,
Whiteboard, Microsoft Teams
and many others will
run just fine on here.
Microsoft has done some special
work on the screen bonding
to make the pen experience
a little better.
And it will instantly pair as
soon as you touch the display.
You can even snap it to
the side of the display
just like a Surface Pro.
Because of the combination
of touch, stylus input
and the three by two
aspect ratio, you can get
some pretty interesting
software experiences here.
The idea is to increases
collaboration for meeting rooms
or to allow workers to
wheel this to locations
where meetings might
not typically be held.
Microsoft is shipping this right now
with its regular sort of
modified version of Windows 10.
But next year, it plans to
release a processor cartridge
that you'll just simply slide
into the back of the device.
This processor cartridge has the CPU,
RAM and the GPU inside.
Next year's particular
cartridge for the upgrade
will include a more powerful GPU at least.
That cartridge will also enable
some of the more interesting
software experiences that
Microsoft isn't enabling just yet.
One of those big ones
is the screen rotation.
We've seen that before and
there's also the ability
to tile up to four of these side by side.
For businesses that want
something a little bit bigger,
Microsoft is even announcing
an 85 inch version
of the Surface Hub 2 and
a 16 by nine aspect ratio.
But the company isn't showing
that new model just yet.
Businesses in the US will be able
to start placing orders today
and those will be fulfilled
and delivered in June this year.
Pricing for the 50 inch
model starts at $9,000.
Microsoft is also gonna send it
as a monitor for slightly less.
And a stand is sold separately for 1449.
The battery pack I mentioned earlier on
is around about $1400 as well.
Microsoft hasn't announced
its 2S processor cartridge
pricing just yet.
When you add that all up, it's
a staggering nearly $12,000
for this device if you want everything.
This future certainly doesn't come cheap.
That was a quick look
at the Surface Hub 2.
