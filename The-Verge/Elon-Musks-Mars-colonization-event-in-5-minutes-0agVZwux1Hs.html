make Mars seem possible they're really
two fundamental paths one path is we
stay on earth forever and then there
will be some eventual extinction event
what the alternative is to become a
spacefaring civilization and a
multi-planet species why Mars that
they're actually fed they're remarkably
closed in a lot of ways in fact we not
believe that that early Mars was a lot
like Earth so we just need to change
that bottom row because currently we
have seven billion people on earth and
zero on Mars the issue that we have
today is that there's no intersection of
sets of people who want to go and can't
afford to go an optimistic cost number
would be about 10 billion dollars a
person and if we get a cut the cost of
moving to Mars do roughly equivalent to
a median house price in in the US which
is around $200,000 then I think the
probability of establishing a
self-sustaining civilization is very
high so it is a bit tricky
we have forgot how to improve the cost
of trips to Mars by five million percent
these are the key elements that are
needed in order to achieve the four and
a half order of magnitude improvement
with frequent flights you can take
something like an aircraft that costs
ninety million dollars if it were
single-use you'd have to pay half a
million dollars to the flight so if
taking the right propellant is also
important I think this is maybe this
does three main choices that methane
actually was the clear winner and this
is this is simulation though the old
rules
this is to give you a sense of size
so they at least 100 people per trip is
is the right order of magnitude and I
think we actually may end up expanding
the the crew section and and ultimately
taking more like 200 or more people per
flight in order to reduce the cost per
person so it's probably somewhere
between there maybe 40 to 100 years to
achieve a fully self-sustaining
civilization on large it's made
primarily of an advanced carbon fiber
and bikes that this is all designed slip
you could actually lose multiple engines
even at liftoff or anywhere flights and
continue the mission safely the trip
time at six kilometres per second
departure velocity can be as low as 80
days
also the I suspect that you'd see Mars
transit times of as well as 30 days in
the more distant future I mean in order
to make it appealing and increase that
portion of the Venn diagram where people
actually want to go it's got to be
really fun and exciting the crew the
crew compartment or the Aqua compartment
is set up so that you can do zero-g
games you can foot around they'll be
like movies lecture polls your cabins a
restaurant
it'll be like really fun to go you can
have a great time really the key is is
making this affordable to almost anyone
who wants to go the architecture allows
full a cost per ticket of less than
$200,000 maybe as less maybe as little
as one hundred thousand dollars cutting
upon how much mass a person takes or
so then what about beyond Moz so there's
this absolute the rocket booster the
spaceship the tanker and
the propelled plants if you have all of
those four elements you can actually go
anywhere in the solar system by but by
planet hopping or Moon hopping but but
by establishing propellant deeper if
this system really gives gives you
freedom to go anywhere you want in the
greater solar system this is to give you
a sense of size
it's quite big</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
