the Geneva Motor Show 2016 this is
Jordan with a verge I am a hyper car
reporter he's a transportation reporter
and we are in we are in the Volvo xc90
excellence Edition which replaces the
third row and the second row with these
very comfortable seats and this nice
wine glass setup here so we have three
questions that we're going to answer
about the Motor Show all right you first
glad what's your favorite car of the
show third carbon show has to be the
Aston Martin TV 11 it is the
quintessential car that looks better in
person than doesn't photos I've seen
impressed photos I've seen in person and
our entire team video producers included
and they have really good taste love it
they think it's the best car I'm gonna
go back on my answer from Esther and I'm
actually gonna change to the Bugatti I
think it's the pinnacle of engineering
it's gonna be the fastest car in the
world and it's bright blue I think
that's the car of the year well as a fan
of red I can't agree with you and also
the Bugattis for me is just it's too
wide it's too big it's bigger than the
Veyron that in replaces the Bugatti
Veyron and it just it's too extreme for
me I prefer a more compact sports car
what's our second question our second
question is what car would you most want
to own yourself that's an easy one and
I'm categorical about this the red
Lamborghini Huracan it is on show here
at Lamborghini stand and we're gonna
introduce the chain scenario which is
the same thing as the bugatti chiron
it's super-exclusive only 40 are being
produced they've already been sold seven
hundred and seventy horsepower it's a
ridiculous piece of a machine and it's
too ridiculous for me the hurricane is
perfect I was talking to one of the
Lamborghini Lamborghini excuse me
representatives here saying that you can
drive it like a Volkswagen like a go I
don't think it wanted to quoted about
that but there you go the thing is it's
gorgeous it's a Ferrari red Lamborghini
so to me it's the perfect combination of
color and
I'm gonna say this car that we're
sitting in right here I drove the xc90
last year it's comfortable it's
practical the seats are the best ones
you're gonna get short of a rolls-royce
I agree there and it's it's just
fantastic of all the cars that I've
driven in the past year and I've driven
a lot of them this one was my favorite
I'd take it off question number three
what car would you get in the most
trouble and I am going to use this
question to bring in the Morgan TV for
you because I it's kind of a cheat but I
love that car it's crazy it's retro it's
your turistic it's kind of like a space
racer pod but also how do you even drive
that thing you you got to see in person
it's it's interesting it's got a
steering wheel but it's a three-wheeled
car it's designed for oversteer and fun
and craziness and you can have a lot of
fun with it for 50 miles and you can
head into a little trouble with it you
could I think you would go up to the
club and you know who knows who's gonna
be attractive that car I was thinking
more about actually rolling over and
getting in so it actually dying
yeah well that could be better well you
wear a helmet I'm gonna say the Rolls
Royce great black badge just announced
all blacked out it's it's such a crazy
car it's not me but I think I would be
going out late at night and going up to
the club and do things that I'm gonna do
and things that are not me and that car
would just have a bad influence on me
maybe in a good way maybe not my wife's
not here so it's okay and that's all
from us here at the Geneva Motor Show in
a couple weeks you can catch us to the
New York Auto Show it's hard to believe
it's only March but we've already seen
so much already any final thoughts Vlad
nothing to say check us out at
youtube.com slash The Verge and the
birds will come for all of our Geneva
