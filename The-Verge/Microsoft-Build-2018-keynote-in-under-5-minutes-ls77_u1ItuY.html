welcome to day two and now I'm very
excited to announce that we will be
bringing hime line to your iPhone and
your Android devices as well thank you
and making the PC the perfect second
screen to your phone so you saw some of
this yesterday I'm thrilled to announce
that coming in a future release of
Windows we will be shipping an inbox app
that will allow you to get some of the
key workloads off your phone right onto
your PC you can launch it from the
taskbar launching it will give you
access it's a permanent destination for
your photos for your texts for your
notifications and many other key
workloads over time from your phone
right there on on your PC and so today
I'm gonna walk you through sets so as
you'll see here we're gonna start in a
Word document we're here I am someone
putting together a rainfall report and
of course one of the first things that
I'm gonna see is a web link that might
be in my document or it might be
research that I'm doing and what starts
to happen as I get going is more and
more things will open up
okay the next insider build you get will
take web content and put your recent web
tabs right at your fingertips and
alt-tab so you get this automatic muscle
memory feeling of switching back to the
last thing regardless of whether it's
web or app and yes I thank you I can see
some of you clapping for that in
Microsoft Word we have a goal to make
every person a better writer and one way
we do this is with grammar checking
however some errors are very very hard
to detect with traditional algorithms
for example in English you get into a
car but on to a train we've trained the
grammar checker and it now can suggest
corrections that I can take action on
and fix we're running this on Windows ml
it's the little things that matter the
most right like how in notepad the Linux
live feeds don't actually end
well we fixed notepads we decided
finally time to go fix it notepad now
supports Linux line feeds of course we
continue to invest in the Microsoft
Store we're building new ways for
consumer developers to track the use of
their apps to deploy their apps and one
thing that we're excited to announce at
Build this year isn't change in the
revenue model within the store for
consumer apps so if you're somebody who
writes consumer apps not games not
commercial apps you'll care about the
fact that going forward later this year
will increase the revenue share to 85%
of the revenue going to you if someone
comes to the Microsoft Store finds your
app and installs it but even better if
you're running your own campaigns or
promoting your app on your website if
you send a customer to the Microsoft
Store and they find your app will return
95 percent of the revenue to you making
this the most developer friendly store
from an economic point of view of all
the large ecosystems today I'm here to
show you how by building adaptive cards
you can engage with your users in your
apps right in the flow of their daily
conversations
adaptive cards are an open source card
exchange format that allow you to embed
your content inside of other
applications I'm thrilled to announce
that starting today you can pay off
bills and invoices directly in Outlook
using adaptive cards this integrates
with Microsoft pay which means that I
can access all the payment methods that
I already have securely stored in the
cloud to streamline the payment process
for developers Microsoft graph is
accessible through one single unified
REST API endpoint graph but Microsoft
comm you can connect to Microsoft graph
to power your own app experiences by
doing so your app will be able to
sign-in users seamlessly with the same
identity that is used by windows and
office
and you will be able to use the same
business data that Microsoft 365 apps
use to make it even further I'm happy to
announce that we're making the new graph
uwp controls available today thank you
so much for coming and spending time
with us today enjoy the rest of the
conference have a great build we
appreciate everything you do so on
Microsoft
