at the verge lounge I'm Jordan Golson
and i'm here with corey read from John
Deere they make big green tractors he's
the senior vice president of the
intelligent solutions group which is a
very agust title thanks for joining us
hey Jordan good to be here preciate it
Corey so most people think about giant
agricultural tractors they probably
think of you know guys sitting up there
with their Sun hats on just driving
around the field but all spit over
exactly the whole thing you know Wizard
of Oz something out in the Dust Bowl but
actually the modern tractor is nothing
like that so when he tell us a little
bit about about autonomous tractors yeah
incredible in fact the technology in the
last 20 years has come a long way if you
make that trip from Detroit to Miami
down i-75 on either side of the road
you'll see a lot of green tractors
running through the field many of them
will have an operator in them but most
of them are running on their own they're
using dual correction GPS technology
modems Wi-Fi modems that are in the cabs
that communicate between the vehicles
and they'll guide themselves within an
inch of accuracy we do that in over 100
countries today at John Deere and you've
been doing it for a long time we're just
now getting to the very beginnings of
autonomous cars but you guys been doing
it for 10 years 15 more than 15 in fact
we started investing in the technology
over 20 years ago 15 years ago around
2000 is when our first autonomous
vehicles and vehicles that guided
themselves through the fields hit the
market and we've got over 200,000
vehicles in those hundred countries
around the world that are driving
themselves producing the food that feeds
the world that's incredible so what's
what's the advantage to want to say
putting the the poor farmer out of
business because he's still got a got to
be helping out but so what's the
advantage of the tractor driving itself
well actually it's it's not put them out
of business it's helping them be more
productive if if you start from the fact
that a lot of farming is very manual
very intensive and the age of our
farmers continues to grow it's a tool
that helps them gain productivity gain
efficiency reduce the amount of overlap
they have in the
field and overall produce more crop with
less dollars so our largest machines
would be a hundred and twenty feet wide
48 rows at a time that they put into the
ground they can cover four to five
hundred acres a day and incredible
productivity but the same technology
applies to all sizes so we started in
this space by building retrofit herbal
technology to cover the entire fleet no
matter what size or age of vehicle you
put into the field so whether it's a
small mom-and-pop farm or at a giant
agribusiness with thousands and tens of
thousands of acres they can still take
advantage yeah my dad's a traditional
farmer he's 74 years old in Northwest
Ohio he uses these technologies so do
the largest commercial producers in the
country and in the world for that matter
one of the big themes here at CES has
been connected cities and connected cars
and connected refrigerators and you guys
have connected tractors to right there
talking to the cloud and learning about
what's going on and how to improve
absolutely so our vehicles and the
systems that we use our combination of
embedded technology that that technology
that sits in the vehicle mobile
technologies that people carry in and
out of the cab and then we also have a
full suite of cloud-based services so
those vehicles are networked together
they both guide themselves but they
communicate back and forth across
various vehicles they also communicate
and deliver the data about what's
happening in the field in real time back
to an operation center that every
producer can log on and see from
wherever they are in the world in real
time thanks for joining us Cory thanks
for telling us everything about John
Deere I appreciate it great Jordan great
to be here and come out to the farm
sometime absolutely and thanks for
joining us here at the verge lounge at
CES will have much more from the show
floor over the rest of the week</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
