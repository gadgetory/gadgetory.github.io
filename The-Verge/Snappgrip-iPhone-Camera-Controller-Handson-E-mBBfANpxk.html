and I'm here at CES with snap grip which
is a new camera accessory for the iPhone
4 and 5 it's currently in prototype mode
so it's a little bit janky but the
concept is very cool basically what you
do is you simply attach this device to
your iPhone case which is customized and
what it does it uses Bluetooth to
basically talk with the iPhones camera
app what it allows you to do then is
essentially take photos with one hand
simply you can autofocus by pressing
down as you would a normal
point-and-shoot you can zoom in and out
with the buttons here on the top and
there are several presets shooting modes
so basically what it does is turn your
iPhone into a standard point-and-shoot
camera and this is actually a product
that began as a Kickstarter campaign
launched about a week ago and it's
already reached about 80% of its funding
goal with about 25 days left we're told
that a further ideations of it will be
made for the galaxy s3 and that by the
time it hits the market it should retail
for between 69 and 99 dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
