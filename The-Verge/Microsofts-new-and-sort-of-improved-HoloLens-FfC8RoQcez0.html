microsoft hololens for about three
months now it's supposed to be amazing
it's Holograms they're real right in
front of you and now I've finally gotten
to see it and it's really great except
when it is really terrible they still
won't let us take pictures or video
using a hololens but it actually does
look like something that's semi finished
it's completely self-contained you can
put it on and adjust it and it feels
about as finished as something like
project Morpheus when you manage to look
through it and you're looking through it
at the right angle it looks amazing you
aren't seeing pixels or seeing photons
it seems like there's actually like the
world's best projector and it's showing
you something on the floor and it's
amazingly aware of what's actually
around there if you have an origami ball
then you can watch it bounce off the
table and it'll roll around on the floor
and it will hit a couch and bounce off
that and it's just really incredible
what it can pick up it's still not
really clear how people are going to
interact with it as soon as you want to
start getting close to it or start
actually moving it you're stuck doing
this the air tap again or talking to it
and it can recognize these gestures well
it can recognize voice
well but that's not really how we want
to be interacting with something and
you're not even able to get that close
to it because the camera your head
camera will start to click through it
which brings me to my biggest problem
which is that you can never actually
believe that this is there the field of
view which is where you can actually see
objects it looks kind of like a box in
front of you and if you have a small
object there then it looks amazing it
looks like it is absolutely there but
the moment you try to actually look
around something that's you know a table
or a big notepad and then it starts
disappearing and clipping off and it's
like you have all these invisible walls
around you and so it means that you can
never really feel like something is
actually in this space it just feels
like you've got a screen and it's the
best screen in the world and the problem
is that all of the demo videos Accola
when are these incredible vistas of
people looking around and Mars or seeing
Minecraft expand out around them
and that solves basically a lie all of
these things they can be around you but
you have to look straight at them to
know that they're there you just have to
kind of take it on faith and if you
can't see this if you can't believe in
this then what are you using this for
right now the lowlands is an augmenting
reality it's augmenting a little
fraction of reality which is still
amazing in a lot of ways but Microsoft
has promised a science fiction and this
isn't science fiction yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
