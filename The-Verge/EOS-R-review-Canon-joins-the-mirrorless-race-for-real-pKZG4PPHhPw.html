San Francisco and I'm more of an a7s or
35-millimeter type of shooter whole
summer type of shooter who brings way
too much gear to every shoot
whether you believe that mirrorless
cameras are the only cameras we're going
to be using in the future it's clear
that the competition in the mirrorless
world is heating up it's been sony to
game for years but now Canon has decide
to play would you us are without a
mirror system to reflect your frame up
to the eyepiece merliss cameras can be
more compact and faster and the
electronic viewfinder can show you
exactly what your shots gonna look like
before you even come close to hitting
the shutter Canon has put out an airless
cameras before with the M line that has
a smaller aps-c sensor but EOS R has a
full-frame 30 megapixel CMOS sensor and
some pretty flashy R f-mount lenses to
go with it flashy but a bit limited with
two primes and two zooms but can it did
get a little creative with these all of
these lenses have a control ring on it
it can be customized to settings such as
ISO shutter speed aperture and more but
instead of having image stabilization
integrated right into the camera body
such as Sony does they decided to put it
into the lenses that means it depends on
which lens you're using whether or not
it's stabilized and the majority of
existing lenses are not body wise it's
pretty similar to most Canon cameras and
even keeps the same batteries that a lot
of Canon DSLRs have it has very similar
button layouts and a familiar menu
system but what they've added is this
multifunction bar you can't push the
button in but you can set it to do many
different functions it has a moveable
touch screen that can flip around for
vlogging with a touch and drag autofocus
system as well but in order to actually
test this thing we should go out there
and shoot blair's what do you got I hear
you've been hating the subway lately so
I want to rekindle your love why don't
you test the video quality in the depths
of a New York City subway system I'm
really interested in this third ring on
the lenses I want to know if it's gonna
make you faster shooter if it's just
easier why don't you hide you like the
skatepark and test those things out
hey V so what's the vibe let's
autofocus first
yeah let's dive in so I think it's one
of the best ones I ever used it's super
fast
it was very reliable and accurate even
in low light and it's very customizable
maybe too customizable yeah that is an
interesting thing about this camera is
that it's so familiar button wise and
menu wise but then extremely different
in such minut ways that it really can
throw you off yeah I want to grab that I
was like oh I know exactly what this is
cuz I've been shooting Canon most of my
life but once they actually like try to
do things that you're comfortable with
you realize that a lot of things
actually change then you need to adjust
a bit I think another way that it's it's
like super different in minut way is
like this whole extra ring on the lens I
quickly got really used to it and was
loving it I also love it I think it's
like one of the best things that came
out in photography in general it's
already under lens it's not too far on
the lens so you don't have to like
adjust your hand alright since you did
more video I'm curious did you rely on
the electric viewfinder or were you
using the flip out screen I'm a huge fan
of being like really immersed in my
camera I don't really love it when other
people are seeing what I'm getting so I
was all up in the EVF but there was some
times where I popped out that screen and
its movement it's so familiar to the
c100 mark to that I felt right at home
the thing I will be nitpicky about is
the 4k crop and I know that you can like
you know plug it into an external
recorder and you know get the full 10
bit 4k output but like I shouldn't have
to do that if I'm paying $2,300 for a
body that's right also the body that
doesn't have image stabilization built
into it so this video I shot
okay crop and I was holding in front of
me doing like the selfie cam kind of
look you can almost see the rolling
shutter in your defense like the lenses
that we got are massive the balance
between the body weight and the lens
swayed it's just all over the place I
can see your hand also just getting
tired after a while so the 5d Mark 4 and
the r have like super similar sensors I
mean the ARS updated just a tad but did
you notice a difference and image
quality at all yeah the image quality is
similar to what you would get to 5d mark
4 which is a good thing because those
photos are just great I mean this camera
is more about like getting used to the
buttons and getting used to the redesign
that Canada's introducing in the
mirrorless line okay so would you put
this camera in your kit I I think I
would for canons first true full-frame
mirrorless camera it's a pretty good
camera the body smaller it fits you know
everywhere it still feels good besides
you can also use your old lenses on it
which is a big plus yeah I guess might
hold up here and why I don't think I
would get this version canons video
definitely has drawbacks I mean only
being able to shoot 120 in HD and not
Full HD or especially not 4k is is
limiting and then when you look at the
a7 s mark one that came out in 2014 like
so much has changed in a short amount of
years and so I had this problem with
buying the first version of any camera
and I think the most important thing
here is that we're seeing a blueprint of
what Canon is going to do with the mayor
less line hey thanks so much for joining
us this is kind of a new camera review
sort of thing we're doing basically V
and I just want to shoot more together
but let us know if you liked it
also if you want us to review something
else let us know in the comments</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
