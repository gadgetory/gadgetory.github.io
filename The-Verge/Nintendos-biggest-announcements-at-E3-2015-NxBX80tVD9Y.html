Nintendo digital event for e3 2015 come
on Fox to belleville yeah viral I can't
it doesn't that check this out in the
other starfox games you play by
controlling your plane and third person
on one screen this time the game world
is shown on the TV and you can focus in
to aim on the game path by using two
screens you can see yourself flying in
third person on the TV while shooting
down at the enemies below you from the
cockpit view on the gamepad the are we
transforming into a walker that was in
star fox too but since that game didn't
make it out I'm glad we were able to
have it appear later this year Super
Mario maker will take the next step by
turning the essence of game creation
over to you our fans now players will
become creators as you build your own
Mario levels that can be shared globally
with friends the first time we're
bringing a whole new toy cat away this
year with our new game Skylanders
superchargers we've got two unexpected
guest stars turbocharged Donkey Kong we
also have Bowser's this is hammer slam
Bowser the legend of zelda triforce
heroes the latest Nintendo 3ds Zelda
game this time I wanted players to
cooperatively enjoy more serious Legend
of Zelda gameplay elements like solving
puzzles and going through dungeons we
came up with the totem McCann
co-op was fully realized with the totem
mechanic also for Nintendo 3ds we have
another new game last year we had the
wii u version of hyrule warriors we're
now developing a 3ds version we are also
adding additional characters and stages
from the legend of zelda the windwaker
to expand the gameplay
you
in
I was in charge of designing Yoshi's
woolly world the world itself is in yarn
and fabrics and lots of textiles we have
places in the game where you can unravel
and you can also mix platforms and in
this game the enemies are made of yarn
as well so when she swallows them they
turn into little yarn balls
thank you for watching in tempo Dexter
