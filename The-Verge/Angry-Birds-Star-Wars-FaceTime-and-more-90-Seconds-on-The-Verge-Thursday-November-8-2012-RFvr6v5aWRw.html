paul miller and i'm wearing a winter
coat because baby it's cold outside and
they'll go outside because it's cold
because UK out with me and you're
watching 90 seconds on the verge Angry
Birds Star Wars is now available which
is basically exactly like Angry Birds
but its star wars so there's the force
there are lightsabers and there is a
death star which is known as a big star
in Angry Birds parlance it's available
now on every platform that you've ever
conceived of suffer black bear you can
now pay with square at seven thousand
starbucks nationwide it's so easy
anybody can do it you just pull out your
phone and they scan the QR code and then
you get a Frappuccino the only problem
is you can't tip yet using the app so
you have to wait until 2013 or carry
cash and love your bark bark for justice
on a more somber note today ATT
continued to be eighteen t 18t pissed a
lot of people off a few months ago when
they announced that you could use
facetime over LTE if you got to share
everything plan which cost some extra
money consumer advocacy groups threaten
to sue so AT&amp;amp;T has now agreed to allow
facetime streaming over LTE but not the
other things that calls for g like hspa+
so we still have a little way to go
that's it for today's top stories tune
in tomorrow where I will start wearing a
mitten and a hat</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
