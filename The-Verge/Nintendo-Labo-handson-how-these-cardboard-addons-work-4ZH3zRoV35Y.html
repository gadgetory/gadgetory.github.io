try out Nintendo labo today a DIY
cardboard cake made specially for
Nintendo switch I got to try out a
variety of minigames like fishing
playing with the keyboard and something
around as a giant robot since that's all
made of cardboard it seems really simple
but there's actually a lot of really
interesting text behind it all but
before we get into all that we have to
start by actually building four projects
oh wait I would say this sheet of
cardboard is actually a a little bit
thicker than your regular like cereal
box cardboard definitely not as thick as
Amazon packaging cardboard but I'm being
as gentle and delicate as I can
a little bit like doing origami but the
the cardboard is a lot stiffer than
regular paper you're just making me
realize just how it's like spatially
challenged I am oh I think we messed up
but it's okay because you can go
forwards and backwards on the app and it
tells you just exactly where you screwed
up you never used the IKEA AR app it's
really helpful to see things in 3d
instead of like a flat 2d space so we're
just finished building the RC car and
each kit actually comes with two of them
one is blank so you can customize it
however you want you can control it with
the switch here pressing the right red
controller will make it vibrate and move
does the same thing for the blue
controller if you want to make it go one
direction you can press both of them at
the same time so this part is really
interesting there's actually a camera in
one of the controllers here and you can
see through the camera on the app it
almost kind of looks like night vision
here even make it look at me and another
super cool thing is if you just tap it
one more time it turns into a heat
sensing camera and actually if you put
it on the auto mode it can follow you
around according to the source of heat
here if I put my hand in front of it it
follows the source of heat it was
actually the IR camera on the controller
and beyond seeing your own body heat it
works with these little reflective IR
stickers that pick up on the camera
really easily and here's where the lava
gets really interesting by arranging
them in a certain way you're basically
creating a code for the camera to
receive sure you expect a normal tilt
based controller like this motorcycle
where you turn the controller to drive
an engine or the robot visor we're
tilting my head controls the direction I
walk but something like the keyboard
each of the keys have a sticker on the
back which the camera at the end of the
piano
picks up to see which note is being
played there's also IR stickers on the
little knobs you can plug in and dial to
change the pitch of the south
so the robot can't all these strings are
attached to weights that pull the IR
stickers up and down when you throw
punch the controller in the back can see
the stickers move which controls the
robot so the IR camera and the
controller really wasn't utilized that
much before the lavvo basically it can
detect an object in the 3d space so it's
really only used for a handful of games
like the eating contest game on once you
switch what's really cool about labo is
just how it opens up a world of
possibilities like there's so much
potential for 3d printing communities or
like the DIY dubious online to come
together and share what they know just
really make it their own and in keeping
with this style Nintendo actually
introduced toy con garage which lets do
reprogram the toy cons you have and
remix their features and map different
buttons to different actions like for
example if you press the button on the
blue controller it can make the right
controller vibrate so right now there's
two different kits you can buy there's a
robot kit which is $79 lets you stuff
around as a giant robot and there's also
the variety kit which is $69 seems like
about our value because there's five
troy cons you can make and with the toy
con garage you can actually remix and
play with it all again at the end of the
day nintendo isn't just selling a
cardboard kit it's selling a platform
there's so much you can do with the
technology they're offering no matter
which can't you decide to go with I
think you're gonna love it all I mean
for the first year of the swish it's
already doing super amazing developers
are flocking to the console so I'm
really looking forward to seeing what
other things are gonna add to it you can
tell air had to move directions walk up
to a building
I'm just smash the hell out of it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
