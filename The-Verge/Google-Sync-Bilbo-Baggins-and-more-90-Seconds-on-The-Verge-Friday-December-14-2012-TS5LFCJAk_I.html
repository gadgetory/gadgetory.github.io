hamburger this is 90 seconds on the
bridge part 1 of Peter Jackson's Hobbit
trilogy is now in theaters the first
film subtitled an unexpected journey has
so far received mixed reviews critics
generally agreed if a movie is gorgeous
and the performance is strong but the
length and overall pacing seem to hurt
the story The Hobbit is the first major
film to be shown in theaters at 48
frames per second at least for some
theaters and the reaction is fully mixed
our own brian bishop likened it to
watching a live-action video game still
we're pretty excited to watch it in fact
there's actually a pretty good chance
I'm in the theater right now Google is
dropping support for exchange activesync
for gmail contacts and calendars this
means there's no longer one way to
connect your iPhone to all Google
services the company will continue to
support imap for email caldav for
calendars and carddav for contacts but
Google would probably prefer you just
use its own gmail app existing users can
continue to use google sync for the
known future but new signups close on
january thirtieth finally the US has
blocked a United Nations treaty over
fear of internet regulation move isn't
surprising an ambassador said the US was
fighting to maintain a quote open
Internet joined by 20 other countries
and refusing to sign the treaty
including Canada and the United Kingdom
the world conference on international
telecommunications wraps up today
there's very clearly still no consensus
on who should control the world wide web
and that's it for today's tech stories
tune in tomorrow and take care of this
weekend</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
