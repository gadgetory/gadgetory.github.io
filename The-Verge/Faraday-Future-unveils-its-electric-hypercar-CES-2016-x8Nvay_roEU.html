this evening tonight I'd like to give
you a sense of how far a future is
completely reimagining one of the most
important aspects of our lives
a Faraday future we're looking at the
future of mobility let me tell you about
an update of where we are today Faraday
future was founded just 18 months ago
and in that short year-and-a-half
we already have a staggering 750
employees globally we'll be breaking
ground on our 3 million square foot
Factory in just a few weeks yes just a
few weeks time and we will deliver our
first production vehicle in only a
couple of years time we've created a new
and more advanced platform we've called
it the variable platform architecture or
vpa for short with vpa we can add or
subtract strings of batteries based on
those Power Cells we can create
different models that have a different
have our desired range without having to
redesign the entire structure and this
is really important in terms of time
cost efficiency
please meet faraday futures ff01 concept
we started with an all-white interior
appear an extremely clean aesthetic that
wouldn't be practical in a traditional
internal combustion racecar the driver
is placed at a 45 degree angle located
in the spine of the headrest is there a
halo safe safety system which integrates
a head and neck support connection as
well as an oxygen supply and water
supply through a port of our prototype
helmet that we also develop in-house
we're taking the innovative intuitive
movements of digital devices and
applying them to the interior of the
vehicle incorporating swipes pinches and
touches augmented reality is projected
on the road as your digital copilot the
vpa combined with these materials gave
us the flexibility to push the seating
position all the way forward which gives
us a perfect teardrop aerodynamic
profile these Aero tunnels channel air
directly through the vehicle this year
yields several performance benefits like
reducing drag battery heat and power
consumption the FF we believe with every
bone in our body but the world is ready
for new way of looking at mobility you
don't need to have a hundred year legacy
in the automotive industry to define
what the next generation of
transportation needs to look and feel
like Apple didn't just redefine the
phone it transformed the way that we
communicate organize and enjoy our lives
and that is what we are today and future
are looking to do we're looking to the
future seeking opportunities and working
to bring them to life to help redefine
the world of mobility</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
