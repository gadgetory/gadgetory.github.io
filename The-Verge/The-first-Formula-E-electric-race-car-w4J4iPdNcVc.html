Joshi with the verge here at
CES 2014 and we just got to see the
first formerly e all-electric racing car
come to September the open-wheel car is
sponsored by Qualcomm the car is
completely electrical power and it has
up to 20 minutes of battery life
promoters say that the cars in the
series of able to reach close to 150
miles per hour it's not quite Formula
One speeds they can get up to close to
200 these cars will have no fuel of
course and lucas de Grassi the driver
who used to drive a Formula One he says
that the acceleration is simply
breathtaking and the throttle response
is unbelievable because it's electric
vehicle it's not a combustion motor the
rumors behind formally II hope that this
series will help change perceptions of
electric vehicles hopefully no longer
there would be slow and expensive cars
that don't have much range they're
hoping to show that these cars can
compete with some of the greatest racing
vehicles around they're particularly
focused on young race fans they're doing
this new thing where they'll be offering
fans to vote online for their racers and
during the race that I should be able to
give a boost somehow to the vehicles
using communication technologies it's
not clear how significant this will be
but they are saying this is the first
time that fans were able to directly
interact with the race itself series
promoters have considered adding
artificial sound while they're driving
down pit road to ensure safety there a
number of teams on board including
Richard Branson's Virgin as well as
Leonardo DiCaprio's backing another team
the car that we saw today is a spark
renault that was made in conjunction
with great racing couples like Williams
McLaren and Michelin which you'll know
well if you're familiar with four mil
why not the racing series the first
point of the race is set to begin this
September in Beijing and there will be a
number of races going throughout the
rest of 2014 and 2015 will definitely
hear a lot more about formally in the
coming months as it looks to become the
premier electric racing series
