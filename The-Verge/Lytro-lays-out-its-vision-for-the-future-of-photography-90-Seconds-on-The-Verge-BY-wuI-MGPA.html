out-of-focus photos i'm nathan sie kurt
and this is ninety seconds on the verge
this is the lighter Illume even think of
it as the professional version of its
original point-and-shoot that first
shipped in 2012 a light-filled camera
with a more traditional looking body and
a larger more powerful sensor it's
available for pre-order now at the
professional level price of one thousand
five hundred ninety nine dollars but
let's take a step back
what exactly is light field photography
anyway it's not a camera on the
conventional sense when you push a
button that doesn't imprint reflected
light on a sensor the way a camera does
light row instead records the direction
each ray of light is moving the
practical result is an image that you
can refocus after the fact
Electro's mantra has long been that the
magic can be done in software and sure
enough it's no longer the only company
trying this approach out last november
nokia released its refocus app for all
PureView Lumia devices in both Samsung's
Galaxy s5 in the new HTC One also touted
Lytro like refocusing effects even
Google has gone so far as to include
refocusing in its new standalone camera
app but all those phones and apps are
still using traditional photographic
methods light Rose pitches to capture
everything at once light draws a great
vision for the future of photography but
can't convince people to invest in the
future now the Illume will be available
in mid-july for more on light show check
out the Virg coming up Polaroid
announces the relationship camera that
helps refocus the conversation after
you've dug yourself into a hole you just
can't seem to get out of what I was
trying to say is that the dress just
isn't my favorite one you own I like it
it's just you have better ones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
