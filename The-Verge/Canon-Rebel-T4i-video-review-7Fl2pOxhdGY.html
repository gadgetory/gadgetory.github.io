and this is the Canon t4i the latest
camera in canons prosumer line you may
notice it looks a lot like the t3i from
last year and it actually shares the
same 18 megapixel aps-c sensor as the
t2i of the year before that if you took
pictures with all three cameras at the
exact same place time with the exam
settings you'd get very similar images
the difference is the t4i figures out
more of those settings for you and gives
you more and simpler controls externally
it looks the same but the buttons stick
out further making them easier to find
by touch the power switch now has a
third position to switch you directly
into movie mode without having to turn
the mode dial all the way around and
most importantly the 3-inch 1.04 million
dot articulating screen that pivots 270
degrees up and 90 degrees down it's now
a touchscreen and lets you control every
part of the camera that might not sound
like much of an advantage if you're a
fan of physical controls but it can
actually be quite a help for one thing
if you put the touchscreen in one hand
and the physical controls in the other
you can navigate to settings faster than
with either alone for another in Live
View mode you can tap directly on a spot
to autofocus there or even touch a
particular subject in the viewfinder to
take a picture as soon as they come into
focus canons done a pretty good job with
the touch screen gestures you can not
only tap but swipe through controls
quickly and zoom in on photos with
pinch-to-zoom but the best part about
using the touch screen is that it
doesn't make a sound when you're in
movie mode with the t4i
canons added stereo microphones audio
leveling and most importantly continuous
autofocus during video recording if
you're a serious filmmaker you're
probably going to want to stick to
manual focus
but for home movies and the like it's
not that at all we found that it did
detect objects in front of us fairly
easily and switched between focus points
although for things that were further
away it had trouble locking onto
anything at all it's also not
particularly quick to phone
even with the new STM lenses the company
rolled out they do smoke as smoothly and
silently but quickly not so much images
come out crisp bright and clear exactly
as you'd expect from a DSLR of this
class but not much more
for instance images in low-light aren't
necessarily any less noisy than its
predecessors though they are slightly
brighter and more detailed autofocus is
definitely improved with a full nine
cross-type autofocus points compared to
the one of its predecessors we had a
much easier time focusing on distant
subjects than either of the other two
there's an auto picture style boat now
which can let you get more color out of
scenes without you having to select one
yourself
in two dedicated positions on the dial
for multi shot noise reduction and HDR
mode both combine several images
together for for the multi shot or three
for the HDR and they produce
surprisingly good results as you can see
here the HDR can definitely improve the
overall exposure of the image although
you do lose some detail in the process
the very best new feature of the t4i
isn't on the spec sheet or any press
release though it's the far more
professional sound that the reflex
action of the camera makes when the
mirror flips up it's just so much more
satisfying to hear that rather than t2
and t3 ni screech whenever you take a
shot that reflex action is probably also
responsible for the improved speed here
the t4i captures five images per second
as opposed to the three point seven of
the earlier cameras and if you've got a
sufficiently fast SD card the buffer is
quick enough at shoving out those images
that you can keep snapping indefinitely
if you've already got a t2i or t3 I
don't plan to use the touchscreen and
don't do a lot of video recording
there's perhaps not any reason to
upgrade right now but if you do or if
you're a first-time DSLR buyer looking
for an all-purpose camera that's easy to
use and has interchangeable lenses the
t4i is an easy sell
