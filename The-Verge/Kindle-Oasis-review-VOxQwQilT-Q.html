you've seen one candle you've seen them
all right well for the past week I've
been testing out Amazon's new Kindle
this is the Kindle Oasis and I mean look
at this thing it is incredibly thin
incredibly light and super tiny there
are a few things that will really stand
out for you about this new Kindle first
it looks obviously it's a square shape
versus the rectangular shapes that came
in other Kindles of the past and one
side of it is a lot thicker than the
other side this is deliberate Amazon
wanted you to hold it in your hand and
feel that center of gravity shift so you
didn't have to sit there with two hands
holding your e-reader which nobody
really does it's also 30% thinner and
20% lighter and that might not seem like
a big deal but four point six ounces is
so light that is something you could
just toss in your bag and totally forget
about another thing you'll really notice
about this is that it ships with its
cover this is the first time Amazon has
done this since the original Kindle came
out in 2007 it's a beautiful leather
cover that has a magnetic clasp so you
can just tug on it gently and it pulls
off and I really love the feel of this
in my hand so I always wanted to pull
that cover off if I had the chance I
also like that the cover gives it some
extra battery life if you don't have the
cover on the Kindle alone will last for
two weeks of battery but when you put
the cover on it shacks it up to nine
weeks so you'll probably forget that you
ever have to charge this Kindle but
reality strikes and the price for this
Kindle is 290 dollars which is insanely
expensive for an e-reader but Amazon
wasn't really going for the low market
they wanted to show you they could
design something really cool and they
did that with this device of course
you're not getting the high-end features
like a 3G connection and no ads on your
screen for that you have to pay up to
three hundred and eighty dollars for
that and that will give you 3G and no
ads on your lockscreen this is the
Amazon Kindle that you're going to want
it's not necessarily the Kindle that
you're actually going to buy when I
write my downsides because I didn't I
just like making those
I know I'm going to forget them again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
