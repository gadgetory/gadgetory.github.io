this is sean hollister with birch and
i'm here with brian bishop my colleague
at the verge and we are here in a Ford
Focus Electric taking it for a test
drive
I can actually hear the sound of birds
outside almost a ladder in the sound of
the engine
so here we're going to take a look at
the ford focus electrics regenerative
braking feature board actually has a
built-in reward system here in the upper
left hand corner of the navigation app
it's called energy coach
you take a look at that it'll give you
up to date stats about your braking
acceleration and losing habits here
adding a little bit to that meter and
giving you a score to see how much
energy you free captured at each stop
you can see there Brian managed
ninety-eight percent not bad
so Brian tell me a bit about what this
is uh what this is like to drive your
overall impressions you know it's uh the
car feels very very tight in its control
and it's very nice and quiet which is
not the case with some of the earlier
for focuses that had been out of the
market I on one that was actually
extremely loud so this is quite nice and
the zip eNOS and acceleration are very
very enjoyable it's just a very nice
part of the rod especially in a
situation like this works you know you
have lots of quick stops you have odd
terms angles on Hills lots of
pedestrians it's a
it's a nice experience
so how do you feel about the range it's
a good question for told us that the
vehicle has 76 miles on a full charge
which kind of calls in a question who
the ideal customer for this vehicle is
you think you know with the meeting
charging stations a suburban environment
we can have one of your house makes the
most sense but if you have a car on that
situation you're plugging to have need
to go more than 80 miles at a given time
in a city environment like this it makes
a lot of sense because you have in your
quick short trips that kind of thing
once again you're not going to have a
charging station at your apartment so
right now it sits in a kind of a weird
middle ground and maybe a case we need
to go and have more technological
developments provide faster charging
that's more widespread to really take
advantage of electric vehicles in
general
