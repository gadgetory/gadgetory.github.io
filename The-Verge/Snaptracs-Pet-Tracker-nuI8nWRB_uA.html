snap tracks which is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Qualcomm and you guys are
making dog tracking devices we're also
here with Sam Sam who is also a wholly
owned subsidiary of Qualcomm and a so
tell me what these things you know how
do they work well it is a purpose-built
dog pet tracking device and what you can
do at any point in time is that if your
dog for whatever reason gets away and
you're alerted and your let known by
either text or email or or on your app
or on your email and your friends and
family will also be notified when you
when he leaves and gets out so you can
go find him you've got apps for the
phone that's right and and these guys
just snap onto a call or you've got a
little clip the traps i can go into a
collar or harness right anywhere you can
get the the clip on fire and we're going
to lose our rina loosed and everywhere
we're gonna take the scent and we act
like we're launching we're gonna have to
locate them goodbye Sam thank you for
although them right so if this would
have just happened and you were at your
house the dog would leave your tags on
that you've created around your house
right you would get an email or you
would get a text also friends and family
that you've directed to get those would
get the same thing and then it says to
you at that point in time do you want to
start tracking it do you want to start
finding it or was it a regular get out a
walk or that type of and how does it
track it's using its usual criteria it's
using the wireless network and it's
taking GPS fixes and it's communicating
back to you okay so it's basically
taking all the state-of-the-art
technology that you have in your cell
phone that gives position locations and
it's built into a purpose-built dog head
how often is it pinging I mean how what
are the intervals I'm you can you can
control that when you're doing it when
you're doing on demand locate you can
just do it and repeatedly and it takes
one to two minutes to bring back a new
fresh fresh location we also have the
tracking feature where when you push the
button in every three minutes we'll give
you a continuous track and send you back
your locations okay and then it'll
actually on our app you can actually get
directions and driving directions to
find out where you can manually pay it
by now you can manage a day or two to
get that's right that's what we're
saying and we're being conservative when
we tell you say that to people because
it does take a while and it does say but
some fixes are faster than others
you know because it's basically just the
same state of the art technology that's
in mobile phones today is built into
that pet tracking about yeah so as you
can see Sam is moving down the street
away from us yeah and then we can
deliver an electrical shock on him so
that we don't pick him up right well
it's interesting we've had that idea
given to us by a lot of people have you
really yeah yeah leave you just start
them a little i was joking it doesn't
people get serious they remain serious
because of a lot of people using the
invisible fences which does the same
sort of thing technique we've been in
the market since october and we've
already had about 10 rescues people are
giving us their testimonies on our
website and are you gonna expand this
you guys were saying a dog for dogs 10
pounds and over you told me before we
started filming I have a chihuahua right
she's about 8 pounds right I mean
probably work on her okay yeah we've
seen that on our Facebook are you gonna
do smaller versions for things like cats
or gerbil maybe a hamster well a ferret
I want to track I mean ferrets get out
yeah there's a rabbit there's good I do
this going to other end you see that we
do see it going to other animals right
now we believe we built this as small as
we can possibly get with with getting
the battery life that we need and making
sure that it gets the coverage that
right has because as the device as we've
seen the device we have actually built
the antennas into the device and and so
we've done this to make it like make
these are the antenna yeah and so it's
just basic physics when you have 800
megahertz here that this is as small as
you can get it right now today right you
can be assured that when you're here on
Qualcomm that we're working as best we
can to reduce the size of these and will
so be certain to bring it down the
marking we can do it but right now
you've got the state of the art and the
lightest weight you can get on the
market and it's a built purpose-built
for the pet industry yeah yeah that's
very cool okay thanks so much i can't
really appreciate it yeah thank you
you're a good dog</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
