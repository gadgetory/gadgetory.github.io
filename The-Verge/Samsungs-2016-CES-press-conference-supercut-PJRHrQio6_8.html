2016
Samsung is recognized for breaking
barriers and pushing boundaries his
keynote last year our CEO BK Yoon
described how Samsung's IOT solutions
will enhance and be in sync with our
everyday lives last year at CES we said
that all of our TVs would be IOT ready
by 2017 I'm happy to announce the
introduction of our new smart things
extend USB adapter this will enable
users of our 2016 s UHD TVs to control
IOT features directly from their TV
screens via the smart things platform
when connected the extended Apter could
control more than 200 smart things
compatible devices from home appliances
to baby monitors we're making it
available free of charge to every
customer who purchased as a 2016 su HDTV
it seems like just yesterday I was
standing right here introducing our su
HD TVs to the world announcing the
flagship 2016 samsung s UHD TV
ladies and gentlemen this is the world's
first bezel s curved design and this
year we will launch five full series
with screen sizes ranging from 49 inches
all the way up to 88 inches and what's
more every 2016 s UHD TV will feature a
cadmium free 10 bit quantum bit dot
display
bhasu dot is an advanced optical
technology that dramatically expands the
color range while creating brighter more
lifelike images our new ultra black
technology reduces light reflection
enabling viewers to experience all the
details with minimal glare and the
increased brightness helps to express a
higher level of contrast so you can see
the intensity of bright sunlight
piercing through a dark forest with a
lifelike depth and richness our smart
TVs also allow you to automatically
control multiple devices with just a
single remote control let me show you
how it works
when an external device like a set-top
box or game console is connected to a
Samsung TV the TV automatically
recognizes the device we are very proud
today to announce the seamless
integration of Time Warner Cable and
Samsung's Tizen platform what this does
is enable our customers to sit back and
enjoy TV without having to change inputs
or switch back and forth between
applications to find what they're
looking for or two thousand six inch
Smart TVs also feature new enhancements
in bring the second screen experience
right to the TV screen with a dedicated
button called extra last year extra
delivers real-time stats on games and
players on live sports broadcasts this
year our extra service is going beyond
it will cover the big four sports
leagues and european soccer games it
will also offer entertainment and social
information on your favorite TV programs
we're very excited to announce that we
will be launching Samsung's first Ultra
HD blu-ray player in March with
pre-orders beginning today this player
will support 4k with HDR and we're
working with top film studios like 20th
Century Fox and Warner Brothers to
deliver this content today we're excited
to announce the world's first sound bar
packaged with wireless up firing rear
speakers featuring Dolby Atmos this 5.1
point 4 channel system will let users
feel every dimension of sound it's yet
another way which we're truly delivering
innovation that matters we innovate in
home appliances in ways that matter that
are in sync with life we launched active
watch last year we transform how people
do laundry by adding a sink inside the
washing machine we enabled consumers to
pretreat and wash laundry all in one
place
simple yet brilliant and it gets even
better this year with the new active
wash with mid control now we've added
digital touch controls in the middle of
the lid so they're easy to reach and the
built-in sink is wider and deeper the
new active wash models will launch
globally this spring I'm excited to
introduce you to ad wash with AD wash
you can add items after the wash has
started just push the pause button open
the ad wash door and add the item to the
wash now let's move to the kitchen the
kitchen has always been the heart of the
home it's where we meet talk about our
day share meals and enjoy family and
friends we believe it's time for an
upgrade to modernize the kitchen with
the power of IOT for example we're
adding IOT capabilities to our range
line including remote monitoring and
control so now you can preheat the oven
on your way home from work or if you've
left the house in a hurry you can see if
the oven or burners are still on using
your smart phone if the kitchen is the
center of the home the refrigerator is
the centerpiece of the kitchen I'm
pleased to introduce to you the Samsung
family hub refrigerator
the family hub refrigerator is a true
home appliance revolution with the 21
and a half inch touchscreen you can
leave notes post photos share calendars
and artwork whether you're at home or on
the go how many times have you gone to
the grocery store and forgotten to buy
an important item or bought something
you already have it happens to us all
now imagine being at the grocery store
and using your smartphone to look inside
your fridge the family hub has built-in
cameras that take a photo of the inside
of the refrigerator every time you close
the door in partnership with MasterCard
the family hub offers a new seamless
more convenient grocery shopping
experience groceries by MasterCard is
the first shopping app integrated into a
refrigerator connecting consumers to
stores straight from their kitchen at
launch we will have access to online
shopping at Fresh Direct and shop right
when it's time for bed you can check the
doors and turn off the lights right from
the family hub screen and this is just
the beginning of the journey to
integrate home automation and control
into the centerpiece of the kitchen
family hub will be available at all
leading retailers this spring we were a
pioneer in the SmartWatch journey a
journey that has changed a relationship
between people and their devices since

been enjoying the real-life benefits and
convenience of wearable devices and
