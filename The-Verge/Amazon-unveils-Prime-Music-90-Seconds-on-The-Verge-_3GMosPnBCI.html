business coincidentally is one of the
only industries the company hasn't
publicly pissed off this week
I'm Brian Bishop coming to you from e3
2014 and this is 90 seconds on the verge
Amazon calls a prime music and as the
name suggests will be bundled in the
company's pre-existing $99 annual
membership program prime already
includes free two-day shipping Kindle
eBook lending and Prime instant video
the last one has been growing
substantially as of late but while Prime
Music is a value-add it's not at the
level of its competition just yet Amazon
promises 1 million songs will be
available at launch for streaming that
number is super tiny compared to Spotify
and beats each of which claimed to have
around 20 million tracks prime music
will also have hundreds of curated
playlists if you just can't decide on
your own try music has one glaring
omission right now and that's universal
it's the largest music company in the
world and it means know you to know
Taylor Swift's know jay-z and know Kanye
discussions are said to be ongoing but
Universal is just one of many major
companies that Amazon has been beefing
with that's not even remotely the most
public spamming Amazon and book
publisher has chef have been a very
public ugly feud lately it seems Amazon
is now purposely delaying customer
orders of hash hat books by weeks
affected authors include James Patterson
Malcolm Gladwell and Stephen Colbert
Amazon seems to be plying similar
tactics to Warner Brothers it's no
longer taking pre-orders for movies like
The Winter's Tale and the lego movie for
more on Amazon check out the verge
coming up tomorrow what begins at the
90th second shell in there and what ends
there shall begin once more here you
make it again it's time to wake up Brian
wake up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
