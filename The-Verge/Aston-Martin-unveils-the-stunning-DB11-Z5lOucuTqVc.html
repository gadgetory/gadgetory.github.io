the Geneva Motor Show 2016 and the car
behind me is probably the prettiest one
of the entire show aasta.martin DBM so
this is Aston Martin's 2017 model as a
successor to this DB 10 which we got to
ride late last year the DB 11 is this
new flagship is the new luxury sports
car is the fastest the most powerful
engine that as somebody's ever produced
as a turbocharger inside 5.2 liter it
reaches not to 62 miles an hour in less
than four seconds 3.9 to be exact at the
same time it still fits in all the
luxuries and conveniences that Aston
Martin customers are used to that
includes space for two golf bags which
is cute because it implies what your
lifestyle is going to be like there's an
infotainment system a touchscreen it's
all provided by Daimler there's Bang and
Olufsen sound on the inside as tamati
has a unique thing it calls an air blade
which channels through the chassis and
then pushes it out through the back of
the car which functions essentially as a
spoiler the pricing on this aasta.martin
DB 11 again compared to the Bugatti and
the Lamborghini and Ferraris and
everything else it's actually quite
reasonable it's a hundred fifty five
thousand pounds in the UK two hundred
twelve thousand dollars in the United
States so it's quite affordable buy
luxury and supercar standards one other
thing that as someone is CEO mentioned
in the presentation was that he will
personally inspect every single one of
these as the Martin TV Elevens before
they go out so far we've only seen a few
of the big announcements here at Geneva
but this is probably the prettiest and
the most attractive of all the cars
we've seen so far so this our first look
at the Aston Martin deviated Eva Motor
