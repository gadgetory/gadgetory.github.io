York City where we just saw the Sonos
one it's the first ever sono speaker
that is built-in voice controls Sonos
finally has its own smart boys
controlled speaker and it's called the
sono Swan
it works with Amazon's Alexa goes on
sale October 24th and costs $1.99 the
same price as the old play one speaker
the soloist one looks identical for the
play one from the front and it sounds
exactly the same but on top are new
microphones that listen for you when you
ask Alexa to play music or control your
smart home or just answer a question so
you can say Alexa play some time petty
or Alexa turn off the lights just like
you would on an echo and it works the
same way so no one will support Google
assistance sometime next year so you'll
be able to pick one or the other or
maybe even use both at the same time
unfortunately not every music service
can play your spoken song requests right
now
Spotify won't be supported until after
launch and Apple music doesn't work
either Amazon music pandora iheartradio
and others dufoy support voice out of
the box and your basic commands like
pause or skip this track work everywhere
so no someone might have some of the
same features as an echo but your music
is gonna sound a lot better first and
foremost this is still a music speaker
you can put two Sonos ones together for
a stereo pair or at the new speaker to
your current zone was set up anywhere in
your house Sonos is also redesigning its
smartphone app where you can stream
music or podcasts from any number of
popular services so it's easier to use
but other companies are also starting to
make their voice speaker's sound better
Amazon's brand new echo has improved
sound quality and is half the price of
the Sonos one and on the more expensive
side
Google just announced a $400 speaker the
home Maxx and then there's Apple which
is also said that its upcoming home
Pottle sound better than all the
competition when it ships in December
the other way Sonos has realized how
easy and valuable voice control is
people love listening to music on the
echo and home not because they sound
great but because they're so convenient
that's what led Sonos to try and defend
off everybody else with this $200 Sonos
won and you can pre-order it starting
now if buying a whole new speaker is too
much for you you can try the new public
beta to control your isono system with a
$50 echo dot now we're going to be
comparing all these new speakers very
soon
