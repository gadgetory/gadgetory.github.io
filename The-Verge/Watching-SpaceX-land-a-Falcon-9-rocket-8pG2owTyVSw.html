before but I've never gotten to visit
the rocket before it went up so it's
crazy to think that just in a couple of
hours this place is going to be filled
with a lot of a lot of flames we're here
at Cape Canaveral Florida home of NASA's
Kennedy Space Center we've come to see
SpaceX launch one of its Falcon 9 rocket
but I'll be honest I came here to watch
it land we all know the story SpaceX has
been trying to land its Rockets after
launching them into space to save on
manufacturing costs they've had some
explosive misses and some overwhelming
success and I followed all of these but
only through a tiny computer screen so I
thought it was time to see one with my
own two eyes we traveled all the way
from New York to Florida for SpaceX CRS
nine that was the company's ninth cargo
resupply mission to the International
Space Station but before we saw the
launch and landing we paid a quick visit
to the rocket on top of this rocket is
SpaceX's dragon cargo capsule it's
filled with nearly 5,000 pounds of
goodies and science experiments that
need to get to the International Space
Station that includes the first DNA
sequencer to be used in space and a
shiny new international docking adaptor
that adaptor will be added to the
outside of the station allowing future
private spacecraft to automatically dock
with the ISS and eventually SpaceX is
own vehicles we'll be using that adapter
there assuring us out but we'll be
seeing the rocket later all stations one
minute
you see and DC on countdown verify f9
and dragon Ark startup token let's start
up dragon isn't startup t-minus ten nine
eight seven six five four three two one
the doctor government
- $30
integration your sirness what coming
back you can see it oh my god here go oh
my goodness oh look oh my god it
looks like it's right ahead of us Oh
just do you want it's your bear to shut
down next one will be some stage want
landing burn has started here we go here
I go oh my god oh I got him LT one fell
tonight has landed landing operators
moving a procedure 11 . 100 recovery in
LZ one amen oh that huge noise came from
a bunch of sonic booms the Falcon 9
enters the Earth's atmosphere going
faster than the speed of sound
creating shockwaves and we don't hear
until the rocket reaches the ground oh
my god that shook me I've never seen
anything like that that is gonna that
that is something everybody's got to see
as a space reporter I write about
spaceflight everyday but there's
something fundamentally different about
seeing one of these events in person I
still can't seem to put into words what
it was like to see that rocket land and
then to feel the sonic boom go right
through me it was so intense even locals
in the area reported it to 911 schools
it all was spacex hopes these landings
become just as routine as the launches
themselves after is all over hans conics
men one of the VPS for spacex said this
one day people will pay less attention
to this and that's actually the day when
we succeed but for now it's still really
awesome I just take it home I'm taking
an obligatory space egg selfie
