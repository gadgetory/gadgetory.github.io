the Samsung Galaxy Note equipped with a
5.3 inch Super AMOLED display the note
is Samsung's attempted and no compromise
device the balance is the portability of
a phone with the extra utility of a
larger screen tablet but that's not all
Samsung's also brought in an integrated
stylus making a note a candidate to
replace your paper notebook as well the
obvious risk that Samsung is running by
straddling so many categories is that
the note will exceed and none of them
exchanging excellence in any one area
for greater versatility that's partially
true as a phone the note inevitably
sacrificed a single hand operation is
pretty awkward socially if not
physically to hold against your face to
take a call and its ability to fit
inside pockets can be described this
question of what is best the note also
won't replace your iPad firstly because
your runs Android Gingerbread and
secondly because the screen is a really
large enough if you can look past this
one size fits non form factor though the
note is a truly excellent Android device
here's a 1280 by 800 display resolution
giving you pixel density of 285 PPI and
it's Super AMOLED technology means
incredibly deep blacks contrasted
against bright vibrant colors
there's also screen mode adjustment in
case you find the saturation too strong
a common complaint with AMOLED displays
the dual-core 1.4 kicker's processor
inside the note is extremely impressive
Richard score of over 4,000 in a
standard quadrant benchmark and running
every Android game and app with ease
Riptide GP looks spectacular in the note
and I'd love to see the high graphical
fidelity of the Tegra optimised version
of this game being brought to Samsung's
platform as well the notes easily
powerful enough to handle it games also
where the stylus comes in with things
like fruit ninja and some other drawing
and slicing games making good use of it
you can use the stylus to take a quick
handwritten note to grab a screenshot of
what's on the phone and annotate it or
to navigate exactly as you would with
your finger the only downside is that
the capacitive keys don't recognize it
so you still need to use your physical
digits to activate those beyond
handwriting recognition in the core apps
like messaging an email
samsung doesn't really have any killer
uses for its S Pen Stylus there's an SDK
out and some recommended doodling apps
like Omni sketch and Zen brush but
they're not exactly deep of
functionality additionally text input
the stylist can be hit a miss did not
mean a few too many mistakes for me to
learn to write my notes instead of
typing them out browser performance in
the notes is excellent pages around it
beautifully where a zoomed in or out
scrolling is quicker responsive and so
is pinch-to-zoom
the camera is also pretty quick in
operation though not as fast as the one
at the Galaxy Nexus on the plus side did
not take some really great pictures that
almost never need to be reshot
it's part of the great processing power
within it the note does have some
software issues holding back the most
immediate one is the delay in the screen
waking up from sleep it's manifested
slower than most firms there's no lag
around the TouchWiz UI but there are
some delays in the occasional stutter
things that an upcoming upgrade to Ice
Cream Sandwich should hopefully rectify
some of the smaller things that Samsung
has done well include the keys err app
which has been around since the release
of the Galaxy s2 but it's still one of
the best ways to communicate between
your phone and PC 2500 milliamp hour
battery is also great it lasts like a
champ and the bundled in ear headphones
are actually very decent in the UK the
note also comes with an ingeniously
designed power plug to save space
ultimately I feel like the note size is
his biggest weakness if you're after a
tablet I wait for the Galaxy Tab 7.7
which is almost the same internal specs
but comes with a bigger and better Super
AMOLED plus display the Galaxy Nexus
will take good care of you if you're
after a morgue anomic phone than the
note while the get up paper based
notebook still remains the easiest and
cheapest way to take handwritten notes</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
