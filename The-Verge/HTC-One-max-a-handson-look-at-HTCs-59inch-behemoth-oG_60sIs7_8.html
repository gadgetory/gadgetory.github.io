are looking at the HTC One max the one
max is the latest member of HTC's one
line of devices and it features a new
5.9 inch 1080p display considerably
larger than the 4.7 inch screen that is
on the HTC One or the 4.3 inch screen
that's on the HTC One mini otherwise
it's very similar in design and looks to
the other HTC One phones you still have
the boom sound speakers on the front so
you have dual front-facing speakers it's
got an aluminum and plastic design this
particular unit is a silver model which
HTC will be releasing this in it still
has the ultra pixel camera so it's a
four megapixel camera with HTC's ultra
pixel technology
it still has the IR port at the top a
couple of big changes though are the
power button has been moved to the side
and HTC has included a fingerprint
scanner which can be used to unlock the
device with one hand so that you don't
have to use the power button or the
passcode on the screen if you don't want
to inside the HTC One max has a
Snapdragon 600 processor it's the same
processor that we saw in the HTC One
it's paired with two gigabytes of RAM
and in the US it will have 32 gigabytes
of storage so international models will
be available with 16 gigabytes of
storage the one max also has a micro SD
card slot so you can expand the storage
built-in it has a 3300 milliamp hour
battery but that's non removable or
upgradable software wise the one max is
running Android 4.3 out of the box and
it's got HTC's latest version of Sense
which is now since 5.5 then cludes a
couple of new features for the blinkfeed
settings there's a new swipe in menu
from the left that offers different
options so you can drill down your
blinkfeed into specific feeds and it
also now integrates Google Plus as well
as Instagram Twitter and Facebook as it
did before in your feed and then you
also now have the option to turn off
blink feed entirely if it's something
that you don't want to use other new
features include tweaks in the gallery
it's a couple different things now it's
a different layout there's more video
highlight options
you can choose to have longer video
highlights if you want and you can also
import your own music into them that's
stored on the device overall though this
is pretty much the same sense experience
that we have on sense 5 on an HTC one
it's not really hugely different
it's just blown up to the larger screen
size performance wise the device is very
fast even with the Snapdragon 600
processor it's very similar to what we
see on the HTC One there's very little
lag or delay with anything the hardware
is the same type of build quality that
we saw on the other HTC models too so
it's got the aluminum finish as well as
the plastic inlays that really just do
feel nice when you hold it obviously
this is much larger to use in your hand
HTC says that it will be available for
purchase by the holidays on Sprint and
Verizon though we don't know an exact
price yet we expect it to be competitive
with other devices in this class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
