looking at the HTC One max the one max
is the latest member of HTC's one line
of devices and it features a new 5.9
inch 1080p display considerably larger
than the 4.7 inch screen that is on HTC
One or the 4.3 inch screen that's on the
HTC One mini otherwise it's very similar
in design and looks to the other HTC One
phones you still have the bloom sound
speakers on the front so you have dual
front-facing speakers it's got an
aluminum and plastic design this
particular unit is a silver model which
HTC will be releasing this in it still
has the ultrapixel camera so it's a 4
megapixel camera with HTC's ultra pixel
technology it still has the IR port at
the top a couple of big changes though
are the power button has been moved to
the side and HTC has included a
fingerprint scanner which can be used to
unlock the device with one hand so that
you don't have to use the power button
or the passcode on the screen if you
don't want to inside the HTC One max has
a Snapdragon 600 processor it's the same
processor that we saw in the HTC One
it's paired with two gigabytes of RAM
and in the u.s. it will have 32
gigabytes of storage to international
models will be available with 16
gigabytes of storage the one max also
has a micro SD card slot so you can
expand the storage built in it has a
3300 milliamp hour battery but that's
non removable or upgradable
software-wise the one max is running
Android 4.3 out of the box and it's got
HTC's latest version of sense which is
now since 5.5 then cludes a couple of
new features for the blinkfeed settings
there's a new swype in menu from the
left that offers different options that
you can drill down your blinkfeed into
specific feeds and it also now
integrates google plus as well as
Instagram Twitter and Facebook as it did
before in your feed and then you also
now have the option to turn off
blinkfeed entirely if it's something
that you don't want to use other new
features include tweaks in the gallery
it's a couple different things now it's
a different layout there's more video
highlight options
you can choose to have longer video
highlights if you want and you can also
import your own music into them that's
stored on the device overall though this
is pretty much the same sense experience
that we have on Sense 5 on an HTC One
it's not really hugely different it's
just blown up to the larger screen size
performance wise the device is very fast
even with the Snapdragon 600 processor
it's very similar to what we see on the
HTC One there's very little lag or delay
with anything the hardware is the same
type of build quality that we saw on the
other HTC models too so it's got the
aluminum finish as well as the plastic
inlays that really just do feel nice
when you hold it obviously this is much
larger to use in your hand HTC says that
it will be available for purchase by the
holidays on Sprint and Verizon though we
don't know an exact price yet we
expected to be competitive with other
devices in this class</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
