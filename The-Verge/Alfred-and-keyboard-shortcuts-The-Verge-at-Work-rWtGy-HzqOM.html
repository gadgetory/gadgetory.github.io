million things in my computer I've got
50 windows open and a ton of apps and I
need to move on to the next thing
luckily there's an app that helps me do
that it's called Alfred it lets you
launch apps search Google and do a whole
lot of other stuff really quickly so
Alfred is just an app for the Mac it's
in the App Store or you can pay for it
from the developer directly and it's
just a text box so it's a lot like
spotlight you launch it with a key
command and you start typing it's a lot
like apps that used to exist for the Mac
like Quicksilver launch bar so typically
if you want to launch an app you've got
to go down to your dock or you've got to
open up your Applications folder and if
you're like me you've got a ton of
applications they're kind of hard to
find but without ffred you can just
launch the text box type in the name of
the application hit enter and you're
done
same thing with Google searches with a
browser you've got a tab over the
browser you've got to put the mouse up
over to the search box gonna click it
then you've got to do your search but
without ffred you just get the hot key
launched the text box and type of the
thing you want to search for hit enter
and you're done I mean one of my
favorite things about Alfred is you
don't have to think about what app you
want to use necessarily if you want to
search on beat you can start typing IMDB
if you want to launch an app you just
launch an app it's based on actions
instead of apps so for example I know
I've got an email sitting in my gmail
inbox and I've got Albert hooked up to
my gmail so instead of opening Gmail and
then going to the search box I just
start typing this thing that I want and
then one of the options that drops down
is to search Gmail for that thing
searching all those different default
web stores is great but I work on the
web and I work at a specific website I
work on the merge and so I've set up a
whole bunch of custom searches that just
work on the verge so for example if I
want to search for a tag on the verge I
can just open up Alfred I type CT which
is how I set it up and I can search for
a tag like Motorola and it will
automatically show me everything from
Motorola verge so beyond just typing
text into a box Alfred actually has a
ton of other features and I don't use
them all but one that I'm really fond of
is a clipboard history it automatically
keeps record of everything that you put
into the clipboard and then paste it and
you can call that up with a quick
keyboard combo so another part of the
keyboard history is its thing called
snippets which lets you save lots and
lots of different text and call them up
later and so for example I've got a
whole bunch of gifts that I save and so
I can very quickly type in a bias and
I've got a thing for bias or I could
very type in gtfo and I've got a gtfo
together which is great so once you've
gotten used to doing all this stuff with
Alfred you want to go even faster and
you can set up hotkeys to do some of
these actions automatically so I have a
hotkey set up to automatically bring the
clipboard history I've got a hotkey set
up to clear out a folder that I clear
out on a regular basis instead of
actually typing in the thing that I want
to do in Alfred I just hit a certain key
combo and have things automatically
happen so there's actually a small
developer community around Alfred that's
created a whole bunch of added
functionality basically like little apps
that attach to it so I use it to do
things like automatically create
calendar entries with fantastical or
to-do lists restarting my audio when it
gets broken I've got Apple scripts for
to-do lists and a whole bunch of other
stuff it's actually pretty great so the
thing about Alfred is can be really
complex there's a ton of features and I
don't even use all but the nice thing is
you don't actually have to use all of
them you just start with some simple
google searches and launching some apps
and get that into your workflow and then
once you do you can see if you want to
start using the other stuff there's been
studies that it might not actually be
that much faster but the point is that
it feels faster and it feels more
powerful than just you know moving my
mouse around in the Alpha preferences
there's a tab that lets you see your
usage and it tells me that I launched at
an average of 40 times a day which is
pretty amazing and it feels like it's
more it's such an integral part of my
workflow that I couldn't
using Mac without it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
