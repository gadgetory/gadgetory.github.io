taking a look at Flipboard 2.0 so there
a bunch of changes here some are sort of
small and aesthetic like it just takes
up the whole screen now on your iPad or
iPhone and it just looks a little better
it's much more visual there's a lot more
pictures through the whole thing this
used to be just a list of text and now
it's a lot prettier to look through but
most of these changes are small the
search is pretty cool it's now on the
front page and you can search across all
of your different content and other
different sources so you get not only
stories on Flipboard but you can see
tweets and things on Facebook and
YouTube and Google+ and everything so
search is pretty powerful on here now
but the biggest new change is curation
they're calling it and basically what it
lets you do is create your own magazine
so instead of subscribing to the New
York Times and Flipboard Tek and SB
Nation and The Verge you can actually
make your own and you can pull together
all kinds of different contents so we at
the verge have done a bunch of really
cool interviews and we've actually made
a magazine of all of the best interviews
we've had and you can add to your own
magazine just by hitting that and you
can create a magazine and you can share
that with anyone you want people can
subscribe to your magazines and as you
add more things to it it will actually
subscribe and show them the new content
as well in general Flipboard is still
very much the same it's pulling from a
lot of different content sources and as
you build your own magazines it
preserves all of the information about
where it came from and you can actually
if you comment on a piece it'll actually
comment on the original website which is
pretty cool but it all looks just like
you'd expect it to even across different
magazines and really the big thing here
is that instead of doing a site specific
Tumblr or Twitter account
Flipboard wants you to build a Flipboard
so that's really the big difference
Flipboard says they have 50 million
users now and they're really pitching
this as a way for publishers to get
their stuff in front of a lot more
people it's still free it works great
it's faster than ever video works well
you can listen to music as you flip you
can actually like set up a soundtrack
for a magazine and you can play it while
you flip through and read and in general
it's a pretty great solution it's still
not available offline and it's still not
available on the web which are two
things that would make Flipboard really
really cool but even as it is this is
definitely a step forward for them as
they go through and makes the board
potentially if people really get
involved a lot more useful of a way to
find cool stuff to read so that's
Flipboard 2.0 it's out now
for the iPad and iPhone and we'll be out
on Android soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
