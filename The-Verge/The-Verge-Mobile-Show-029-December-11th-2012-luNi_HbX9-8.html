the weak of descent
oh this is episode 29 and if you're
joining us and you're watching us live
we apologize for our slight delay this
week but we want to say that everything
is working now and we're all here so i'm
dan seifert I'm flats have 0 and i'm
chris sigler and i am responsible for
the delays by the way no no you're not
just comcast says yeah yeah I actually
would kind of like to relay the
harrowing experience that I had the past
half an hour so first my my main
connection died my comcast cable modem
at precisely the wrong moment so I
switched over to a verizon LTE hotspot
connection but the machine that I
normally broadcast from is an imac with
fried Wi-Fi hardware so i couldn't use
hotspot mode so i switched over to a
macbook air and then that connection
died so then Brendan our producer tried
to loop me in on a hangout on my Nexus 4
that didn't work very well it kind of
worked not really you can't use
bluetooth with it and I could barely
hear the loud speaker so it kind of
wouldn't have done any good and then I
couldn't and then my comcast connection
came back but I couldn't get to Google
Hangouts because google com wasn't
resolving on dns and it goes on and on
bottom line is i'm i'm here i'm ready to
uh ready to talk about phones but if i
do suddenly die if i if the connection
drops you probably can blame comcast
just morning feeling this into a
scenario that has developed probably all
across Chicago and the American no well
yes no what is it northeast no middle no
chicago so midwest yeah yeah it soon
enough man but anyway this is a scenario
the reason for is because camp comcast
changes logo and stuck a ccp cock in it
which is a it's a travesty I mean let's
not let's not mince words guys well I
you know I gotta say with that logo the
NBC Peacock is not the worst part of it
the worst part of it is the fact that
the letters start off rounded and
and off sharp like not a taxi yeah look
at it closely yeah notify look at the
sea and the the top part of the sea has
a rounded end and then you go all the
way down to the bottom of the sea and
it's sharp at the end and you know
anything mentally I was thinking
naturally going to the right yeah I mean
I don't know how to put this in words
well I don't speak well that makes you
fully qualify for this podcast I'll try
to find our post on it but actually I
spotted the apparently there are
channels like Comcast SportsNet this is
how savvy IM on US cable channels which
to actually have the NBC logo next to
the comcast logo but again that's an
entertainment channel where is now you
have this entire massive network of
Comcast engineers and people carrying an
entertainment channels logo on them
which some people think might be
something that that lose the brand
because look Chris just had this entire
massive outage and you're just gonna
associate the entire freakin network
with her this is chris is gonna boycott
watching NBC now because of his comcast
outage I mean just to put things in
perspective this would be glad if like
if like BTW put the BBC logo right above
it and called it there at their new logo
this isn't happening that would pretty
intense this is BBC logo is actually
mostly a word mark rather than an image
that would be a little weird um yeah I
know this I dan I'm really upset that
you brought this font situation to my
attention I think our charter cleared it
up it's like half sands half sereth at a
part partially sarita don't know I I
don't know if that no because there's
there are no flourishes I don't think
that's that's accurate right there it's
entirely sans-serif but it's a as dan
says his friend that is a top and then
kind of like look at the day it kind of
loses like fat as it goes down
ah yeah this is a nightmare fascinating
topic of discussion but let us like
bring it back to move fine oh you want
to talk about ah let us start with
Windows Phone let's get this stuff out
of the way first oh no I mean I'm
sounding underwhelmed about it and I
think it's fitting we got to put up our
HC Windows Phone 8 s review today that
was done by tom warren who long last
managed to have enough time in his life
to actually review a windows phone um
and he wasn't that psyched about it
disappointingly well I mean the 8's is a
mid-range phone and there's like a
couple of things that are definitely
disappointing that I we encourage you to
of course read the review but you know
the display is wvga which we know is a
quite a bit lower resolution than what
you get on the 8x or on the 920 from
Nokia uh and the camera is a bit of a
disappointment apparently but you know I
think the phone looks really great I
think the design is cool and I'm kind of
bummed that we're not getting it here in
the States the lack of a front facing
camera is really like it's just a really
bizarre a mission and I know that it's
not a big deal for most people I get
that but like of all the things to just
randomly leave out the the the the
amount of you know bottom line cost that
that feature must add to a phone I'm
sure is like absolutely minimal so it's
i don't i'm curious what decisions went
into that call that's it's a little
strange to me but is it is a very
nice-looking phone I've been held it in
in a couple months but from what I
remember that it's a pretty cool little
phone and I was expecting it was kind of
hoping that it would end up being the
replacement for the radar in the US so
but it's not to be yeah I mean
personally aside from the front facing
camera problem or missing front facing
camera I kind of like this the ADA is
better than no key is equivalent in the
820 oh yeah and and Tom did to Tom gave
it a better score than he gave the 820
so I you know I I think that regardless
of which mid-range Windows Phone you
choose you're making some pretty severe
I compromises and I think Tom does a
pretty good job of spelling that out in
the review and and I think that if
you're in the market for windows phone 8
device you're probably still bit you
know unbalanced you're better off going
with one of the higher resolution
devices that I'm actually I have a an 8x
for verizon right now and it's it's
growing on me I'm not gonna lie it's
growing on me a little bit that the
power button is still one of the worst
up in any modern smartphone i think but
but that on its it's a decent device one
thing Tom notes though is that the ATIS
is extremely affordable as a
pay-as-you-go device in the UK is that
right flat it's like I think it's 200
it's the equivalent of two hundred
eighty nine dollars or something like
that which is pretty pretty I will be
able to tell you that but then I'm too
much of a snob to care about wvj phones
so it's completely like my mind sees the
price and just blanks it out I mean that
that price would have been awesome six
months ago but now assuming you can
actually place an order for one and you
can get a nexus 4 for 300 bucks with a
720p display so it's like all the nexus
4 totally screwed up that pay-as-you-go
value quotient for me I mean just just
to expand on my snow machine there is
actually a rational reason for this and
and also to spread out the hatred that
emanates from me tonight it also applies
to Android because today we've got the
UK announcement for the HTC one sv right
and I first thing is I'm reading for the
press release I'm like okay is this more
of an HTC One V with a bit of HTC One S
sprinkled in or is it the other way
around which is it what's the difference
the other I looked at the images it's
kind of a nice phone it has a super OCD
to display and then I'm like whoa hang
on a second this is like the 1s as LTE
is still has a 4.3 inch display the side
is ok it's not quite as sharp as the 1s
it's a little bit softer
this thing is interesting and I see it's
also wvga and I just completely
submarine the whole thing and now it is
like apparently this was also I mean
it's not apparently it's a fact that it
was also announced Westralian the
Southeast Asian region suffer like a
month ago so it's not a brand new phone
either but it's like I look at this a
look at the 8's and I just don't see any
inspiration for why we want to buy
either one for how much and that is
absolutely right with a nexus for being
so affordable it's not entirely
obtainable listen no that's the next
book I did hedge that if you are able to
buy one right unless you chris ziegler
who's like six is house unless you're
him and unless you have that stash is ok
I take the point but still the pricing
on the Nexus 4 right now makes a lot of
these mid-range phones feel lower the
mid-range even and the other thing is we
need to like carefully consider what's
going to happen at CES which just a
month away right what's going to happen
with mobile resolutions particularly on
the Android side because all of these
1080p displays which are being built and
stashed and stacked up right now I'm
going to show up in new phones we're
going to see more 1080p phones
everybody's mid-range is going to become
a 720p display we can see that if you
can price a nexus 4 at that price for
the 720p display nobody else should
really have an excuse like I would love
for more people to make smaller phones
but higher res is definitely the future
so wvga just isn't gonna cut and just
like a horrible horrible time to buy
anything with that we PGM yeah in that
is it is that it's my biggest
disappointment with the 8's that's for
sure yeah um yeah I mean I I don't think
it's apples to apples because the nexus
4 yet to take a few things into account
one google is obviously juicing the
bottom line somehow it's google so they
meeting those price points was
obviously very important to them and
they did something they pulled some
magic to make that happen because the
numbers just don't really make sense
considering the hardware that you're
getting with that device but then also
of course LG like Samsung is very very
horizontal and so they can in source
many many many of their components in in
that device which is something that
Nokia can't really do and and most
manufacturers can't do other than
Sanders I think you think of any good
school no I mean horizontal they're very
broad Samsung is in many many many
different silos but I think the
expiration is when you go from component
manufacturing for assembly through
distribution etc so true though I
understand what what Chris is saying
because Chris can be like LG can just
call over to LG display and like source
of display yeah pretty much even though
to supposed to be different ok look
they're both horizontal and vertical
they're there to deplane LG is a plane
in space and samsung is another plane in
space and the line intersecting LG and
Samsung is google whatever mind uh look
always saying is that Nokia and you know
we mentioned this before with regards to
HTC they don't have the component buying
power and the component design power
that that somebody like Samsung or LG
does LG you know for instance has been
making absolutely wonderful displays for
Apple for the iphone so going back to
the iphone for the original rhett and
display so I mean they've been you know
this is something that they've been
preparing yours for the display on the
Nexus 4 which by the way is a really
really beautiful display ok yeah it's
very good I was actually I'm sorry guys
I'm sorry I don't mean to harp on about
it but like a few people like Josh of
being disappointed at this place I think
I mean I think it a little washed out it
is a little washed out but it's it's a
very gapless and I think I'm looking at
it right now very very gapless I really
think that like unless you forget
side with like the one odd boy by this
but I let that super gapless yes super
gapless too oh that's perfect David do
one just be like super gapless do we
improve me now i need to stare at this
place um I totally believe that Sony
would create a super gapless to display
except they didn't they'd have like a
brand name for it they call it like hi
bra or like they make up some like some
vaguely like Greek sounding word for it
and then they they branded hybrid and
then they'd have a super hyper to and
and that would just refer to the fact
that it's like gapless um anyway dude
it's a nice we ever do if we ever do
like a quiz particularly on branding
names we need to make sure we asked
people what reality display and rabbit
and the Bravia Engine actually mean and
then we can take their answers and learn
ourselves yeah asses on a digital
postcode i'm amazed i mean i've read it
so many times and I still don't know
what the hell the Bravia Engine yes I
know what white magic is when they say
that I know what they're referring to
there but I don't know what the Bravia
Engine means or the other thing that's
white magic is on a white pixel right
yeah white magic is the white pixel
thats makes it brighter and easy a see
daylight yeah it would be would it be
pretty cool as if they did a black magic
and it was a black pixel I don't know
how that would work but it would be
people you just wanted to work in the
black magic brand name that's about yeah
okay yeah and just before Jennifer
ramped up all this display discussion I
just thought we should mention Nucky
introduced lumia 620 which is a surprise
thing is the most affordable windows
phone yet at two forty nine dollars i
believe is where they announced it it's
very colorful but it also has a WVGA
display yeah so what and again branding
is clear black so it might be a good
high quality so f VG display for ah this
is a WVGA display at three point eight
inches oh I can almost live with that
because you're not going to get
a 720p display its three point eight
inches that's just not going to happen
at least not a true that's true and it
is cheap so so maybe when you when you
you know grab it embrace it hold it and
note that this has a front facing camera
yeah highlight I don't know why you won
I I'm just looking at this I don't know
why you wouldn't want this over an 820
can somebody answer that question for me
I I don't need that I would actually go
for this the 820 is a larger display
right if you're into that yeah I guess I
mean this is a nicer looking oh this is
what micros oh no that that that
supports your argument uh yeah I don't
know unless like this just really feels
lousy I don't know yeah but again I mean
it's you know I hate to keep going back
to the nexus 4 but this is only 50 hours
less than a nexus 4 I hate to keep going
back to the nexus 4 but I really don't
hate it yeah well I mean it's look it's
it's eight gig the the 620 is eight gig
that the nexus 4 8 gig is 299 this is
240 I mean this is just I don't know I
don't really know where to go with that
I mean course this is going back to my
December theme if you're going to
introduce a phone at this time of the
year it's not gonna be the one that's
going to be not your biggest seller and
your biggest attraction right yeah but
this will make a great in the US this
would make a great prepaid device for
for tmobile or four for any of the you
know the cdma carriers or like even
tracfone like a you know tracfone is
going to have to stop ignoring
smartphones at some point and when they
feel that I mean something like this
would make a great device for them or
straight talk or any of those guys I
mean point is that there is a market for
a phone exactly like this in the US but
but I'm sure that that is not where
Nokia intends to roll this thing out
well not also media time but maybe yeah
maybe eventually another thing I'd like
to point out is that this is still much
much much more expensive than the
cheapest Symbian devices that Nokia's
made so you know in terms of in terms of
Licensing in terms of the amount of
horsepower that is required to run
Windows Phone versus the horsepower
those required to one run symbian
there's still a gap there even though
technology is advanced since no key was
making a lot of symbian devices yeah I
mean it should be noted that that this
has a much better screen than virtually
any symbian device a much better
processor than virtually any symbian
device um and and the camera is probably
the only thing that's really on par with
most average Symbian devices well
devoted much better scream symbian
device because the e7 had a really nice
AMOLED display well it's a higher
resolution at least ce7 was that funky
NHD right yeah n HD which has nothing to
do with HD whatsoever it's like like
what it is that's why the editor because
it's not HD yeah bingo but actually
Chris brought up TT mobile in the US and
I think we should you know jump through
our topic list and get on that because I
think they made some pretty big waves
this week or was it this week in any
case like anything who said that and
properly discussed t-mobile's
announcements shall we yeah no we
definitely should I so t-mobile like
kind of blew up the world last week when
it finally announced that it would be
offering Apple devices of some sort next
year they didn't really go into
specifics of which Apple devices they be
carrying or how much it will cost or how
they'll sell them but it's pretty safe
to say that we'll probably see an iphone
on tmobile next year and more than
likely an ipad to go along with it but
then after that t-mobile announced and
made official some rumors that we had
heard before but they made official that
in 2013 the carrier is going for all
value plans which means that it's
essentially dropping subsidies on
smartphone or on cell phones and selling
them at full price
from the plan options that it offers and
you can finance the smartphones but it's
it's not connected to your plan like it
is with a standard subsidized model
which is a pretty big deal and it's kind
of a huge thing that would really will
really kind of separate t-mobile from
the other big carriers in the US yeah I
really like that sorry started to talk
over there but I'm a huge fan of that I
don't know how it's going to work out
for the company because particularly you
know going off the UK experience and
something we mentioned or I mentioned a
podcast or two ago with the The Times
newspaper bundling a nexus 7 tablet
associating some sort of hardware some
sort of material possession with a
service seems to be a way to attract
people to spend money because then it
kind of feel like they getting something
for their money so it's a sweetener for
the deal so that's one reason why they
like to do a substance the second reason
is you subsidize your phone for the
duration for the minimum duration of
your contract right so if you're paying
here in the UK 20 pounds per month let's
say five pounds of that is for you for
fifteen pounds of decks for your data
but then people get lazy the contract
expires they carry on paying the same 20
pounds of up even after you know the
subsidy has already been paid off for
that phone and that works in the
carrier's favor so one of these little
tricks work in the company's favor and
not the consumers favor so from our
point of view I love it like if I'm
going to the US I would just you know go
to tmobile say sell me a phone like I
want to support you guys I like what
you're doing it's good but sticking with
the UK experience there was a retailer
over here one of the bigger you know
department stores we decided is going to
just do away with sales do away with
discounts and just be like this is how
much our stuff costs right so if you
guys want our best price this is it and
we're not doing any sales now what
happened with them is the sales just
crashed so people
just love sales and discounts and even
when they you know BS jcpenney actually
learned that the hard way this year when
what's-his-name from Apple came over and
took over JC Penney's retail operations
they said no more sales and they were
just gonna be like theses are everyday
prices they're good prices we're not
gonna have any more sales and then they
kind of like retracted I'm sorry you're
right i think i might be recording fat
experience rather than the UK yeah yeah
and now you can get some things on sale
it's JC Penney so it will be interesting
to see how this works out for t-mobile I
think like you were saying but it's
great for a consumer because right now
if like I paid full price for my nexus 4
here and I take it to ATT I have to pay
the same amount per month uh that I
would pay if I had signed a contract and
gotten a subsidy on the phone which is
kind of insane because the contract is
supposed to absorb that subsidy and so
if I were going to which tmobile i'd be
paying less per month because i bought
the phone a full price so uh that that
is something that's you know really
great for the consumer but like you were
saying it's gonna be hard to see or
interesting to see if they will turn out
to be profitable for tmobile Chris funny
thoughts well I you know I i think that
the entire industry in the US the entire
Willis industry here is based on hand
waving and and providing maximum spin to
the consumer by the time they actually
open the door and walking to the
brick-and-mortar store and and it's it
that is why there is so much difficulty
in breaking out of the subsidy model
because it's you know again compare you
know from there from the consumers
perspective they're comparing apples to
apples when they look at t-mobile and
they see that they're paying 299 for a
galaxy s3 and they go to AT&amp;amp;T and then
they're paying 189 or perhaps 99 on on
sale or you know whatever it is so that
you know and yes if you do the math you
break it out and see that you're winning
inland in the long run with a value with
tmobile value fine I've been on it
people value planned before and it's I
mean it's it's night and day if you just
run a few not
but at the end of the day it for many
people the question is what is my outlay
when I walk into the store and that is
going to continue to be a question for
many people and timo you know it's weird
because t-mobile has a reputation as a
value carrier in the US and they're
asking these v's value customers these
customers who put a premium on value to
take a leap of faith and pay more
upfront in exchange for really getting
the better value in the long run and you
know this is a society that's addicted
to I want it now and I want it cheaply
so that is going to be a philosophy that
they're going to have to fight so i
think i think what t-mobile will have to
do is make it's uh it's plan options
that allow you to subsidize the phone or
allow you to finance the phone over the
course of two years very apparent so
that when you walk in the door you see
that 199 prices that ninety nine dollar
price and then you're paying twenty
bucks per month for the next twenty
months or whatever until you've paid off
the subsidy but what's cool about that
is once your subsidies paid off that
twenty dollar per month fee is gone and
you are now paying the lower half so you
paid less up front you paid it over the
course of your 20 or 24 months and now
you're paying less per month which
doesn't happen now like when my contract
ends with 80 and I paid technically paid
off my subsidy my bill does not go down
one penny uh which is totally an 18 tds
favor and in my it's against my favor
unless I take another subsidy
immediately okay so yeah I think
t-mobile will definitely have to make
that a very loud obvious thing to
consumers when they walk in the door
yeah yeah agree and justin far in some
additional thoughts for me I am so sorry
to be letting the team down on the beard
front guys keep on looking so lush today
and I'm just I just look like the 17
year old just coming into maturity you
call it wash you call lush i call it my
beard trimmer bro can we can half ago
ago and i haven't replaced it yet but i
like i like your i like your angle
better Vlad oh no no plan I wake up in
time to
trim my beard whatever dan just grew
distance this morning yeah we know oh
yeah no I've decided on the side I'm
gonna grow a nice beard so expect you to
be expected to be up to speed come see
ESI man hopefully data keeps up the team
tradition as well I don't know dieter
when he wears his his uh wafers or
whatever they are he has he has these
new frame city that he's been wearing
and it really freaks me out when he has
those on oh speaking of dieter uh we we
were not supposed to talk about it at
length because because he wants to he
wants to be here when we do it but he is
using a nexus for right now and he has
extensive thoughts on his experience so
upon his return next week expect a long
along I don't know if I called a tirade
but along a speech position from him
yeah I think we'll have a good disguise
yes assuming assuming chris is still
actually in possession of a nexus 4 by
then and assuming my internet does not
degrade further I'm hanging on by a
thread here yeah so teaser teaser there
for next week I think as if you ever had
enough nexus 4 jabbering and blabbering
today next week or less for Nexus or the
week week before that or yeah yeah I I
want to say I think I don't think we
talked about how significant it might be
for that t-mobile is actually going to
be able to carry the iphone four years
no t-mobile has attributed subscriber
losses to the fact that it doesn't have
the iphone and now that's going to be
changing next year and that's kind of
little and they also have it is not just
subscriber losses but also the fact that
they haven't had a spectrum synergy with
anybody right like there are the only
ones in the u.s. using AWS for 3g at
least among the Nationals and and so
that at least early on I think that was
a major barrier for them and and finally
they got to the point where they can do
it I I think I you know this is another
case would be fascinating to
on the inside to be a fly on the wall
during these and negotiations because I
think that sprint in order to get that
jump the tmobile did not get paid dearly
and they will be paying dearly for many
years to come and dan has his head to
defend that decision in public on a
number of occasions I don't think the
tmobile needed to uh to stoop to quite
the level that sprint it to get this
device right and i agree i think that um
one of the executives actually said that
it would be making money off of the
iphone with an ear so we definitely did
not have to put out the huge huge
deposit or payment that sprint had to do
yeah and ranking money off the oven
within a year is exactly what sprint
hasn't done yeah right which is rough it
is rough it's rough time to be a carrier
on the USB speaking of sprint we're just
going to segue right into our next story
which is that this news kind of came out
earlier this morning that sprint it
might be talking to clearwire to buy out
the rest of clearwire sprint currently
owns um at this moment I think it's 51%
so there are talks now from CNBC that's
saying that it might be interested in
buying the remaining forty nine percent
of clearwire that it doesn't own and I'm
not really sure why they do that see so
this is like you know that male and
female friend you have that like you
know kind of pretend they're not dating
but they are and like you know it's been
going on for years and and sometimes
they're dating other people but you know
really you know that is somehow they're
gonna end up together this is exactly
that situation these companies have been
flirting with each other since since
before I was even writing about phones I
think and they they need to just hook up
they need to seal the deal they need to
hook up they need to have beautiful
babies together they you know sprint
briefly sold out for a long time they
had held I think it was 51-percent of
clearwire sold off just enough to no
longer be a majority shareholder which
was a decision that I didn't understand
at all and then southbank swoops in and
I think they were like why did you guys
do that so then they promptly
they probably bought back a majority
holding and now they just want to bring
it entirely in-house makes sense to me
clearwire has a ton of spectrum even
though it's it's largely considered to
not be super valuable but it does you
know it's a huge block and Sprint is
like all carriers could use as much
spectrum as it can possibly get its
hands on so I with this this deal would
not surprise me at all and frankly I've
thought of these two companies it's kind
of being one of the same for five-plus
years so yeah I mean it has been exactly
like you described a kind of a romantic
relationship between them and you know
clearwire must have done something wrong
that offended sprint sprint backed off
and and now you know spread iron came in
would smack him upside the head and said
you know you really should be getting
getting along with clearwire well I
think what what clearwire did that
offended sprint was it didn't deliver
you know I mean there was at that period
last year when they were first
discussing network vision and they were
in talks with light squared and you know
sprint had set a number of goals for
clearwire to meet in order to win a
td-lte contract and so there was that
whole there was a and and there was some
concern on sprint send about the amount
of debt that clear where I was carrying
and sprint kind of didn't want to be
involved with that and I don't blame
them because I their own financial
troubles so they really didn't want to
mix finances yet they were just not at
that point in the relationship and
that's right that's right they didn't
want to combine bank accounts and I'm
playing them I wonder if they're going
to sign a prenup that's that's the real
question uh so yeah uh so you know it I
think like you said Chris it's probably
very likely that this will happen but it
hasn't happened yet still a rumor what
is what is the impact going to be on you
know the guys to buy the phones and use
two phones I don't think it'll have much
impact because there's already an
agreement in place for Clearwire's
upcoming
LTE network to augment capacity in the
markets that that sprint is rolling out
LTE in like for instance like you know
it's not good for for covering a wide
area because it's such a high frequency
but they can they can deploy like spot
coverage in places like Times Square
where they need to really blanket it and
beef up the via the the capacity so that
was the intention and I think that
that's still the intention but
presumably there's some financial
advantage or you know but investor
advantage to having all that all those
licenses in house owned by sprint
instead of having an arrangement with
clearwire to farm it out I mean it you
know hey I think this is more a legal
and financial maneuver than it is a
technical or product one I don't think
that this will really change the the
short to mid-term strategy it up at all
actually okay and I have one more
question about us carries this was kind
of a big news story and I'm struggling
to understand why some of you guys can
lie to me the 911 SMS texting service in
2014 why does that matter was a
significant to you guys well I i can't
speak for Dan but i know that i prefer
to text people instead of calling them
and 911 is no different like I you know
I don't want to like go through the
pleasantries of hello how are you doing
like you know what's up like I just want
to like text and be like yo you know I
broke my leg okay yeah it's just more
efficient right like yeah I think it's
just the convenience factor for people
that want to use it it'll be there and
right you know your grandma will still
dial 911 and I don't know I don't know
how how like teletype services work for
911 but I there might be an impact for
like deaf and hard of hearing to I don't
know there's Larry might be that aspect
I I could just envision you using
something like cereal google now put
your input by voice text message and
then say send to 911 III would test it
but I've already but dialed 911
like 20 times this year I don't want on
my one x so don't you do that a ton at
ctia this year yes it kept like to this
day I don't know what was happening for
this one x I kept pulling it out of my
pocket and I was connected to 911 I just
kept hanging up like instead of talking
to the operator which is probably not
the right thing to do and I assume that
at any minute a cop car was just gonna
roll up on me and like all me off to
jail for at least 90 one because it got
pretty ridiculous toward the end of the
week I'm going to assume the phone is
like calling for a rescue because you
didn't love it enough yeah that's
entirely possible I was yeah it's
probably like making fun of it and it
felt uncomfortable um yeah I don't know
I to the sky don't know but it what I
ended up doing was I I kept the phone in
my pocket with the screen facing me and
I i turned it around so the screen was
facing out and that seemed to stop it so
i don't know whatever that's a good
consumer usage tip and also a great
segue i have a great segue because uh i
think is DITA who brought up the 1x plus
review he did for AT&amp;amp;T but before we get
to that I'm gonna segue in the midst of
the segway and just say that today the
11th of was soaked in December is when
my one x here in the UK got android 4.1
a level of December so they claim that
these rollouts of the software updates
are staggered but they're like staggered
drunk honestly it's has the ATT or the
US version of the wallets gotten into it
4.1 yet I don't think it has I don't
think it has but you know this is a
thinner frustrates me right because guys
like HTC would just say we're starting
to roll out the next version of android
right and they say that will do that in
October and then two dozen people
somewhere across the globe get it in
October you know Tabitha and then you
know a few more people get in November
and then the leg is like myself get in
December and then you know the first of
every month comes around and people you
know right outcomes with headlines like
two years after its release android too
I'm free is still more than half of all
android phones well of course it is
right because if you're gonna do rollout
do it properly if you say I'm rolling
out October I better finish in October
and as if you're not frustrated new with
one x+ launch actually is a launcher
October and the weather HTC phrase it
sounded exactly like a whole bunch of
people going to get the android 4.1
update in november for the older devices
and how much people going to get in
december but a GC really really wanted
to push the narrative of this role that
will begin in october and i think it
might have done but it'll say probably
to like just a few people and it
frustrates me you know because you make
these announcements they're technically
true and accurate that you're rolling
out the update but it isn't getting to
everybody and at least people frustrated
um and i haven't actually played with
the phone so I don't even know what the
benefit of and your focus on it yet but
google now is in there somewhere yeah
you'll probably have to dig for it but
yeah yeah it's actually kind of weird
because after the update happened it
said this is a place to update for
google search which i think is the thing
that turns it into google now yes yes it
is yeah but i can wrap up this segue and
say that the one x+ on ATT comes with
4.1 pretty loaded as i have five min a
segue and answer n sense for Plus 4.1
with sense for plus another box which is
cool aside from being a generation
behind now um and so I mean I wish
dieter was here to speak more about this
just because he's the one who spent a
good amount of time with the one x+ but
uh based on his conclusions despite the
fact that it's got a slightly faster
processor and a slightly bigger battery
um it's not a huge huge difference from
the original 1x that 18d has been
selling for most of this year the
battery didn't last a super long time as
far as much longer than the 1x and they
didn't feel that much faster with the
faster processor so I have a theory
about the one x+ and
and I apologize if I've already offered
this theory in fact now that I think
about i'm pretty sure that i have
offered it I'm offered again for new
viewers I think that you know in in the
US state of the the one x+ is only
available in black I think that's
probably true in Europe too right Vlad
no it's the other way around in Europe
the one x+ is only available to map
black whereas on AT&amp;amp;T i think is
available in white though but no no that
the 1x the one axis is white the one x+
is black oh yeah I was just talking
about the one x+ I'm sorry ok yeah so so
my theory is that you know I complained
about this in the 1x review and I I saw
a lot of complaints about unlike XDA
devs and some other places that on the
1x the the the case had a tendency to
get really dirty really fast and and I
think that's because it's matt white and
that's why other manufacturers
specifically nokia when they do a white
device they do a glossy because it
doesn't it doesn't capture the dirt like
am at a matte finish does and i think
that HTC learned that lesson on the One
X so I think that they specifically
opted not to do a white version of the
one x+ because of that problem and they
didn't want to like bother to go through
the retooling of doing like a glossy
shelf or do they just decide that that
there wasn't worth their time and that's
kind of a shame just because I thought
that the the the 1x look really nice and
white when it was clean it just got
dirty really fast yeah it's definitely
more striking when you're looking at it
then then the black version which is
just kind of every day all black you
know the the circle around the camera on
the back is also black it's just another
black slab phone right well of course
you say retooling but actually at their
then I from using the word correctly i'm
just going to use something journey i
said and pretend I know what talking
about the shampoos on the edges of the
1x i'm sure i'm using it incorrectly but
yeah the edges and the size of the one
is actually glossy the white one
oh yeah you're right there yeah just
have the extra little bit of gas so the
tools are there to make glass surface
yeah Lincoln age is there for the sides
but I just want to raise one more point
and I don't know why I'm harshing on htc
so much today but the branding with the
one series has just gone just down the
toilet I'm sorry it's it's a nightmare
things like the one sv as a product
maybe it has a reason maybe it has a
place to exist but the name is garbage
because it tells me nothing what is the
1s and what is the one sv how do i
distinguish how do i differentiate
between them what is the one XL versus
the one x+ how do you is someone who ya
got it right exactly one of the x which
just launched on eighteen t the other
day i literally don't know what that is
it is well i mean you really don't need
to bother yourself with it but like for
a consumer that's looking at the One X
and the 1dx the one DX is a
significantly lower end model but you
can't tell it from the name and exactly
exactly I mean this is first of all this
is a problem with dslrs and cameras but
the guys who sell those things get away
with it for the most part because it
costs so freaky much that people do to
research anyway right and they're not
currently available usually yeah but but
but it's also like you know the d90 and
these have a thousand how could you ever
make the connection between those two
even though they're so close connected
and I mean a great example for this is
electric toothbrushes it's a spectacular
example because go in you take a look is
like ah yeah one is a 500 another one is
a 600 and then you go to 1000 and 3000
and nothing of matches up nothing it
makes sense and you just have to like
read random weird bro specs and as the
point HTC isn't selling electric
toothbrushes it isn't selling niche
product is trying to sell like devices
which us you know just the accessibility
you know so it's I I think that HTC
wanted what Samsung has with the galaxy
brand because Samsung literally puts
galaxy on every single smartphone it
makes these days I did which I don't
think is a great thing because then you
have things like the Galaxy S Blaze 4G
which is not as high end as a galaxy s2
dan dan you're forgetting you're
figuring the achieve oh the team okay so
so I say galaxy is on the Android
smartphone so so all of samsung's
android smartphone line has galaxy in
its name and I think HTC wanted that
with the 1-series but when they pitch
the 1 series when it was first announced
it made it feel like it was a premium
line and and yeah just going to be on
every single phone that the may affect
the manufacturer yeah I think the
biggest Inc shin is Samsung in terms of
advertising and promotion makes the
galaxy s3 so clearly the flagship and
differentiates it so clearly from all
the other garbage galaxy s whatever's
the fact that it promotes it kind of
separates it I mean aside from note and
note to ads I don't know if I've ever
seen an ad for another galaxy phone that
wasn't a galaxy s2 or galaxy s3 exactly
and and look the other thing is HTC I
think HTC's biggest mistake was to make
the 1s so desirable and then put a phone
above it his range you know and then
you're like which one is the flagship
again yeah because the 1x yes is the
flagship it so the specs and all that
stuff but the 1s is actually the more
attractive phone for a lot of people and
like you say that it felt like the 1
series which is going to be premium
premiere all right so maybe if that was
the case just keep the 1x in the 1s and
don't add anything to it yeah you have
to differentiate you have to stick with
like to maybe free phones at most that
people are going to want to know about
me but we don't have intentions pants
that can cover that many devices you got
to give it a couple generations to
establish whether they do something
similar to what Samsung is doing though
because they might very well have a 1 X
2 0 1 x 31 x for that will just you know
carry them forward on the flagship line
and then whatever they do below that is
just kind of meaningless
nonsense which is what we have with
Samsung but look less of trouble even if
you go into the store with 1 X 2 right
yeah and and then you see next year wax
and a wax plus how do you know that the
1x2 is like the really brand-new awesome
thing the other one sounds superlative
as well it's true it's a good point well
the other thing that uh that HTC kind of
failed with as well was uh Samsung's got
in its galaxy line on every carrier with
the name galaxy in it whereas at least
here in the US HTC has not been able to
do that with the one series they've got
a variant on sprint that has its own
name and a variance on verizon they have
their own names and then 18 he's got the
1x and t-mobile's got that one s 18 he's
got the 1x plus and this other one DX so
it doesn't feel like a cohesive thing at
all when you look at the grand spectrum
of of offerings a GC has right and as
far as phones go when I remember when
the evo 4g LTE came out like like I like
that one better than I liked the 1x
which then what X was supposed to be the
flagship um you know irregardless of
Sprint's limited LTE network you know
the hardware was nicer on that the evo
and it just was I don't know better
phone in my opinion but and as the other
thing that HTC is also sabotaging itself
with the droid DNA okay fine you sewed
the droid DNA branning to verizon you
hit you had to do that I get it ac's
income and profits have been kind of on
a downstream or downward trend for a
while now so you saw you talk to verizon
a lot of people do it is forgivable it's
not that much of a sin but then it's
called the Jade butterfly in Japan and
school is going to be called just the
butterfly in Europe which meshes with
the 1-series not at all
and that's that's the end that's also
the droid DNA for verizon essentially
yes yeah this is loud message to max
yeah yeah I mean that's a that's uh I
think that HTC this goes back something
we've been saying for a solid year now
which is the HTC does not have the the
same level of power in the market that
Samsung does and that's I mean it's a
huge problem and you just wish I mean
you want so badly for HTC to just you
know stand up to the carriers and say no
screw it you can't have the droid DNA
and then just like you know slap it off
the table and then storms from out I
wish that's how that meaning went
between HTC and verizon but
realistically HTC needs as much business
as it can possibly get yeah so they they
end up you know bending over and doing
all sorts of ridiculous things but I
mean you still I mean yep their
intentions were very pure when they
originally introduced the one axon and
1's and it's kind of gone downhill from
there I I still think that the default
lies on them for the XL and next plus
yes because that's a global branding but
some of these other products
specifically the droid DNA and the evo
4g LTE those are entirely uh HTC's fault
and I'm going for another segue smash
out of the ballpark by asking who else
do you think really needs to get some
carrier by and with new devices what do
you mean I'm segwaying Chris check the
typically you're not taking the button
debate yeah I I feel we know that a rim
once it finally does uh do E's have to
talk about blackberry and all right why
am I know you get you guys are terrible
I'm sorry I'm the cynic I've been hating
this whole podcast and now I'm the most
optimistic guy I'm the most excited to
see this teaser rooms first okay oh let
me clarify this a teaser is very
generous of what this is because I can't
even like call it a teaser it's a
quarter of a render
the back of a device that may be the
first blackberry 10 smartphone other
work dad I'm sorry I know you American
but that is exactly how you tease I know
you'd want another column with trailers
wedding is I drinking like I feel like a
teasers just giving it too much credit
it's like it on such a tease if I yeah
okay fine vlad savov teasing expert if
you if you look at his business card
that's actually what it says mom yeah I
mean look I I don't care about
blackberry until they give until they
give me a reason to care about them and
they have not yet done that and I will
reevaluate when I see these frickin
phones dead okay that's all it is dm7 is
out now out of beta later and you can do
voice Wi-Fi calling BBM voice come on 20
your BBM party I mean I i can't i can't
tell if you're trolling me or if you're
seriously trying to like get me excited
about this product is um like there was
such a time with BBM was like the
messaging platform and and i'm just sad
for that like I was never on it I was
never one of the attics but nowadays the
only people who were still on it I kind
of embarrassed about the fact that still
on it just yes that well I remember when
I carried a blackberry full time I ended
up using text messages more than BBM
because I think at that time it was
still before everybody had BlackBerry's
night nobody to BBM with anyways and I
will never forgive rim for using hacks
codes as the primary means of like
communicating like you wanted to add a
body to BBM you had to give him like
this insane like eight digit hex number
like what why I mean until until they
did the thing with the bar codes which
was kind of smart it was like you know
pre NFC pairing types of things or yeah
but how about a word how about how about
a username like right yes no I oh man
sorry look I had my last blackberry was
a curve 8900 which I wanted to love it
was at each letter in one of mine too is
it is a t-mobile branded curve 8900
night hey guys yeah that's getting up is
one of the last trackball BlackBerry's I
think but it I'm nobody's like you
you're not missing out much from CH 11
see from the very late to be pretty sad
of a true sad but true yeah cuz the
curve 8900 was a it has high res display
it was hvga or something wasn't it yeah
it was 480 x 320 I think so boom yeah i
mean that's that's pretty serious
display uh gpio that i will say i think
i've said this many times before and I
know Nia I will agree with me on this as
well that it was definitely the best
looking blackberry that rim has ever
produced even better looking than the
9900 uh and and I'll continue to say
that I'm sure after the the blackberry
10 devices come out because it was just
it was at the time it was cool looking
the keyboard was great had a nice screen
um that was you know very competitive at
the time and it actually had Wi-Fi which
was rare for blackberry devices at the
time even though it was only edge and
yet no 3g um you know I'd like the 8900
I don't know man the the bold with the
the denim that cover I mean putting up
some some serious competition for the
you 900 there but i i i agree with you
what what ultimately led me to return it
to tmobile was the email experience
which i don't think as highly ironic yes
it is but you know i think that they
were so hell-bent for so many years
going back to the 90s under on
delivering a good exchange mail
experience that they you know they did
that the cost of like really paying any
attention to any other mail services
that came along and you know of course
in my case it was gmail and they didn't
do to a sink and i like to this day I'm
not sure they do it well yeah they they
introduced a 22 way sink eventually
but it works awful the last the last
time I used it I was reviewing the
blackberry 7 phones when they hit the
market yeah it was it was like why am I
constantly having to check mark this
email read twice either I'm marking it
read online it's not marked read on the
phone or vice versa it's driving me
insane now dan I'm going to put you on
the spot a little bit d and you have to
be honest do you still have a playbook
uh yes I do and why is that oh come on
is that it's just going to dig it up
from the top of I don't know where it is
at the moment but I do have a playbook
and you know why because I want to know
what it'll be like with blackberry 10 I
was gonna be really impressed if it was
like right as its up of your gadget
shelf you know I was using it as an
alarm clock for a long time Oh is
speaking of that I have to have to give
a little shout out to a producer Brendan
because i was looking at because part of
our hangout is we get to look at him and
his handsome handsome face but i would
just switch in between tabs at at one
point he wasn't there and I saw the
background and it looked like a coat
hanger on the wall but it wasn't
actually a coat hanger it was just
headphones it's just surreal man like to
do the heads of wall hanger where he's
just stacked up headphones like I
actually want to go and visit his place
and try all those that but see I regret
I'm jealous i only have had my beats
sorry not gonna try to hide it anymore i
wish i could put a troll face on you
instead of just on me ah yeah no I I
look I'm not going to get into a beats
discussion but let's just say they sound
great when they're plugged into my bose
airwave or whatever that
six-hundred-dollar FM radio is called
you know talking about right it's the
one to us it's like it's like an alarm
clock with like you know one the benz
air right yeah yeah yeah yeah I've seen
that I'm TVC like the 20-minute
explanation of well I remember the
infomercials they had for that thing
we're like so long and these people were
like this is the most remarkable thing
ever yeah and look it is a candle right
and if you use an almost peak the candle
stays on because it's so strong enough
but you bend the air right and and this
is perfect because it matches the advent
of movie which stinks rights is perfect
and year-round the code and the end the
thing still has not only does it still
have a CD slot but it's available with a
3 CD changer in the year 2012 guys my
first car a Chrysler LeBaron a
rusted-out Chrysler LeBaron I was very
excited about installing a six-cd
changer in it this was nineteen ninety
something and here we are in the year
2012 and bows is offering three CD
changers for an FM radio for six hundred
dollars so i just want to point out that
i found my blackberry playbook yeah if
you guys want to hang out for 20 minutes
of the boot oh that's nice that's a nice
kindle fire din yeah dude has a nice
last generation kindle fire kudos but I
proof nice there is a question here
though which I'm sure many observant
listeners will be asking why the heck
are you guys wearing over the head
headphones with just a podcast okay I
want to clear that up because actually I
really like these headphones and they
sound great but I was tearing my office
apart today trying to find any our
monitors that I own uh and i cannot find
out to save my life so I'm using my over
ear headphones again do you just have
one pair of in ear monitors or is there
a particular set that you like to
podcast with there's a particular set
that I like because because they dig the
wire goes behind my head and they sound
really great and like I guess I could
use ear pods if I really wanted to
punish myself but ya dumb be
do that to yourself yeah they hurt well
I'm just a huge fan of beats products no
I look at these are actually these are
growing on me when I first put these on
these are beats mixers and when I first
put them on I thought they were the
worst things on the planet because
they're like the cups are just small
enough so they rest their you know their
honor instead of over the air that's us
psupero supra-aural is that the
technical term for desk for you audio
file nerds at which wich mine are as
well there there's they're called
supra-aural they just sit on top of your
ear yeah but they probably don't want to
they probably don't make your ears want
to fall off is my guess but these do and
they've I've grown on them over the
years over the months however long it's
been since since I got these and I no
longer despised them I merely dislike
them there's an improvement wow that is
like a 45-degree downward angle thumbs
down it's like it's not complete thumbs
down just kind of creeping up right
that's exactly right but I'm not topic I
mean I'm just going to wrap up the
suffolk by name dropping my favorite set
of headphones which a lot of our
producer guys also use which is the sony
MDR v6 and MDR 7506 and the v6 is
actually as old as me because apparently
it was first introduced in suffolk in
the mid 80s and just hasn't been changed
and then the MDR 7506 was introduced in
the 90s and again hasn't been changed
it's just that tank like river of a pair
of MDR v700 here which are completely
unrelated what the number is close and
dr as mud poise grace this is exactly
what is getting at it's like you know
with the HTC naming schemes like the v6
7506 is one series visa hundred all of
that all of this modern Sony stuff is
garbage to be honest with you for our
cell phones go I mean no please PLEASE
glad
but relative to the 80s and 90s stuff it
is garbage because like Sony showed
itself in the foot by just making stuff
that didn't break and lost it for
decades ya know I I yeah a tease sony
gear is like primo um in fact I wish I
still had my mini disc players circa 90
what 93 94 the HUD about 94 95 a thing
yeah um yeah it was the bomb and I miss
it but those days are gone never to
return poor mini days i will not her i
will never own spinning media again if I
can avoid it of any kind I agree that's
a very notable go and I think it's very
achievable one nowadays as well yeah I
mix but next year I'm gonna buy a pond
oh I just want to point that out i would
i would like you to fall i'm not i'm not
doubting you because i'm sure you will
but i would like to see it when you do
so let's try things up by talking about
a few apps and if you have related
situations as skirmishes yeah it seems
like the pet i don't mean to cut you off
lad but i just want to get this in there
that it seemed like the past week has
been like all about pictures and filters
no by all means this finished ella
census carrion so yeah it was like you
know we had last week Snapseed finally
google finally released snapseed for
android it bought Snapseed earlier this
year Snapseed was a pretty popular app
for iOS that let you do a lot of tweaks
and adjustments to your photos as well
as add filters and things like that and
it's finally available on android it's
really great it runs really great on
android and it feels just like the iOS
version which is a good thing so so that
was released then and let's make mention
the end of the iOS version used to be
five dollars you got chopped down to
free yessir then is very generous with
that yeah as far as the users
perspective is this is an absolute net
positive it's awesome right and then
soso snapseed is kind of like a little
bit more advanced than your typical
instagram it choirs a little bit more
work on your end but you can get great
results but then yesterday
Instagram released a new version of its
app that added a new filter totally
redesigned the iOS camera and added some
integration with foursquare which is
really cool and then you know out of
nowhere well not really had network they
had been rumored but then Twitter's like
oh we're going to have apps our apps are
going to have mole of photo filters so
here's our absolute photo filters to
compete directly pretty much directly
with Instagram so there are so many ways
to make your photos look like crap now
it's amazing absolutely and I will say
this that I've been using the nexus for
a lot and I really hate the camera and
none of these apps make the camera good
so I'm just wondering about twitter is
it just the official twitter app that
now should have photo filters in it
right yeah it's your official app for
android and iOS when you upload a photo
you now have the ability to add a filter
to it i'm guessing the update hasn't
wrote add to my phone today the update
actually just hit this afternoon so
check no it was for iOS was delayed
about a day for whatever reason and by
the way I should mention i'm gonna i'm
just going to plug a report that just
went live on our site a little site
called the verse calm recently written
by the amazing ellis hamburger he penned
an editorial on why a twitter should not
be focusing on these filters and i
wholeheartedly agree so even if you
haven't read that report yet please do
so is this making your head explodes
because i know you're such a huge fan of
filters in instagram uh my my head
exploded regarding filters like 18
months ago there's nothing left to
explode it's just my my head is just an
open you know an exploded you know pile
of like meet at this point i yeah i
think that that battle is lost when the
Instagram certainly isn't going anywhere
twitter has a few users and i think are
going to do a very respectable job of
continuing to push the retro photo
agenda for years to come which makes me
very very sad but what can you do
I'm not I'm going to continue if I the
good fight I'm going to upload
unretouched photos I'm a crop under
certain circumstances as needed but I
will not check out to protect the
innocent you might die crop right but I
will not you have my word I will not
upload a retro-styled photo to twitter
if you follow me on twitter which you
should please do cuz chris Beckham's
woulda your heights as is finished I
never I never left twitter i just i did
there was a there's a long time between
two tweets that's all there's an
extended break between two tweets that's
all right but yeah I mean I think what
we need to discuss here is uh but I mean
is the thing that everybody's discussing
which is Twitter's protectionism
basically because Twitter first of all
removed Instagram previews so wait no no
yoake that was Instagram that removed
their functionality oh yeah yeah
instagram turn the Instagram with
supporting Twitter's cards functionality
which allowed yeah on the native Twitter
website and apps to see the preview of
the image Instagram went ahead and
turned that off ah interesting so maybe
maybe Instagram did that because it got
wind of the fact that Twitter was going
to do some photos maybe it was like a
pre-emptive move maybe I think I think
Instagram was doing the you were you
were saying the twitter is being
protectionists I think Instagram was one
being protectionist right right i mean
when i was a driver's instagram my
perception was twitter was you know
making the viewing of instagram in which
is tougher by making it yeah not pretty
in the timeline you have to click on the
link in order to look at an Instagram
image and then coming in with its own
more convenient for the filtering effort
but if his around food is all support
then yeah I guess I guess nobody's
particularly clean this one there's no
more thanks for the users because uh you
know it was a nice thing that you could
easily see without having to you know
jump out of your timeline or
dream too yeah but ever you get the
angle from Instagram perspective why do
I do that because you have to click the
link and now that instagram has a web
viewer that it didn't always have you
can like and comment right from there
and it drives the likes and comments
pageants that's my answer I think that's
it that's a fair guess and also there's
obviously the fact that under the
Facebook umbrella I think they have a
very different set of agendas than they
did as an independent company so there's
that consideration as well you guys
think I'll ever get instagram my
playbook yeah I think you have a better
chance of running iOS on that playbook
but it's just my take actually I think
somebody managed to hack iOS apps to run
the playbook a few months ago yeah what
I had a thing but you're making a hurry
up no I don't think he is gonna say a
few months ago I mean like yeah for two
ago it's like when people were actually
fascinated by the PlayBook Sofia way I
did not mean to turn on that that smiley
face sorry if anyone caught that um yeah
I mean I I don't know anyone would do
that I don't know why why anyone would
spend a minute of their time porting iOS
apps to play book but you know yeah this
happened to june so flood was definitely
right okay well kudos to the three
playbook owners and their newfound
catalogue of iOS apps i suppose stay
strong guys black boots hence coming I'm
devices but it's coming and then UVO old
school and you have street cred and
stuff just an update uh word where to
the splash screen now oh nice progress
yeah you're not serious then you know
you haven't been booting that thing for
like seven minutes heavy I I think the
battery might have been at its minimum
and I had to plug it in and then it
finally started bleeding but it's pretty
much amazing so let's just draw a quick
conclusion of this google takes over a
photo app in company and it makes it
university better by introducing it to
android and cutting the price to free on
iOS facebook does the same thing and
makes our lives more difficult to the
mine is that the balance of what's
happening here that's a very poignant
observation glad i like it should write
that down so Google good Facebook evil
oh I don't know about that that might be
drawing broad strokes but what do I know
I mean I'm happy with making that
statement you can quote me on that if
you want to put it on like a product
book somewhere the flats ever so kook
was good at Facebook is evil I'm five
over that you can use it um but in the
battle of good versus evil Apple and
Microsoft have been jabbing and fighting
at each other again apparently
reportedly and you know people can
choose which one you think is good of a
shot i think is evil but this relates to
the iOS skydrive app which is being held
back and the issue also seems to relate
to to to the office for iOS application
which remember for so freaking long and
i don't know who cares battle that much
anymore oh i don't know i think it went
when it does get released it'll be huge
yeah i think it's a very big office in
their ipad and that's it has a very big
deal and it's kind of like the trump
card that Microsoft is holding with the
surface now is that it offers a quote
real office experience right yeah I mean
like I think about it and I'm like there
are ways for me to make charts and there
are ways for me to make documents
outside of office I haven't used office
I'm
this up fool yeah it's me free use yeah
no I i I'm I'm with you Vlad but you're
not the with with all due respect you're
not the target demographic for this for
this product I think that there are
millions and millions of business people
who rely on office to get their job done
on a daily basis and relying pretty
specific features of it and want to use
iOS and want to use iPads and want to
better integrate those devices into
their lives and the lack of a true
office experience is holding that back
and and to be fair you know at this
point there are a number of third-party
office replacements for iOS that I think
do a pretty respectable job but there's
no replacement for the real thing so I
think that they are going to sell
licenses of Office for iPad in spades
when it comes out if it comes out when
it comes out ever we'll see right and I
mean that's the wrangling i think it's
it's always about money with these
things anyway but it's like they can't
sort out their agreement for office for
iOS and this thing thats also holding
back SkyDrive for iOS which just got
rolled out for the xbox Xbox Live and
xbox 360 so it kind of puts a little bit
of a kink in Microsoft's plans to make
SkyDrive a universal classics you know
you were successful one right I know you
are there any third party SkyDrive
clients for iOS or no third party well
there's the SkyDrive app itself for iOS
not a dozen is this dude no SkyDrive for
iOS am I crazy am i high an actual app
but nothing is this um yeah no
definitely does the problem is that it
hasn't so oh so it hasn't been updated
and Microsoft wants to update it and
Apple is holding the update back because
of the subscription argument that
they're happening all right yeah the
subscription aspect yep yeah I was just
insulting my iPad Mini product plug
there
um to check with respect that that check
in five to seven business days um yeah I
I like skydrive but I like it best on
windows phone and when I'm not using a
Windows Phone I I don't care as much
about it but yeah which-which i should
mention is also my excuse for just
completely not knowing the fact that it
exists in iOS right what what what
service to use why do you drop box to
use these Google Drive would you use
yeah ninety-nine percent drop box like I
made the switch to google drive once and
that thing was trying to sync up every
single file in it every time I turned it
on I mean I had issues with it you know
I was going hose is around the time the
google drivers introduced it I was like
you know skirt drop drop box let's go
with Google Drive SVO Google things I
think with with drop boxes if you're
like a fan of phones and you're buying
sell or you know switching phones a lot
you know HTC offers a deal on money up
its phones that give you 25 or 50
gigabytes free samsung does the same
thing at a lot of its phone so it's like
I've had in my possession enough HTC and
Samsung phones where it's like I don't
think I'll ever leave dropbox just cuz i
have so much storage they're available
to me yeah yeah i'm gonna use that as a
segue and say that december 13th samsung
galaxy camera none of phone no
particular camera but it's coming to
verizon and that has the extra forty
eight gigabytes of dropbox storage free
and LTE LTE hey that's neat what you
know it's really you know it's really
really weird about it this might be the
first device ever released on an LTE
carrier that doesn't have any form of
cellular fall back to another network
its LTE only it doesn't have cdma and I
can't think I'm sure I'm going to get
corrected by somebody but I cannot think
of another device that is LTE only good
no i agree i think you're right Chris
and what makes it interesting is that if
you do buy this from verizon your
wireless connectivity is useless
anywhere outside of verizon's network
and it's also useless outside of
verizon's LTE footprint so if you happen
to live in an area with with shaky LTE
coverage or you're still in a cdma only
area it's useless to you and it made me
wonder like now that this LTE model is
out why did an ATT just released an LTE
version of its own and my theory is that
Samsung designed it with only one
wireless radio in mind and it could use
one wireless radio didn't have room or
the power management for two so since
ATT's LTE network is much smaller than
verizon's at this point certainly not
nationwide at all 18teen one with HSPA
which is a much much larger footprint on
and also has the advantage of being able
to be used in most most parts of the
world right and it should be noted that
18t definitely made a special exception
for this device because they have long
since required LTE support on any
smartphone you can't as an oem you
cannot even present a phone to AT&amp;amp;T that
doesn't support LTE at this point so
they made a loophole for this gal to the
camera no that's point Chris it's not a
phone it well I mean it's look it's
basically a smartphone with a giant
camera on it minus the earpiece yeah but
yeah could you I mean you could you may
answer the question you've em to the
next question which is the freakin a
face to the microphone because you I
mean could you run skype on it does that
bluetooth could you connect a headset to
it and run skype well yes another new
video calls on it except that there's no
front-facing camera so like the your
your part your Co caller or whatever
will only see whatever the front of the
camera sees yeah but you could do a
voice call on skype to presumably
presumably it um yeah yeah no I think
you can I talk on from now I feel like
we covered it in the review let me check
I'm sure that covenant knew he then show
you my only phone I'm just gonna carry a
galaxy camera everywhere no do you make
me sad
like honestly I would be happier to see
people going with the nokia 808 just as
their own phone like a galaxy camera
would be easier to haul around than a
note to okay so so it's like it's easier
to hold it around the big ass I think
that's a that's a that's a stretch there
Chris because it's like as thick as for
note tues stack together wait wait wait
how much does how much does a teen he
charged for the galaxy camera they
charge for 99 for the camera that's 10
bucks a month to edit your mobile share
plan okay so you can get a you can get
an international unlock galaxy camera
from expanses 4509 imagine their number
retailers that sell for around the same
price not to say there's any reason to
get it unlocked Galaxy camera person to
care at all as Chris quietly clicks the
buy button yeah I know chris is looking
at it and you cease to have limited
availability it is like okay I need to
back trip right now all right I need to
buy two of these want to keep new as
Alex and I i wish i wish that that was a
joke but that's sadly close to reality
and what just happened okay Chris um I'm
right here you know expenses is I'm
pretty sure expenses in UK operation so
if you want me to buy you some gear and
bring it over for CSG you just tell me
dude Vlad you know something expanses is
a UK operation but they're us division
is headquartered very near to me so I
can actually run it actually a century
it's like a two-hour drive there are in
the middle of nowhere in Illinois but I
could I could run down there and get
some galaxy cameras I'm gonna show up to
CES with like a dozen galaxies cameras
for no reason but the best thing I was
wondering actually is like what gadget
device any piece of electronics is there
that's actually cheaper here in the UK
but other thieves in states I'm
struggling to come up well if it's if
it's offered here in the states or you
mean because if we have to import it
like a Christian
no that like you know the Galaxy Nexus
when it came out the GSM model is like
costs eight hundred and fifty dollars to
import yeah but generally I mean most
things like I don't know i mean i'm sure
kindle fire HD s of being given away
with newspapers over there in the US by
that whereas the UK price pretty much
the u.s. price but translated into the
other currency how's the thing that
always pops we have yeah but you guys
have free health care's oh yeah so you
know better education you guys are three
you guys have free health care great 3g
service that gets awesome speed it's
pretty much wherever you go so right how
do i had a tiny little LTE network yeah
i was 14 it's still bigger than
t-mobile's LTE network in the US so and
might be bigger than sprint's might be
bigger than sprint's yeah although
although i will actually announce this
exclusively on the verge mobile show
actually it's not exclusive at all no uh
sprint's LTE network in chicago is
intermittently showing up now even
though they haven't announced it is live
they said it was coming soon and
somebody tweeted at me the other day
that that in fact i think it was our own
moderator dr. dr. techno PhD who first
clued me into this that the network is
trying to show up in places so you have
a sprint LTE device in chicago check it
out and be sure to thank dr. techno PhD
and comments that that he noticed this
um I don't have any sprint LTE devices
so I can't can't check it out and on
that note we can wrap it up yeah I think
so we have nothing else to talk about I
feel like it's such a short podcast I
don't know man we're going on an hour
and a half yeah even if acting like you
guys are ever your major delays i'm
gonna talk to you guys forever
you forget Chris oh oh face to show up
that's it I'm done no more troll faces I
promise I think it fell that's why
because we like before the podcast we
can anticipate slut not even being able
to see your beautiful face Chris I glued
all of that drama and connectivity
issues that's the place talking about
yeah I kind of want to get Chris riled
up right here the the chat room wants us
to talk about the galaxy s4 rumors so I
want to get Chris really mad really
quickly too oh well I would be homage I
would be happy to discuss the galaxy or
rumors um sorry I didn't mean to leave
that on uh so yeah the bottom line is
that they will definitely you will
definitely one hundred and twenty
percent not see a galaxy s4 at CES if if
samsung announces a galaxy s4 at CES I
will eat my own face off with a spoon
that is my promise to you virgin mobile
show listeners it's not going to happen
we as soon as that well first of all it
was not a rumor in the first place it
was merely idle speculation on the part
of some publications who you know
Samsung put out a teaser for their CES
events and they were like you know
something big is coming and everyone's
like Oh galaxy s4 as if Samsung doesn't
make a thousand other products um and it
doesn't make any sense to anyway because
the galaxy s4 only came out like six
months ago it isn't right for the
product cycle and anyway I reached out
to my samsung source who I have a long
history with and who has never literally
never been wrong on anything Samsung
related and just asked him to confirm or
deny and he said it will definitely not
be at CES but he did them easy he didn't
give me i should i should mention very
briefly he did give me a couple enticing
tidbits about the galaxy s4 one is that
well he he didn't but he he he hinted
that we can expect a 1080p display which
makes a lot of sense and he said that we
should not expect this so-called
unbreakable
i display because the flexible
technology is not near term term enough
for that for that generation as five
maybe but as for now i just had to point
out that when he dismissed in the bunk
the galaxy s4 rumors that followed about
five minutes of fame laughing on the
phone to you at the very premise of the
Galaxy at will come in at CES yeah
that's about right I just really hope
that samsung announces a new washing
machine um just because something I want
to upgrade my washing machine again I'll
tell you this much another guarantee
from Samsung's two years there will be
an oled TV and it will probably look
stunning a fork aioli Wow don't push it
Chris for the point is everyone would
like it everyone wanted and none of us
will have it by CES 2014 they will show
that here's my prediction they will show
a glasses-free 4k oled of at least 62
inches and it will it will have it will
have 12 person head tracking for the for
the 3d and let's support miracast yes
and it will be Google TV it's my
prediction by the way I know nothing
about tvs so don't listen this is why
we're this is the wobble show yeah all
right Bradley outside yeah so I guess
I'll wrap that up um so thanks for
listening to the Virgin Mobile show this
week please follow us on twitter i'm dan
seifert my handle is DC seaford sei Vlad
is at Flagstaff of and chris is at z
power and if you want to follow dieter
of course he's at back lon so that's it
and we'll see you guys next week thanks
