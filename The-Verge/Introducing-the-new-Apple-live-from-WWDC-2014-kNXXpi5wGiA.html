are live at Apple's Worldwide Developers
Conference you know it's been a
rollercoaster of a day beginning with me
nearly getting run over by thousands of
extremely angry and anxious developers
desperately trying to claw and punch
their way to a chief and pretty
uncomfortable seat you will sit down I
promise but obviously that's not the
main story the big story is that Apple
had a bunch of announcements iOS 8 a new
version of OS 10 called Yosemite several
weed jokes on stage actually pretty good
a pretty good run of weed jokes on stage
OS 10 we strangely this one had large
pockets of support within the product
marketing organization so Yosemite is
obviously a big deal it's a complete
visual revamp of OS 10 for the desktop
it looks a lot more like iOS there's a
bunch of new features but I thought the
most notable thing that they're
including is something that Apple's
playing continuity which is actually a
cross-platform feature it is a way that
you can sort of push your application
States from your desktop to your iPad or
your iPhone and vice versa
and there's a lot of interplay there
that's really similar to an idea that I
had a few years ago called the
continuous client which would allow you
to kind of place shift the stuff that
you're doing on your devices from one to
the other and there's some really
interesting things that Apple is doing
with stuff like proximity awareness
where your computer will know that your
phone is nearby and will be able to
answer a call from it which is kind of a
huge thing and I've been sitting at my
computer a billion times wishing that I
could make a call or answer a call from
the desktop instead of having to do it
from the phone than the sitting next to
it so I think that's one of the most
notable things that they did today in
terms of Yosemite but obviously the
visual refresh refresh is in Safari a
new engine that's powering Safari that's
extremely fast and power efficient and I
think you know most importantly what's
interesting about continuity is that it
allows you to place a call to dr. Dre
while at your desktop
if you want to be Tim into the office
it'd be about four thirty but I think
you know orientation new people or Ian
tation starts at nine so and you don't
to miss the free t-shirt so I chewed for
nine I don't know if that's a feature
that's available to everybody or just a
Craig federighi but it's intriguing
Apple also introduced iOS 8 today which
is a pretty major update from the
previous version of the software not a
lot of visual changes that I could see
at least during the demos that they had
but some really interesting new features
and a lot of under the hood stuff one of
the things that's really notable is that
they have updated notifications and you
can now take action on a notification
right from the drop down panel so you
can like something on Facebook or reply
to a message another interesting thing
they've done with the Notification
Center is they've added widgets to it so
a third-party developer can plug in
glanceable information you can access
right from the notification panel I
mentioned there's a lot of
behind-the-scenes stuff going on and one
of the big features is extensions
Apple's allowing developers to make
their applications extensible and plug
into more of the system architecture so
you'll be able to share from apps to a
lot of other apps now including Apple's
first party apps for instance Pinterest
sharing or Instagram sharing will now be
able to be built in at a system level
and you can also have things like photo
filters say a visco photo filter in your
Photos app you can apply right from
within that application so that's a huge
underlying change the way Apple is
running its iOS platform and as we
create a lot of opportunities for
developers to plug into each other's
apps and to Apple's apps in a brand new
way they're also allowing third-party
keyboards which is a huge sea change for
Apple they've been proselytizing their
keyboard as the best in the business
since pretty much day 1 on the iPhone
and this is definitely a change in
attitude about the keyboard and about
users ability to customize their
experience Apple is also including
continuity obviously in iOS 8 it's a big
part of how it plays with your desktop
so that's kind of awesome and there's
some new multitasking features you can
now get to your favorite contacts from
within the multitasker you can also
access Siri without having to actually
touch the phone elsewhere there's some
slight tweaks some interesting changes
to mail with new gestures to manage your
mailbox and sort of multitask while
you're working on a message and there's
also maybe some changes to the speed
with which the OS actually operates but
that might have just been for demo
purposes but overall you know this
really did feel like a developer focused
WWDC maybe more so than they've ever
done in the past and in fact they
introduced a new programming language
here called Swift which people kind of
went crazy for in the room and I think
is a really notable move today maybe the
biggest story of the day because it's
certainly going to have a long-term
impact on Apple's platforms but I think
the most notable thing that happened
today is that Apple seemed to be having
a lot more fun
they were looser they were more open
they were cracking jokes and I think the
vibe in the room was very different from
previous years at this event and
hopefully that's a little bit of the new
way forward for the company</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
