lots of money and acclaim producer
deadmau5 driving a Ferrari that looks
like an internet meme you get the
gumball 3000 annual road rally filled
with some of the rarest most expensive
cars in the world as the name suggests
the gumball 3000 runs for 3,000 miles
and this year it's a transcontinental
affairs starting in Miami and ending in
the European Dance Club Mekka vibe Ethan
the Mediterranean Sea technically
there's nothing about the rules that
says that the entrance each of whom paid
forty thousand pounds to participate
have to break the law but when you've
got a grid filled with cars they can
crack 200 miles per hour without
breaking a sweat well you do the math
the gumball stopped in New York City
South Street Seaport on Friday night to
get loaded on aircraft taking them to
Scotland for the second leg of their
journey and a small but devoted crowd
turned out to watch the cars arrive
they're pretty ridiculous entrance range
from a chrome esten Martin to a
velvet-covered rolls-royce but the
evening clearly belonged to deadmau5
who's driving the rally in a Ferrari 458
clad in yen cap with Tory Belleci of
Mythbusters fame riding shotgun wijnen
cap why well I'm not right on right
because no one is one of one because
it's it's it's me it speaks to me it's
mine it's
I created it speaking of things on the
Internet turns out deadmau5 is a pretty
big fan of the verge I'm with the verge
by the way someday we'll all be driving
McLaren supercars painted to look like
Tron crops wait no we won't this is as
close as we get</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
