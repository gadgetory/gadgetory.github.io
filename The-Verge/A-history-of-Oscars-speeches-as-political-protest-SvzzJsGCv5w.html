two hours into the show and Donald Trump
hasn't tweeted at us once and I'm
starting to get worried about him well
the Oscars podium is intended to be a
place to accept an award it's become
less about thanking the Academy and more
about raising awareness with protest
building over a tense political climate
the question was never will there be a
political statement but how many
political statements will be made with
an average of nearly 40 million viewers
tuning in it's definitely a powerful
platform award season in Hollywood opens
the floodgates to some pretty hefty
controversy we need the principled press
to hold power to account to to call them
on the carpet for every outrage climate
change is real that is happening right
now let us not take this planet for
granted I do not take tonight for
granted thank you so very much but the
Academy wasn't always quite so accepting
of a politicized stage one of the most
explicit memorable moments is when
marlon brando openly boycotted the
Oscars in 1973 he sent Native American
activists Sacheen Littlefeather in his
place
the audience was split she was met with
some applause and a few boos and the
Academy responded by banning recipients
from sending proxies of the microphone
ban that's since been lifted as proven
by Asghar Farhadi
I'm sorry I'm not with you tonight my
absence is out of respect for the people
of my country and those of other six
nations whom have been disrespected by
the inhumane law that bans entry of
immigrants to the US by 1978 paddy
Chayefsky called for nominees and
winners stop politicizing Hollywood
opinion of course that I'm sick and
tired of people exploiting the occasion
of the Academy Awards but 15 years later
presenter Richard Gere openly criticized
Chinese leader dung shellping while
presenting an award for the best art
direction then shortly after Susan
Sarandon and Tim Robbins open with
another relative Pryor
governing officials in Washington to
admit that HIV is not a crime yo Cates
was furious and called all three
presenters distasteful and dishonest
from their presenters quieted down but
by 2002 when Halle Berry became the
first woman of color to win the Best
Actress Oscar she wasted no time
pointing out the historical significance
of the moment open the list goes on you
have a man sending us the war landing on
one of the most politicized Academy
Award shows of all time Academy Award
otherwise known as the People's Choice
Awards there was once a time where we
look to Hollywood for pristine
entertainment it was a place to live
fictitiously even now we see politicians
and personalities crying out for
Hollywood to shut up and dance claiming
they shouldn't get involved in politics
slowly have the tendency to disconnect
ourselves from stars they're still
citizens this goes out to all those
black and brown boys and girls and non
gender conforming who don't see
themselves we're trying to show you you
and us so thank you thank you this is
for you citizens with a really large
microphone if everyone could just stand
up and remind them that we all care that
this war ends as quickly as possible
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
