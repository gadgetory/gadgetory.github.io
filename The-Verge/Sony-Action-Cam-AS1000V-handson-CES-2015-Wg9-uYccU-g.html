this is shauna came with the verge we're
here looking at sony's a.s 1000v this is
sony's first 4k action camp this is
about a year behind the gopro hero4
black but it matches it on the specs it
can shoot 4k video you can shoot 1080p
video at 120 frames per second it uses
Sony steady shot too so it stabilizes
your video in camera without having to
do it in post it looks just like Sony's
a s100b which was the last premium model
that Sony put out but also means it's
not any smaller so it's got about the
same weight to it you're gonna feel it
when you have it on your helmet this is
going to run about five hundred dollars
which is comparable little GoPro as well
what Sony's done this time around is
they've actually built out there
accessory system which is something that
weren't doing too well with before so
you're going to have more helmet mounts
more chest straps the things like that
so you can really bring this wherever
you want to bring it one thing that I
really wish they had upgraded was this
LCD screen it looks like it's out of a
Casio watch out of the 1980s this is
they've had this on the Sony yes 100v
and also the action cam mini from 2014
and it looks like they opted not to
upgrade it this year Sony spent most of
2014 lagging behind in the action camera
market but the specs are there on this
one we haven't seen the image quality
yet but if you can match GoPro we're
gonna have another competitor in the
action camera market and that's it if
you want to see more awesome stuff from
the CES floor subscribe to our youtube
