here looking at the lenovo ideacentre
horizon so on the one hand this is just
a big 27-inch all-in-one PC it stands
use it with a keyboard and mouse and
it's fairly normal but it's also called
a table PC this is a new thing that I
was trying to do they're calling it
fidgets all which is a mix of physical
and digital basically means that when
you lay the horizon flat on a table or a
desk or wherever you get automatically
into a totally different UI they're
calling it aura and it's totally touched
based and it has these kind of wheels
that you can scroll through and you can
play music you can do it you can move
stuff around it's all very reminiscent
of kind of the original microsoft
surface which was a table that you could
interact with and do nifty things and
the the whole visual thing comes back to
things like the air hockey game which
you start to play you can actually put
their physical accessories down and
start doing stuff and so it's designed
to be super family-based super
interactive again it's a lot like the
surface here it's designed to be able to
be used by you know more than one person
or time so you can put something over
there and they can interact with it
there's a 10-point touch screen and you
can play music while you're doing it
ever you want and then if you just want
to see all your music you can just do
that and it'll bring up whatever you
have and then you can bring everything
back or get rid of everything it's a
very cool kind of a little gimmicky but
fun touchscreen interface but then again
you're back to just a totally normal
Windows 8 PC as a big bright screen it's
it's super powerful to core i7 processor
it seems to run pretty well we've only
used it a little bit but especially
being able to run that kind of touch
interface works well there's you know
some built-in apps and you get the
standard kind of gigantic Internet
Explorer experience on a device like
this it's super responsive to touch it's
a pretty interesting device actually and
it's going to be cool to see it if it
shows up on tables and restaurants and
your home and wherever else so that is
the lenovo ideacentre horizon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
