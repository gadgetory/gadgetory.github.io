booth here the rave just dived down died
down so we're going to take a couple
quick minutes to go through some of the
new things here on the show Corrigan the
mini KAOSS pad 2 and k oscillator to
both have a feature a new kind of kind
of goofy form factor actually it looks
like a knockoff mp3 player but it's a
KAOSS pad it has the Pat the XY
controller tap tempo you can play loops
can play mp3s can store waves mp3s
there's a microSD on here somewhere then
your typical line-in lineout
three-and-a-half 3.5 millimeter and DC
voltage I guess if you don't want to use
batteries it's like it takes double a's
to double a's ok oscillator same deal
has a since drums you can play patterns
you can mess around with our Peggy ation
once again just kind of more of a up to
date k oscillator in this new form
factor as well there's a couple new
monitor ons is a ribbon synth this one
takes a takes one voice I believe from
from a korg mono synth and explain
around with it a little bit the ribbon
controls actually it's pretty responsive
these tend to be pretty responsive I
don't know how
with just a headphone jack and the
auxiliary out I don't know how hardcore
this is going to be for performance live
but it's certainly fun taking on the bus
plays it in study hall and uh monotron
delay adds delay to the mex essentially
and I believe this glows in the dark so
that's pretty great</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
