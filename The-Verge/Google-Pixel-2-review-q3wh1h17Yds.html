and it's the pixel - Excel the Google
phones are back for another round and
they might not be all that much to look
at but they're good really good this is
only the second year of Google making
its own phones but you can already tell
that the company is sticking to a few
consistent themes it wants to make
something that's really practical
these are phones that are more
impressive to use than they are to
behold they just do dozens of little
things better than you might expect
given their kind of unassuming form and
it starts with the hardware the nice
thing about these phones is that other
than the size of the screen and the
battery they are basically identical
Google isn't making you miss out on too
much by choosing the smaller phone and
for both of different sizes there are a
few different colors and they all have
slightly different textures the white
and the blue ones look nicer to me but
the black ones are a little bit easier
to grip even so I really prefer the
pixel to excel because of the screen
it's got this huge 6 inch 18 by 9 OLED
screen that goes nearly edge-to-edge
with curved corners and a ridiculously
high 538 pixels per inch and the screen
looks good to me
but I will tell you that it has been
polarizing you see lots of Android
phones have these pen tasmad goreck
colors especially compared to the iPhone
but here the pixel screen is tuned to
srgb and so the colors are much more
toned down it's better than your worst
LG v30 fears but it is not up to Samsung
quality if you're into the smaller pixel
to the 5-inch screen there isn't quite
as technically good but it's still
really nice it's just smaller and square
it off so we should talk about bezels
both phones have them and they look
especially big and dumb on the smaller
pixel - but even the XL has some thin
bezels that go all the way around so
yeah the bezels are not awesome but they
do make space for dual front-facing
speakers and yo the speaker's sound
great
they get really loud without too much
audio Distortion they've got pretty good
stereo separation and they even manage
to convey a little bit of bass now
they're not going to replace a separate
Bluetooth speaker but I am finding I'm
using a
way more often than I expected speaking
of sound there is no headphone jack
which is frustrating and annoying it's
the one impractical design decision that
Google made and I still feel like it's
gonna be a year or two before the
accessory world gets caught up
I have precisely zero faith that USBC
headphones are going to be standard or
any good anytime soon so yeah don't lose
the dongle that comes in the box and
sorry there are no headphones in the box
oh but on the bright side
Bluetooth here is 5.0 and I experienced
way fewer drops and audio stutters that
I did on the last pixel Google kept the
glass shade on the back it's pretty much
already the pixel trademark now but they
did make it smaller there's also a tiny
bit of a camera bump Google also kept
the fingerprint sensor in the same easy
to reach spot and it's a crazy fast
fingerprint sensor by the way it's
faster than any I've used on any other
Android phone specs sure let's run them
down they're totally standard for
flagship Android phones
it's a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor
with 4 gigs of RAM and base storage of
64 gigs the bigger pixel has a bigger
battery so I am getting a little bit
more of a day of use out of it the
smaller one didn't quite go that long
for me but it should still hit a day of
light to medium use unfortunately there
is no wireless charging but the fast
charging over USB C is in fact very fast
the new pixels are also finally water
and dust resistant they're rated at IP
67 which is good enough for a short dunk
but you probably shouldn't go swimming
with them honestly it seems like Google
went out of its way to make these phones
feel kind of plain so for example
they're made out of Gorilla Glass and
aluminum just like every phone but
Google coated the aluminum in this
textured finish that makes them easier
to grip and also hides the antenna lines
think about that Google took a metal
phone and covered it in a material that
makes it feel like plastic just so
that's easier to hold you really won't
impress anybody with a look of these
things see if you want to impress
somebody with the pixel - you should
just take a picture of them yes the most
impressive thing about the pixel 2 is
it's camera both because of the pictures
it takes and because the 12 megapixel
camera is just endlessly
interesting from a technical perspective
the pixel you see it takes pictures a
little bit differently from other phones
you've probably already noticed that
there's only one lens on the back not to
Google thinks that's all that it needs
do the same kinds of camera tricks that
other phones do with multiple lenses
instead of a dual camera Google is
switching to something called dual
pixels basically each individual pixel
on the sensor that reads light is split
into a left and a right pixel which
doubles the number that gives Google
more raw data to work with and makes
portrait mode possible without an extra
lens another major change this year is
the addition of optical image
stabilization which should help keep
blurring down if you have shaky hands
but the most important thing that Google
is doing is constantly shooting photos
while the camera app is active and then
stacking a small set of them whenever
you hit the shutter button combining
them with you know math Google calls as
hdr+ but it's much more than just high
dynamic range it's using algorithms to
take a bunch of very noisy data from a
bunch of shots and combine them into one
good image now to be clear Google is not
the first to use HDR auto it's not the
first to use oh is and it's not the
first to use dual pixels what it does
seem to be doing is taking all of those
technologies and combining them
algorithmically better than anybody else
photos you take with the pixel seemed to
pick up more detail and provide sharper
images then you're gonna see on an
iPhone 8 plus or a note 8 I'm
consistently impressed with the results
I'm getting in even challenging
situations including backlit subjects
and low lighting conditions saturation
seems pretty well-balanced about in line
with what Apple is doing now it's not
nearly as intense as what you're gonna
get out of a Samsung phone as for
portrait mode it's impressive but it's
not radically better than the
competition the way Google does it goes
back to those dual pixels even though
they're less than a micron apart that's
enough for Google to detect depth
combined that with the multiple shots
that you take every time you click the
shutter button and you end up with a
massive pile of data for the pixel to
use machine learning on to make a
portrait with a blurred background hell
you can even do portrait mode on faces
in the selfie camera even though it
doesn't have dual pixels there because
of all that machine learning now just
like with the iPhone A+ and the note 8
you can usually tell when a phone is
artificial
and blur to the background the pixel
generally does a better job cutting
around the hair on a subject and it is
able to work with non-human subjects on
the rear camera but I can't say that
it's unequivocally better because the
pixel only has one option for portrait
mode on or off and you can't tweak the
results either there are some other
camera tricks notably motion photos
which are essentially a little video
they're not quite as nice as Apple's
live photo to my eye but you can get
basically the same fun little motion
effects unfortunately I wish there were
more ways to edit them after the fact
Google also combines both oh is an
electronic stabilization when you shoot
a video it's still not a perfect system
you can get some fake looking video when
you pan but overall it does a much
better job of accounting for shake and
bounce we'll do a full deep dive photo
comparison once the iPhone 10 is out but
in the meantime here's the bottom line
it's in the same class as the best phone
cameras out there and it's often at the
head of that class what's so fascinating
about Google's approach is that it
created a camera that gathers more data
not one that just gathers more light
it's an AI approach to photography
because AI if you haven't figured it out
by now is a very big deal for the pixel
to
now if we're talking about AI the most
important thing to pay attention to is
obviously the Google assistant it's good
at things you might take for granted as
an Android user it can do a lot of stuff
when you're offline you can set Spotify
to be your default music player you can
ask questions in a pretty normal
language there's a full history of your
previous searches that's really easy to
find and you can type to it if you don't
want to talk which I love and now
there's a new way to launch the
assistant by squeezing the phone it is a
little gimmicky but it's also
surprisingly convenient and it works
well you can adjust how hard you need to
squeeze the phone to launch the
assistant and you can also set it to
silence the ringer when you squeeze it
what you can't do with this so-called
active edge feature is remap that
squeeze to anything else its assistant
or nothing the assistant does a better
job of worming its way into my everyday
use of the pixel than Siri ever has with
the iPhone it just tends to be more
generally useful with results of point
to what I actually want more often and
sometimes soon you're gonna get another
input method for the assistant your
camera the feature is called google lens
and for now it's limited just to a
button inside the Photos app it can
recognize stuff like Mark Worth or
landmarks or books movies and some other
things that are pretty easy to do an
image search on lens will be much more
interesting when it's built into the
Google assistant or the camera app or
Google key or whatever else you can
think of long term lense is supposed to
be another input method next to text and
speech short term though it's basically
just a parlor trick I'll be at one
that's occasionally useful oh you know
how the pixel is also always listening
for you to say ok Google now it also
listens for music it shows you what's
playing on the lockscreen without you
even needing to ask for it all of that
identification happens locally on the
phone it doesn't send anything to
Google's cloud and it even works if you
don't have data so hopefully it's not
too creepy for you anyway it is a nice
subtle touch in fact there are a lot of
nice subtle touches on this phone and
most of them aren't actually AI they're
just iterations on the software every
time Google makes a phone and
some stuff around on the homescreen this
time the Google search button gets moved
to the bottom integrated into the doc
that search box now does double duty as
your on device search - which is smart
the homescreen also has a new widget
which shows your next calendar
appointment the weather and the date
there are a few artfully animated
wallpapers but I wish there were more of
them and there's no way to make your own
with motion photos but there is one neat
trick if you have a dark wallpaper the
app drawer and the notification shade
switch to a dark theme automatically the
lock screen can be set to always on and
show little icons free notifications I
do wish there are a few more
customization options for it though also
there are some other like neat features
on the way like augmented reality
stickers inside the camera app but
unfortunately they're just not ready for
the launch yet but really the most
important thing to know is that this is
Android as Google sees it it's pretty
clean there's no extra gunk that you
don't want and it has the fastest and
most consistent access to OS updates and
overall performance has been pretty
great I just hope it doesn't get crufty
over time like some Android phones tend
to do but the pixel been pretty good in
that regard I just really like the
direction that Google is taking the
software here and I really like this
phone a lot of phones are designed for
one thing above all else to give you a
dazzling first impression the pixel 2
doesn't go in for all that in fact the
first Hardware impression you get isn't
going to blow your hair back but then
you start to use it and you notice those
little things like your hair not getting
cropped off weird on your portrait mode
and you notice yourself using the
assistant or and then it's giving you
better answers and you notice that the
software is fast and it helps you be
more productive those impressions don't
get mentioned often enough but they're
super important the pixel 2 and the
pixel 2 XL our phones that are designed
to be of use they're not the nice dining
room table where you lay out the fancy
silverware for your guests they're the
kitchen counter where you actually eat
it's those everyday impressions that
show why this year's Google phones that
have great design in fact there are a
lot
