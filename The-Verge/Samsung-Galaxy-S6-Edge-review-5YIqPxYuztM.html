well go as big as you possibly can with
it Samsung's Galaxy s6 edge had two
sides of the screen that bent around the
sides which is pretty crazy the new s6
edge+ is that crazy idea gone bigger at
its core the s6 edge+ is just a bigger
version of the s6 edge as a stunning 5.7
inch display in place of the smaller 5.1
inch screen and it's considerably taller
and wider than the original it still has
those sloping curb sides that give it
the edge moniker and it has the same top
notch metal and glass construction as
before it even has the same processor
and camera as the s6 edge although this
time it's packin 4 gigabytes of RAM all
that means it's a really fast phone
that's as visually impressive as
anything you can buy but going bigger
doesn't solve the core problems I have
with a smaller s6 edge the s6 edge+ is
not that practical to hold or use it's
hard to pick up from a flat surface
thanks to the sloping edges and it's
even more difficult to use in one hand
than the smaller version those curved
edges may look amazing in product shots
but they distort picture and video on
the edges more than ever
essentially defeating the whole purpose
of them and the super shiny glass finish
collects fingerprints like nobody's
business
Samsung made slightly more of an effort
to take advantage of the curved display
with the software this time around the
swipe in shortcut for favorite contacts
has been expanded to include apps making
it a bit more practical than before but
it's still not something that's
dependent on the screen being curved
there are plenty of third-party apps in
the Play Store that let you do similar
things on flat smart phones and it's
certainly not enough of a reason to pick
the s6 edge+ over one of the many other
big screen smartphones out there one
area where the s6 edge+ is objectively
better is with battery life the smaller
s6 edge often had trouble lasting a full
day on a charge well that's not a
problem here I'm able to reliably go a
full day with the edge plus and have
juice left in the tank when it's time
for bed the edge plus doesn't have a
removable or replaceable battery but it
can be recharged any way you want
rapidly with the USB cable or wirelessly
with a compatible pad which makes it
super convenient to top-up
the s6 edge+ gets the basics of a
phablet right it's got a big beautiful
screen fast performance a great camera
and long battery life the software is
good and it's pretty easy to theme it to
look more like stock Android if that's
what you're looking for but I just can't
ignore the fact that it's beautiful
head-turning design makes it harder to
use and it should be a smarter purchase
would be the note 5 which won't turn
nearly as many heads
but has the same level of performance
with a more traditional and comfortable
to use display but if you're buying the
s6 edge+
chances are you're not buying it for
practical reasons you're buying it
because it just looks damn cool and hey
sometimes it's cool to look cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
