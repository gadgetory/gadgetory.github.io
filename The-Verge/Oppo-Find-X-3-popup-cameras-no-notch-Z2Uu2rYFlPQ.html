this thing out
so you're probably wondering what just
happened there so let's talk about it
this is opos new phone to find X now you
may not be familiar with Oppo but
they're a big smartphone brand in China
and they're actually owned by the same
company that owns oneplus which you
probably are familiar with if you've
seen this channel before and this phone
is their new flagship phone which is
gonna be launched globally for the first
time and yes it'll be available here in
North America which I'll talk about in a
bit but let's talk about this phone here
so what you're seeing is a big six point
four inch OLED display and it's going
edge to edge with no bezel or almost no
bezels no not and basically no chin so
in order to build this phone and
accommodate the camera opal put the
camera and a motorized slide-out tray
that pops up when you open the camera
app and disappears when you close it
it's pretty trick now in this camera
tray are both the front camera and rear
cameras and there's some interesting
things going on here now the rear camera
is a 16 megapixel and 20 megapixel dual
camera system pretty similar to what
we've seen with a bunch of dual cameras
on phones before it does portrait mode
effects and all that kind of stuff but
the front camera is a 25 megapixel
sensor and it's got 3d face scanning
sensors in here not unlike what you get
on the iPhone 10 now those 3d scanners
can do things like automatically
beautify your image which is very
popular on a lot of phones from China or
it also works through blog you in so
that when you turn on the phone and
unlock it the camera pops up sees your
face and it locks you in now the find
exit does not have a fingerprint scanner
on it as you can see on the back here
there's no fingerprint scanner there's
no fingerprint scanner under the screen
either so it's basically relying on the
camera to log you in but it does it all
pretty quickly Oppo says that the camera
can launch in as little as point 5
seconds which is pretty fast as you can
see I'm doing it a bunch of times here
so then the screen itself
it's an OLED panel it's got curved sides
which you can see here it looks a lot
like what you get on a samsung s 9 or s
9 plus it's 1080 pixels of resolution
basically the phone itself kind of looks
to me like an S 9 with slimmer bezels
which is pretty cool
and then inside come all the high-end
specs you'd expect from a 20-18 android
smartphone it's got snapdragon 845 eight
gigabytes of ram - up to 256 gigabytes
of storage
its global LTE compatible and it's got
dual SIM support I've got a t-mobile SIM
in here and it's pulling an LTE signal
here in New York so it works here in the
US which is pretty cool to see now for
software it's running opos color OS
software which runs on Android 8.1 it
basically looks like a mix of iOS and
Samsung's Android software it's not the
nicest Android software I've ever seen
it definitely doesn't look like a pixel
but it's not the worst either and you'll
probably get used to it pretty quickly
and it seems to have all of the main
features that we look for on an Android
phone at this point even including a
gesture navigation system which is
pretty cool no other hardware features
it's got a big 3700 milliamp hour
battery and it's got oboz vio OC fast
charging which is basically the same
thing as one plus as - charge so it can
recharge really quickly over a wire but
there's no wireless charging here so
what are you gonna do the other big
thing that's missing is there's no
headphone jack which isn't a huge
surprise in 2018 but it's unfortunate
all this engineering and I couldn't put
in a headphone jack in it now OBO says
they're gonna be bringing this to North
America the pricing is still a little
bit up in the air at least here for here
in the US but they're saying it's gonna
be priced less than other major smart
phones from Samsung and LG so I'd expect
to see it probably under $700 and even
more interesting they're gonna be
selling it with a carrier at least so
they claim we don't have any information
on that yet so you'll have to stay tuned
but that should be pretty interesting
now is this the future of smartphones I
don't know I think it's really
interesting it gives me a lot of screen
without a lot of bezel and it's an
interesting compromise to you know
making sure that it has the things like
front facing cameras and sensors and
things like that that we all expect on a
smartphone I do have a little bit of
concerns I'm not sure how you put a case
on this thing I guess it could only wrap
around the side you can't really put a
case on top and what happens if you drop
it or it get you go to the beach you get
sand in it or whatever there might be
some reliability concerns with it but
otherwise I think it's really neat and
I'm eager to spend more time with this
and play with it more for more on the
