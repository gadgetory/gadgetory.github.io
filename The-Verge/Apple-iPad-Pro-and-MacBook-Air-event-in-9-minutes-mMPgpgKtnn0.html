York and I'm incredibly excited today to
introduce an all-new MacBook Air with a
Retina display and a whole lot more now
it's Tim said the number one feature
custom somewhat had wanted in a MacBook
Air has been a Retina display but we've
made the display better in every way
the familiar aluminum bezel of the
current MacBook Air is gone the new air
sleek design takes the display glass
right to the edge of the enclosure
forming borders that are 50% narrower it
features a 13.3 inch display and when it
comes to resolution we've taken the
pixels and quadrupled them providing
four times the resolution for over four
million pixels and even with this
narrower border design we were still
able to keep the FaceTime camera at the
top of the display the MacBook Air has
another new feature that customers have
been asking for and that's touch ID and
to enable touch ID the new air comes
with Apple's t2 security chip teaching
also features a secure an SSD controller
which has automatic on-the-fly data
encryption offering the most secure
storage of any notebook the new MacBook
Air has our latest generation keyboard
with keys that offer four times the
stability over the previous generation a
modern keyboard does he deserves to be
paired with a modern trackpad so we've
replaced the old diving board version
with the new force touch trackpad now
whether it's in dorm rooms or lounging
on the sofa at home we know customers
spend a lot of time watching videos on
their MacBook Air so we wanted to make a
better sound experience it is 25% louder
it has two times more bass and wide
stereo sound so the new MacBook Air has
two Thunderbolt 3 ports there's an
eighth generation dual-core CPU along
with the latest Intel integrated
graphics and it also supports up to 16
gigabytes of faster
which is double the capacity of the
previous air it has the same great 12
hours of wireless web browsing but now
has up to 13 hours of iTunes movie
playback the new air has an unbelievable
17% less volume than its predecessor
it's just 15 point six millimeters which
is 10% thinner than the previous air so
the new MacBook Air is configured with 8
gigabytes of memory a 1.6 core i5
processor with turbo up to 3.6 and 128
gigs of storage and we'll start at 1199
making it the most affordable retina Mac
we've ever offered you can order it
starting today and it will be available
next week
now there's another small but mighty Mac
our users have been waiting for I can't
wait to tell you about the biggest
update ever to the new Mac Mini now I'm
sure you've noticed that we've given it
an awesome space great finish the number
one thing our customers wanted us to do
is give it more powerful processors so
now every Mac Mini starts with 4 cores
but we didn't think that was far enough
so we're also giving Mac Mini 6 cores
processors as well and these are mobile
parts no these are higher power
eighth-generation CPUs with faster
graphics - ripping through traditional
desktop apps like logic and Photoshop
and workflow apps like mainstage and
compressor making this by far the most
powerful Mac Mini we've ever made so the
new Mac Queen II can now go up to 64
gigs of memory and now is this memory
faster it's also an Esso dims something
we know our Mac Mini customers will
really appreciate and every new Mac Mini
also has the Apple t2 security chip with
as many new features including HEV C
video and code that get this 30 times
faster the new Mac Mini has an entirely
new thermal system with double the
airflow while still being super quiet
with gigabit ethernet 4 count them for
Thunderbolt 3 ports and
my port two USB a ports it can connect
to almost anything the entry config has
eight gigs of memory a 3.6 gigahertz
quad-core processor and 128 gigabyte SSD
and it starts at just $7.99 and you can
order it starting the day and it'll be
available next week today we're
announcing an all new iPad pro it's
going to push what you can do on iPad or
on any computer even further and here it
is we've always felt that the iPad
should be all about the display and in
this new iPad pro we have an LCD that
stretches from edge to edge and top to
bottom
now we achieve this design by rounding
the corners of the display using the
same pixel masking and anti-aliasing
technology that we introduced in the
iPhone 10 are just like in the 10r
we call it a liquid Retina display it is
packed with our most advanced
technologies like wide color true tone
promotion and of course support for
Apple pencil this is the same take
anywhere sized you loved in the 10.5
inch design but now with an 11 inch
display it has a quarter million more
pixels and this is a new 12 point 9 inch
iPad pro it's now almost exactly the
same size as an eight and a half by 11
piece paper this new iPad pros are just
five point nine millimeters thin in the
case of the twelve point nine inch
that's nearly fifteen percent thinner
than before because it now has face ID
but bring it to the iPad pro matte we
had to optimize the cameras and even had
to retrain the underlying neural
networks to work specifically in all the
ways that you use your iPad portrait
landscape attached to a keyboard and no
matter how you use these new iPad pros
they are always right-side up now with
support for face ID you might have
noticed there's no longer a home button
wellnow home button means that all those
familiar gestures from the iPhone 10 now
come to the iPad so for instance you can
swipe down from the upper right hand
corner to get to control center
you access the dock by swiping up from
the bottom if you continue swiping up in
pods you get to the app switcher
and you can even swipe along the bottom
edge to quickly switch between your most
recently used apps because these new
iPad pros are powered by the all-new a
12x Bionic the a 12x features an 8 core
CPU with for performance cores and for
high-efficiency cores with our latest
generation performance controller
multi-threaded workloads can now
leverage all eight of those cores
simultaneously single core performance
is up by 35 percent compared to last
year is already really fast ipad pro's
multi-core workloads are now up to 90
percent faster the a 12x Bionic has an
all-new apple design 7 core GPU that
delivers two times the performance of
the previous generation on board the a
12x and coming for the first time to an
iPad we have our latest generation of
the knurl engine and just like in the
a12 the knurl engine is capable of
delivering an unbelievable 5 trillion
operations per second and this year we
have a new fast storage controller on
the a12 X which enables up to one
terabyte in storage capacity and so in
these new ipad pro's we're moving to USB
see this brings a whole new set of
capabilities to the iPad pros like
connecting to accessories that change
how you use your iPad cameras musical
instruments or even dots or connecting
to high resolution external displays up
to 5k and with USB C you can connect to
these data accessories and displays at
the same time we think our pro customers
are really gonna love this and also for
the first time on these ipad pro's we
now support charging out over USB C so
you can even charge your iPhone when
you're on the go
and with these new iPad pros the
second-generation pencil has been
completely redesigned the new Apple
pencil attaches magnetically to the iPad
pro it automatically pairs and starts
charging wirelessly and this year
there's a whole new way of interacting
with the Apple pencil just tap twice on
it to switch modes in notes you can
switch between your current tool and the
eraser and in other apps this behavior
will be customizable which puts even
more control into our users hands it's
amazing how much performance we packed
into these iPads the 11 inch iPad pro is
offered in these four storage options
and it starts at $7.99 the twelve point
nine inch iPad pro is offered in these
same storage options and it
starts at $9.99 customers can start
placing orders today and they're going
to be showing up next week
on the seven seas are the most exciting
iPads we have ever created doesn't just
change the way we think about iPad it
changes the way we think about computers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
