here in Barcelona Spain looking at the
new nokia X this is Nokia's actual
Android phone that they're using in
emerging markets to be able to try and
capture the growing smartphone demand
that's their respects you've got a
4-inch WVGA display it's a dual-core 1
gigahertz processor it's very much a
low-end device but it's targeted for an
emerging market and at 89 euro it's
pretty low price as well the home screen
here is actually very inspired by Nokia
Lumia phones you can see it's got a very
tile like interface you can do things
like resize tiles and make them larger
just like you can on Windows Phone and
the Nokia Lumia devices it does support
full android app compatibility many
developers are said to be able to add
their apps to the device without without
making major changes to them here you
can see facebook is running on it below
that you've got a single back button
that works as both back and home so if
you open up an app and you can long
press to go back to your home screen or
you can just step one step back the
other thing that Nokia is doing here is
what they call their fast lane which is
kind of like a combination of
notifications and your recent apps and
you can take a look at your upcoming
appointments through it as well it's
coming over from Nokia Asha line and it
is it's Nokia's version of a
notification center but there's no real
app tray here all of your apps just kind
of get installed down at the bottom as
you install them there's no way to call
up an alphabetical list or anything like
that you can make folders let you again
with other android phones and it does
support full android widgets so you can
install widgets on the home screen
itself as far as this particular model
this is the nokia X it's one of three
there's also the X plus and the XL this
one has a 3 megapixel fixed focus camera
with an LED flash it's dual sim support
so you can have multiple Sims running at
the same time and it's got a removable
battery in there too metra this
interface is actually pretty responsive
it's a it's more responsive than we
expect when you're navigating the home
screen but as you can see opening apps
can be a little bit slow and
a less responsive than you might expect
from a more modern device so in addition
to the nokia X nokia has announced the
nokia XL which is a larger screen
version of the device it steps up to a
5-inch display it's still wvga so it's
still pretty low res for this day and
age but it is a much larger display it's
a bit nicer looking as well you've got
better viewing angles the device itself
is actually it feels thinner than the
smaller model it's a little bit nicer to
hold in your hand but it is quite large
the other major improvement that they've
done is they've upgraded the camera to a
higher resolution and you've got an LED
flash on there nokia will be selling the
XL later this year in many markets
across the world for about 109 euro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
