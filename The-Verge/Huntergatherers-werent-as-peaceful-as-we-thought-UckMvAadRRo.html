inseparable from the violence that we
see on TV and in history books but for
archaeologists who study ancient humans
violence between groups of
hunter-gatherers isn't a given in fact
some scientists think hunter-gatherers
weren't prone to warfare at all now
researchers say they found 10 skeletons
belonging to humans who died violently
10,000 years ago in Kenya it's a rare
find and it could put to rest the myth
of the peaceful hunter-gatherer in 2012
archaeologists discovered remains
belonging to at least 27 people in
Nazareth near an area that once held a
small Lagoon a large number of these
remains were broken and in bad shape but
the researchers managed to dig up 12
skeletons 10 of which showed signs of
lethal injuries for example one man had
a projectile embedded in his skull where
is another individual that may have been
a woman had a perforating lesion on her
forehead signs of trauma on her jawbone
and a fractured hand the researchers
also found a tiny blade and two small
tools made of Flint embedded in two of
the skeletons taken together the
injuries suggest that these people died
at the hands of humans armed with bows
and arrows what's perhaps even more
gruesome is that the two skeletons that
didn't show signs of lethal injuries
probably belong to people who were tied
up the researchers know this because of
the position of their hands which appear
to have been found when they died all in
all the fight led to the deaths of at
least seven men and possibly five women
but what about the timing of the attack
to find out when these people died the
scientists use radiocarbon dating a
technique that uses the properties of
carbon to assign dates to organic
materials they estimate that the bodies
are between nine thousand five hundred
and ten thousand five hundred years old
which is significant because the Wester
can a region of Kenya was home to a
large population of hunter-gatherers
during that period and according to the
authors the timing of their deaths
means that this is the earliest
scientifically dated case of violence
among different groups of
hunter-gatherers
not everyone agrees with that
interpretation however skeletons of
possible hunter-gatherers who died in
battle were discovered in 60s in North
Sudan and they might actually be older
according to two outside researchers
these skeletons are generally thought of
as being between 12,000 and 14,000 years
old in addition one researcher told us
that there may not be enough evidence
that the matter excite
- solidly conclude that the skeletons
belong to hunter-gatherers the study
describes a very complex series of
events that includes people being tied
up and others being injured by
projectiles so it's possible that these
events happen at different times if so
this could be part of an ongoing fight
between groups of people with more
sedentary lifestyles the truth is that
archaeology isn't always cut and dry
after all scientists still don't know
why the humans in Kenya were murdered
it's possible that they died during a
raid by another competing group they
could have been fighting over resources
like territory or food the researchers
say or the two groups may simply have
had a very bloody and extremely
unfortunate disagreement given the many
many reasons why humans kill each other
today it's not all that surprising that
the same kinds of disputes might have
led to the deaths of 12 people 10,000
years ago</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
