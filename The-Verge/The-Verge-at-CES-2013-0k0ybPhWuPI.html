you can be bitter about it but I think
that there are weeds that grow through
the cracks if all you see is the
concrete you're missing what's exciting
about technology and what's exciting
about our culture
this shows how our modern culture and
our modern life is evolving
yes it's a corporate show yes there are
corporations here trying to sell you
stuff yes much of what is here is
garbage you know what much of what is
out there in life is carpet there are
things that transcend the garbage
how many caves do you want I hope you
said four because that's how many you're
getting this is first we are live on the
well we're not on the mower or we're
like a parking lot and so if a car comes
crashing through don't be surprised
that's normal we wanted that to happen
welcome to top shelf this is our
afternoon show about all of the gadgets
and weird things and great things that
we've seen at CES this is ridiculous
I'm Brian Bishop and welcome to day 4 of
90 on 90 presented by for today's top
stories tune in tomorrow to find out
anytime there is an opportunity someone
is out there that's gonna try and take
advantage of that opportunity whether
that's a poker table a slot machine or a
table game we're gonna know who you are
if you're a bag if you're not a bad guy
we I don't care who you are but if
you're the bad guy we're gonna catch you
if you've ever seen that movie wild wild
west I'm like Will Smith right now
let's see what happens when I crank it
up
I'm gonna say this is one of the most
exciting I've been to I don't know why
yes it's got some weird interesting
stuff going on out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
