McRae the CTO visio and here we're here
with the new P series which is a
thousand dollar 4k TV you guys nacet in
CES it's a little about nine or ten
months later and here we are so what
first of all what took so long we want
to get it right yeah so you know we
showed our demos at CES and you know
we're showing a lot of picture
processing demos here and we want to
make sure that the resolution was right
the motion capture was right the color
was right
so it's really been just fine-tuning the
details and not only ship an amazingly
priced 4k TV but one that actually
closed away the competition on the
picture quality so that's the big
question how did you make $1,000 15 4k
TV when everyone else is like $2,000
$4,000 what's the secret here well it
wasn't easy we spent a lot of time doing
engineering work specific to our product
so probably the biggest thing we did is
we developed our own back lights so we
you know talked about that at CES where
we do full ray local dimming across all
our product lines and by designing them
ourselves we were able to not only raise
the picture quality but actually lower
the price how wait how does all that
work let you lower the price if you're
doing all that engineering work because
of component price so yeah we spent a
lot of engineering time and development
effort but the actual component price
and the innovation that we did was to
create a full array local dimming right
where we got LEDs going all the way
through the backlight but actually
reduce the component count by 40% at the
same time so there's a lot of
integration happening where you know the
where the glass meets the LEDs meets the
driver boards we were able to reduce
that overall cost through that
innovation and again you the picture
quality goes up but cost goes down it's
a big question with 4k is how are you
gonna get content and you guys are
betting almost exclusively on streaming
right yeah we've decided since you know
since our first Smart TVs launched six
years ago that streaming was going to be
one of the primary ways people are going
to get any content and we've streamed
you know billions of hours of video
content to our Smart TVs now and 4k is
not gonna be different so there will be
4k blu-ray players in the future there
will be 4k set-top boxes in the future
this has hdmi 2.0 and we support all
that but we do believe that one of the
many ways and probably the primary way
people will get content are going to be
from sources like Netflix and Amazon and
ultra flicks and some of the partners
we've announced today and we had a demo
in the other room and you can see that
it's it's pretty nice I mean at 10 to 15
megabits per second is gorgeous and that
that's what you need right otherwise you
get a little too compressed yeah it
starts at about 9 point something almost
10 megabits per second and then the
steps up all the way to 15 and by the
time you're at 12 to 15 megabits per
second it is substantially better than
1080p really and is that you think it's
going to be as good as on disk it'll be
a little bit different you'll see
different artifacts it won't be quite as
good as a disc because a bit rate will
be so much higher but it's already
showing a massive upgrade against what
you're seeing on 1080p and remember you
know it's not just going from 7 megabits
a second on 1080p to 15 on 4k a doubling
of it because we're also using HEV C
which is a much more you know compressed
formats a new format for extreme unis
you're getting the double of the
bandwidth but you're also getting
another doubling of efficiency so it's
actually four times the effective
throughput and it looks really good and
you're building your own ships too we
are so we have the Vizio v6 processor
which is a six core processor we're
using to do all this and we have the VM
50 which is our picture processing
engine that's doing all of the color
fidelity the contrasts are pixel mapping
and everything that we're doing and we
that was the other way that we decided
even though we take a little bit more
time but to not only beat people on
price but beat him on picture quality we
had we had to actually bring our own
technology to market so I mean that's
the question once you start talking
about processors and cores that kind of
technology and a TV I get worried about
like how long until I have to replace it
with a faster processor and a faster you
have a better picture pixel engine and
better software what how long do you
think this season lasts it'll last a
long time you know the chips that we can
buy off-the-shelf
we're dual-core yeah this is six cores
yeah so again one of our choices was
actually put more horsepower than we
need today to make it a platform that
can last quite a while you know the
investment like you keep mentioning how
do you guys do it how you guys do it
there was definitely a very large
upfront investment
but we're not passing that on to
consumers of investment we made not only
for this TV but future TVs so we're
spreading that very small across all the
platforms
so first TVs got flattened everybody
rushed out and bought new form factors
and then there's been this desperate
search for the next thing that's gonna
make everybody buy again don't say
curved curved then there's 3d you guys
have taken 3d completely out of the
picture now you're just giving up in 3d
well so what I'll tell you is we one of
these we pride ourselves on is really
listening and watching consumers but
listening to what they really want in a
television so there was actually two
reasons one is we looked at how many
people are actually using our 3d TVs how
many people actually thought that was a
very important feature set it was pretty
low also if you look at the 4k if you do
4k right if you do ultralinks calorie
already and kind of look at and say is
that 3d and it's because the depth that
we're able to produce through the
picture processing so for us putting our
investment resources right towards
improving the picture quality not in a
2d but making it so clear and the motion
resolution is so good that it actually
looks 3d was much more important you get
to curves and things like that you know
again our opinion is curved as a gimmick
it actually hurts picture quality it
causes a lot of problems so you won't
see us too curved we try and find a way
to actually improve the users experience
and charge them less not figure out how
to make their experience worse and
charge them more so for us it's complete
opposite of what we focus on so do you
think 4k is going to kick off another
adoption cycle is that why you price so
low to like get to the front line well I
think what would have happened without
Vizio is we would have seen maybe a
three to four year maybe five year even
transition cycle from 1080p to 4k at
least on you know 50-inch in above where
you can really tell the difference our
goal is to try and make that transition
you know one to two years yeah and get
most people buying 4k TVs at those sizes
by next year and hopefully this year
we're already going to go to a big chunk
of market so one of the things Vizio
thinks we like to do is actually drive
transitions
faster is use disruptive technology to
get people the latest technology
technology maybe they thought they
couldn't afford now and that's part of
the pricing strategy is to take that
market by storm right so we talk to you
about times it's this feels like
refocusing on the core Visio which is
always from televisions you've
diversified a few places you're in
soundbars doing really well there but
you did laptops for a minute we've
played with phones is this Vizio coming
all the way back to TVs you're gonna do
even keep trying to brought now yeah a
bit what I would say is this took a lot
of effort yeah so for the last probably
year and a half two years we've actually
spent a bulk of our resources perfecting
UHD and again making it making sure we
hit the prices that we want to hit but
really setting a new bar for quality we
think it's really really important so
that has been the bulk of it also our
sound bars and our audio equipment you
know we're the number one sound bar
manufacturer as well that's been a big
focus but I think what you could say
fairly is that the last year and a half
at least from an engineering R&amp;amp;D side we
decided that there was some really cool
technology coming forward and that
focusing on the living room again was
really important because we saw this
transition coming having said that you
know you'll see some interesting stuff
coming in the next year or two that I
can't talk about so we won't
predominantly stay in the living room
but it was important to actually take a
leadership position in UHD and continue
that position in audio as well why do
you deliver he was getting interesting
in because of the court case transition
no one's practice right everyone's still
poking around the edges of it how how
are you guys going to maintain that
leader leadership position use every
analysis coming at you cuz they're all
gonna keep coming at you yeah I'd want
the best way and the reason we spent so
much time on this is quality you know
you can try and be the best price
forever and that's great and it's you
know it'll decline quick and that's
something we do naturally anyways is
priced aggressively that's that's great
but that can also be fleeting what
really matters is is actually shipping a
world-class product so if you if you
have a world-class product where you've
actually beaten you know products that
are twice as expensive as you you're
gonna have staying power and you're
going to actually you know have a pretty
good chunk of that market so we're we
have a good initial foray with these and
you're going to see us continue to
innovate in UHD and again our goal is to
get people to transition into an ultra
high def living room quickly so the last
question will cost product the other TV
shared CS was the reference series yes
what's the timeline on that coming soon
can't tell you exactly we're perfecting
that as well yeah a lot of probably not
shipping it's going to be really close
and so we may actually wait a little bit
longer give us some breathing room but a
lot of the fine tuning that went into P
series is going in our reference series
and then we have a whole nother order of
magnitude that we're doing for that
product and it's it's a it's beautiful I
can't say too much but you know the
demos we showed at CES on the reference
series was we're pretty jaw-dropping and
it's only gotten much better from there
also reference series you know we want
to make sure that you know when we
launch the P series we want to make sure
there was contact right so you know
Netflix has great content we've got
Amazon and ultra fix klemming so even if
you don't have a 4k blu-ray player yet
there's a lot of content on the
reference series we're doing the same
thing where we want to make sure that
there's high dynamic range ultra wide
color gamut content when we launch and
you know some of that stuff's being
created and mastered right now so we
don't want to launch a TV and then not
have content to actually show with it so
it's another reason why maybe waiting a
few months would would make more sense
yeah so this guy's thousand dollars
thousand dollars 99 the big one is how
they even have the 65 inch is $21.99 and
this 70 inches $24.99 that's aggressive
and these are going to be a source now
yeah actually a few websites are already
selling them live there's some
pre-orders of a few stuck out and our
retailers will have them
starting tomorrow but some are already
on the shelf
any legal team on the stock what I
think's going to happen based on what
we're seeing online is that we're going
to sell out for a while and then we've
got a whole another huge boatload coming
and that's when we'll kick off our
advertising things like that in October
