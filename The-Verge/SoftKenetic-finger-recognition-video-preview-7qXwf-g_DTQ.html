are here checking out soft kinetics the
latest build of their new gesture
control software the running a sensor
not unlike the kinect what's special
about this is actually does really
accurate finger tracking up close about
15 centimeters and as far back as three
feet works surprisingly well and they've
got a few demos so they can kind of show
us a kinda exemplify what's going on
let's check it out alright so we go
ahead and try to get this kind of tested
i stick my hand out there we go at the
Blue Monster recognizing me he seemed
kind of dancing around a little bit let
Mia articulate his mouth a little bit
alright so i can either do the spock
like the motion of my old hand squeezed
into a fist another way we get to kind
of hand mouth moving a bit kind of gave
them dance around a bit now the arms are
just jelly they just they just kind of
going with the flow so don't really
matter i can move a little for little
back you know if i have my hand open
palm i can go into face I'll have to
write the other trick is I can actually
get the second guy open let me open my
hand to activate him wake him up here we
go we got them and dancing around a
little bit in out
or get make it do it make sense
alright better faster stronger okay so
we're going to take a behind-the-scenes
look this is kind of what the computer
sees you got basically so you activate
my hands here it's actually tracking
each individual finger right there I so
yeah it does go really close and even up
there it kind of makes out you know all
four of my fingers and thumb you can see
kind of moving around both on the kind
of heat map look and then kind of wears
kind of tracking the skeletal system I
go farther back and I can actually go
kind of a ways before it's a little
wonky even here it shows my fist kind of
going in and out I can kind of draw a
little bit of my finger and still tracks
that and even that far away it works
with both hands I can kind of bounce
around here twist you can kind of see
try to figure out basically where the
proper pointing direction is it's
perfectly fine swapping hands and
placement orientation touching though
completely scared this is something I'm
assuming you know again it's an alpha
build I've formed some kind of weird
octo dodecahedron monster so that's new
bills for their deaths since ds3 11
connect like sensor for gesture controls
this alpha build is not available yet
there is an SDK if you want to try it
out but the new bill with the close up
in the finger tracking that's coming out
general availability later this year
