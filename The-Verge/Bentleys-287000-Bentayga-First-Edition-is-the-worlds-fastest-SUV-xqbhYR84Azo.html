edition Bentley been taken the company's
very first as you mean we spoke with the
exterior designer sang aply who gave us
more insight into the process of
creating a two hundred and eighty-seven
thousand dollar SUV making a Bentley is
a quite challenge because it's a
different type of lodge for the brand
and says shrevie so is a two boxcar and
Bentley is known for a three boxcar like
a stands and the sports could be for
it's like our founder said that we will
need to make always want to make the
good car fast car the best in the class
so message for the Mantega is the
fastest and the most luxurious SUV in
the market so design has to deliver it
that promise it has really nice
beautiful Union Jack our first edition
badge just for this car to begin with
and it also has a nice carbon fiber and
this is very special feature because it
just enhance the look of the car but
also it improved the functionality of
the car and also we want to have a wheel
to be a little bit more special so we
made the wheel our 22 deep-dish
directional wheel hand-finished
different in two-tone
so when you sit in the car we always use
it's real leather and our wood is real
wood and the metal is a rare metal
Bentley is about effortless driving but
we can always rely on the tradition that
brad has to move
it really enhanced by technology
obviously so that is all the technology
around the car with Antigua is very
special and start with the headlamp we
have the LED matrix being headlamp which
works with atmosphere in the environment
around you the first edition was created
a two celebrating launching of Antigua
was actually six hundred eight cars were
made and will be available for 75 cars
in US market and it's all sold out now
Antigua will be on the street a
beginning of next year yeah so you will
see a lot of Antigua hopefully on the
street and actually the car was launched
at the Auto Show and you look at the
photos and everything but as a designer
I really recommend the looking at
Pentagon compared to other cars on the
street then you will see the rear
Bentley
