Soho gallery for digital art at the art
of apps event what we're going to see
here is some apps like path tweet bot
paper the designers and makers of the
apps are going to be showing how these
things function as art in the 21st
century on touchscreen devices so let's
go check it out what exactly are we
doing here and what threads do you see
between the seven apps that you pick to
display here we really try to gather
some of the most interesting user
interface designs going on on iphone and
on ipad and I think the common thread is
that everybody's still figuring it out
it's really young platform you can go
back to the beginning of the iphone it's
five years with the ipad is certainly
only about two years old or so so people
are really trying to figure out what
makes sense for all the really different
kinds of creative uses that are putting
these multi touch devices to why do you
think a lot of these apps are using this
kind of bottom navigation bar is that
functionally the best way to organize
things you think yeah I don't know if
that's you know the necessarily the best
argument I think people are always
trying to push the boundary but it's a
visual metaphor that everybody's
familiar with you know that's the design
template that Apple came out with and I
think that people became accustomed to
it and it's hard hard to remember what
phones were like before the iphone yeah
and I mean they were not very capable of
showing really really beautiful user
interface design and now all of a sudden
you've got this beautiful screen that in
many cases is got more resolution than
we had on our desktops five years ago
and you're carrying it around with you
all the time on top of that Apple did
this terrific thing the terrific favor
for designers in fixing the resolution
so you don't have to design you know
umpteen number of monthly number of
screen sizes and so forth that's huge
but I like with all of these apps and
obsessive focus on the user experience
and in all of the all of these cases the
engineering fades into the background
and that's when you know an engineering
standpoint the standpoint that you've
done a fantastic job the key for us was
taking this very complex concept and
making it so it just was stupid simple
and so I think when people use it though
we'll stay this is a really simple it's
a very elegant app but behind the scenes
are so much going on I do think things
are going to move in that direction
where apps are going to become a lot
smarter with a lot less buttons a lot
more intuitive a lot more easy to
consume I think more photos less words I
think we're still going to have this
this variety of interfaces out there but
you know I think things are definitely
moving more towards new types of
interaction models gestural base and you
know how can we make things more natural
it's really constantly an effort of
trying to do the least that that can
have the biggest impact what are you
seeing that kind of inspires you and
like a art gallery for apps I think the
first thing that inspires us just from
the crew here is that everything is very
creation based it's part of that whole
shift that I think we're sort of on the
cusp of like moving from this
consumption experience more into like
how do we actually create the world that
we're in this is the future and do
anything for the web doing anything even
just for the computer anymore doesn't
feel like the kind of focus we want to
have these apps are more integrated in
our lives than desktop apps ever were
and it's a great opportunity to do
really focus design but also to have a
great impact on people's lives and
to sort of meld with their their you
know their usage patterns and to the way
they think about the world I think
mobile is all about taking everyday
experiences and making them look
incredible do you think there's time in
our lives for all these apps or do you
think over time let's say in 10 years
things are going to be distilled down to
the point where you know or is it really
just like you know what everybody likes
different books that really likes
different video games there's not enough
time for all of the books that will be
published this year or all the movies
that will be released this year but
having that variety and especially with
digital media with the web creating
these apps for people who have passions
that otherwise would be unmet can go and
meet other people and engage in and get
and get sort encouraged to indulge his
passions I think that's incredibly
valuable you know when you look at like
the 19th century it was all about you
know literature and novels and that's
how you told stories and then 20th
century was all about filmmaking I think
the next thing the next way that will
tell stories is really through
interaction after this point or like
like you guess hit songs and hit music
so you're just really getting influenced
them influenced by them week after week
except this is paying around I'll also
be really excited to start seeing more
and more artwork that was generated with
apps in galleries that would be very
cool a whole generation of people are
focusing their energy on apps and
they're doing amazing work and I think
it it really deserves this kind of
showcase it really deserves people
looking at it more closely and having a
dialogue
