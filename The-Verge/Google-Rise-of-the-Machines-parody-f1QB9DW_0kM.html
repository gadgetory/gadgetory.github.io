Larry wants to change the world and he
believed technology can show the way I
think people naturally are concerned
about change and I think how do you
think the pace of change in the world is
increasing especially in technology we
need revolutionary change not
incremental change we have an adaptive
mechanisms to deal with that and maybe
some of our all institutions like the
law and so on aren't keeping up with the
rate of change through technology now
privacy officials from the Netherlands
Australia New Zealand Mexico Israel and
Switzerland have sent a letter to Google
chief Larry Page they're asking him to
explain the privacy implications of
glass Google's new self-driving vehicle
there is no steering wheel there's no
accelerator and no brake pedal google
admits that had collected private data
on people who were connected to Wi-Fi in
the alleged privacy of their own homes
carbon monoxide in the family room as
Google moves into home automation of
home security it's obvious our gonna
move into cameras room sensors the
things that would tell them specifically
what I'm doing and where I'm doing it
Google now owns these
they are robots high-tech robots that
mimic humans and animals they were
designed for the battlefield no idea
what Google plans to do with all that
robot power
Google's at it again buying up this time
an artificial intelligence company deep
mind this after buying Boston Dynamics
the company makes that thing you imagine
what are these robots running around if
they can't think for itself I mean
listen Google's motto is don't be evil
most of us would agree that robots
inherently are evil machines do we have
any idea what their ultimate goal is
most people think companies are
basically evil you're they get a bad rap
and I think that's somewhat correct
