another new Fitbit what's actually new
about it so this is the Fitbit Alta HR
and as its name suggests it now has
heart rate sensors it costs one hundred
and forty nine ninety nine which is
twenty dollars more than the regular
Fitbit Alta and is about the same price
of the Fitbit charge too which is a
whole other wristband it looks exactly
like last year's Alta exactly it has the
same tap sensitive screen but one thing
that's different about it on the
underside is the strap it's a little bit
different last year's Alta had a series
of holes and you kind of snap in to
close it and this one was more of a
traditional railroad style strap the
good thing about the Fitbit Alta is that
it's one of the more attractive fitbit's
out there you can see how people might
mistake this for a bracelet not a clunky
activity tracker which is nice on the
downside it's one of the more basic
Fitbit I mean attracts your steps and
your distance traveled your calories
burned it does track sleep but it's not
like the kind of fitness band that you
would use if you're going out for an
intense exercise you wanted to you know
get your duration and your GPS and your
vo2 max it's not for that it's just your
everyday activity tracker so why would
Fitbit add heart rate sensors to this
tracker well I mean for one you can
check your heart rate throughout the day
so right now mine is seventy which is a
little high I think you're making me
nervous but you also get your resting
heart right now if you wear the Fitbit
to bed which is considered to be a key
baseline metric for your overall heart
health and speaking of sleep
Fitbit is now doing more advanced sleep
tracking not just with the alto but with
a few of its other wristbands as well so
this means you can now go into the app
after you've slept and you can see your
different sleep stages in a way that you
couldn't see it before and the app is
also giving you insights around your
sleep like how you sleep during the week
compared to the weekends or how that
informs other key metrics in your health
if it is not the first company to do
this I mean there have been other
wearable makers out there that have
tracked your sleep before and said what
kind of stages you're in when you're
sleeping and we
don't know how accurate all this is by
the way but it's a nice feature ad okay
so a few things to know about the Fitbit
Alta
it does have some automatic exercise
recognition technology which means if
you go for a brisk walk or an intense
run it's going to pick up on that but
you can't start or stop exercises like I
said earlier you also means I wouldn't
necessarily trust it when it comes to
accuracy if you want to know exactly how
many miles you ran I mean this doesn't
have GPS it's just using an
accelerometer so take that with a grain
of salt some people have also asked me
whether or not this would be a good
replacement for the charge - which is
also $150 and also has heart rate
sensors built in and my answer is no I
mean this is really meant to be more of
a stylish Fitbit kind of a basic Fitbit
and the charge to actually does have
specific exercise tracking by the way
this means Fitbit has nearly ten
different Fitbit models for sale on its
site right now along with that smart
scale that it's still selling and it's
all just kind of a repackaging of the
same feature sets in the same technology
with slight variations on features and
price so it's cool that the Alta now has
heart rate sensors but it's not like
this is the most innovative new Fitbit
we've seen so should you buy the Fitbit
Alta HR if you are one of those people
who bought the Alta last year and you
love that activity tracking wristband
and you've said to yourself on a dozen
occasions this is great but I really
wish I had heart rate tracking then this
is for you you should be really happy
because that position is easy right but
if you're looking for more tense
exercise tracking you want to stop and
start you want to track your runs and
your cycling and your swims and all that
other stuff this is not for you okay
this is just your everyday activity
tracker there are other products out
there beyond fitbit's by the way that do
more intense exercise tracking in fact
we've reviewed a lot of them so go to
the verge comm and check it out
for watching I'm learning good host of
this special episode on every Fitbit you
need to know about because there are
2700 of them now and we're going to
break it down in this 7 part miniskirt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
