moving image with Jason asta curator
here and you do a lot of the digital
media stuff exactly yes and you got
gifts I got gifts I got a wallet gifts
for you are these the first gifts that
you've placed in this museum then the
first ones that have been here since
I've been here I was just watching
upstairs I got a little Charlie Chaplin
like flip butcher hey there was a lot of
site guards a lot of pratfall a little
similar right which is a lot of gifts
are I mean you know gifts or maybe even
sort of like a new kind of foot book you
know like a very short five-second the
story or something so these are part of
a photoshop thread on something awful
that was called what trip tell Hadji
Diouf El Hadji Diouf is a soccer player
right who played for the Rangers and so
he was clobbered by an opponent right
actually we show you have the original
yeah the originals over here it was
posted by teeth in he was actually lives
in Brooklyn okay who sort of
mysteriously said I'm not allowed I'm
illegally not allowed to actually touch
photo manipulation software when he
posted this and he said yeah but he said
but here's the thing I found and I would
love to see this one this one and this
one together
okay and then said I would love to see
what everyone had something awful we
could do over 100 entries came in
inserting pop-culture video games
sight-gags what's crazy to me that I've
seen almost all of it
yeah I used to go to fark.com Alam and
they did these photoshop threads
similarly where somebody erases
everything yeah for exactly somebody
cuts just the guy out so that he can be
in any setting yeah like in solitaire
there's one where it's just the ball
right yeah over here
I love these meta which this available
starts to seem like a really
artistically how esoteric do you get
with like this is a new medium or
anything like that what I'm interested
in is how people are using these tools
to communicate on a daily basis yeah
because these tools are so cheap and so
readily available we're finding that
people are just using this as another
tool to like tell jokes or have
conversation and that's what I think is
really just thing about about this
threads that tells the story of some
people who don't claim to be artists you
know there's you know I don't have
titles they're not aspiring to any lofty
goals they I think also one of the other
interesting things about this for me is
how they're used like especially on
reddit like to respond to a post instead
of like writing like I like this or oh
this is gonna get good right you know
they're like these sort of canonized
gifts it's like a new emoticon yes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
