the new jawbone up the up first came out
last year but it had some serious issues
it actually just stopped working for a
lot of people and Java and wound up
offering everyone a refund for their
model Jawbone's been working on a new
model since then and promises that the
new one is sturdier more powerful and is
basically unbreakable and having spent a
week or so with it that seems to be true
on the outside though it's pretty much
the same thing it's a textured rubbery
bracelet available in a bunch of
different colors and it tracks your
every move the band itself is
nice-looking it's definitely something
you won't mind wearing all the time but
it's a little big and bulky for my taste
it comes on and off really easily it
doesn't have a clasp
it's just rigid enough to stay on your
wrist but the rubber can kind of stick
to your arm and it always got in my way
on the palm rest of my laptop kind of
clacking around it's just not very
comfortable
those aren't huge problems on it
definitely won't turn you off from using
this device you use the up to track
three things the first is your activity
it measures your steps throughout the
day and tracks them against a goal
you've set for yourself which is 10,000
steps a day by default uses that number
to track calories burned how much time
you've spent active versus inactive and
lots more it's really accurate and
really consistent and pulls a surprising
amount of data just from you wearing it
on your wrist and not thinking about it
the second thing I think is even cooler
yeah I've actually tracks their sleep
it'll tell you how long you slept how
much of that was deep sleep and how much
you woke up during the night it also has
a built-in alarm clock which is my
favorite thing it'll wake you up as much
as thirty minutes before the alarm you
set based on when you're in light sleep
and will wake up feeling better it works
incredibly well it's actually the only
alarm clock I don't want to just throw
out the window every morning when it
goes off the third thing you can track
is what you eat but that requires a lot
more effort on your part if what you're
eating has a barcode on its packaging
you can just scan that using your
iPhone's camera and the up app will
automatically grab all of its
nutritional information that part's
pretty cool but if there's no barcode
you can input it manually or use
Jawbone's food glossary and they'll work
fine but it's a lot of work to maintain
for every cup of coffee or a glass of
water or snack you eat you always have
to go and find exactly the thing you had
and then input information it's just a
lot of work if you're willing to do all
the work that the up system is pretty
great that syncs to your iPhone via the
headphone jack there's a port on the
bracelet itself
there's android app coming but it's not
here yet and it makes all of your data
really easy to see you can see how many
steps you've taken today and
how much sleep you got and see how
you're doing compared to your goal you
can also see a timeline of your food
sleep and activity or look at trends and
how you ate versus how you feel and so
on and so forth there are a lot of
different ways to use the data the
bracelets collecting and the app does a
great job of surfacing all of it
now the syncing itself is a little
clunky since you have to actually take
the bracelet off and plug it in every
time bluetooth would be a lot better but
it works fine as is the up cost $129 and
here's the thing it's really powerful
but it's a lot more work to maintain
than something like the Nike FuelBand
that's also a lot more complicated with
the fuel band it's all about whether you
did better or worse than your goal or
than you did yesterday but the up is
based much more in things like calories
and steps and tracking how you eat and
function and feel over time there's all
kinds of powerful stuff you can get out
of it but you have to put a lot more
time and effort into it if you really
want the most and most diverse data the
up or the Fitbit one is the way to go
the Fitbit has wireless syncing and an
Android app and a few more social
features but I like the UPS Hardware and
app a lot better and I like that it's a
wristband and not a clip that goes on
your pants and that you'll lose
immediately at least I did it's really
just a matter of personal preference
there for the right kind of person the
up could be a really great device but
you'll definitely only get out of it
what you put in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
