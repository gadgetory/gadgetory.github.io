here at the 2013 san diego comic-con
international and we're sitting here
with Seth Meyers from SNL and the new
who animated series their costumes thank
you for sitting down with us this is my
pleasure thank you for having me come so
real quick off the bat the awesomes
animated show on hulu superheroes why
the drama um well my co-creator and I
Mike shoemaker always loved superhero
teams big comic book fans but those are
always the kind of comic books we were
drawn to is ones with teams where you
sort of see the interpersonal
relationships between different
superheroes and so that's why we wanted
to do an animated show that was about a
superhero team and the awesomes of that
team cool well it's really funny we saw
like the the first episode earlier today
at a panel it's really funny it's like a
lot of like your collaborators from SNL
you guys are having a very good time
clearly that's what I like you know the
show came up you mentioned that the idea
first come up in 2006 who got aboard in
2011 yeah you know what was the process
but it takes long for it to come to life
well we have the idea and then we sort
of shopped around to different networks
and it had like sort of those beginning
development lives that projects have
places you know and it was never you
know we didn't have any bad experiences
it was just one of those things that you
know we do in animatic or we do like we
turn in a script and just sort of like
would stagnate places and we became a
thing that we sort of loved but lamented
that nothing more happened to it but
then who came along 2011 because they
were looking to original programming and
they were the first place that we're
willing to let us tell it the way we
wanted to tell it which was we wanted to
tell like sort of a longer story over
ten episodes the way that you know comic
books will often tell story over ten
issues and that was great and it was
just really lucky that the it stayed
alive enough as an idea to sort of wait
for the perfect vessel which was hulu
and citrus there's some of you know
people that are making you know online
programming now you know is it just a
better creative processor just different
it seemed obvious you got a lot of
freedom yeah you know and I've been
lucky to work in network television and
have a lot of freedom that's saturday
live as well so I haven't had any bad
experiences with network television but
I will say the reason my experience with
who has been really great is they sort
of stood by their promise which was we
want to do shows that are creative
driven we want to give you the space to
do the idea of the way you want it to be
done and so yeah it was a perfect
marriage for us and like I said I
haven't had any terrible experiences
with network television but I couldn't
had a better
barron's with hula awesome now
schedule-wise you're obviously very busy
here your co-creator with a you know
like night Jimmy Fallon he produces that
he's very busy yeah how do you guys find
the time to actually do this show well
it's funny we like in 2006 we had
nothing but time right way and it's
lucky for us that it's sort of a thing
we're very passionate about because I
think only with this level of passion
when we find the time to work on it as
much as we have um but you know that's
the thing you know you're really lucky
to for us you know we always thought
like once Mike left sarnia alive we
thought well at least the awesomes will
be a way for us to work together we
didn't realize we'd work together again
on Late Night with Seth Meyers but let's
congratulate something we were very
awesome so yeah but it's just been great
I mean again like when you grow up
loving comic books like one of your
dreams is to work on something close to
that so this has been wonderful now you
mentioned earlier all that most of the
cast is here um I heard that they were
you guys were recording pickup lines yes
yes so you're at comic-con well is the
perfect place to record pickup lines of
comic-con is yeah that's the most
fitting place to be doing it but you
know it's great because we you know
obviously that's an element you want to
change the line it's as easy as drawing
putting a piece of tape over a cue card
and writing in the new line like here
requires obviously recording the new
line and often we don't know we need a
new line until we see the animation so
yeah the animation company was smart
enough to bring a microphone here
because they're like we're probably not
gonna have all these guys together again
for a long time that's fantastic so you
know online series as well right you
know this last week was interesting I
mean nominations for rest development
house of cards do you think there's like
a fallen legitimization that's actually
happened at this point are we there yeah
I mean we've had nothing to do with it
but the timing of this obviously for our
show being on hulu is I think people are
coming to terms with the fact that like
it is actually television shows that is
online as opposed to I think that what
the way we've seen it for last you know
10 15 years which is webisodes like this
is a TV show it could be on a network it
just happens to be on hulu and you know
certainly when I go and who i'm watching
network shows that i'm used to seeing on
my television so hopefully it'll be an
easy transition for people to come to
terms with the fact that this is an
actual you know 22-minute television
show that could you know would be on any
other channel yeah I mean do what kind
of benefits you can there's going to be
for you know for writers directors you
know now that we're getting more pro
I mean this vein it's another Avenue
yeah look any time any any place says
we're gonna start doing more original
programming it's good news for people
who have original ideas so I think you
know who is commitment to it much like
Netflix commitment to it you know even
an Amazon committing to it like that's
just good news for people who want to do
creative things cool now back to late
night yes februari you yes it starts how
is it going uh it's good this is a very
nice time because you know it hasn't
sped up yet you know ever there's no
one's like sort of in the building right
now it's a good quiet time to sort of
work on things like staffing and and
sort of more like bigger themes about it
you know as we kind of get into the fall
it'll become a little bit more intense
but it's going to be so intense of them
that I think we're sort of enjoying
right now the idea of like this is gonna
be great when we do it and you know not
any any sort of details i think we try
to hammer down now we're just going to
sort of need to be rehabbed down come
februari so we're trying to we're trying
to ramp into it at a nice place between
that and the awesomes are you even
worried if I mean thinking about SNL
what that's gonna be like walking away
that it was easily in the back your head
somewhere you don't acknowledge I don't
think about SNL you know I'm gonna be
there in the fall and so I'm so mostly
thinking about just executing the job
and that part of it because I think
every summer you sort of you know around
this time sort of end of July beginning
of obvious you start thinking about like
ideas for the new SNL season so I'm feel
very lucky that I at least have to have
like one more run at it and but it'll be
heartbreaking leave SNL but I think the
best way to leave SNL's was something to
do right afterwards so you don't spend a
lot of time lamenting your decision well
hopefully I'll be busy enough to not
have those lemons very cool well looking
forward to that awesomes august first a
week earlier if you're on an xbox Seth
thank you so much as we get to meet you
thank you my pleasure take care
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
