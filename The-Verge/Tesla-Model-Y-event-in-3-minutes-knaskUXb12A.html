I hope you guys will all have
a really great time tonight.
So in terms of where we are today,
we've got, obviously, the S, 3, and the X.
We've made, I think, 550,000 vehicles.
Twelve months from now, we will have made
about a million vehicles.
It's pretty wild to think
that 11 years ago today,
we had made literally one car,
and a year from now, we
will have made a million.
There's a missing car.
(crowd laughs)
It starts with a Y, ends with a Y,
and has a Y in the middle.
Bring out the Model Y.
(rock music)
(crowd cheering)
The Model Y.
Yeah.
(crowd clapping and whistling)
So, like the 3, it
will be extremely safe,
so you may know the Model 3 has
the lowest probability
of injury of any car
ever tested by the US government.
The Model Y, we expect,
will have a similar result,
five stars in every category.
With the battery pack low in the floor,
it's going to have a very
low center of gravity.
It has the functionality of an SUV,
but it will ride like a sports car.
So this thing will be
really tight in the corners.
And we expect it will be the safest
midsized SUV in the world by far.
It's also going to have
incredible performance,
so expect to have 3.5-second 0-60.
(crowd member cheers)
Yeah, it's good.
It's testing out at
0.23 drag coefficient,
which is extremely good for an SUV,
and in terms of range,
300 miles.
(crowd cheers)
Yeah.
So it's going to have a panoramic glass roof.
It really feels just like the Model 3.
If you're in the car, it just
feels like you can see the sky.
It seats seven, 66 cubic feet,
obviously Autopilot and all that.
And, as I've said publicly,
we expect it to be feature complete
with self-driving sometime later this year.
And then as we prove out the safety
with billions of miles or kilometers,
we will, from our standpoint,
feel like it's safe enough
to not pay attention,
and then get the regular pre-approvals
sometime there after.
The cool thing is feature complete.
It'll be able to do basically anything
by the end of this year
just with software upgrades,
which is pretty cool.
(crowd cheering)
The basic long-range one we
expect to be about $47,000,
and then sometime in 2021, we'll have
the sort of standard version, which will be
at a $39,000 price point.
Ah, no. The seven seats are optional.
So there you have the sexy presentation.
Thank you all for coming.
We are bringing sexy back quite literally.
(crowd cheering)
All right, thank you.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
