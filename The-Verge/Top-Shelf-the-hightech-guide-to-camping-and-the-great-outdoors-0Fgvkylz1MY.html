Pierce and this week it seems like
everyone I know is out on vacation
everyone's out in the woods somewhere
pitching tents and roasting hot dogs so
we figured we'd talk about camping but
instead of doing our research and
talking to people and bringing everybody
into studio we figured what the hell
let's go camping
step one unload all your crap it's a lot
of work but it's a lot of fun and in the
midst of it you're probably not thinking
about the tent poles you left in the
garage or that parked acceding bag that
will probably keep you just a little too
toasty having the right gear isn't
necessarily what camping is about but it
can make your life a lot easier
Evan Rogers took a pretty traditional
approach to packet
I brought a regular tent pole from REI
and a pretty heavy sleeping bag from a
big-box retailer
I brought a light sleeping bag an
inflatable tent called the cave by a
German company called Heim planet and a
self popping tent called well the pop-up
tent why do they need more than one tent
that doesn't matter what matters is that
it took almost no time for me to set up
camp I can't say the same about my tent
it was a nice one-man pole tent but the
directions were a little cryptic and we
had that one missing piece left over the
ceiling sagged a little bit and I think
that's probably why it's a good thing it
didn't rain that's it my bag was well
warm I'm pretty sure I made the right
choice choosing light sleeping bags for
summer they're smaller lighter and a lot
easier to carry than winter sleeping
bags now for that tent the cave that
thing was cool it has these inflatable
geometric support braces that make it
look kind of like a spider all you have
to do is plug in the pump and pump it up
however it wasn't quite as easy to set
up as it should have been the tent has
these air valves around the base which
are kind of tough to spot when the tent
is deflated and if you miss one you just
pump forever and never get anywhere but
after I found and closed all of them the
tent went up with just a few pumps so
the first time might be a little tough
but once you know what you're doing the
cave is a great tent and an auto base
since it's about $750 then there was the
pop-up tent it went up just as described
you basically toss it like a frisbee
into the air and it has these flexible
braces that pop it into shape
that part was I'll admit a little
anticlimactic but it was up and ready to
go in one minute flat of course I gave
all that time back trying to take the
tent down the next day it's almost
impossible to fold back up and get back
into its back the dome took a long time
to take down - it takes a while to fully
deflate and it's made of this thick
stiff polyester that makes it really
hard to fold so these aren't tents that
you typically take hiking or backpacking
my intent was a little better suited
today it wasn't very fancy and it took a
hot minute to set up the super light and
collapses into a very small footprint
mine was super straightforward not
particularly easy or trying to be
really obvious putting things back in
the bag sticking them back together it
took a little longer to set up though I
think I was broken down and ready to go
away before David had anything put away
anyway it all depends on what you need
if you're taking a weekend camping trip
and you're leaving your tent back at
your campsite much of the time larger
tents that are easy to set up are
probably just what you're looking for
but if you're covering a lot of distance
or putting up your tent and breaking it
down every day if something lighter
makes a lot more sense I just wish I'd
brought better shoes okay so we're
settled now we've finally got our tents
working weights and dinner we explored
we finally figured out how to build a
fire and so now I want to figure out
like what else is cool about high-tech
camping so Evan Rogers camper to the
stars I don't know if that means camper
extraordinaire maybe that you yeah yeah
so you're you're a camper like this is
your thing
you know every the whole time we've been
here you've been like well when you
can't for real this is how you actually
do it
you're so like tell you what's your
camping situation tell me about it I
mean the camping situation is you only
want to take as much as you need because
taking a bunch of extra stuff doesn't
always help right but sometimes it makes
your life a lot easier so we have the
nice luxury this time of like not really
having to hike so much we just sort of
drove and then unpacked and now here we
are Yeah right which is nice it's a good
way to camp yeah my family always used
to like hike through places and this
seems much easier yes it's all the
camping and none of the like actual yeah
yes no sweating you don't wanna do that
yeah so what would you bring so it's
like you need a tent obviously any idea
I guess is like the smallest possible
for all of these things yes and a
sleeping bag yep the ends I guess well
I'm eating food give me food you need
some beverages you need just various
accessories but having a good backpack
yeah having good pair of shoes clean
socks clean socks are precious you think
you know even if you're going for like
three days maybe have like six days of
socks because you never know just
because there's really nothing worse
than a soggy pair of soft that's fair
yeah take in life just in general oh
yeah absolutely but so here so we had
some like deeply unnecessary but also
awesomely high-tech gadgets yes so and
we got to play with a bunch so like
what's what's cool what have you liked
what what makes it into the
Evan Rogers repertoire here well the
first thing that I really have enjoyed
using is the bio light camp stove yeah
and it's really complex when we cooked
on we made our whole dinner on this tiny
little stone yeah it's it's super
compact it's really light
it's like $129 so it's not terribly
expensive but it has an attachment on it
that blows into the chamber where the
fire is and it uses that to like stoke
up the fire so that you can cook things
on it really easily and like really
quickly - and it also charges your cell
phone or any other USB gadget so you
might have yeah it just uses the fire -
yeah right yeah like that's where you
don't need to charge it at all it
charges itself it's totally
self-sufficient all you have to do is
get some twigs and sticks and put them
in there and you've got power and dinner
and this company has like a crazy
backstory to it right they've been doing
stuff like this and they do it make a
bunch of other cool products - yes they
they've been developing the bio light
stove for for a long long time and they
have a they have some other products
that they're testing out in developing
markets to really like improve the
quality of life of people that don't
have all the modern accoutrements that
we have right so I mean their hearts are
absolutely in the right place and the
bio like camp stove is solid products
well this thing would think it blew my
mind it's like the thing is like this
big around and you just drop a bunch of
twigs in I kept waiting for like the
extra step the thing that would make
this more complicated but there just
isn't one you just light it and then it
just goes forever yeah it's it's burning
over there right now it's it just won't
stop burning yeah and it's really it's
really safe it stays really cool on the
outside so like you can pick it up if
you have to and move it it's it's I mean
it looks nice yeah it's great yeah so
what other cooking stuff is is useful we
have I have a titanium spork that we
picked up I was just gonna say I think
the most important thing is sports yes
that is the single best camping
invention take two things turn them into
one camping gold right and it's on tape
it's really strong it's got kind of like
a good cutting edge on the side and it's
really easy to clean because titanium so
yeah total win in my book okay so can I
tell you my favorite thing this is
deeply this is what we're veering way
into the you certainly don't need this
for camping but I think it's really yes
yes so I for me it's cameras and and I
found two
that I think are really awesome and one
I know you just discovered - one is the
rx100 mark - yeah that thing is crazy
insane this fire is crazy well yeah
there's that but it's it's like the best
pocket camera ever it's insane
bringing it actually fits in your pocket
right and I'm just - bringing a fat DSLR
on trips like this because I want good
pictures that's the point of going on a
trip if you don't take pictures right
and everyone sees it and is jealous of
your trip right why even go but so
that's awesome it's so small but the
pictures that actually come out of it
are insane my family's I handed this to
I was like it's great and you did not
believe me at all I mean yeah and then
given this would you believe it but it's
the pictures look phenomenal out of it I
mean it's got like it doesn't have the
best bokeh in the world but I mean it
has an approachable bokeh for like a
point-and-shoot camera like it's a city
otherwise brought giant DSLRs yeah 11
times the size of this camera I mean it
actually fits in the pocket which is
insane yeah Lorena's watch tell me
that's what yes oh yes this Garmin
Phoenix it's a huge huge watch but it is
it is a single Randy Jackson yes looks
like a Randy Jackson watch it really is
except for it has a ton of features it's
got a fully functional GPS on it it's
got tons of points of interest that you
can just look up on the watch the
battery lasts for pretty good while
while you have the GPS on and the big
thing is is that you can set a waypoint
wherever you are
so like fruit this campsite for example
and if we go hiking and you know we may
get lost we got that freedom yeah that's
awesome it's really interesting ok so
I'm going back to the realm of utterly
unnecessary things that are still really
cool hit me so this thing is a headlamp
it's a lamp that you wear in your head
very exciting but what this is is
there's all sorts of unbelievable
technology in this thing that I don't
even understand but it has remember
those cars that had the headlights that
would look around the corner for you yes
this has that I don't even know how to
get this thing on my head it's so
intense but it this has lights that move
so it has lights it also adapts when
you're looking at it so it figures out
how much light you need to guide your
path and will Ratchet back depending on
what you need so that it can preserve
battery and it has a
basically computer back here that you
wear on your head this is I feel like
this is a one of those things that they
wore in the 80s that was like the
computer of the future on top of your
head and this is researchers were
excited about tests this is one hundred
and seventy-five dollars which is just
absurd for a head lamp well but if it's
one of those things that if I were in
you know the Amazonian rainforest yep
and I had to get home in the middle of
the night I would want this thing and
this this is easily the least practical
thing I could possibly imagine bringing
on a camping trip
it's a humidifier it's called the melody
made by a company called sound cast okay
it was I think 10 pounds it's a 360
degree speaker it has 20 hours of
battery life that's basically all this
thing is Wow battery and it sounds
awesome
like really really good and you can you
know we could annoy everyone within 40
miles of us with this thing and it has
bluetooth and you can plug it into a
line in and you know there's the jam box
which you could fit 40 oh yeah and I
guess if you brought 40 damn boxes it'll
probably be louder than this but all in
one this is really cool and really
expensive and might also be a king
goodbye so this is a car I would never
get honestly I would never recommend to
anyone that they take this on a camping
trip but if you do you'll be super
stoked about it because it sounds
fantastic
okay so let's go back to GPS for a
second sure so I'm a challenge for you
so we're gonna get some sleep we're
gonna you know sleep in these
unbelievably incredible tents actually
get the crappy one that you set up and
I'm gonna sleep in both of the
unbelievable tents it's gonna be great
but so then tomorrow morning what's
gonna happen is we have all these cool
GPS gadgets and I'm going to take them
all okay and you are gonna take none of
them all right and you're gonna get a
compass I bought you a compass it was it
was 13 dollars you get a regular compass
it's just a cardinal direction it's a
compass okay it has a hand on it all I
know and then we're gonna go get lost
we're gonna go get terribly lost and
we're gonna race back to basically this
spot okay it's back first wins
okay all right let's go get ready now
okay challenge accepted sir imagine
you're camping and suddenly you're
stranded you took a wrong turn looking
for the lake or running away from a bear
and now you don't know where you are you
could follow the path of the Sun I guess
but I have no idea
do that something about east and west
right so Evan and I decided to get the
exact same amount of lost in our
campground and chart two very different
paths home mine insanely high tech Evans
decidedly low-tech David had all the
gadgets we've brought and I had a $13
keyring compass from REI because David
wouldn't buy me anything better so he
parted ways and I basically just started
wandering off I had a vague sense of
where we'd come and it was still early
enough in the morning that I could sort
of figure out where the right direction
was then it was just a matter of
following the past and making sure I was
always headed in roughly the same
direction navigating without any
gadgetry it's mostly about keeping your
eyes open and minding your direction oh
and getting back before sunset I on the
other hand had four gadgets to guide me
home the Garmin Phoenix a crazy $400
high-tech watch that has GPS all kinds
of sensors for altitude and pressure
alarm clocks and god only knows what
else
I liked it mostly for one thing you can
at any time set a waypoint basically it
drops a pin wherever you are then no
matter where you are just navigate to
your Waypoint once you've figured out
all that clunky menus and you're set and
in case that didn't work I had another
Garmin device the Oregon 650 T it looks
like the ugliest Android phone ever and
works that way too but it's also a super
powerful gps device and just in case I
brought my phone along oh and just in
case it got dark before I made it I had
the hundred and seventy five dollar
Petzl now headlamp the crazy high-tech
flashlight with adaptive lighting that
looks around corners so I was either
gonna make it back before Evan or just
outlive him in the woods somewhere all
David had to do was follow directions I
had to figure out mine for myself
luckily we weren't in a particularly
complicated place there definitely
weren't any bears my compass never
showed me exactly where we were or where
I was supposed to be it just showed me
where I'd been and where I was going I
made kind of a beeline for our campsite
but it wasn't nearly as easy as I
thought first of all I had to constantly
look at a screen and I tripped over
everything
second GPS really isn't perfect all
three of my devices told me slightly
different things and would occasionally
reset if they lost signal and
tree-filled spots I'd find out I was
going in the wrong direction only after
my watch figured it out on some level
having only one direction was kind of
useful
I knew roughly where I needed to be and
roughly how to get there I could make my
own pass as long as I was heading in the
right direction so ultimately we made it
back at pretty much the same time I bet
if we switch places Evan would
me by a thousand miles though David beat
me by a few seconds but I'm pretty sure
I'd have destroyed him if the odds were
evened but that's the thing about these
gadgets they're really great if you're a
novice but for most people all they do
is bring you up to speed if you're an
experienced camper you don't really need
a fancy GPS to get back to camp though
it certainly doesn't hurt but if you're
new at it it's huge I wasn't paying any
attention at all what we were getting
lost and with only a compass to my name
I definitely would have died that's true
of a lot of the things we used on our
trip brilliant our camp stove was
probably overkill even though it was
awesome even having a super easy to
assemble tent was probably more than you
needed all these devices are great and
they definitely make camping less
daunting but even after having all these
toys I'll probably just go back to
camping the way I always did except the
biolite stove I'm keeping that one
around just to charge my phone
so one thing technology hasn't really
changed is that by the end of camping
you're still just gross so we're all
gonna go home and take a shower which
means that's our show thanks so much for
watching we'll see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
