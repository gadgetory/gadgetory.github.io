should trust me because I'm into some
terrible e3's I'm going to explain why
this one in particular matters with for
helpful reasons one is super obvious but
people actually brought video games over
the past couple years we've been so
focused on an actual hardware that plays
the games got the games themselves high
and playing second fiddle this year
there is a bounty of video games for all
types of people whether you want to
shoot people in the face or shoot people
in the arms or not shoot people at all
which I hear is a new trend there is
something for you which brings me to
number two did you like old games that
came out a long time ago but you like
them to look a little bit better well
don't worry everyone has you covered
this is officially the year of the
remaster we have a new version of gears
of war one that looks nicer than the
last version we have rare replay which
is 30 video games across I don't know
like the Atari or something wooden
people play back in the day I'm too
young still even though I'm old I'm
turning 30 this year I'm gonna die in a
shallow grave and we can't talk about
remix without talking about the king of
all remakes Final Fantasy 7 remake
announced by square enix it sony's press
conference i'm sure we'll see it by the
year twenty thirty two number three vr
and AR virtual reality or augmented
reality or mixed reality if you're a
publicist took Microsoft it turns out
people actually cared about these things
and years passed the relationship with
virtual reality and video games has kind
of been thin you could get the general
vibe that hey this might work but I
don't really want to put too much money
into it in case it utterly fails sony is
really enthused about the potential of
Morpheus in Microsoft is overwhelmingly
ecstatic about hololens its augmented
reality system that is also going to be
the world's most popular way to play
minecraft when if it ever comes out
number four and most important of all
diversity it turns out video games are
finally realizing that you can invite
half the
relation to enjoy this medium women
appeared at press events on stage not
nearly as many as men until a small
percentage but it's a start and you can
actually play as female characters in
video games there was time clearly made
to show that this would be an option and
fallout in Assassin's Creed it's easily
the most interesting new game shown at
the show horizon zero dawn star is a
strong woman who looks like she could
kill pretty much anything including
robotic dinosaurs so yeah it's a nice
time to be at e3 it feels like an e3
that actually wants people to be here it
feels like an show that I don't have to
cringe through because it spends a large
chunk of its time making people who
don't look like me feel like they're not
welcome and it's kind of thrilling now
let's hope that what's happening here at
e3 can kind of rally forward through the
rest of the year so that people who want
to talk about games and interesting and
different in critical ways can feel like
they can hop onto social media without
being attacked by crazy people
