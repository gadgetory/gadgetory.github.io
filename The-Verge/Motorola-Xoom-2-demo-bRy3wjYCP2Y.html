a look at Motorola's new
second-generation zune tell you what
we're looking at right now is a 10.1
inch zoom to the bottom the 8.2 zoom to
media edition above it and then the
droid razr right on top so this gives us
a good idea of how thin this new tablets
are can tell us the exact dimensions for
both of them yep see you're looking at
from the bottom upwards this is 8.99 on
the zoom too yep and 8.8 on the media
edition and obviously to 7.1 on the
razor so you can see all device is
really driving fingers across the phone
awesome and let's take a look around the
devices they see what it look like okay
let me show you the underside and baby
first yeah so this is the sim 2 i'm your
see from the design we've taken through
the razor designer brought it onto the
tablets as well so you have your cart
away corners here I get very nice and
easy to rest into the hand when you're
horny so 1280 by 800 display very large
10.1 inch as I mentioned you've got a
front facing camera here if for clippos
with a device you have the rear camera
little back here with the flash and you
can see the designer here having a soft
touch around the back yep and then a
metallic metaclass finishing and those
are stereo speakers around them yeah
this one actually got a 3d virtual
surround sound on there so it's real
item music video 5 megapixel camera LED
flash yep pod focus yes sorta focuses
more it's too late EP capture and
understand these are IPS displays that
you now have a minicab yes now that I
pierced despise visit extra brightness
and clarity and you can see from the
screen yourself
ok your just due to the side a bit so we
can see the viewing angle will seem
close your fingerprints but that's kind
of expected as much yeah so you can see
that less on the display is
fantastically brilliant display what we
also have here is a stylist so we have
an optional stylus which will be
available at launch as well the elite
are works perfectly with the 10.1 ish so
you can see I can just scroll through
late my sneezing here I can open up the
apps here you can see all the
applications at the preinstalled so
we've put the Citrix client we've put
Evernote digit which turns the device
into a infrared control for a motor on
your house we got a fuze meeting which
is for multiple persons video conversing
kadaga gotomeeting quickoffice we've got
the schedule appt much lots into
evernote we've got 24 DLNA now we've
also got our minds mikhast application
here which we started with the razor ok
just about there this is a very powerful
passive stylus yes absolutely actually
just goes in the back there takes a
quadruple a battery in the back and
works on a 10 point on it all right and
it tell us about multiple stuff so motor
cast is the technology that motorola
introduced to the market two weeks ago
with moto razr we also putting it across
both the 10.1 inch on the media edition
so what you see here is I'm connected to
directly to a macbook pro that's sitting
about 50 miles away in a house of one of
my colleagues allows you to access all
of the files and applications on
instructing it you can also access any
music any albums and any videos you can
see this is live streaming I can go and
select one of the songs so on I here or
just hit play then it will start to
start to go back and pull out that
that's all directly I can go back here
and choose an album so I can click on
that albums right and this is connected
by Wi-Fi because both tablets a Wi-Fi
devices yeah
Wi-Fi devices any chances of freezer
device in the future potentially we're
asking the wifis today and if we have
any more information in due course will
provide that as well and they're
available in the middle of November in
the UK and Ireland yes and you know sent
us about other markets no today's before
you can I totally in the coffin
warehouse specify pcworld Curry's
Dixon's all should be available in the
next two weeks right pricing is now
available so for the this device you're
seeing here now the retail price is 379
pounds 37 9 99 and the media edition is
329 lines can take a little quick look
at the media edition so he you see on
the front the same design language on
the side you see is very thin as with
the other one you have the buttons on
the side here for power and volume up
and down even if it's got the same
camera from major on the slide that's
the device back in itself mustard and
you'll see this one is actually designed
so it does fit in the back of my jeans
pocket okay we'll take your word for
that you think</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
