the keynote hey I can't make it now this
is the least I can do you pull I'm there
thanks Jess I mean what are you going to
talk about is there anything insider
information you can give me we're gonna
talk about some great stuff
like to get started with a few updates
beginning with Apple music Apple music
has grown to over 17 million subscribers
there's a great new simple and intuitive
design and iOS 10 this past year alone
Apple music was the first place to hear
over 70 great releases the combination
of our incredible products and the
success of the App Store has made the
iPhone and the iPad the most popular
gaming devices in the world but there's
been something or rather someone missing
and I'm so happy to announce today he is
coming to the App Store with any people
as possible all around the world to be
able to enjoy playing as Mario and
they'll be doing it first on iOS
now as the title suggests Mario runs
automatically to the right and as he
does he'll hurtle small gaps in certain
enemies collect as many coins as you can
and get to the flagpole at the end of
the level blue announced pricing later
but Super Mario run will release in time
for holidays in 2016 so that's a brief
update on the App Store let's turn our
attention to Apple watch we call it
Apple watch series 2 and it has been
completely re-engineered it's rated
water-resistant 50 meters the watch
needs to withstand the pressure the
water pressure equivalent of being at a
depth of 50 meters so for series 2 we
redesign the speaker system and at the
end of your workout we use the speaker
itself to eject the water s2 takes that
to a whole new level we've added a
dual-core processor that's up to 50%
faster a new tirely new GPU that
delivers two times the graphics
performance it is the brightest display
Apple has ever shipped on any product
1000 nits we've added built-in GPS
series to comes in a wide variety of
styles as well as a new material
real we've been working on for quite
some time
ceramic this new white Apple watch and
ceramic has this gorgeous pearl like
shine it the finish is remarkably smooth
is actually four times harder than
stainless steel Apple watch Series 2
will be priced at 369 and we're keeping
in the line our original Apple watch but
we've done something with it we've added
the same dual-core processor that's in
series 2 so it's just as snappy and
we're calling it series 1 starts at just
269 you can pre-order both series 1 and
series 2 on September 9th the watches
will go on sale both series 1 in series
2 the following week next up is iPhone
it's the best iPhone that we have ever
created it has a gorgeous new design an
aluminum body and foam sheet of gloss
describe a singular shape Tim and Johnny
have told you that there is a beautiful
new refined design for iPhone 7 it
starts with this new finish we call
jet-black there's a second new black we
call it simply black and it looks very
cool very high-tech well the new iPhone
7 also looks beautiful in gold and in
silver coarse rose gold the home button
is quintessential Apple design click it
to go home we double click it to bring
in multitasking we've re-engineered it
it's now force-sensitive solid-state it
works together in combination with a new
generation taptic engine in fact it's so
useful we use it throughout the user
experience so if you do a quick action
like moving a widget it gives you a nice
taptic feedback there's unique feedbacks
for notifications and messages and even
your ringtones the new enclosure and
iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus are water and
dust resistant and to do that and
provide this resistant meant
re-engineering it from the inside out
let's talk about the camera everything
about it is entirely new so this is the
iphone 7 camera new 12 megapixel camera
system with optical image stabilization
wider F 1.8 aperture six elements in the
lens that sensor 60% faster now a quad
led true tone flash are incredibly fast
isp and white color capture it is the
best camera ever in an iphone and this
is what we're doing on iphone 7 there's
now - 12 megapixel cameras built in the
iPhone 7 plus so why have to complete
cameras with two lenses so we know with
two cameras and two different lenses we
can create the zoom feature built-in to
the iPhone but now with this button you
can do one of two things first you can
just tap it and it jumps to 2x here's an
example to photos side by side one on
the Left taken at 1x the one on the
right of 2 X so that's the camera in
iPhone 7 plus joining iPhone 7 with this
great new zoom feature so our goal is to
try to do something like this
using the two cameras in the iPhone 7
plus there's a new style that says
portrait you select portrait it
automatically jumps to using a telephoto
lens because that 56 millimeter lens is
great for portrait lens and
automatically you see the depth effect
is another photo that's absolutely
beautiful one more so how will I Phone 7
+ users get this great feature well
simple it will be a free software update
later this year to all iPhone 7 plus
users earpods
Apple earpods are the most popular
headphones in the world and with iPhone
7 and 7 plus we're moving to connecting
them over lightning so we've also made
this it's an adapter Lightning 2 mini
foe no audio adapter I'm going to
include that in the box with every
iPhone 7 and 7 plus as well wireless up
till now no one has taken on the
challenge to really deliver the audio
experience wirelessly between your
mobile device and your headphones in a
way that takes advantage of the
opportunities to do something new and do
something great that is why today we are
so excited to show you a new product
from Apple called Apple earpods we
believe in a wireless future
the future where all of your devices
intuitively connect you try it you're
just going to be blown away and it all
started with a brand new chip w1 chip
Apple's first wireless chip and there's
so much technology packed into each air
pod as the chip
there's dual accelerometers optical
sensors beamforming microphones antennas
batteries five hours each and there's a
battery and charger built into its case
so you can recharge directly from the
battery in the case for up to 24 hours
of listening well ship in late October
and price is just one hundred and fifty
nine dollars what's happening today with
iPhone 7 and 7 plus blows that all away
is we have a new generation chip in the
iPhone 7 and it's called
a10 fusion a10 fusion is a 64-bit 4 core
processor with over 3.3 billion
transistors it is a rocketship so what
will I phone 7 costs just six hundred
and forty nine dollars it comes in
silver gold rose gold black in the new
jet black we've doubled all the stores
capacitive configurations so now it's 32
gigabytes 128 gigabytes a 256 gigabytes
and jetpack black specifically comes on
128 and 256 gig sizes iPhone 7 plus
starts at 769 it also comes in 32
gigabytes 128 gigabytes and 256
gigabytes and again jet-black
specifically on 128 and 256 gigabytes
when can you order the new iPhone 7 for
7 plus orders start this Friday on
September 9 it will start shipping one
leap week later on September 16 what a
morning I hope that you can get a sense
from all the details that we've shared
the level of care that we put into the
products the most advanced iPhone ever
air pods and the new Apple watch series
