getting a sequel hopefully they don't
leave it open for a trilogy
I'm TC sonic and this is 90 seconds on
the verge Apple and Samsung returned to
court this week for round two of its
patent infringement Court battle the
first trial which ended less than two
years ago saw Apple convinced jurors
that Samsung made billions of dollars
copying the iPhone so what's different
this time around
simpler patents for one Apple will try
to convince the court that Samsung
wholesale copied many of the features
found in the original iPhone including
slide to unlock in Universal Search the
other big difference is Google Samsung's
signed a broad cross licensing agreement
with Google last January and now Samsung
is arguing Google independently
developed many of the software features
Apple has accused it of copying Apple
will still paint itself as a huge risk
taker with the launch of the original
iPhone while Samsung will suggest Apple
as being a bully trying to stifle
competition it's worth noting that have
the almost 20 products listed only a
handful are still on sale most have been
retired
it also doesn't cover any company's
latest products since the lawsuit was
filed in 2012 and only just made it to
trial ultimately this case isn't about
money the financial damage both sides
are asking for is relative chump change
for the tech companies this is about
Apple and Samsung two extremely bitter
rivals battling it out in every venue
imaginable it's the hangover part ii of
sequels more of the same with just a
little more google this time around for
more on Apple vs samsung check out the
verge coming up two star-crossed lovers
one and Apple executive the other is
Samsung VP fall in love amidst heated
battle between two rival families love
tragedy and patents collide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
