gotten really good over the last few
years and that includes shooting video
but which phone is the best for video
right now so we've been testing out some
of the best ones released this year the
iPhone 10 the Google pixel 2 XL the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 HTC you 11 and the
LG v 30 and here's how we think they
compare to each other when it comes to
capturing footage of our everyday lives
now when it comes to straight up image
quality the pixel to excel the iPhone 10
and the notte are a definite step above
the others these phones capture crisper
footage with more information in the
brightest and darkest parts of a scene
which means they're going to be able to
handle challenging lighting situations
better and more consistently than the
others the note eight captures what is
probably the best footage to edit it's
very flat meaning there is not much
contrast and there's a lot of details
the iPhone 10 is right behind it the
footage isn't as flat which means that
looks a little better right out of the
camera even if that means it's a little
worse for editing the pixel to excel
footage is pretty much just as good but
has a tendency to look a little
oversaturated at times which I really
didn't like of course good video isn't
just all about image quality there are
tons of other factors to consider
one thing that note 8 does best is it
has the highest resolution front-facing
camera of all of these phones it can
shoot quad HD or 2k footage in selfie
mode which looks really impressive and
is great if you want to vlog on the go
the pixel 2 XL has the best
stabilization of all three of these
phones which means it's footage looks
super smooth but the pixels sound
recording is noticeably worse than the
iPhone 10 or the note
selfie camera the pixel also doesn't
have dual cameras which means it's not
quite as versatile the iPhone 10 and the
note 8 each have a second telephoto rear
camera and that means you can capture a
greater variety of footage with those
phones the LGV 30 also has a second rear
camera but it's a super wide one and it
looks like a GoPro a little bit which is
kind of cool but I think it looks better
in photos than it does with the video on
this phone we could do this back and
forth all day the node 8 has faster
autofocus than the iPhone 10 but the
iPhone lets you shoot super slow-motion
at 240 frames a second with the
telephoto lens and the node 8 doesn't do
that meanwhile the pixel to excel will
only let you shoot 240 frames a second
at a lower resolution than those other
two phones the point here is the note 8
and the iPhone 10 are the best out of
these 5 phones when it comes to shooting
video if I have to pick a winner it
would probably be the node 8 just
because of that slight edge and image
quality on both sets of cameras front
and back but either of those two or the
pixel to excel will still serve you
really well when it comes to shooting
video on your smart phone hey thanks for
watching if you want to see a full in
depth comparison between the iPhone 10
the Google pixel to excel the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 the HTC u 11 and LG v 30
we did a video with James b√¶rum you can
watch that right here and make sure to
