you shouldn't leave your phone plugged
in overnight doing so depreciates your
battery life and makes it age faster
you're killing your battery I always
charge my phone overnight and then
always let it reach a full hundred
percent charge am I really killing my
battery am i a murderer I can't live
with this guilt so I called it some
battery experts to find the truth
Daniel Steingarten associate professor
at Princeton University told that
actually did you hear that I'll say it
again as much as you can the way he sees
it is that we all need our phones ready
in charge so you might as well keep them
fully charged Trevor your phone is
pretty smart and its software recognizes
when it reaches full charge so you can't
technically overcharge your battery
problem solved
but not really I also called Venkat
Srinivasan the director of the Argonne
collaborative Center for energy storage
science and he told me don't charge the
battery all the way to other percent get
it up to 90% and then stop it he never
lets his phone reach a full charge what
he says we should keep our phones
between 30 and 80 percent charged
because once they reach a hundred
percent certain reactions occur that to
gravy electrolytes and depreciate our
batteries so this is probably where that
overcharging myth comes from alright so
I went back to Dan and I asked him to
clarify like Venkat says you're wrong
and Dan told me that both of them are
actually right so awesome you do damage
your battery when you charge to 100% but
if you're going to that full charge
already keeping it there it doesn't harm
it basically if you are a normal human
who just needs their phone on all the
time feel free to go to 100% and keep it
plugged in forever but if you care a lot
about your battery's life like a lot a
lot or you don't use your phone that
much Govan cats are out and try to keep
it in the narrow charging range
I admire your discipline and maybe
you'll extend your battery's lifespan
ultimately though batteries are meant to
be used and phones are meant to be used
to you don't do any damage by leaving it
at a hundred you'll probably replace
your phone before your battery totally
dies or in a worst-case scenario you
replace the battery that's not
that okay glad we settled this go live
your truth keep it 100 good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
