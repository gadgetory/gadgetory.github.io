robertson and when i was in middle
school people used to tease me and call
me for eyes good thing I had those extra
ones surgically removed this is 90
seconds on the verge the next-gen
console war has begun and Sony is off to
a very good start the ps4 which was
released on Friday sold over a million
units in just 24 hours despite launching
only in the US and Canada this makes it
Sony's fastest selling console and one
of the fastest selling game consoles
ever of course not everything went
according to plan some ps4 owners
complained of a quote blue light of
death in which the consoles light bar
flashes blue but it never outputs a
video signal or boots up Apple is always
looking to make big move but this time
is quite literal the company is
reportedly in talks to acquire
primeSense the Israeli company whose
technology chips and designs are inside
the first Kinect sensor to the xbox 360
neither company has commented on the
rumored 345 million dollar acquisition
with reports of an apple television on
the horizon it's possible that
primesense may play some part in an
apple living room push or in future
mobile devices and finally on-again
off-again TV show The Killing is back on
again Netflix will exclusively are the
final season of the acclaimed show which
will consist of six episodes the killing
was canceled twice by AMC but it proved
to be a streaming hit on Netflix brought
back by popular demand the final season
will air without any involvement from
AMC so what we're saying is cling to
those hopes that Firefly is coming back
and that's it for today's top stories
coming up tomorrow we answer the classic
question of which came first the chicken
salad or the egg salad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
