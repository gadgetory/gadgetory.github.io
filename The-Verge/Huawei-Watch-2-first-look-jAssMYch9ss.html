looking at the Huawei watch - this is
the latest Android wear SmartWatch form
Huawei it's running Android wear 2.0 and
it comes with built in LTE for mobile
connectivity and data on the go
you also got GPS for tracking your
location when you're out and about and
you've got a heart rate sensor on the
inside and it's also NFC which supports
Android paint so you can use it for
paying things at the store - now
compared to the last while way
SmartWatch we saw that was the wire way
watch was unveiled back in 2015 it's got
a bit of a smaller display 1.2 inches
instead of 1.4 inches it's also a bit
thicker as you can see there on the side
a bit of a chunkier model and that's
presumably to fit in the extra
connectivity like the LTE connection the
rest of the watch is pretty standard
you've got two buttons on the side
you've got a microphone in the speaker
and inside you've got a 420 milliamp
battery
now while weigh says that will get you
battery life that will last you around
two days and you've also got a low power
mode which will last for 24 days says
Huawei but that will only tell you the
time and count your steps
there's interchangeable straps and also
ip68 water resistance now as we've seen
with other Android watch makers in the
market Huawei is kind of focusing on
fitness and health tracking with this
one so I've only been playing with this
thing for a couple of minutes but my
initial impressions are that it's a kind
of a cheaper feeling watch than we've
previously seen from Huawei it's made
out of plastic rather than metal to
allow for the LTE connection it's also a
bit of a chunky design it's quite
masculine and it doesn't seem like
Huawei is bringing out any smaller
models that might be better suited for
people with smaller wrists now why away
says the watch 2 will be available in
European markets including Spain France
Portugal Italy and Germany in March and
in April it'll be coming to the US the
UK and other European countries the
highway watch 2 has the plastic chassis
to allow for the LTE connection but if
you do want a metal exterior you can go
for the far away watch - classic
pricing will begin at 329 euros which is
about 350
dollars so that's it for the Huawei
watch - stay tuned for more news from
MWC and find us at youtube-dot-com
