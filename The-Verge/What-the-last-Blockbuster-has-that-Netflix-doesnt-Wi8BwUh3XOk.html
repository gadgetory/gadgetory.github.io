changed we have Netflix Hulu and just
about everything right at our fingertips
but like everything online there's an
algorithm telling us what it thinks we
want to watch you know our
personalization learns from what you
watch how long you watch it how quickly
how quickly do you go to the next
episode and while that can be helpful
and also restricts us to watching the
same kinds of movies but there was a
time before the algorithm when your
movie selection was based on spontaneity
word of mouth and for most of us that
experience came from blockbuster nobody
has the movie I want in 1994 Viacom
acquired blockbuster for 8.4 billion
dollars and by 2004 blockbuster had over
9000 stores across the world now in the
u.s. there's only one we went to Bend
Oregon to see what we lost and
algorithms replaced human curation and
how a small town became home to the last
blockbuster in America
so we are in Bend Oregon we're going to
a big-box retailer to watch the general
manager hand-picked DVDs for the store
so that people can rent them later from
Blockbuster she has to go to the store
because blockbuster corporate doesn't
exist anymore
there's nobody sending them DVDs so full
disclosure we called the big-box store
before shooting here to get a location
release but out of concern for the
blockbuster manager of Sandy the store
didn't want to sign because technically
what she's doing here goes against the
retailer's policy up it's probably the
most popular one that I bought in here
we sell that one a law and rent at a
time wolf of Wall Street very popular
Leonardo DiCaprio yes Lord of the Rings
always we sell this one constantly and
rent it out all the time sandy Harding
is the general manager of Blockbuster
where she's been working for the last 10
years
she knows what movies her customers want
and she can even identify a lot of them
just by their voice when they call the
store she uses a service in Portland
that sends them about 80% of their
videos and she shops through the rest
every Tuesday morning you get the new
ones online it's the classic stuff that
people can't always find so they come in
to see us because they know they get it
sandy is basically doing what Netflix
does knowing what her customers want to
rent and serving that to more people I
mean that's business
but in the case of this store there's a
specific community in mind which makes
the whole thing more personal oh
there it is I never thought I would see
that sign again it smells the same it
absolutely smells the same oh wow I
haven't seen any of these things any of
these cases or any of these movies
before it's been so long since I've been
in a DVD rental place like this is
so much stuff there's a place for both
there's a place for Netflix and Hulu and
Amazon and there's a place for this and
I think that we finally found that
comfortable spot and so I think that
people are starting to realize that
coming in here picking up a movie
walking around talking about movies is
something that people miss it's hard to
find spaces where the point is
discovering things or the point is being
around people who like the same things
as you the employees of the store care
about movies and more importantly they
care about sharing them with people I
mean just look at the section of
employee tix it's updated regularly from
me theas is a really cool sci-fi movie
it's actually based on the alien series
another one rec room for a dream is
great the employee showing me around the
store is Sandy's son Ryan this is
actually completely edited on a software
that's totally free for anybody which is
a DaVinci Resolve as we move toward
these digital spaces we lose the
expertise of people like Ryan you can
walk down the aisle and have a movie
jump out at you or you can ask someone
for a recommendation you definitely walk
in and you will be looking along
bookshelf and then next thing you know
you see something that might catch your
eye it's not something that's just right
on the screen my kids can wander around
and a lot of times they're picking out
movies that wouldn't be as popular as
others sometimes they come in and I just
want to I feel like seeing a movie and I
don't know what it's gonna be
and sometimes I walk out of here with
like five totally different genres it
was I was surprised to learn that we
were the last one so while they are the
last blockbuster in the u.s. there was a
time when they were an independent video
store before they were consumed by the
corporate chain we converted in 2000
Blockbuster they made us an offer we
couldn't refuse we were in in here being
Pacific video being very happy and they
came to town and said well we need more
blockbusters in this town and we'd
likely to convert and if you don't we're
gonna put a couple more blockbusters in
so Kentish er is the owner of this store
and has been since it was Pacific video
back in the 90s and is a great movie
town boys has been people were amazed
when we had four stores the population
was only about fifty fifty-five thousand
and they said there is no way that that
town can support that many stores and
yet it did Bend is located three hours
outside of Portland and it's small it
seems like everything is five minutes
away the people here really care about
their art downtown you'll find literally
dozens of shops town and locally made
products there's a yearly Film Festival
and outside of that there are three
theaters two of which are independent
that show features and shorts year-round
it's a town that takes pride in its
craft and its community it's a really
interesting town in that you know it's
relatively small but people have such a
love for the art form that all of us
including Ben film are able to do pretty
well that's Todd Looby who runs Ben's
film festival it's celebrating its 15th
anniversary this October I think the
curation aspect is super important like
you know in a lot of any movies that say
came out in the 90s there'll be the
video store guy I mean like the Kevin
Smith surrogate who is the guy at the
video store who's you know telling
people what movies to get the curating
own sections of the movies they love and
want people to watch
so people are gravitating towards that
experience some kind of curation someone
who they trust to tell them what to see
people here really value these
face-to-face interactions it's the same
with Sandy the employees of the big-box
retailers around town know her and so
they let her buy DVDs from the store
even though they're not really supposed
to it's easy to see how this town is
home to the last blockbuster but most of
us don't live in Bend and while there
are local video stores across the
country we need new ways to discover
movies that are more accessible because
most of us don't live near video stores
either but there are some companies
thinking about that kind of
accessibility and they
handpick videos you can watch online
where we come from as a place of
knowledge and passion choosing films
that we think are interesting and vital
and important versus data that makes
assumptions about well this was popular
so this should be popular to you like
this so maybe you like that test that
has no human quality at all
Daniel Casman is the director of content
at movie a video streaming service that
uses human curation to select its movie
catalog what we may see now is just an
increasing amount of channels so Disney
is about to launch their streaming
service Netflix is promoting their
original content Hulu as their original
content but I think more valuable are
this sort of channel idea that it's more
specialized when you look at something
like shudder which is a channel it's
specifically dedicated to horror films
it's much more focused in terms of the
programming that it offers curation I
feel like always needs to exist hand in
hand with a venue whether you're talking
about a physical venue like a theatre
Cinematheque or an online venue like
movie or Hulu or Netflix
going forward I think technology can
leave us somewhere in the middle
somewhere between Netflix and the video
store but right now
streaming services seem to be more
focused on improving their algorithms
and diversifying your movie palate the
Internet should have made Discovery
easier and maybe it did early on but
over time the open web has become much
more closed into apps and feeds
admittedly this blockbuster and a lot of
other video stores still partly exists
because of nostalgia and sure that'll
bring instagramers and news teams to
cover them as an oddity but that
nostalgia isn't what's going to keep
this store in business it's the loyal
customer base that the employees here
have cultivated over the years this
blockbuster is a product and a part of
the community here in Bend and while we
currently live in a world driven by
algorithms maybe we can find a way to
bring a little of that onto the web
