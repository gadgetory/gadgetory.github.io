new Apple TV and then really not that
much at all
on the one hand you could talk about
what Apple wants you talk about the new
Siri remote and TV OS and apps and how
universal search and voice control bring
everything together and create the
future of television that's their
tagline the future of television is here
but that's what everyone's trying to do
that's Roku that's Google that's
Microsoft that's Amazon see everyone
trying to reinvent television has the
same problems it's hard and expensive to
get deals with the cable networks and
movie studios that own all the rights
shows and movies are trapped in hundreds
of different apps and navigating an
interface that's ten feet away from you
with a d-pad remote is pretty hard and
it turns out that everyone has basically
the same solutions to these problems you
get all the video apps and platforms you
build Universal search that can see into
all of them and you control it all of
your voice that's what Roku does it's
what Google does is what Amazon does it
turns out that's basically Apple's plan
to but because it's Apple they've done
some things a little bit differently and
some things a little bit better the real
question is whether all those little
things add up to an actual revolution
so the actual hardware of the new Apple
TV is pretty and interesting it's a
black box just about twice as tall as
the old black box with a handful of
ports in the back and a dual-core
processor inside it's boring but it's
supposed to be it's intended to fade
away it's missing 4k support which is
funny because the new moving picture of
video loops are exactly the sort of
demos that use on 4k TVs but honestly
that might not matter until there's more
4k content out there anyway the real
action is TV OS in the new Siri remote
which has a glass touchpad at the top
dual microphones for voice search and a
handful of dedicated buttons there's
also an accelerometer and gyroscope for
gaming it's all of the basics of the iOS
interface in a remote and it's what
makes the Apple TV feel so much like a
little iPhone under your TV it even
charges over a lightning cable the same
as the iPhone the remote connects to the
Apple TV over Bluetooth and has infrared
to control your TV's volume the one
thing it doesn't have is a power button
which means that if you have an older TV
or a receiver that doesn't support
taking commands over HDMI you'll be
stuck with the second remote just to
turn things on and off if you do have a
newer TV with HDMI control support
everything will turn on and wake up when
you click a button on the remote and you
can turn off by long pressing the home
button and putting it all asleep it
works but it'd be nice if there was a
dedicated power button accidentally
pressing a button on the remote to turn
everything on
once you're using the Apple TV it really
is all about apps then if Apple is right
that the future of TV is apps then it
needs to spend a lot more time thinking
about how to set up and get into all of
those apps the new Apple TV can't
restore your logins and most use apps
from previous box so you'll have to go
into the App Store to get everything and
log into tons of apps all over again
it's ridiculous that Apple can't just
store a single cable company login to
authenticate TV apps like HBO Go and
WatchESPN everyone has the same problem
there but if you really want to create
the future of TV that's the one you have
to solve once you do get all of your
apps downloaded and set up things look
pretty much just like the Apple TV
interface we've had for a few years
except that it's whitish gray instead of
black but you're not really supposed to
spend a lot of time banging around the
on screen interface you're supposed to
talk to it by holding down the Siri
button and asking for things do the
Eagles suck Siri is pretty smart you can
ask for specific shows and movies you
can search by actors you can ask for
weather and sports scores you can even
control
back in interesting ways by saying
things like what did she say which
automatically rewinds 15 seconds and
turns on captions so you can see where
she said that just off the record okay
once you've logged in to your various
video app Siri can search them too so
you'll see various HBO Netflix and Hulu
options right any results you can also
get pretty granular and ask for things
like popular 80s action movies on
Netflix which is pretty cool but Siri
can't do everything they can't control
music at all Apple only lets big players
like Netflix and Hulu into those search
results and you can't use it to search
the App Store which is a huge oversight
Siri also can't help you search inside
an app or even dictate in text boxes
which means YouTube search is still just
hunt-and-peck with the remote
it also doesn't understand netflix and
chill' which is probably for the best of
course you can also navigate using the
glass touchpad on the remote it's really
fun but it doesn't really add much the
experience there isn't a single part of
the Apple TV interface that I found that
actually requires the touchpad not only
does the old d-pad remote work just fine
but you can even tap the sides of the
touchpad to use it like arrow buttons if
you want it's cool and fun to have a
touchpad but until game and app
developers really take advantage of it
it's actually not that much better than
the old remote in taking advantage of
the new remote is really the point the
entire future of the Apple TV rests on
opening the App Store to new TV os apps
and games but this first wave of TV OS
apps is pretty weak most of them are
just blown up iPhone apps so far an app
like periscope feels like I'm just
projecting my phone rather than actually
running an app on my TV it's hard to see
why things like Zillow or guilt or
better when they're 10 feet away from
you actually there's a secret I think
the most interesting app on the Apple TV
is QVC it's the only app that actually
mixes television with interactivity lets
you buy what they're showing in QVC I
don't you buy anything on QVC but it's
really interesting the other thing
that's really fun is playing games on
the Apple TV
even if they're mostly just bigger
iPhone games I love playing does not
commute and jetpack joyride is pretty
fun on a huge screen
they don't look anywhere near as good as
an Xbox one and ps4 but that's not the
point there are really nice addition to
an entertainment box and if you're bored
they're waiting for you
so there's the promise and then there's
reality and in reality right now is the
new Apple TV is the nicest TV streaming
box available but it is basically the
same idea is every other stream box out
there it just has tons and tons of extra
potential so if you need to buy a new TV
stream box you should buy it you will be
very happy with it but if you don't
actually need to buy one I'd wait I'd
wait for a future Apple TV with 4k
support better apps and hopefully a
bigger push from Apple towards the real
future of teeth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
