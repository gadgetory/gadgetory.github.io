the first bubble show I am dieter bohn
I'm that Sam oh I'm dan seifert i'm
chris sigler and as you could tell from
my ridiculous infection I've totally
already it wasn't me no it's fine i roll
with it just fine it is episode 37 we
are not no longer on episode 35
congratulations to us it's the week of
every teen and obviously there's only
one thing to talk about the only
important thing that's happened in the
past week and that is that Google is
finally released the wireless charging
or it just released it in your room you
know it was released last week we talked
about last week but the important bit is
that I have one now oh ok I can complain
about it because I paid seventy dollars
for something that I can't mount in my
car which drives me nuts and so let me
explain why I can't mount in my car
because you're chicken so instead of
using smart things like say magnets to
align the nexus 4 with the charging area
like say the palm touchstone did the
nexus 4 has sticky pad on it which is
like this rubbery kind of almost gelatin
type of material that sticks to the
glass on the Nexus 4 and it's actually
pretty sticky when it's new to the point
where if I lift the nexus 4 off of it
the orb comes with it for like an inch
or so before dropping slamming down to
my desk but because it's sticky it also
attracts dust like you wouldn't believe
so I assume that the stickiness is going
to wear off after a couple of weeks of
actual use but wait are we seriously
talking about you over right now yeah
listen I mean here's the thing fair
enough our first five minutes a
dedicated not mobile topics anyway right
we we don't like we give that time for
anybody who's late who's brewed up a cup
of tea that's right Oh like and trying
to learn hook some brand of soft drink
I'm I've been waiting to rant about this
uh since like friday when i got the
thing so i haven't complained on twitter
I haven't really ranted publicly so
here's my rant about it so that I can
complain about it to people yes yeah it
cost me like 70 bucks after tax and
shipping and not worth it not worth it
no I can't save us I mean I'm surprised
they did the same thing with the galaxy
nexus where it took them forever to come
out with any official accessory were
there any official accessories with the
Galaxy Nexus was there was a car dock or
something was the extended battery in
the extended battery door oh yeah there
was a doc too yeah but the extended
battery was never sold in the US I think
that was just in in South Korea um you
know well the verizon one had the
official extended be a verizon did I'm
yeah sorry I always associate the galaxy
nexus one I mean I bought one off of
Amazon I don't know that it came from
something sketchy in South Korea I have
one um well is yeah it's only like it's
an extra like two milliamp hours it's
like this the most ridiculous extended
battery ever made but anyway yeah there
was a long delay between the release of
the galaxy nexus and the release of the
official accessories and they did they
did the exact same thing with the nexus
4 and to be fair it was only in the last
few weeks that the nexus 4 really became
widely available but but there was still
you know a pretty healthy nexus 4
ecosystem for the past few months during
which nobody could get a bumper or a
dock or anything so much i'm talking
about the HTC while i was gonna say
enough trolling let's talk about the HTC
One the big huge launch event happened
today we got amazing hands on we've got
an interview with the CEO Peter Chou
we've got reporting we've got the fold
specs the full details we have basically
everything you need to know as our story
stream explains in its headline and if I
don't even know where everything is to
know about it having everything there is
to know as opposed to everything there
is one bit of trivia I can't tell you
like what day you could walk into a
store bought it that's fair okay there
is one bit of trivia that nobody
actually knows yet and because I'm kind
of invented it over the
past few minutes which is that we are
running episode 35 which is our
recurring episode in the Virgin Mobile
show which coincide very 137 I declared
it really I did um you just deflated
Vlad I gotta kill Santa in his voice
he's like really damn i'm sorry but this
is episode 35 more heart anyway the
point is we have this recurrent episode
going on until we nail it until we're
happy that we've completed episode 35
and HTC's kind of do the same thing with
the recurring branding so there was the
HTC One X and the 1s and the one sv and
the YX + 91 XL and the 1v and the one
something else and now there's just the
HTC one so the company kind of is
recurring what its branding also it was
kind of hilarious that HTC was already
buying up advertising just advertising
HTC One which is the name of this phone
yeah and a lot of people worm used by
because last week's football soccer
tournaments had that HTC One branding
all over the hoardings around the
stadium and everybody because of all the
rumors no leaks that happened everybody
was like well HTC is already pronouncing
the name of this device Pizza ciao right
he had this freak out like a week or two
ago where he was waving it about say
yelling m7m so I think that freak out
hit the internet a week or two ago but i
think was actually recorded late last
year like it was a end of your company
retreat of some sort Wow okay so she
wasn't legs nokia stolen so it wasn't
like nokia trying to leak things itself
is a legit malik that one uh no i
wouldn't say that I'm just saying that
the video originated from the end of the
year maybe it took HTC a month to we get
ok well the broad point I'm trying to
make it's not particularly strong one
it's just that is we it's been kind of a
funky old hood up to his phone AC hasn't
helped itself with things like Peter
Chou and all of that stuff happening
and then today does the the combination
for me was this simultaneous event which
was actually two completely separate
events yeah it just happened one in you
of City one in London we presume and
this is actually to BlackBerry's credit
what they did simultaneous events around
the world they essentially did one event
and then just projected it on massive
screens in satellite locations HD didn't
do that HC had executives in New York
City talking about the full features of
the phone and they had exact season
London talking about the full features
of the phone it's just that London being
at about 20 minutes after New York and
it was a complete and that's a disaster
for anybody trying to coordinate in tuna
too yeah that was much different than we
kind of expected we had you know
expected seeing a live stream of one or
the other because I was at the new york
city event with her or New York team
Vlad obviously you were at the London
event yeah while we were communicating
we were trying to tell each other what's
going on and then it was just like
nothing was lining up unfortunately I
mean for the most part from my
perspective you so weird because I was
taking pictures and writing up
announcements it I was like am I just
echoing what Dennis said about 15
minutes ago well I you know from my
perspective not being at either event it
was cool to see the pictures flowing
into the live blog from both event site
I made a comment about it on Twitter
just seeing seeing those two events
happen and you know at the same time
covered by verge staff was was pretty
cool but I can see why that would be
very frustrating to you know that the
news is flowing at different rates you
know I I pretty much just ignored what i
was doing this is a good policy for life
can we talk about the phone yeah we
should talk about the phone so so yep I
actually want to try had a Segway a
legitimate Segway which is that the
European device fled correct me if I'm
wrong doesn't have any LTE is that right
no it does yeah how does okay that's so
I have no segue everybody all right so
once I mean we need to run down the
basic specs here so
it's a 4.7 inch screen it is 1080p full
which gives it a hopping 468 PPI and
it's some variation of super mega mega
super LCD I'm assuming no HTC has an
isn't quoting super see this time but it
is an LCD and yeah which is very
essential quality CC has given every
other feature a marketing term except
for this screen just like what the most
prominent feature on the device and if
such as the most prominent is to me it's
absolutely the best feature like I think
it's right up there with every Super LCD
HD SF before and I can't tell you in any
way in which the one x is better than
this display like the to me this is just
here's the HTC One X to play it used to
be a 720p display we just turn it up to
1080p like that's all I'm saying it's
just a really really awesome explain to
me yeah it's quite beautiful on the top
and bottom of the display our speakers
there are dual speakers and i believe
the marketing term for that is boom
sound oh yes you comes the boom Oh again
I have to give a see really big credit
for this not for the branding absolutely
not for the branding but when I think
about stereo speakers and I think about
how you should do sound on the phone a
real multimedia device this is it from
facing speakers symmetrically placed no
messing about like one of them is where
the ear piece would be one of them is
where the microphone would be and they
just look good the functional like I
think about like every smartphone that
I've reviewed over the past you know
whatever many years except for the
iphone which has a downward firing
speaker I always write about how if you
put the phone down on your couch or on a
table the sound gets muffled because the
speakers on the back all right and this
you know the the one essentially just
circumvents that problem entirely by
just throwing the speakers on the front
which is great and you know when we got
to see it and we got some hands-on time
whether they're really loud yeah they
project very well they you know put the
sound right in front of you don't have
to do the silly cupping your hand behind
it to reflect the sound
back to you so it does work pretty well
I guess it gives you the boom and it's
Beats Audio too if you care about that I
guess uh so it's it's an all metal
construction of course the displays
glass and there's there's some plastic
ring around the edge it's actually like
they carve out the metal the same way
you've seen metal device has carved out
like the iPhone in the macbook or
whatever but then like in that process
they embed the plastic into it and then
there's bands so that it does proper you
know antenna stuff so you don't actually
decide material we couldn't establish it
when we had the pre briefing with HTC
it's plastic even they win I sure
is plastic because one of the suggesting
maybe ceramic no I mean they may have
lied to me but it's plastic okay but
it's a very thin rail of plastic it
looks fine it looks good it comes in
white not black as long as it stays
clean he's the only concern that I had
when I when I was handling the device is
because it's white and you know the One
X was a white advice for its flagship
version and that notoriously got dirty
quickly so it would be pretty horrible
if the white plastic on this got dirty
because it's not a glossy plastic you
know it's really nice upgrade from the
1x the camera doesn't protrude anymore
now it's right integrated into the back
show yeah and the dozen adjusting to the
Cabal does i sent her around it's not
i'm not saying it's fat i don't know
exactly the thickness is at the top of
my head but it's not nice nine point
seven millimeters yeah i have a DNA here
and it's virtually the same profile as
the DNA well the protruding camera on
the the 1x was functional right because
you had the speaker on the back so i
think that they needed to raise the
phone off the surface and with this one
they don't so it's a win-win yeah and
we'll get into the camera but I'm saving
the best stuff for last it's got a 1.7
gigahertz Snapdragon 600 processor which
I imagine just flies on the benchmarks
darkness yeah 2 gigs of ram 20 30
million battery 32 and 64 gigabyte
variants and so like when you look at
like the standard specs of a phone HTC
is doing what HTC is always done which
is like just we're going to have a
hugely well SPECT phone we're going to
play this
and feeds game we're going to you know
blow that out as much as we can and you
know we'll see what happens this is the
other thing with the galaxy s4 in a
month but for now like is there another
phone that has like you know so that our
specs from in the stuff we've talked
about so far HTC is always played at the
speeds of frags game but in like actual
real world use it has not always had the
fastest phones so right uh it will you
know we once we actually use the device
for more than 20 minutes we can really
say how fast it was I can say that in
the time that i did use it everything
was very snappy and very responsive and
quick and fast and things like that i
didn't notice any lag like I've noticed
with older HTC devices so yeah hopefully
the new processor along with the new
software that you will talk about a
moment and all that gobs of RAM and
stuff like that yeah so there's
basically like two more spec things to
run through and then the software the
first spec thing which I'm gonna mention
now is that integrated into the power
button which is on the top um dem days
and infrared blaster IR blaster so
they're shipping with this thing they're
calling I think this is called HTC TVs i
was called HCG whatever and it's
basically like a rebranded version of
the peel app but instead of having to
connect over Wi-Fi or bluetooth some
janky IR blaster control your media you
can use it right the app you can pick
your channels directly but it's
integration with DVRs is sad and you
know it's you know it's it's a pretty
basic piece of remote software now the
fundamental problem with this
application and the concept of it I
appreciate that HTC is doing this
although it's it's really really
hilarious to think that phones in the
1990s head IR blasters and now we've
come full circle but but they're they're
solving the wrong problem if you if
you're looking at the industry as a
whole that the correct problem to solve
is the requirement that devices in your
in your AV rack require ir control in
the first place right every
should be on a standard I mean
everything is connected to your network
at this point right your receiver your
game console your TV everything is on
your network everything should be
controlled over over over Wi-Fi and and
that that is where we should be going
and we're it's it just sucks that HTC
had to do this a lot it gets into the
phone will she like HTC can't build a
whole TV ecosystem writing they're not
at all or not they're not even Samsung
and so they gotta work with the stuff
that's available to them and what fails
to indy red fighters yeah my table
runners like the average consumer that
doesn't have a super geeky AV rig in
their house has a motorola or scientific
american cable box from their cable
provider and that thing was designed in
like nineteen ninety nine and it uses I
arbol yeah it's not their fault it's
just symptomatic of a AV industry issue
that is is frustrating and I just have a
couple of points to counter that
actually the first one is having had
some issues setting up my Wi-Fi
situation over here at my new place I
can tell you that just cramming
everything on Wi-Fi isn't the very best
idea in the world just because 2.4
gigahertz bandage is gonna be way
saturated when you think about the fact
that you know if you're an apartment
building everybody has a Wi-Fi
networking and everybody's TV has to
hook up and everybody's forward
everybody's tablet everybody's laptop
then kids laptop etc etc so that's one
thing the other thing is exactly what
DITA was raising just a bit earlier
these things already exist you know your
cable box is already there your TV is
already there yo maybe you have a VCR
that you can't let go DVD player all
these things already in place and I
figure particularly here in the UK HT is
already signed up virgin sky most of the
content providers so they have all the
program guides integrated into the app
which is already on the phone and then
you have the IR blaster just at the top
of the phone you have the app which to
go to control your TV to me it's kind of
like there's no downside to this so
oh it just it's a net positive even if
you never use it it's a net-positive to
have it there the only downside which
are completely agree with the Turin is
the power button should be mounted on
the side this phone is too big for top
mountain power button should have been
on the side it should just had a little
opening for the eye applause that's all
I want yeah that I mean the same problem
was with the I'm just talking to my
level so if I'm too loud let me know but
I was the same problem with the DNA I
complained about it in my review you had
to do this ridiculous claw type of grip
in order to reach the top mount a power
button so right alright so the the big
thing is the camera the ultrapixel
camera which shoots zoe's which is short
for zoetrope and so we can come at this
from a software and solutions
perspective which is the direction HTC
is hoping that everybody will see that
or we can come at it from a spec
perspective which I don't think HTC is
afraid of the specs side but there is
something sort of scary to the average
consumer from there and I just get into
it yeah so I think Vlad will agree with
me here that as far as the spec goes I'm
perfectly content with the spec well
let's say what the spec is is it's a
it's technically a 4 megapixel camera
which is obviously a lot lower
resolution that will you be see on most
smartphones on the market today but
there's this misconception and it's been
talked about in cameras for many years
now called the megapixel myth which just
means that more megapixels equals a
better picture and that's not really the
case and in the real reality there's
many more of the factors that go into
making a quality image and one of them
is the actual site physical size of the
pixels on an image sensor so what HTC
has done here is said we're going to use
a sensor that has fewer pixels but each
pixel is larger and therefore since its
larger it's more sensitive to light and
it's able to better capture light for a
better color better low-light a better
dynamic range all of those things that
contribute to a better quality image and
essentially if you are familiar with
digital photography this is why full
frame cameras take so much better
pictures than your pocket pocket sized
point-and-shoot cameras because their
sensor is so much larger and it has
larger pixels on it so HTC is trying to
apply this to the smartphone
own uh and if everything they say is
true about it then it should lead to
much more improved image quality which
I'm perfectly fine with for mega pixels
of resolution if you are printing a
photo off of that you can easily do an
eight by ten without a problem you can
even go bigger if you're not pixel
peeping as they would say so I'm not too
worried about it but to your point
dieter customers have been sold on mega
pixels for many years now and seeing it
on the shelf next to something that says
eight or 12 or 13 or whatever it might
be is certainly something that will and
to be clear on chopper people to be
clear if you if you're printing digital
photos in your 2013 you need to
reevaluate your life there are better
ways to look at photos now then there
were even five years ago and I don't
know man Jack White disagrees with you
well I don't listen to Jack White's
music so no al Jack White's album from
2012 it's awesome just gonna say that I
should listen to it but okay but this
would be before move on to the software
side which I'm sure dear is going to
bring down for us I do want to give HC
massive credit for doing what they've
done here because yeah we say this on
podcasts up and down the internet that
companies should be bold make both
decisions and stand out the unique
things this is unique nobody has ever
done this among smartphone or even
feature phone manufacturers as soon as
they were able to put the word megapixel
on their cameras it's always been let's
get the bigger number let's get a big
enough is 12.1 free megapixels five min
fiskars yada yada yada 41 megapixels so
actually I want to talk about the
PureView because everyone immediately is
going to compare this to nokia's
pureview technology for a number of
reasons and because the average picture
that you take with the 808 PureView is
only 5 or 8 megapixels so there guys
that's low resolution but in reality the
way that particular sensor works is it
captures 40 mega pixels or 41 or
whatever and then down sample sit down
to the lower resolution no in Canada
study a yeah it cut just excuse me 38
right and then it down samples down to
that five or eight megapixel final image
which is a different approach than what
HTC
using right but the general effect is
pretty much the same because right
essentially you have this thirty eight
megapixel 38 million pixels in a nokia
pureview which are fit into a given
space and then you have a smaller number
of pixels four million pixels in hcs
sensor which again fit into the given
space and i think they're the same
synthesizes but now the general point is
that you have larger than average sensor
sizes and you're taking all the
information all the lights information
as Steve Jobs used to say it's all about
the photons man and no keys doing you
know arithmetic and algorithmic work and
all of this calculation where is a she's
kind of brute forcing it say we're just
gonna make big pixels absorb as much
light as we can but the ultimate effect
is the same both of you have deliver
better low-light performance than most
other cameras and the thing that I would
say is I'd rather have a really high
quality four or five megapixel photo and
then take my chances printing it that
have like a 12 megapixel photo from you
know south of the let's say Sony sensors
which kind of rubbish from like
2011-2012 right like 12 13 megapixels um
you know I'd rather not have that I'd
rather have a smaller one that just
gives me higher quality and then an idea
with the sensation so he had a I'm
talking there's there's one of the
spectacular spec not know I'm gonna get
there I would kill you guys be the best
I love you so much uh the other thing
you're gonna say is that it's optically
stabilized David's to a botanical
stabilization which also helps with low
light so HTC had a you know a meeting
with a whole bunch of a tech journalists
to talk about this I was there and they
they showed a chart where what access
was the overall area of the whole sensor
and the other axis was pixel size and
you know you look at most smartphone
cameras and you know when you start
getting up into the 8 10 12 megapixel
especially those higher megapixels 13
you get these really tiny pixel sizes on
the sensor that you know they argued
like getting down to the point where
like the actual wavelength of
light makes it so that it can't capture
an image whereas this sensor the pixel
sizes up in the point and shoot range
and it also gives them other benefits so
having just a 4 megapixel image instead
of an 8 megapixel image since there's a
couple things one they there's less
processing that has to happen one
because it's smaller but two because
there's just less noise and less sort of
interpolation that they have to do from
a whole bunch of sensors catching the
same light and trying to figure out what
where the pixels are right and then so
that the the smaller size and the less
processing means that they can take I
don't think they're using the same image
chip but they can take their image
processing chip and do more interesting
things with the images both in terms of
you know getting low light shot and
processing it but also this new feature
that they're introducing which they're
calling Zoe yeah I can talk about Zoe
too if you want since chris is gonna say
something Joe yeah was like this perfect
moment where all three of you was gonna
say something and because Chris seems to
be generally more quiet and forecasting
ya wanna hear what he has to say I was
nothing it was the moment is lost but
but please don't tell us about Zoe what
is what is Zoe theatre so basically like
a lot of cameras they you can you can do
their first shot so you hid the camera
shutter button and it actually captures
a little bit before you hit it a little
bit after you hit it but what HTC is
doing is that it's dual path encoding so
when you do a Zoe picture it's actually
encoding the light twice one is a short
little movie so at four seconds long and
I think it's technically like 3 point
something and then it's a couple seconds
before you are a couple tenths of a
second before you hit it and 10 seconds
after it's done somewhere in that range
and then at the same time it's recording
a burst shot of the actual images and
the net effect is you get a short little
for second clip and you can take you
know any moment out of that clip and
pull an image out of it as a still that
is like full fidelity you know not
blurry not crappy looking it's not a
it's an actual still image it's not
something that it's pulled out of there
and so the net effect is you can instead
of
you know taking a picture if you've got
some kind of action some kind of thing
going on you can take a Zoe and just
record the little for second thing and
then pull what you want out of that as
appropriate and then the other thing
that they're doing is and this I'm less
clear about but they're they're making
they they take the event galleries that
automatically get created and then you
can automatically make these like little
12 minute movies that are like short
little automatically cut and click and
transitioned things it's you're still
photos in your video with vintage
filters with vintage filters yeah I
think they've got six they've got like
six different tracks that automatically
like put the filters on it so I mean
hopefully they'll be expanding that soon
but I mean I'm interested to try this
new way of taking pictures so the thing
is that confuses me about Zoe's is that
there's other phones on the market that
do this you know you've got the
blackberry z10 that will shoot a string
of images in a row almost like recording
a video and then you can pull the good
one out of that and I know there's other
phones that do that another software
that does it but what HTC is trying to
sell this as are like short video clips
right that you know these zoe's
essentially if you're not pulling a
still out of it you're making a Zoe and
it's this you know new short video clip
it's not a cinemagraph it's not a vine
it's not these other things that we kind
of have been blowing top of line let's
be honest is half a fine but and then
you know so it's this proprietary format
and then to share it I got mean it's not
proprietary it's the get saved as a
standard like MOV file I think okay well
that's fair but what so when I want to
share it though I upload it to HTC
servers is that correct well you can
upload it to YouTube you can upload it
to Facebook or you can make this
automatically little generative in yet
and you can upload that or you can
upload it that little vignette along
with up to i think it's ten of the
associated assets from the gallery so
like the vignette plus like 10 photos so
let you make a cute little gallery you
can upload that to HTC servers but HTC
apparently doesn't want to be in the
business of storing your junk forever
and so uh when you upload it that it
only stays there for 180 days which
it's just like I would never like if I'm
going to share something to my mom that
you know is a cute little video clip at
some pictures the idea that I would put
it up there and it's not going to be
there in 180 days not gonna happen not
gonna do it I love how DJ's webcam kind
of shakes the more outraged she is
disappointed it is about things so I
mean I obviously this is an
android-based device uh and we don't
have things like vine which is you know
blowing up but when vine eventually does
come to Android why would I use as le
instead of just shooting a lot well
because you can you can get the shot of
your child's first step and if you
happen to miss the shutter button you'll
have the little thing I mean HTC's an
argument and I mean take it for what it
is is that you know most people when
they shoot movies on their phones kind
of suck at it most movies on phones are
really boring but when you you know
you're limited to this little for second
clip you'll catch something interesting
and they argue that like they can put
these things together and make something
overall that's compelling even if it's
from you know a relatively boring day
hanging out that's their argument I mean
if you think about vines and the fact
that most people's values actually
consists of multiple little clip so like
they'll hold it there hold the button
down they take like a three second thing
and then add a free second thing and
then combine them and try and do
something crazy for that I think HTC's
going after the same thing I need to
correct d2 sa sit three second clip that
you get from the HTC One camera nota for
a second one it's like a half it's like
three points yeah I think it goes point
six seconds before you hit the shutter
and then three seconds after so no but I
think before each other didn't what does
the thing before you hit the show you
get five frames just being shot and then
15 frames after you hit the shutter but
that's one thing that's the full res
photos that's one recording the other
recording is the extra 1080p video which
is happening as three seconds it's three
seconds you get point six before and
point three after so it's 3.9 seconds in
total so I'm going to say I'm okay at
calling it four seconds then
having misinform then I apologize you've
been sliding an adverse information yes
I'm underselling HTS product but yeah I
think HTS going after the exact same
parameters vine which is again what d0
saying is just short little bursts which
when you put them together makes to me
it's kind of like a video collage or
like a stop-motion animation with more
animation in it I guess it's something
like that I mean really I I like this
software edition for the playfulness and
the toy factor of it really right so you
get the phone you have automotive media
capabilities to playback movies and
music and all about stuff but that stuff
you've been able to do for years now
your phone so that isn't brand new this
software suite in this camera sweet
gives you a new way I mean is such a
type marketing cliche but to be creative
right it actually lets you do stuff
that's creator than another thing a lot
of creative people do say that the fun
of creativity is in the limitations yo
yeah just being able to shoot video gets
boring because it's just so expensive
and there's too many options and you
don't really know what to do but if you
if you're told ok you can shoot free
clips of 3.9 seconds and then stitch it
together into this epic 11 second
12-second masterpiece what's the best
you could do you have limitations you
have kind of a sett framework and then
you can work within that and play with
that but ok having said that I do still
get this video and and I am one of the
biggest fans of the design of this phone
as well like I really like the hole 0
gapless HC causes physical design
optical bonding of this plates etc as
usual people think I have a fetish for
this but if this was four point four
inch phone a positive married to buy now
but the travel is ok you have a great
design you have this great new camera
sweet you have the biggest speakers ever
fit inside a phone
early is still just another Android
multimedia phone booth had these already
you know we've had cuoco phones we had
1080p phones I just don't feel excited I
don't feel like I'm really getting that
much knew why i think that i think that
smartphone fatigue not an issue with
this phone in particular because true
what hey yeah i don't know what HTC
could have done today apart from show me
a Nexus device that would have yes no
brought me the same level of joy that
the that the original iphone or the
nexus one did well it's interesting that
you mentioned smartphone fatigue because
i know you've talked about this before
Chris but one thing that we noticed
during HTC's presentation today is that
all of the specs that we've been talking
about were not mentioned during the
presentation we didn't hear 4.7 inch
1080p display with us that's a good
point yeah we didn't hear Snapdragon 600
quad-core processor with 1.7 gigahertz
clock speed and two gigabytes of RAM I
don't recall hearing a single speck
period the only spec they really talked
about was saying that it's all aluminum
and then they just talked about the
actual features of what you could do
with the device so it will be
interesting to see how that plays out
this year with other events but
certainly in the past you know we've
seen Samsung shy away from talking about
specs obviously Apple has never really
focused on specs with it wait wait wait
samsung Shen away talking about specs
well features and specs are two
different things right the galaxy s3
event was all about you know smart stay
and and stuff like that it they they put
far more emphasis on that than they did
on the actual like line items facts of
the yeah oh no what you you get you guys
have the 01 make the phone do what it
does you guys have a very selective
memory because I remember saying I was
there with a samsung galaxy or what I
remove it I remember seeing people to
say doesn't that noise make you want to
go to the bathroom that's what I
remember from Samsung's Galaxy s3 event
okay no no seriously samsung had one
probably like biggest screen in london
inside a dome it was like a 60 no 60
feet no
it's all just a massive massive screen
and I put up every spec and feature
began as his free up on that it was just
the stray bullet point list it was like
GLONASS gps bluetooth 4.0 yadda yadda
yadda which also reminds me um the HD
one is one of the first phones with 802
11 AC so yes hot news for router fanboys
802 11 AC connectivity is ready to be
used so I want to make a point that I
think we should come back to and revisit
but it's really important to note that
we are talking about HTC and we
inevitably ended up talking about
Samsung and that's happening to them
again because there's going to be a new
samsung galaxy s phone flights your
phone probably next month are announced
next month but before I get into that
whole discussion of are they actually to
be able to sell any of these damn phones
we need to talk about the software we
need to talk about the new sense since
five although i think newson is just
calling it new sense when she sense
don't say this i'm fast oh sorry I just
can't believe that nobody in there
marketed team was like what if we say
this fast air what does it sound like oh
it sounds like nuisance which is
something that we've called sense not in
not so many certain terms for years so
I'm sorry HTC but new sense is not a
good name so ah the new sense is just
like the old sense I asked specifically
if they had taken out any features and
the only feature I think they actually
took out was the thing where you could
set the phone down on its face to
silence the ringer because or you could
lift it up you're going stick your phone
well and plus the speakers are on the
front now so it doesn't make sense to do
that functionality but like you know all
the you know integration with social
networks most of the widgets not all of
them they killed a couple you know
that's all there and it look and feel is
a bit better they got rid of the
annoying tabs at the bottom they switch
to the hollow pivots they toned down the
gradients a tiny little bit but not all
the way and they they redesigned all the
icons
uh ACC tells us to know he touched every
single corner I mean we'll see again
yeah but the icons are 2d now right
instead of 3d yeah yes they're like less
problem yeah the cartoonion isn't on
that subject you just want to say really
quickly the new icon look is apparently
very much in the Styles crow who's
the lead designer for hcc i don't know
what that tells us other than he was
allowed to change the icons and anything
of actually poor Skye Croyle has
absolutely fantastic taste in Footwear
may I say I've actually had a
conversation with mr. Coyle about issues
in the past so poised today Chris
turquoise in oh yeah he even wore
turquoise shoes to the mwc announced for
the 1x last year too I don't know if
that's a running theme for him or what I
don't think they were literally the same
pair of shoes but they were closed ya
wanna wear the same photo shoots why is
that really slowed down about these
turquoise shoes because Chris is wearing
them too so I've been avoiding saying
the most impelling our new shoe
conversation anyway I've been avoiding
talking about the most important feature
on the new sense which is blinkfeed they
have replaced your homescreen they've
gotten rid of the flip clock place with
a more generic clock and they basically
put Flipboard on your homescreen and I
don't know if the people that are
talking are visible but Vlad's jaan is
pretty amazing right I'm just getting
comfortable so I can have a nap while
you talk about this nonsense so the idea
is you at your home London you have a
feed of snackable content uh you know
your news feeds and your facebook and
some Twitter stuff and it looks like
Flipboard relatively pretty it's
relatively fast doesn't work offline
which is kind of stupid but it's like
it's not a tool you can't use it as a
google reader replacement or Twitter
client replacement it's just like a
thing that HTC put on your home screen
so that when you're standing in line at
the grocery store you've got something
to do for a couple of minutes and I mean
I really wonder what you guys think of
it because I like I'm literally holding
two thoughts in my head at the same time
and like seventy-five percent of me says
oh my god
flipboard on my home screen and twenty
five percent of me says uh yeah look my
way home great now that actually because
here's my thought on it and if you're
the type of person that's going to open
your phone up at you know while you're
standing on line at the grocery store to
read something chances are you're
already getting information from Twitter
you're already getting information for
facebook you're already getting you're
probably doing some sort of arias RSS or
google reader type of thing uh and this
is kind of pulling in all that same
stuff right so if you have a twitter app
that you'd like to use and you check
that you check it you look at it and
then are you going to say the same see
the same stuff on your your blinkfeed I
guess extend with all your other stuff
so it's like you're reading the same
stuff twice or if you have an a Google
Reader account set up and you're looking
at your google reader articles you're
going to see the same type of articles
again in your place without a way of
marking them red so if you see it up and
then you go back to your google reader
it's not marked as read so you're seeing
it again so I mean it's just well you're
not the target market for them no I'm
not but I'm trying I'm trying to put
myself in the mind of someone who's
going to use this where's your placement
you you you just have to kind of let go
not meant to be a full tool it's like a
thing to do it's like it's like flipping
on the TV you know you're not like
you're not sitting down to watch you
know your your binge of you know West
Wing on netflix and making sure you're
going through every single episode
you're flipping on the TV seeing what's
on you get bored you turn it off like
that's what it's meant to be versus if
she sees this is HTC's way of saying
that our way of doing things is better
than you the users your way of doing
things because if they if they wanted to
respect the user they would have made
blinkfeed a widget that you can put on
any home screen panel you want but
instead it is now the home screen which
is I find in terms of an android device
I find that offensive I mean we've seen
widgets like this fail spectacularly
right right and another like they're
going to make it a home screen widget
have it be successful they needed they
need to make it look they need to have a
control the whole screen right it needs
to be that Flipboard experience where
it's you know edge to edge
not in a stupid little border so I kind
of get what they're trying to do it you
can click a checkbox to make it the
classic android home screen your default
home screen when you hit the home button
oh god we haven't talked about the
buttons compact that but like the report
that I wrote was basically I take HTC is
taking two giant risks one is the camera
I think we're pretty positive about that
we're at least happy they're taking that
risk and two is this differentiation
blinkfeed and like it seems like a
fiasco to me that I want no part of but
there's like a tiny part of me that says
maybe but listen listen and I just
thought I just want to point out where
this thing just goes wrong for me and
I'm reminded of Timescape so Sony
Ericsson's android phones blur skate I
love how we're just bringing up like old
really bad android customization skins
the trouble is I have yet to see any one
application nevermind a phone
manufacturer whose strength and
specialties hardware anyone application
aggregate all of these things
successfully everybody has ambition I
mean it might be one of the most
commonly attempted and absolutely one of
the most commonly fail things in mobile
software aggregating news social feeds
and maybe like emails and lots of things
like that I mean it's it's like
something that windows phone is it's
essentially built around with the People
Hub and that we all know how well that
works to replace your but everybody's
trying right because with iOS series
trying to do similar things where the
loads you two things Google now is
trying to similar to do some of the
things we're gathers information it
thinks you're going to want to leave
aggregating information in an
intelligent way in a way that you find
helpful and useful more so than estamos
a just jumping into twitter is just
jumping into a discrete application in
question like your email client for
example is really really tough anyone
know I want I want I want to express the
there's a couple of things I want to
express that's different about blinkfeed
than what we've seen before him and it's
funny that you mentioned Google now
because Google now is very different
from blinkfeed in that blinkfeed is just
purely for entertainment sake whereas
Google now it's going to give you
directions it's going to give you
whether it's going to give you you know
local things nearby that you can check
out and and your calendar and all that
other stuff blinkfeed doesn't do any of
that and a lot I've heard a lot of
people compare blinkfeed to Microsoft's
live tiles because it looks very similar
but in reality it's not it's not giving
you email notifications it's not giving
you messaging notifications not given
you missed call notifications it's just
giving you entertainment as you think
big priorities when the thing for me
priorities were the thing for me so ok
you might blinkfeed and I'm supposed to
trust you because as you say if you're
going to replace at least part of the
Twitter app or the emo apps
functionality or your newsreaders
functionality you want to trust whatever
you're placing it that with that is
better so I'm supposed to trust you but
at the same time you have no way no
hierarchy for the information that I
want to see so I asked about things like
what if what if I have calendar that's
coming up are those go to float to the
top of the blinkfeed what if I have
important emails coming up but those
going to come to the top and this is the
thing we have alerts we have all this
incoming data and information that
Android just provides to HTC why isn't
that integrated into the bling feel like
I'll find it so much more useful you
know to unlock my phone and to say oh
here's the news but then they actually
do have some alerts and some meetings
coming up which I need to address first
those things aren't surfacing they are
coming up and that limits the usefulness
of it where is it it's trying to be kind
of universal to you so here's here's how
I see it HTC is screwed right there
tenth place in the global smartphone
market I don't know mobile global mobile
phones phone market excuse me they they
can't spend as much money marketing a
samsung can they're not Apple and they
had you know on the software side they
had two choices they could go the
standard you know stock Android route
which they seemed terrified him do it it
wasn't chosen this is thing no no I'm
not
ter man but the kid they couldn't go the
standard stock in a row because they're
afraid of Motorola because Motorola's
going to do that then they won't be
differentiated from Motorola so they had
to try and push forward a sense and they
believed that sense is great okay
whatever so in order to make sense of
real differentiator that people care
about they have to provide a tool that
people actually need that they can't
otherwise get and the tool of giving me
crap to read when I'm waiting in line
like that problem has been solved very
well by a ton of apps so the only real
thing they're fixing is for the few
people that don't know how to find
Flipboard and the few people who don't
want to have to hit the home button and
then hit the Flipboard button icon like
those are really small problems and so
that's that's the thing is like the if
you're going to differentiate
differentiy in a way that actually
matters it solves a real problem not a
fake problem and then like I'm he merely
agreeing with you Vlad that like think
this is a version one of a thing and
they're promising that they're going to
make it better and they're going to add
algorithms and blah blah blah and
they're also promising they can do it
off of the standard rom update cycle
they can update it directly but until
they do this is like a feature that I'm
like only a tiny part interested does
the thing this thing that's a great
point actually that you're raising this
is a version one this is the horrible
thing in the horrible situation we face
ourselves as smartphone buyers when i
get a version one of something i know
for a fact that i'm not going to get
version 2 in amongst I've version free
in like three months time I'm not going
to get the deterioration speed or
something like Firefox which is reached
you know between seven versions over the
past 10 weeks or whatever you get
version 1 of something on your phone
you're stuck basically it's like version
2 is gonna come next year and the next
year I have to buy the other new phone
yeah so perfect this we would judge this
so much less severely if we could trust
HTC to just iterate like crazy on this
and innovate until here's here's the
thing like if all those things that you
are asking for Vlad of your calendar
notifications and things like that
Google provides in Google now so and
google has been updating google now acai
outside of rom cycles i mean the google
search blinkfeed can be updated outside
of rom cycles it's just trust h
she'd actually do it exactly Google's
already doing it and has done it and its
extended goals now now's functionality
HTC could have just you know integrated
it or if they were you know daring
enough to actually launch a phone
supporting android 4.2 let you put the
stupid google now widget on your home
screen ah but you know the it's not
doing that and now we have to rely on
HTC who doesn't who designs hardware
more than software to update the
software I just thought I just want also
add the extra notes about sense because
like the same way I did an interview
with Peter channel today we spoke about
that first of all I am a basically lost
hope like if you if you if you're hoping
for an HTC made 4.3 inch device who
stopped Android please just stop hoping
so just just kill yourself learn about
learn about albert camus a french
philosopher french-algerian philosopher
and absurdism and learn to live with
that hope that is the best advice I can
offer you we got a deposit though ok
very very pity but essentially to Peter
Chou sense is really important to the
company because the company needs to
differentiate itself and he says and I
don't agree but he says you can't build
things like blinkfeed without sense I
don't see why you can't and you can't
build things like the camera experience
without sense I don't see how sense
facilitates the camera app I think those
innovations can be done in a standalone
fashion and put on top of stock Android
or just take Android and customize it
less but the company just resolute and
determined to be different for different
sake and I think yeah well I mean we
need to be clear that sense sense
applies to all of their software
customizations all bundled up so it's
it's more than just a skin so when he
says you can't I do the camera without
sense like that's like like the
semantics her that you know pedantic
reason is I like that part of their
overall branding for all of their
customizations but yeah I would like to
see something
I what I would like to see is HTC have
the confidence in its own software and
offer a stock rom download on its
developer site and I will void my
warranty to go get it and I'm sure that
it costs a bunch of money to develop
that but if you think that senses the
bee's knees give me the choice not to
use it and see what I do and that's it
that's the thing that I think you know
the people that are really into HTC's
devices and are really excited about
this particular one etc are the
enthusiasts they're the people that are
most likely going to take that device
and customized the crap out of it so you
know that's just like throwing them a
bone and it gives them that halo status
among you know the the geeks that they
can be like I love my HTC and and you
know go tell everyone else to buy it and
instead we're going to happen yeah they
need to move beyond that crowd though if
they're gonna be successful like I mean
but just like it's not like what's a
halo through though it's like it's like
when you think of like a car
manufacturer has a halo sports car that
very few people buy but the people that
do buy it are influential and they
influence and that whole that car right
they only sell a handful of units of
influences the entire line down but so
blinkfeed isn't about those power users
at all HTC knows they're not going to
get them to care about blinkfeed they're
gonna install rom or they're going to
click the checkbox get the default home
screen what it's about is the store
shelf experience they need to have
people walk into a carrier store and
play around it to go like this is cool
that's what the old flip clock did back
in the day was about the store shelf
experience though that's what blinkfeed
is now if I'm Peter Chao I could give a
good goddamn if people use blank fleet a
month after they buy it if it gets him
to buy it that's good enough so let's
talk about these buttons yes somehow we
miss this in discussing hardware but it
kind of relates to software anyways cuz
as use it but I so HTC's last year used
three capacitive buttons on this device
you have a back a home and a recent apps
or multitasking k depending on how you
want to call that but this year it's
only got two buttons and the
one that's been axed is that
multitasking key uh and HTC claims that
the average user doesn't care and
doesn't use it and doesn't want to use
it and isn't aware of it and so they've
buried the function under a double tap
of the HOME key which is located on the
right side of the phone just above that
bond speaker and the back button is on
the opposite side on the left side so
they've Barry they've buried
multitasking under double tap and they
varied google now under a long press the
button which is any button appears at
the bottom of the screen by default but
you can turn that off and make a long
press the back button toggle the menu
yeah so you can you can get open up all
these long press options which are like
the way to bury features that this is
this is why if you want users to not
care about multitasking this is how you
do it you just hide it from them and not
so here's here's the thing HTC's not
wrong that most users don't care about
multitasking them probably not but at
the same time like if it's there you
know they're gonna hit it and they're
gonna see it and they're going to see
what they can do with it and if they
bury it under a double tap of something
which you know how many people are
really going to figure out that a double
tap of the button launches this then
they're never going to use that feature
ever and this is perfect evidence from
our point about a she wants to be
different from for its own sake the most
us can overview the visual multitasking
is different again from last year yeah
the last year it's way better it was
some sort of three-dimensional card
system where you slide left and right
without words or inertial scrolling ever
right now it's nine thumbnails and you
can swipe up to dismiss them yada yada
yada it looks like it looks like the
Nokia headlines multitasking right but
it's just nine and there's no option to
just shut down all of them at the same
time itches again it's there it's in the
freaking stop Android you take good
software and you destroy it you take
things away you use you you slather on
nonsense on top of it I feel you know
illnesses
on the stock android there's no
dismissal number one number two I can
only see three and a half apps on the
multitasking button added there's no
dismissal installed android no no not
for all of the apps you can do one by
one obviously but ok well then everybody
else has been doing I guess it's being
password I take that back I'd say that
back okay but still to me it's it's it's
like I'm seeing all these changes I'm
seeing all this work I people have got
into the office spent time doing this
and I just feel like this is not what
you need to change about your phone from
last year this is not the reason you
have me selling phones as Samsung has
been seven phones and that's where we
find ourselves well it's it's
interesting you know I I'm railing on
this this two button layout pretty hard
ah i really want to use it in an actual
work flow and see if i can live with it
because for the i mean the fact of the
matter is I use an iPhone often and that
only has one stinking button and I have
to double tap that to open up my
multitasking tray or whatever as well so
you know I could be making a big deal of
nothing but I do like that multitasking
button on the old old phones so and you
know where I'll this thing is double tap
the home button is the gs3 yeah yep this
thing is getting released in the it's
getting every something like 180
carriers worldwide 185 185 in the u.s.
is getting released on AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile and
Sprint but not verizon sorry verizon
sorry HTC oh yeah sorry sorry verizon
has nothing to do with that this was
verizon's decision i was saying so for
sorry verizon users that want this phone
yeah did the real story is sorry HTC
that it's it's being left out of big red
yeah so I mean yeah it's just terrible I
don't add any egg they can't catch a
break right like they have no leverage
with with verizon and it's just you know
if they can sell a bunch of these phones
on other carriers and build the brand
the way that they didn't in 2012 maybe
they can you know start to get horizons
like yeah sure will carry it what the
heck
give us a droid 2 but you know give us
this but until then Ike I don't know it
it's basically kneecapping them from the
start at launch it should be coming out
of march and the dates are kind of fuzzy
i think but the other thing that's
kneecapping them from the start is just
like last year there's gonna be a bunch
of people that are gonna be looking at
this and waiting to make their purchase
decision until they see what Samsung has
on deck right that's chris is key yes
well just to wrap the discussion on with
with verizon i mean let's not forget the
fact that the droid DNA just came out
like a few years ago so HTC is still on
on a cycle with them it's not like
they're getting shut out of verizon and
I think that verizon is just kind of
like continuing to exercise its
extraordinary purchasing power on on om
so that can't afford to standardize
across the range HTC included so um you
know I don't know the the the droid DNA
is a good phone right like I do I mean
dan I think that you may be the only one
among us who have used both do you have
an opinion on which one you'd rather
take home uh the one versus the DNA yeah
I would rather have the one just because
it's slightly smaller the DNA is very
frustratingly large uh and the 1i I do
like the aluminum chassis the DNA he's
got the soft touch plastic but I like
the aluminum body on the one and obvious
the the DNA has last year's camera
technology and the one has this year's
camera technology etc so yeah III think
as far as a device goes I would go with
the one over the DNA it's fair sounds
prudent but yeah but this this gs4 room
or so eldar murtuza nor have you
pronounce his last name i'm sure i'm
pronouncing it incorrectly and I
apologize eldar if you happen to be
watching our show you probably not he he
has a long long long history of of
breaking news and also spreading
incorrect rumors to be very blunt going
back to the early Nokia Symbian days
back when it was still at 60 and so he
tweeted yesterday morning think it was
yesterday that that there would be a big
event on March 14th didn't specify
Samsung didn't specify gs4 just said
there was gonna be a big event on march
14th and that was going to kill the HTC
One basically and Sam mobile which is a
site with a pretty good reputation for
Sims on leaks posted about that tweet
and then followed up saying that they
had confirmed that that would be for the
gs4 we did a little research on our end
talked to some sources who have a very
good track record and and they basically
came back and said yeah that's
definitely the date March 14th it's
going to be us event and which is
interesting yes it is the last event was
in London so it's in the US this time
around and and yeah it kind of I mean it
may be a coincidence it's hard to tell
how much industrial espionage is
actually going on here but it does suck
for HTC that this phone is being
announced like literally days before the
one start shipping around the world the
timing couldn't be worse for them that
is of course assuming that the date
doesn't slip it but as of right now 314
is looking like the date to watch but
you don't know anything we don't know
anything about it that's that's the
other thing to know when we uh we know
that it's going to be another very
feature heavy announcement and Vlad and
I were debating about this earlier about
just out feature heavy the gs3 announced
was I thought that they put a lot of
emphasis on these weird like gimmicky
features as much they always comes to
mind and and and our source says that
with the gs4 it's going to be even more
pronounced it's me the biggest leap in
feature set since launch of the the
Galaxy S series and bigger than the the
Delta from the GS tooth to the gs3 and
then we also heard that the phone the
phone's industrial design would mirror
that of the note 8.1
Elite recently which is samsung's new
midsize tablet that we're actually
expecting to see debut at Mobile World
Congress next week I think think that's
going to be Samsung's big announcement
they're so that the final ID for that
product that we see next week should
give us some hint as to what we can
expect to see with the gs4 in terms of
ID but that's about all we know I mean I
think that 1080p is obviously a very
safe assumption uh we've been seeing
Samsung four point nine inch nine nine
inch panels with 1080p resolution but
what's interesting is that you know
you're saying that's all we know and
that's such a stark contrast to what we
were talking last year at this time
about Samsung like bird maybe just over
three weeks away from this alleged
launch date and we haven't seen a single
leaked image we haven't seen a single
linked leak design or anything whether
they've been yeah place last year or not
there's been nothing so yeah it's a it's
it's pretty interesting to see how
different that is this year and I think
that to be honest I think that Samsung
is starting to get a little addicted to
like via to you know that the PR aspects
of like you know product security and
all that because you remember last year
that the GS leading up to the gs3 there
were all those those incorrect leaks and
then the phone was announced and then
Samsung actually came out with like this
big like blog post basically
congratulating itself on unfoolish and I
I think we're about to see this same
cycle again I think that that you know
we're hearing the note 8 leaks have been
incorrect in terms of what the the
device actually looks like right now the
leaks that we seen basically make it
look like a giant gs3 or giant note 2 so
we're hearing that that's incorrect we
haven't heard squat about the gs4 like
you say Dan so I think that Samsung is
really like that they're they're really
putting the nose to the grindstone on
security and they're super proud of it I
guarantee you after March 14th we're
going to get another blog post from them
saying how they did it I just got a on
that topic I do also want to point out
that
Samsung and HTC and all of these asian
manufacturers consider the just basic
quantity of people that attend their
launch event part of their
self-assessment and part of their
success of a lodgment they don't really
give a rat's ass whether you're
connected and whether your life blog
actually exists and what are they
connected with actual consumers they
just want to see how many bodies they
can fit inside a massive hole in a big
city but I'm not something nice bit of
trivia from HTC event today Peter Chou
when he came in he came in very early
and just kind of snuck in because nobody
noticed in for some reason so it was
kind of like a random Taiwanese do just
walks in and I'm like that was Peter
Chao why did anybody you know freak out
and try and take his photo but then I
think she's his wife still share one
who's the chairwoman of HTC I believe
she is a gentleman of agency wait wait
she's she's also like the boss of VI a
which is another big Taiwanese company
she's a big deal in Taiwan when she
arrived man I mean it was like she had
an entourage of 20 people with cameras
and video cameras and Diaz of ours and
things like that and she was the focus
of attention everywhere she went it was
really weird because Peter Chao was then
people could see him floating in and out
of the event nobody chase him when she
had anything to say they're like people
with lights on their cameras and all
sorts were just all around her I don't
really understand that I don't really
understand the dynamics and how she's a
bigger celebrity than him over there in
Taipei but it was just kind of a curious
thing for me uh the only thing I have to
say about that is I want everybody to
appreciate just how awesome this photo
that plaid talking pho is it's amazing
he looks like such a boss he's just you
know stupendous nice and he is indeed
the boss that I restroom yeah yeah i
mean he's kind of a laid-back guy also
it was just another thing to point out
because the comments on that interview
suggest that it kind of sounds
aggressive like we're angry at each
other and
pointing a finger when I'm asking
questions and he's kind of give me a day
locally delay but because you know just
transcribed in text I think the tone of
the actual interview was really conveyed
like there was a bit of a language
barrier because it's English isn't
perfect and we're oppressed even things
i did so gently yeah and he smiles when
he gets those questions like he's like
yeah I know and I'm gonna give you an
answer now yeah yeah um I have nothing
else to say about the HTC One or the
galaxy s4 or the wireless charging orb
yes the Abboud would phone that it's
waiting til next eater you didn't answer
the most important question of all who
would you rather have the HTC One or the
galaxy s4 I'm gonna wait and see yeah
what's your next I'm gonna wait so I'm
gonna wait and see that's a question
there's a thing that i would love to be
proven wrong on and it's like i'm
convinced even though we haven't seen
anything we really know nothing about
the galaxy s4 convinced it's gonna be
made out of plastic and that will make
me want the issue see more on a hardware
level yeah I would love for samsung to
just prove me wrong and make me shove my
foot in my mouth and release a little
bit of device but that happened last
year this is thing I I just feel like
we're going through an absolute
recurrence and maybe we should call this
episode 37 instead of Mecca five
absolutely time deja vu this is actually
we live in we live in the Battlestar
Galactica universe everything is that
before and everything will happen again
and so this sort is reliving 2012 latest
a lot okay maybe that maybe this is the
matrix all right Oh same same situation
it's a similar story it's an alternate
universe similar story minor details are
different this is what happened last
year and in the year before Hsu was
first with a sensation before the galaxy
s2 HD was first with the 1x coming up
for the galaxy s3 and both of those
devices had higher quality materials the
one x vs galaxy s3 is just a no contest
in terms of physical design the one is
is just so much nicer it has a better
display HTC in terms of hardware
keeps winning it keeps having the better
device and yet Sampson keeps pitching it
yeah with those dumb features I mean
even and this is not a commercials yeah
that's what is meeting with its beating
it with the marketing push I mean if you
turn on a TV and you see a commercial
for cell phone company you're usually
going to see apple or Samsung and
Samsung is going to be lately thankfully
it's been talking about its features
instead of just trying to make fun of
Apple buyers uh whereas you don't see an
HTC commercial you might see it
initially like right when a phone is
released you might see a handful of HTC
commercials but they're not running for
like six months at a time like I can i
still see galaxy s3 commercials on TV
and that form was launched in what June
or July so yay so this time around HTC
is going to take a bigger it's going to
take a bigger role in in the marketing
of its own phones instead of leaving it
to the gears it's going to do it in like
you know specific cities because it
doesn't have a ton of money and I don't
think they're going to be like they're
not going to be spending like at the
company money but they are going to try
and market this stuff directly to
consumers themselves and I mean that's
smart insofar as the carrier certainly
didn't help them out with the 1x or the
1s at all in any appreciable way but I
just you know can the can does HTC have
the resources to do what they need to do
to actually compete with this phone from
a marketing perspective especially given
the fact that they have this camera and
this you know blink feed you I that is
going to initially put consumers off if
they don't market it just so just write
well and I'm right look it's good Chris
well I was just gonna say i bet that HTC
thought that it had a couple more months
of leeway yeah i was going to say the
camera point is really good because that
ultrapixel situation and the low-light
performance are so easy to demonstrate
and they're so easy to promote you can
trust carriers just you know pimp them
out in a very easy and approachable
fashion so long as Carey is interested
but the thing to me when you think about
the scale of Samsung's the G
wait is marketing might the freaking
phone when you unlock it has water
ripples and it makes these clunking
noises like you pick it up and it in
acts it doesn't train itself seriously
it acts like freaking child's toy and in
spite of that in spite of junkyard
things like smart stay and just nonsense
features it keeps it keeps succeeding so
I don't know what to say like it just
makes me sad because I still continue
think that Android is the best
smartphone software out there and
watching these people just footing
around and it's screwing with it and not
a good job even Sony I mean Sony is
generally restrained but then the Xperia
Z 0 said it should have been out by now
right because HTC might actually get the
one out before the experience said and
it already has a higher pixel density
and it absolutely has a better display
so that what's the point in the
experience that who cares about the
experience that today yeah nobody I mean
at this point as far as andrew is
concerned I'm just I just kind of feel
like I'm gonna mute everything out it
just going to me when the K branded key
lime pie was it yeah okay branded the
pastry comes out and we get new effects
from the more likes phone ya know okay I
tell you what I'll step up to 4.5 inches
for that device won't go all the way up
to 4.7 but if it's a 4.5 I will spend
actual money on it oh I'm gonna hold you
to that what about you Chris are you
what are you gonna do um I think I'm
gonna I'm gonna hang on to the iphone 5
in the nexus 4 until i said at least
until the gs4 announcement and then then
we'll take it from there but I mean
that's going to be easy for us all to do
anyway because the one won't won't be
out by then so which is exactly if she
sees problem
um I don't I don't want to talk about
deep go to phone it's not shipping till
2014 you got a great report by a sean
hollister up on the site should read it
as the developer previews out for are
coming very soon for Galaxy Nexus in the
nexus 4 so you can play around with it
so I do want go ahead Chris why I do
want to just mention one thing very
briefly about the boom to mobile effort
in general which has me concerned which
is that they appear to be moving in some
ways in the same direction as Tizen
where they're going to end up seating a
lot if not all control of the platform
to the carriers that are launching these
devices and it's going to become more
about branding these phones as carrier
devices with very very deep carrier
quote-unquote experiences and less about
you know a consistent boon to experience
across phones and across carriers and
that's that's very scary but will say
you are we have we have a long way to go
until we know for sure how this is gonna
play out on that ridiculously depressing
I want to chuck briefly mention what's
going on next week oh yes we should
actually I'm totally right we totally
should so next week is obviously or
maybe not so obvious to you but it's
mobile world congress starting on
essentially the event itself starts on
monday but for us it starts force on
sunday all four of us will be there in
barcelona covering it as well as some
other people from from the verge we got
a pretty good staff that will be there
and you know it should be interesting to
see what happens obviously HTC did its
thing already so it will have a muted
presence at mwc instead of the big
presence that normally has and as far as
the show goes I believe we're planning
on doing a show is that correct eater up
sure yeah i don't know i mean here's the
thing like we never know when we're
going to get back from events we never
know we're going to
I'm and we especially never know exactly
what our bandwidth is going to be so if
we can do a show we will do a show and
will endeavor to give you a heads up on
one that show happens but you know
follow verge on Twitter for like hey
we're podcasting in five minutes because
we feel like it because that could
totally happen pretty much but at the
same time rest assured that our textual
photographic and video output is not
going to be diminished because we're
bringing our professional video
producers who put the rest of us
amateurs to absolute shame every single
time and somehow make us look
presentable like for example my whoa
isn't as yellow as it looks but it is
actually really yellow so my webcam is
white balance has been broken in touch
so I look kind of orange and weird and
then the world looks like it's painted
with custard Cory sylvian Twitter so we
will have a higher level of
professionalism at mwc and we'll make
sure not to miss anything because that's
our job yeah it should be fun I mean
that's slightly more optimistic upbeat
note thank you very much for watching
and or listening if you want to follow
us on Twitter you can and should i am
back lawn Vlad Vlad sob dan is DC
seifert with Annie I chris is Z power
again we are all at verge you can email
us it's a mobile show at the verge calm
we will completely read every single
email that you send to us and then
forget to talk about it on the show and
we may or may not see you next week on
the local show but definitely watch for
us covering mwc and it's definitely
going to be able to 35 that's right
thanks is ready right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
