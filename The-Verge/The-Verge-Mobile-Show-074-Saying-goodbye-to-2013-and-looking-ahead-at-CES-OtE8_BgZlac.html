to the verge mobile show it's the last
show 2013 it is December 31st I have a
drink and I'm dieter bohn I'm Dancy for
a knife hot cocoa i'm chris sigler and i
have a delicious cup of intelligentsia
coffee the other thing that you have
Chris what I heard earlier is drugs in
your system yeah so long story short i
have ADD LOL how is this a long story
what was the company cutting up uh okay
good point it's just a hobby where he
acquired the drugs well there's nothing
illicit here but so I'm overcoming a
variety of ailments right now which is
perfect timing would see us a couple
days away and so I have a you know a
bunch of jars of pills bottles of pills
whatever you call them on my countertop
and my sleeping pills look exactly like
the advil gel caps and so I I switched
them and took two sleeping pills instead
of two advil pills and you're only
supposed to take one sleeping pill now
miraculously I'm not dead but I have
been drinking coffee all after all
afternoon I feel a little Spacey but
i've also been feelin spacey just
because i've been taking a lot of
sudafed this week so I yeah it's a mess
so I apologize from if I'm not making
any sense on the show or if I just
spontaneously fall asleep either
situation is entirely possible but
hopefully it goes without incident but
so okay so you just have like random
jars of pills on your kitchen counter
online i love how chris is trying to use
the that i'm sick excuse to have random
jars of pills just learned well it's
it's true like i have i have probably 10
like supplements that i'm taking right
now between
like between like garlic and zinc and c
and all this nonsense because are you
trying are you trying to ward off
vampires no i'm using i'm using every
supplement that has been so much as
rumored to possibly shorten colds by
even a single minute I'm taking them all
simultaneously plus I'm taking sleeping
pills at night so that I can sleep
through the the pathogen and I'm taking
a number of different cold medications
including new snacks so the bottom line
is that yeah my countertop looks like I
should be immediately arrested oh I mean
here's the thing like you're patient
zero for the CES flu the cccs SARS or
whatever what would we call it TS ours
maybe david has the same thing I think
so either one of us could get everyone
sick the other thing that this makes me
think of is that instead of actually
writing about consumer electronics at
the Consumer Electronics Show i'm going
to write CES vampire fanfic where we're
vampires stock the night in the Las
Vegas Convention Center I'd read it
drinking the blood of weary tech
journalists I'd read it by the way who's
cockamamie idea was a dev a virgin
mobile show today I'm using uh believe
it worse I said no I was very skeptical
oops like I came came back to me little
quicker than I thought away yeah good
job then Evan please escort Dan off the
permit oh you can't you're not in the
neither one of you are in the office so
evan is is here producing the show
because of technical difficulties he's
not actually on the show nor is he
hiding his face so you just can see is
beautiful thumbnail down there it's
really nice looking sweet are ya um ok
so like CES coming it starts in like
mere days mirror mirror days and I mean
the common trend of there not being
massive crazy phone news is continuing i
don't i'm not expecting anything to you
know change the game
there hasn't been a major huge phone
announced at CES what since the pre yeah
i'm talking like 5-6 years no there was
um was a three-year to three years ago
when the LG revolution I repeat my
earlier claim no no no no but those are
important because they were the first
phones with LTE to be introduced by an
American carrier I think no yes no
didn't provide HTC Thunderbolt was the
first wonderful yeah that was at CES oh
yeah it's not yeah was the same event
like the whole room had like that like a
surround screen and like lightning just
kept on shooting across the entire
auditorium over and over and over again
hang on i'm pretty sure the Thunderbolt
was at CES well I do know that Motorola
showed the original droid bionic SE es
which ended up looking way different to
the droid bionic that actually launched
nine months later yeah it was at CES it
was january six 2011 no that's though
2010 it was dangerous the atrix was at
CES the original matrix i still think
that the original point stance no then
so the original matrix was interesting
dieter is completely wrong because the
original atrix was interesting because
it was the first device with web top or
whatever that the heck Motorola called
it uh it was the leave it was the first
smartphone announced with one gig of ram
it's a first the first dual core and it
had the fingerprint reader right um yeah
I mean I wanted to atrix so bad when
they announced as like it sounded like
when they announced that phone it sound
like science fiction and it turned out
it kind of was because it didn't launch
for a long time and it didn't live up to
the promises I don't right yeah but it
was decent there was a decent phone yeah
I am like the really exotic stuff about
it like the fingerprint scanner sucked
and the webtop thing was a total flop so
like all the stuff that made it really
interesting aside from the nerdy level
of like it's a first dual core phone I
like was it was a bust and is just like
an okay phone on its own merit right so
every year Sony
has a big press conference and they
usually save at least one phone for that
we're expecting a bunch of wearable
stuff that's going to be everywhere like
so sony last year used CES to launch the
xperia z which is its flagship model for
the time but i don't think that we're
going to see a new flagship from them
this year I mean the timing isn't great
and like the z1 just recently launched
you know we haven't seen it in the US
yet and uh but it hasn't been on the
market long enough for them to actually
like replace it with another flexion so
I'm sure Sony you'll do something but I
don't expect it to be a new flagship
device you know they could do it is the
z1 on t-mobile it isn't right no it's
not not available on any US carrier yet
so here's my prediction I think that it
they will announce it this might happen
at the tmobile press conference but
somewhere t-mobile will announce that
they're carrying z1 and I i bet that
AT&amp;amp;T announces a weird nerfed version of
the z1 for itself it's happened before
I'm just like like agency takes the
camera out it makes it like an inch
thicker for no apparent reason yeah Oh
AT&amp;amp;T like the highlight of a tease big
ATT has like a separate like I think
it's a technically a developer
conference attached to CES so that's at
the palms which is way far off from
everything else happens and the only
thing I remember is the highlight of
their keynote was then repeatedly
dropping gadgets into a giant bowl of
water like here's a kyocera whatever
it's called let's plug enough fouf
pulling it out of the water putting it
back in the water I still don't
understand is it is it Vlad who always
talks about wanting to be able to use a
phone in the shower I think I was David
David is a big fan of using things of
the shower I don't get it like what it
doesn't make any sense to me what are
you doing on your phone in the shower
apparently David reads books in the
shower like you see he gets so bored
cleansing his body that he's like you
know I just need to take a little break
here and read a few pages of a book she
is really confusing to me and also you
know maybe it's just efficient
multitasking and it's good use of his
time I guess I guess still weird me yeah
I mean look I read the story this week
that the majority of porn is now viewed
on mobile devices so and we're gonna
have 4k displays on phones here in what
2015 I alright what is that like a
thousand PPI awesome yeah doesn't make
any sense so we're also okay that's all
you'll have something maybe they'll get
t-mobile's got a press conference 18t
does its thing and usually announces
crappy devices verizon usually announces
some metric about how their LTE is
better than everybody else's there's
gonna be a million wearables like just a
million smartwatches a million crappy
smartwatches and the flagship crappy
SmartWatch I'm predicting right now is
the one that our coasts just teased it
it was going to be fabrication of a
pebble and my phosphor I ink watch and
so I'm going to buy it and that's a huge
giant shame I love our coasts man they
just they always are like they seem
super cutting edge and then they never i
I don't I don't think they seem super
cutting edge i'm not sure where you're
getting that baby i would I feel like
they're like up to date on the spec race
and like they get like they're like
they're like mp3 players before the ipod
we're like they did archos make
something they make make a mp3 yeah
marcos be decided right actually arcos
made these um almost like five and six
inch tablet like devices that you're
supposed to let i put your SD card in
and view your photos and maybe for the
ipad way before smart phones either that
really took off on the mainstream but
they always had like some crippling
resistive touchscreen or just like
horrible software interfaces that made
them like
be cool looking when they're turned off
but as soon as you like touch it and you
try to use it all things fall apart yeah
what else are we expecting from CES well
so uh we kind of glance right over the
t-mobile thing so t-mobile is having
this press conference it's the Wednesday
CES which is actually kind of like in
the downward tail end of CES yeah most
things but uh you know John letters been
teasing it up quite a bit on Twitter as
the next big uncarrier move and
apparently they're going to be
announcing it at CES so this is
uncarrier for I think if you've been
keeping count and I really don't know
what else they're going to announce
short of some people have been batting
around that maybe t-mobile is going to
suddenly start paying ETS if you cancel
your ATT or verizon and you come over to
t-mobile a tmobile baby will pay your
etf fee which is really the big barrier
for a lot of people switching switching
between carriers so I switch the team's
her week I had to drop it because I
didn't have a signal where i needed it
yeah I don't think that I mean I I don't
think that ETFs are actually that big of
it I don't think that there's people who
are saying no but I mean sure there are
some people that are saying that but
it's not like there are 10 million
people in the u.s. saying I would switch
to t-mobile and heartbeat if it weren't
for my damn ETF well well actually but
there are a bunch of people there's
there's a large number of people that
would do that and how many phones on ATT
can work with t-mobile's LTE the number
is much higher now that it used to be
and so if they will pay your etf you're
DTF is now paid which means that under
the new rules that have gone through
AT&amp;amp;T needs to unlock your phone for you
probably I mean that I know there's a
little bit of confusion about
interpreting those rules but I think
that might be the case which means that
if you're an 18 key customer you can
switch to t-mobile for a net cost of
zero because they will pay your etf and
get your phone unlock and you just for
work switch over at this point is it
will let you try tmobile like ETS maybe
Chris may be right that they're not
stopping people from switching but they
are stopping people from even trying the
service if you
with verizon or ATT for seven or eight
or five or six years or whatever your
bedding contracts the entire time you've
never had a chance to try tmobile or
other carriers see what their services
like a tmobile government contracts
right so if they do this thing and they
aren't very careful about how they set
up paying my ETF and I could like get
tmobile to pay my ETF be on tmobile for
a week and then switch back yeah I do
that there's and there's no way that's
it that's gonna happen like they'll
they'll do they'll probably do something
we're like if you're not with with them
for a certain number of months then you
need to pay it back it's got to be that
otherwise they go bankrupt or they'd so
I honestly I think so fast that the
softbank would have to buy ah i think
that uh at least for the mobile world if
you're not looking at wearables i think
t-mobile's press conference will
probably be the most interesting thing
that's CES well there was a rumor um I
can't remember where this came from but
there was a rumor that we could see a
galaxy gear to at CES nuts yeah I know
why though not naughty river I I agree
that seems implausible but how am I
galaxy gear life that didn't have a
camera on was thinner and lighter there
may be a lot of other things fixed with
the galaxy gear before I even consider
that yeah and also Samsung would be more
likely to make a galaxy gear note which
was twice the size of a stylus and you
know I'm right yeah yeah no see but
Sam's Samsung is doing something at CES
Samsung well they've got a million
toaster ovens and microwaves and crap
that they need to announce new Samsung
who does a Buddhist a blast chiller
that's LG right at s LG yeah which is
still like an awesome product that
everyone should have look I went to
Samsung's press conference last year at
CES expecting craziness and it was the
most boring thing I've ever live blogged
in my entire life what did they focus on
nothing it was just like here's a
refrigerator here's another TV this TV
has a slight curve to it which you saw
yesterday so whatever here's a thing we
showed a couple months ago here's a
phone with a curved screen oh wait we
showed that before too here's another
refrigerator and like I literally was
typing as best as I could for an hour
straight and not one interesting thing
just like product gadget product product
product product product well LG has a
new line of appliances that will SMS you
so that's exciting that's not a new
concept though like wow jeans okay don't
you two have webos on a TV I guess we
should talk about that briefly oh yeah
yeah but no I just to wrap up the
Samsung thing I know that samsung mobile
specifically is doing something there
and they it's it's been speculated for a
long time that they are kind of nearing
the point where they need to refresh
some of their tablets and my guess is
that we'll see some of that at mwc and
some of it at CES and maybe there will
be one or two tablet announcements that
are tied in with a carrier because
American carriers love them some tablets
so they don't sell any I know I don't
get it there's a verizon commercial i'm
sure you guys said is a verizon
christmas commercial where this woman is
using a verizon tablet and like the
entire back of it is a giant Verizon 4G
logo a trend right yeah i sum of all of
these verizon commercials and they would
be like red tablet red galaxy gear red
smartphone yeah it was the worst don't
buy that tablet whatever it was I think
it may have been a UH nokia um which
meant all ah the 2520 which does come in
very very bright red yeah so anyway I'm
sorry what were we supposed to talk
about I before I interrupted we were
going to be were going to briefly
chortle about the fact that webos is
coming back ah lie here I just want to
say this that I was at a friend's house
this weekend and he has an LG Smart TV
and it has this crazy remote that's like
a little wand it's like an air mouse and
you can wave it around in front of the
TV and it's got a mouse pointer and
stuff uh which is it
just kind of cool and a smart idea and
easy way to input things like your
netflix password and stuff but the rest
of the software was absolutely abysmal
so maybe webos for LG will be a good but
it's like that's predicated on the
belief that webos was ever an
appropriate operating system for a
television listen man is all I'm going
to do all I want to do is like be
watching megyn kelly on fox news and
then swipe her off my screen just like
it's like they're swiping their giant
touch screens yeah exactly i like and
like show that they she could be like
sitting at the desk and like I a channel
frame doesn't even disappear I just
grabbed her and swipe her off so rumor
is gonna be a card in her face still you
know if you could have like three or
four recent channels and be like slave
up to a card interface and see what the
channels are and then pick the one you
want maybe cool and you know what's
going to have a situation is gonna be
terrible like it's gonna be terrible
well I mean the app situation on any
Smart TV is pretty terrible right now so
yeah can't be it can't be any worst
that's a good point but here's what's
going to happen LG is going to announce
a line of webos TVs and then in a few
months because they like to do giant and
miniature versions of things are gonna
do a TV mini that's it that's actually a
tablet and then there's gonna be a new
webos tablet no crazy do you remember at
mwc last year i remember you and I were
walking around and we stopped by LG
smoothly this like 21 inch widescreen
monitor it was like three monitors like
stuck together yeah you buy that with
webos on it no i mean i buy that as a
monitor in fact i've wanted to buy that
as a monitor and i've looked at it in
several occasions the problem with it
apparently is that it doesn't work very
well with OS 10 i guess there's oh yeah
so i haven't bought it but it isn't like
a really badass looking monitor or not
like i would totally use use the heck
out of it just on with webos on anyway
if you're not familiar so yes
technically I believe that the show
floor opens on Tuesday which means that
the news actually
starts like Sunday or Saturday yeah so
month there's a million press
conferences on Monday so whatever your
plans are from Monday cancel them
because you're going to want to just
hang out on the verge and refresh and
see a bunch of live blogs and a bunch of
we have a bunch of video content both
hands on analysis from the studio that
we have both like right there in our
trailer right in front of the convention
hall it's going to be a ton of stuff so
what will you can work what phones are
you guys bringing to see us so I have
been waffling i'm waffling super hard
I'm going to bring an iphone just in
case but switching to it as a huge pain
because i have to call AT&amp;amp;T and talk to
their customer service reps for a half
an hour just to make tethering work
because ATT is horrible and doesn't
believe in free and open data and their
own sim card system you actually need to
call them they suck i I've never had
that issue well that's its data works
tethering doesn't but like when I like
on my account I've got my iphone 5s and
regardless of where I put my sim uh-huh
he's my iphone 5s and everything PG
tethering works on Android and Windows
Phone and everything like that and then
when i go to use my iphone everything
works but that's not my experience
friend oh i didn't sorry um so I was
actually tweeted this that I was
waffling between the Moto X and the
Nexus 5 I was leaning towards the Moto X
because the Moto X gets slightly better
battery life for me so I put my sim card
back my Moto X i've been using it for a
couple of days and i know that we all
love the Moto X to death but after using
the nexus 5 think feels slow thing feel
slow a little small to me so I'm gonna
probably use the Nexus 5 and I just
bought an anchor like 10,000 oh yeah
battery it's like this big and that's
I'm just going to keep that my back
pocket and i'll use that charge my phone
all day long i'm just taking an iphone
nothing fancy
I I put my sim back in my iphone this
weekend after like months and uh I'm
kind of happy with it yes I did I think
I might I'm gonna burning my iphone you
guys use prefer gmail to use mailbox
teeth by just use the gmail app I use
your lap it's been really bugging
terrible know it's wrong it's really
okay it's okay it still gets it gets
there it gets you use an android phone
for a day oh no no I mean no argument no
argument that the android gmail app
slaps the iOS gmail app up and down like
but it still gets the job done on iOS
the problem is that lately it's been
super buggy for me so I might have to go
back to mailbox if you will if you want
to talk about a steaming pile of hot
garbage try out the gmail app on the
iPad it is not so bad I cannot handle it
so are you using an iPad air or a mini
or what I'm using an OG ipad mini right
now well there's your problem obviously
yeah because I was thinking I might
actually buy mini retina just for the
show so I have a giant hot spot well so
that's what I I was debating buying the
mini retina with verizon I've got an OG
meant mini with verizon now what my
thinking was maybe on would flip the
script and be an iPhone guy with an
android tablet which i know is insane
and stupid but i was thinking it because
the Nexus 7 is so much cheaper than the
ipad mini but verizon and google can't
get their together and release that
version of the tablet so I've haven't
done it but it's your obsession with
tablets and Verizon you like you're an
AT&amp;amp;T customer like yeah my obsession is
is that I'm an AT&amp;amp;T customer for my
phone and I want to have verizon for my
tablet so that I'm garant I have a
better chance my guaranteed but I have a
better chance of actually getting a
signal when I need it when I'm in dire
straits if I'm if I'm you know I'm doing
my job and I gotta have as many
different ways to get online as possible
put all your eggs in one basket that's
the rule
you know what one platform seriously if
I were if I were to I wouldn't get an
AT&amp;amp;T tablet go with an AT&amp;amp;T phone I just
get a Wi-Fi tablet because what's the
point I like dying tethering your phone
to your tablet is a major pain in the
butt not ever buying a Wi-Fi tablet
again not that yeah yeah agree like I
used to be very strongly in the Wi-Fi
tablet camp and then David wrote his
beautiful piece on the original Nexus 7
and then I was a convert after that no I
love having LTE on my tablet I just like
if I'm gonna pay for LT in my tablet I'd
rather pay the extra five bucks a month
more 10 bucks a month more to have it be
on an alternate network so I've got
options how does that actually cause
like I can add a tablet to my ATT
account for 10 bucks a month and there's
no way that you have a standalone yeah
so it's 30 bucks a month it's 30 bucks a
month that's a lot of money but your
attention I want to get extra 20 to have
to be it it's worth twenty bucks a month
to me I mean that's at least said news
and information teachers and scholars
why don't you care about the people that
go to the verge that's I I care about
that one Oh Chris today you're awake you
you were looking down there I thought
maybe like well then my very unusual
monitor setup here makes it look like
I'm nodding off at all times basically
apologized so I'm currently in my brand
new apartment in Brooklyn in our office
which is yet to be set up which is why
everything looks weird and strange I
only minutes before the podcast started
got like my keyboard and trackpad
working there's also echo here I guess
so anyway I'm also not in a setup that
I'm comfortable with so that's why the
show is going so great um anything else
you guys want to talk about with CES I
mean you're both bringing iPhones well
I'm bringing an iphone and I'm also
bringing my moto x and x HTC one because
invariably a battery will die and i'm
just gonna jump my sim over to yeah well
no I'm bringing the Moto X and the
iphone and the Nexus 5 and someone the
nexus 5 dies and i don't feel like
charging it i'll switch swap it over to
something I've got I've got one of these
battery packs I got one one of the knock
off ones it's looks horrible a no-name
brand that i paid like 30 bucks for for
the iphone and then I've got like these
crazy like I once took a picture of all
the batteries that I have and it's like
10 inches high stacked of external
batteries yeah I carry all of them you
know what I'm not bringing is my old
mini hyper mac laptop charger as well
for the win and it feels feels really
nerve-racking to not have a giant
freakin battery in my bag to back up a
laptop yeah plenty of heads up when
you're getting low one thing that's been
worrying me about my iphone actually I
didn't even think about this for CES is
gonna be a problem is that it's now
completely unpredictable when the phone
will turn off between zero and ten
percent it's it's the worst like I I had
it happen once and I thought it was
because I was outside it was really cold
and batteries naturally have less
capacity when they're super cold so I
didn't really think about it but then I
was sitting on my couch last night and I
had like eight percent left and it just
turned off so that's not good you want
to know what I'm doing right now what I
am buying a charger for a sony nex-6
camera you know why because despite the
fact that this in claims that it charges
over Mike your micro USB literally not a
single adapter I have plugged into it
has worked only the one that comes with
it works and I've lost it in the move
you know I can't charge my camera I've
seen Sony's praises for its cameras so
many times but it continually urged me
and rice drives me mad that they don't
pack an external charger in their camera
well it axes it's not just it's not just
the lack of the external charger like
being a charge over bluetooth is
actually really amazing are not
bluetooth I'm shopping while I'm talking
here over micro USB is amazing that's a
great but the problem is that they've
got like they they had this wattage
requirement where if it's the standard
what is it 1.1 on an old-style USB and
then 2.14
is it 1.5 it's whatever it's one point
something in 2.1 and the next six is
like to point 0 and so I pads like the
edging level or Nexus 7 yeah yeah ipad
charging levels won't charge it anything
less than that maybe we'll trick
retarded if you're lucky and so like
it's it's they may as well made a
proprietary plug because at least that
way I wouldn't believe that it would
charge over micro USB and the problem is
if you're charging over micro use but
you can't like really use the camera and
charge at the same time right you know
changes this is me ordering a batteries
and an external charger and having it
shipped to the hotel in Las Vegas right
now you know I actually left my charger
and see us last year you know what
charges over any cable in any situation
whatsoever and iPhone 5s oh that's no
the rx100 mark to like Billy yeah you
can look at that camera and it will
start charging like it's I've never I've
never been in a micro USB situation
where it didn't charge hmm i love that
camera it's the only camera in tampa to
you see yes by the way this is a huge
film okay well we talked CES to death
get ready but we should talk about
blackberry in the two weeks since we
podcasted they have announced their
quarterly results which were of course a
huge fail they only sold one point 1
million bb10 devices they sold way more
blackberry 7 devices which is of course
an embarrassment they called off their
life blackberry live conferences they
mike lazaridis like cut his sold a bunch
of stock so that he's not going to
pursue a buyout of the company anymore
they decided they're gonna stop
manufacturing stuff by curry actually
manufactured most huge portion of their
own phones and now they're like nope
sorry to get rid of those factories
they're going to have Foxconn make
everything for them which is a huge
shift a huge I don't we can we can talk
about that when you're done wrapping a
beautiful well it's actually an
important shift for them because to be
honest one of the things that they like
to brag about is like they own the whole
chain and end and that mattered for
security of like you know do any levels
and they specifically
always like to brag about how nothing
was made in China and that they
manufactured things in Mexico and other
places yeah as a security selling point
and since we all know that Foxconn is
based out of China now that doesn't look
like it's going to be upheld Oh bless
you that that told me you're catching my
cold over the air to attack um I'm
infecting you yeah by looking at you
look deep into my eyes dieter um and
then the last thing is the new CEO John
Chen decided he was going to for like
the fifth time in the past month tell
everybody hey guys BlackBerry's cool
we've got a plan and this time he
enumerated the plan he the CNBC
published this letter that he wrote this
commentary that he wrote and his plan
for blackberry his like his here's what
we're going to do we're in a trim around
we're going to focus on the fundamentals
their fundamentals are sorry their core
business drivers our enterprise BBM unix
and the hardware business it's for uh
and looking at them like Enterprise yeah
like yours you still got a big install
base there but you are like one upgrade
cycle away and it's fading fast and your
Defense Department contracts I know that
you've got like more security clearance
and most people but it's not going to
last very long bro sorry uh next what do
we have next ah bbm you think you're
gonna make money on messaging next ah
phenix yeah okay we'll leave q nicks
you'll make a little bit of money there
you'll been in some cars you'll make
rtos is you'll you'll get some stuff
there but it's not going to be like a
real business but we're gonna hang onto
QX just because yeah that's a viable
business hardware business selling
blackberry to consumers this is your
future blackberry those well planned
eater for those of you not watching the
video portion of the podcast I just
flipped John
CEO blackberry the bird does anybody
disagree with my analysis of John Chen's
plants a blackberry like you shouldn't
picked four core things you should have
picked one or two and Ben and that that
should be it no good but I look this is
cowardice this is him like refusing to
like burn the things that need to be
burned in order for the company to
survive in a real way i hears well
here's why i don't agree i mean like III
think that jen is in the city was built
the same impossible impossible hand that
torsten was was dell and you can look at
any single one of those businesses and
if he had said we're just gonna focus on
this we would we would have been
laughing at him I mean there's no right
answer for this guy blackberry has been
at the poker table for 10 years and for
the past three years like everybody
that's been sitting there and the guys I
tap out play my next hand for me and the
new guy sits down to play the next hand
like torsen hind comes in looks at the
hand and it's a two and A four and then
he gets a tuna for again to 24 again and
he keeps betting and whatever he doubles
down even though it's different a
betting game wrong metaphor but stay
with me John Chen is getting that same
two and four and at some point what's
going on I'm playing the gambler Kenny
right oh yeah but so this is you know
and this is when we get pulled from you
it's not you should no one to hold him
and no one to fold them it's you should
know when to hold them and no one to
flip the table and blow everything you
are losing you took like enough things
off and that is what he's refusing to do
here like you should not be doing like
BBM sell it it's not a money maker let
it go sell it to who whoever wants it
sort of what I bet Samsung you buy it
for 50 bucks ya think don't say that
these four things are the core of your
business just
say we're going to do enterprise and
there's a bunch of other stuff we'll see
what happens with it and that's it you
know nokia went from making tires and
boots to making cars why can't
blackberry go from making phones to
making a fine china you know maybe they
just need to look for a different
business just throwing that out there
maybe they need to be a maple so they
should have kept their name rim then if
they were making glasses in China yeah
research on muffin it's true okay yeah
it could have made cars yeah all right
you know freedom preserves the names
appropriate fruit wow I guess you could
say they're in a real black know how
you're gonna say pickle and it's gonna
be like it makes no sense that was
actually women way better man listen two
weeks ago I had a lot of great cheap
owns I need to keep that streak going
what are we talking about I don't care
anymore oh no I was just noticing like
we should have when we were talking
about webos we should have brought up
the fact that HP is gonna make phones
again they're just going to make like
basically glorified tablets call them
phones and launch a vagina that's the
rumor this is hilarious this is
hilarious to be on multiple levels first
of all they they first of all they have
been making this like ridiculous low end
android tablet that nobody cares about
it like oh yeah it's it's so bad in like
i was buying it uh secondly this is the
exact same strategy the dell took with
its mobile program after it couldn't
make a dent with the venue pro in the US
yes old low end android crap in china
and that went nowhere and then they shut
the business down so no why HP thinks it
can succeed where delphin each patient
just taking microsoft money and make
windows phones yes i'm not kidding like
they did that back in the day before
they about webos that was their mobile
strategy make corporate phones that
nobody cared about but some businesses
would buy make a bunch of money off of
those enterprise customers and Microsoft
paying him to make those
windows mobile phones and it was a
win-win and you know some consumers
bottom because they love QWERTY
keyboards or whatever um they should
just do that again like you know there's
the rumor that Sony is cozying up and
might maybe launched a windows phone in
2014 the information published today tom
warren is a little bit dubious because
of course sony's talking to microsoft's
are talking to whoever they can but I
you know I guess I believe it but
Microsoft I'm sure is desperate to have
anybody be like yeah we support Windows
Phone they would give HP a bunch of
money to make Windows songs and it would
differentiate them because there's no
way that HP can compete with anybody in
making a quality Android device it just
it's not going to happen right yeah
they've been down this road too many
times at this point it's like it's
actually hilarious how many times
they've tried and failed to make phones
like it because it's not it's not just
it's not just webos right like they've
they made windows they made windows
mobile devices on at least two different
occasions Oh more than two I think they
probably made a half dozen of them over
the years right but I mean like I mean
they bought connell compaq had the I
packs and then HP bought compaq right no
but you guys don't remember their
messaging phones they made like three or
four qwerty keyboard messaging phones
like like moto q knock-offs right yeah I
never was they had a really bad name for
him yeah was it Glee more glisten the
glisten he's gonna listen that's what
it's called HP glisten Wow oh man memory
is really bad um yeah that was on AT&amp;amp;T
right i mean frankly i don't really care
what HP does with phones like there's
never going to be a thing that HP does
with phones that's going to be
interesting to me as a consumer as a
paying customer I well you don't know
that what if they went underneath cybot
HP phones I have HP phones a few feet
away from me and I'm never going to
forgive them for it yeah I've got a vir
4G over there it's branded HP hmm don't
your six do you want one yeah bring it
bring into vegas i'll take some off your
hands uh uh yeah i can't actually really
one really have a little party phone man
I still have never they take they take
the big sims so they're a real pain in
the neck to actually yeah and if you if
you screw up your sim adapter to put a
sim in it it's gone forever you have to
destroy the phone to get it out of the
little spring ejector thing well there
was a period when I like woot or
somebody with selling veers for like
twenty bucks so f be a huge loss
actually what I'd like even more than
that those in a t-33 I have that too
well of course you do but like I help me
yeah um why are we talk about web Alaska
and we have to stop uh never never stop
never forget we talked about the xperia
z ultra and z ultra google play edition
on the last bubble show don't know you
we last podcast a damn yes so um I've
got them got them here they're really
big I'm just gonna block out the Sun uh
with with these just because they're so
big oh I open the camera yeah they're
total Lola caca coasters like I've
played with these phones they're
completely hilarious and yang good play
I mean they're like they're super niche
products look these things are sold
unlocked online you can't go into a
carrier store and buy them and they're
expensive as heck and they're obscenely
large and you know if you are into that
type of thing if that gets your fancy
going and you want to spend seven
hundred dollars on a device like this by
the Xperia edition I really do not
understand why the google play edition
exists because it is literally a
blown-up Nexus 5 with a worse camera now
don't you think that a z1 google play
edition would actually do really well oh
my god see what Google Play edition
would be amazing i would love c 1 google
play edition the problem is this device
here uh the Z Ultra is is so big and
it's so close to actually being a tablet
that when you put like a standard phone
interface and phone software on it it
just it's like goofy and it's not a
great or efficient use of the screen
size here and that's what the key
difference between the Xperia version
and the google play edition is is that
Sony actually bothered to do some mate
like even the smallest amount of
customization for the screen size
whereas the google play edition is none
at all it doesn't run the nexus 7
software doesn't run tablet apps it runs
phone everything just like the Nexus 5
so uh that's why if you want to go down
this route more power to you by the
Xperia dition is my suggestion they
should have put the nexus 7 software on
the google play edition right yeah yeah
i mean just add a dialer and you're done
yeah weird but they didn't so and nosy
one seriously the fact that there's no Z
1 actually I think lends credence to my
theory that we will see some American
one or more American carrier
announcements for the z1 at CES and
there's probably an exclusive involved I
don't think you're wrong but I mean it
just goes back to that that's a that's a
follow-up announcement to a flagship
product that's already been out for
months it's not like they're unveiling
their new flagship device right right
what if we had a SmartWatch 3 at CES is
that possible the SmartWatch to hit
market in knocked over I think yeah but
it was announced but it was announced
when a tifa or before then uh it was a
sativa yeah okay so yeah that's not here
right uh uh whose theater worst eater um
they're trying to make an appt work and
it's failing so uh let me add it I was
gonna I was gonna play the am I here
yeah you don't hear yes yeah i was gonna
play the criminy this is the worst my
god hey guys just let me get back the
video what is happening i have no idea
how to get back to you guys right now i
hear what happened to you I
aight i want it i click the youtube app
to try and play the ridiculous horrible
galaxy gear commercial from youtube and
having done that I literally cannot see
what's going on right now I would refer
to that creep mercial so yeah I wanted
to use Google Hangouts to display a
YouTube video but it won't let me at it
so I'm pretty sure that it it's not
allowed to be brought to rebroadcast
nevertheless this galaxy gear commercial
is an embarrassment it's an utter
travesty you know it's super awkward
it's super creepy and it's super doesn't
work for the market that it appears to
be selling to and saucer siegen a PC Mag
wrote a piece on this when it was when
it came out and he kind of nailed why
none of it works in my opinion he was
Alexa no I well you gotta what he said
he said that uh you know nobody in the
video is American it's clearly obvious
that they're foreign and English is not
their first language and the people that
are making the marketing and ahead of
this are not from the Western culture
and that's why it just doesn't work and
it comes off as really awkward and it
doesn't fit in with the American market
look I mean I get cultural differences
and I get that argument and I think
sasha was right to make it to a degree
but at the end of the day sexism of
sexism and churlish hassles or Trish
assholes and churlish is a great word
the as bad as that is that's not my real
problem here my real problem isn't like
here's this creepy stalker guy although
that's a big problem my real problem is
that jerk the pain in the ass guy gets
the girl in the end I mean you've seen
better off dead I hope if you haven't
stopped what you're doing stop watching
this and go watch better off dead
because using John Cusack is supposed to
get the girl the the guy who's clumsy
and in the background and isn't sure of
himself and has to like rise to the
occasion
win the day that's who gets the girl in
the feel-good commercial not the jerk
who's already you know when his samsung
ever made a feel-good commercial okay
their last commercial what was the
privet the the note 3 was about a soccer
dude walking through post-apocalyptic
yeah like land filled with like homeless
children the only good ad i can think
that came out of samsung in recent
memory was the first galaxy gear ad
which was it was it got hit there almost
good well I mean some of the switch at
some of the iphone lion ads are pretty
good and obviously the i believe in a
thing called love ad is amazing oh god I
forgot about that that was at a
superbowl that was a super bowl
hyperbole yeah what was it what product
was it for us were note it had to have
been enough yeah okay it's a samsung
Eddie yeah it's it's unfortunate that
that they their most recent good add the
galaxy gear head was for such a terrible
products but what can you do yeah oh
they and then they're super glad this
year was that the Paul Rudd ad which was
terrible yeah oh yeah I remember that
and Seth Rogen was in it right yeah yeah
uh yeah now they're not letting me find
the other commercial I must have been
for a note it was I think was a note too
because it was a year before last year
so maybe there's a note one cuz last
Super Bowl the note to would have been
on the market so that it must been the
original this 2012 let's see if the
YouTube app will let me play it play
this thing I bet it won't how ironic is
that that it won't let you what
Samsung's not letting you spread their
marketing yeah it really is actually add
videos of playlists search darkness no
it's a fail whatever
well after you watch better off dead go
look for that yeah but mostly just go
watch better off dead because it's the
best what else we have to talk about Oh
Sofer Aizen oh no go ahead I was going
to save verizon confirmed today to the
LA Times that it well best buy confirmed
excuse me that it will be carrying a
verizon version of the Moto G in the
apparently very near future for a
hundred bucks off contract which is
awesome price great price for a phone
uh-huh no LTE and it's prepaid which
means that 99% of Verizon customers will
not care about it because literally
nobody buys prepaid phones on verizon so
yeah that's true hello I want to believe
that's going to change soon it's
changing on t-mobile it's changing on
sprint for sure in fact there was a
rumor that they already have a book both
of them which they really ought to both
anyway but both of them offer really
like a lot of prepaid options and their
competitive plans and everything
whatever verizon's prepaid plans right
now they were so terrible for so long I
don't even know if they've changed or if
they're updated or they support
smartphones in any decent way that you
could buy a lot of data on um so i'm not
i mean the Moto G is an important advice
and it's a great device for emerging
markets and it's important for Motorola
and it's cool that you can buy one for
100 bucks in the US without a contract
but I don't foresee it being a big deal
among actual buying consumers in the US
no but it's a big deal in concept it's a
big deal you can get a pretty decent
phone for honour Bob
you
so like and then they you know right now
cyanogenmod is the thing that you if
you're you're into hacking then you put
on your phone or if you've got an old
android phone that hasn't been updated
by your carrier or your manufacturer
cyanogenmod gives you a newer version of
android and things like that but like
say if they want to be a successful
company making a profit and all that
other fun stuff they need to be just
like another HTC Sense or another
samsung touchwiz just another option
under the Android umbrella for four
people so they've got a long lot of work
and long road ahead of them I just I
want to know I want to know what they're
going to do with 23 million dollars I
really do because like I could I can see
them okay i know i could see them
spending 23 million dollars to make
something amazing no question i
understand that what I don't understand
is how they are like the people
investing in them think that they have a
really good chance at a return you would
I would do with 2,300 million-dollar 23
million dollars if I were signage in mud
I would rent out excess in vegas for a
night and just burn through magnum after
magnum after magnum of dom and it just
blow it i would get in like afrojack and
like who would who would play at that
show would you would you get to play
pitcher like tiesto yeah Tiesto yeah
Afrojack maybe like Gareth on your CV
yeah it would just go the party would go
from like 6pm to like 6am and then at
the end of that the goal would be to
have to have not a single dollar left so
so to answer deters correct question I
think investors are not looking for
cited Ramon to turn a profit ever I
think they are hoping that they get
bought by a bigger company and that's
their payout then they hope that Google
will buy them and absorb them into
Android or an actual smartphone
manufacturer will buy them and use them
as their self yeah I think that's from
your video dan is blowing my mind like
just watching you just like sitting
there listening to somebody when you're
actually talking I know it's driving me
nuts and cuz its link layer avatars not
updated at all and I a few says they
from in frame or not in frame where if
I've got a booger hanging off my nose
I'm sticking with black and white from
now on by the way this
pretty awesome I feel pretty boss right
here this is aces I don't know which way
i remember i think it was last year i
can't remember who i was writing about
but I i wrote a post and used a black
and white picture of them and everyone
thought that like that was like code for
the person had died haha there were a
lot of commons they were like oh my god
this person that I gotta find the post
now i cant member who was i'm black and
white and no real time Wow telling you
man black and white is where it's at you
guys are going add you should get with
the program I don't know how to make it
black and white you click yourself and
then you have the drop down on the upper
right underneath a little thing that
says it's live no I only have no i only
have profile and mute no click yourself
yeah and then when you're big underneath
the lie yellow line oh oh i see now
you're changing colors compelling radio
ladies good so Wow chris is really bad
at this so we're getting word from our
producer that the stream went down for a
couple of minutes to summarize what we
were talking about um when did it go

show you guys how big the phone is again
where'd it go it's such a big phone I've
lost it we talked about gerbils and
Richard Gere Beyonce to you I'll get
that reference and we talked about this
is big phones the correct pronunciation
of the word do GE we talked about why
would anybody give cyanogenmod 22
million dollars not that we don't
believe in cyanogenmod but we're curious
as to how they're actually going to
recoup that money for their investors
that's fun
also we talked about Google Hangouts
because we're egotistical maniacs and we
only care about the things that are
directly in front of our faces oh I also
talked about how to throw an insane
private party at club XS in vegas for
cyanogenmod star yet yes yeah um and
