sheffer and today I begin the verge
Thanksgiving fast 2k13 gotta start
making room for that turkey this is 90
seconds on the verge the FDA has ordered
23andme com a company that provides at
home DNA analysis to halt sales of its
product claiming it's currently being
marketed quote without proper clearance
or approval from regulators the company
has twice submitted its test kit for
review as a medical device but the FDA
has yet to approve it the FDA has worked
tirelessly with 23andme com to resolve
the situation but discussions have
proven unsuccessful Iran is temporarily
halting its nuclear program and what is
being called a historic event six
countries including the US have reached
a deal that would see Iran cease
enriching uranium beyond five percent
and begin diluting material that had
been enriched beyond twenty percent both
of which should mean that Iran could
produce nuclear energy but not nuclear
weapons critics of the deal including
some in Congress expressed concern
because it doesn't completely dismantle
Iran's enrichment program while this is
certainly a large step forward the
entirety of Iran's nuclear program must
still be addressed in the coming months
and finally crack open a six pack of
budweiser because roadhouse is coming
back MGM is remaking patrick swayze's
hit film from 1989 about a cooler that's
called in to clean up the Double Deuce

cohen the director of the original fast

casting has been announced I can't help
