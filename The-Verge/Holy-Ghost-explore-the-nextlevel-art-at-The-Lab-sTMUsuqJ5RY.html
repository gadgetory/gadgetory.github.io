we're here at the first ever panorama
Festival in New York City and right
behind me is the lab the verge is an
incredible interactive art space we
talked to beau Burroughs one of the
artists with work in the lab and Alex
Frankel and Nicholas Milhiser Holy Ghost
about making magic out of sound light
and digital effects so for panorama we
built something that we are calling
visceral recess we kind of channeled
those bioluminescent deep sea creature
vibes to create something that you can
go inside and roll around and press on
and it will react to your presence as
much as you yet welcome to the lab thank
you rather so we're sitting inside a
thing I built that is meant to look like
intestines that light up and kind of
trying to like beautify your inner
guests so that people are more
comfortable
I don't know if it's because DMX
protocols were kind of old nor k occur
because sometimes the lighting guys
aren't totally keating with the thing
you guys have any feelings online stuff
you want to do in the future in terms of
how visuals tie into the musical phones
yeah like dmx is very antiquated it's
very similar to MIDI which is similarly
antiquated but they're I mean they're
they're basically the same language
being musicians we're familiar with MIDI
so we use MIDI to like write lights I
think honestly one of the biggest
obstacle is often times elddis aren't
musicians and musicians aren't LVS
because you have these two different
languages there's always some rough or
something that really should be very
simple and easy and like musical and lot
like it should be something that you
should be able to play live this is
Gabriel blood Jose peace
infinity wall for panorama we're
building an immersive installation made
out about infinity mirrors and see
through mirrors it will be triggering
ripples of light through the
installation so this is touch design
rooms the same one I use for my I'm same
one Dave and Gabe is using for theirs
and
it's really really good at doing better
processing so you can input it tons of
data you can have audio level sample
rates like 44.1 killers data going
through it but it's really great because
it all runs on the GPU so you can
process massive arrays at the same time
so connect out is a great example it
comes in its video
but you can turn it into just float
values and use it for anything so that's
what they're visualizing here
you guy that we work with on a lot of
stuff it was pioneered
you work in touch designer especially
and he built this visualizer in here
with Daniel sch√§fer another guy
everyone kind of has a hand in all the
things I feel like there's tons of
potential in Sinking visuals with music
and keeping that one cohesive sing it
really feels like we're at the nerd
table and the cafeteria is that this is
