that's rare that if you forgot to lock
your door at night
it wasn't that big of a deal if she
didn't was I didn't lock my car doors
when I got there if I wanted to I could
have left the keys in it
neighbors looking out watching was calm
quiet anyone else I mean it was just
nakhon Texas brine which is the company
that has been mining this area that
sinkhole sits over a salt dome and it's
believed that there's a cavern in there
that has collapsed Rock went from this
to this a thing called the size of 20
football field officials here declared a
code three alert which is the highest
form of readiness
after the sinkhole started bubbling
swirling and swallowing more trees a
year ago there was seismic activity in
this area which is odd we don't have
earthquakes in south Louisiana we have
hard we traded hurricanes for
earthquakes we have plenty of hurricanes
we'll have earthquakes so when there was
seismic activity in the Bayou people
started to get worried back on May 12th
2012 my wife and I we took the boat out
one afternoon just taking a little
leisurely ride that something we just
often do just the relax go down the
bayou and take a ride we're going about
a half a mile down the bayou
and when I got to the pipeline crossing
without where they're known there are
three known pipelines that crossed I
noticed some unusual bubbling at first I
passed it up then I turned it around I
went back look again they know this
doesn't look right
you know one morning the bubbles
appeared no one really knew what it was
that was causing these bubbles in the
bayous nearby and and a lot of
investigation took place and then on
August 3rd 2012 our employees came to
work and looked out and the swamp it
disappeared a state of emergency was
declared an evacuation order was issued
at cetera et cetera if you look out
there but 40 feet that bubbling spot
that is a natural gas bubbling up
through the water that is methane gas
that's coming up your main concern with
methane is it is highly flammable and if
you get a big concentration of it you
get explosion you hear in the cities you
hear of gas explosions where somebody's
had a leak they didn't know about or
left the stove on or whatever was gets a
spark well gas has been blowing and you
lose a whole city block that's the
similar concern we have here that this
gas did build up in a back room in a
closet underneath a house in enough of a
concentration to where spark somebody
flipping a light switch
somebody stacked discharged whatever
could set off an explosion it was a
house lose several houses and it was a
life to this point we've had no injuries
we've had no deaths associated with this
and we really really want to keep it
that way we currently have air
monitoring equipment that we had in
place early in its event that air
monitoring equipment actually transmits
to the command post here currently
there's over 300 instruments that that
go here to the command post
typically you get here about 7:30 8
o'clock in the morning
wanted email I typically make a initial
round around the sinkhole and the
community
the danger is with methane so it's lel
lower explosive limit oh this is one of
the flares this flare is gathering
natural gas that is being removed
through our vent wells that at that
surface of the plumbing that depth of
about 150 feet into the aquifer the gas
is flowing up through the well is being
collected at several different sites and
then it's all being channeled into this
single flare and that's how we're we're
you know that's one of the processes
we're using to to to remove the gas from
the aquifer we've got seismic monitoring
in the salt at surface in the area above
the salt to determine monitor I guess
the ongoing stability of the dome itself
so if all we get we catch the seismic
movement got some activity follow-on
from the fact that dome collapse and
that changes you know the weights and
the rock stresses all around there we're
expecting that that's what you expect to
happen after you see in a sudden event
like that while it was a man-made action
that started this its geology and you
know natural forces that are driving
they're making everything happen for now
in geology happens slow
we have nothing to hide the
this event took place we own this
sinkhole it's on our property we are
responding is the best of our ability
you know where this is there's not a
file cabinet back at the offices what to
do in case there's a sinkhole this is
not a curse this is a a unique
phenomenon it's being studied by
scientists all over the world has never
happened anywhere else we yes we know
that this sinkhole is connected to our
Brian Cameron it's on our property the
unanswered question is what caused the
actual breach
whenever the the incident first happened
with the the sinkhole they finally came
out and said that it was a mandatory
evacuation and for me
mandatory means something you have to do
so I did it and we didn't think it would
like go on for very long I thought it
would be just maybe week or two I didn't
really ever understand completely what
had happened at first mandatory
evacuation is established in law is
called disaster Acton in Louisiana
mandatory evacuation basically means
that the risk is present and everyone
should heed that risk because it is in
the present but if you do not you're
taking that risk upon yourself the
authorities are telling them it's not
safe to live there and so if it's not
safe to live there and they can't live
there because of the sinkhole and
because of the gas coming from the
sinkhole then these people have
absolutely suffered damages and they're
saying that not only is it not safe now
but we don't know when it will be safe
and we don't know if in three years you
can move back we don't know if in five
years where you can move back the latest
I heard was that they think that in
three to five years it will stop moving
stop moving doesn't mean we don't even
know what what it's going to look like
in three to five years
just when asked for everybody's prayers
because um a lot of us are in and night
we're not in good condition here
paradise is not lost yet right now the
the sinkhole that's the water the
contaminated water which is saltwater
Brian
hydrocarbons it is contained by a levee
it is contained by a burn if you go
right on the outside of the sinkhole the
swamp right there on is still pristine I
mean you see fish you'll see alligators
you see birds you see wildlife Bayou
corne itself still remains a very
beautiful place I mean as you can see
right here
so uh all is not lost as some people
would have you believe Bayou corne will
never be what it was I know this they'll
get me wrong we have a serious problem
in the area that's within the levee of
the sinkhole that area is pretty much
lost forever
you know those cypress trees will never
come back but the entire area is not is
not gone we're still hanging in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
