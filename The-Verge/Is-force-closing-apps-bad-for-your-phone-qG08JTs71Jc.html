apps trying to save battery life or make
your phone more efficient so what does
exiting apps actually do it turns out
closing your apps doesn't help and
actually it's bad for your phone Apple's
senior VP of software Craig federighi
reportedly answered this question to a
user in 2016 in an email he said closing
apps isn't necessary and it doesn't help
with battery life I will explicitly says
on its support pages that users should
only force closed apps when they're
unresponsive meanwhile Hiroshi Locke
heimer the senior vice president of
platforms of the ecosystems at Google we
did a similar thought last year in his
tweets he said users shouldn't close out
of apps because the operating system
already manages what they do in the
background it closes apps when necessary
and slows them down into background
activity just to confirm all this I
talked to an independent iOS developer
is Shabazz and he said what happens when
you've seen in the screenshot right it
seen a screenshot of the last EPF was in
so the app usually is not running
anymore and the an app will wake it up
when it needs to run if need be but it
actually will let shut it down after
just a few side thinks maybe like 10
seconds or so keeping your apps open in
the background means your phone can hold
them up more quickly as if they were
just asleep and you're waking them up
relaunching every app requires more work
and battery power although data usage
matters to you having apps on in the
background we use up some data but not
that much
if you care about your device you'll
defer to Google and Apple software
management systems they were designed to
help listen I hate that this is the
truth I'm going to try to keep my apps
open but in reality I know I'm going to
feel the urge to close them and guess
what I'm probably going to do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
