expanding we started with daredevil in
2015 which made waves as Netflix is best
show at the time then Jessica Jones
depicted a complex story about an abuse
survivor that accepts rejects and comes
to tentative terms with her super
heroine status Luke Cage follow and was
no less important the store of a black
man that can't be shot trying to find
his place in the cultural hub of Harlem
it's been a great al-bait bumpy ride so
far and we're finally getting to the
fourth Marvel hero to complete the
defenders iron fist iron fist is a
pretty beloved superhero he's also a
rich white Savior propped up by generic
oriental culture to become a mystical
master of kung fu
yeah we need to talk his real name is
Danny Rand and he's one of the finest
warriors in the entire Marvel Universe
he's the sole survivor of a plane crash
that killed his wealthy parents in the
Himalayas since then he spent 15 years
training with amongst of Kowloon to
become the immortal iron fist
with the power to summon superhuman
strength speed and agility and a
powerful glowing fist he returns to New
York to save it from an evil mystical
ninja clan known as the hand we're right
right maybe even a little familiar what
rules our body my MA so what we have
here is a web of pseudo Asian mystical
martial arts ninja enemies and a handful
of white men ready to save the day this
is a trope or an accepted convention at
storytelling but why let's break it down
first
there's the issue of Orientalism
Orientalism and fiction means depicting
characters of East Asian or Arabic
descent as exaggerated and exotic others
as compared to the white counterparts
who taught you in other ways
so if you see Asian men and women in
robes talking a lot about honor and
karma or if they're solely there as
ninjas or martial arts experts then the
show is reinforcing orientalist
stereotypes filmmakers get away with
this because of the presumed ignorance
of the audience martial arts are
obviously real Himalayan temples
actually exist and people really do
adhere to mythical belief systems all
over the world the problem comes in
assuming those ideas can sum up whole
groups of people even worse those ideas
are usually meant to empower white
heroes if you study in the Himalayan
mountains you'll gain mystical magic
powers to affect the universe if you're
blind and study under a blind sensei you
can basically regain your sight and
become a ninja and if you study enough
kung-fu your fists will glow of the
power of an immortal
Bagon this is especially problematic
when characters of the stripe are often
the only roles people of Asian or
Pacific Islander descent can get in film
or TV and spoiler casting a white person
- this poorly developed kind of role
does not solve the issue it makes it
worse the second problem is the idea of
a white Savior white saviors are white
people usually men who enter an exotic
society and come out as the chosen one
figure they've absorbed the stereotyped
culture and have emerged as the best
person among those people but this
marginalizes people who don't often get
a chance to see themselves the main
character while also subtly implying
that all the people from these fictive
cultures can't defend themselves because
they need saving thankfully this white
person showed up to study and use their
culture to save the day so what's marvel
to do a lot of the problem comes from
adapting source material from the 1970s
with baked and racism that refuses to go
away characters like iron fist and his
early forbear shang-chi capitalize on
the kung-fu craze of the era back then
the characteristics of martial-arts
films were arguably empowering for
marginalized audiences featuring a
long-suffering non-white protagonist on
a righteous quest against the foe that
was a moral colonial and sometimes white
but by 1972 efforts like kung fu helped
co-opt Hashanah for white America even
though characters like Iron Fist and
Doctor Strange have come a long way
their origin stories are steeped in some
pretty offensive ideas the film version
of dr. strange for instance tried to
sidestep the problem by casting Tilda
Swinton as the ancient Wantage but that
gave fans the impression that Marvel was
whitewashing the character for Iron Fist
which appears relatively faithful to the
source material it might just be
laziness a vocal group of Marvel fans
protest the casting choices of Iron Fist
explaining how an asian-american Danny
Rand could benefit the story it was
smart criticism that showed how far
we've come since the 70s it's a genre
problem nearly 50 years in the making
and were sadly still struggling with it
to this day food for thought during your
next Netflix binge
so there's been some Twitter drama
surrounding the show of course actor
Finn Jones who plays iron fist tweeted
out a link to actor Reza mats talked
about the importance of representation
in film Jones was quickly struck down by
fans given the irony of his statement in
retaliation he deleted his Twitter
account he's back now</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
