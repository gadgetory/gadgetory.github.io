we're taking a look at google drive
which was just released today the new
cloud storage platform it has 5
gigabytes of free space for everybody
and you could pay more and get up to 16
terabytes if we look at the web app here
you'll notice at first that it's very
similar to Google Docs and this really
does replace google docs if you go to
docs google com it doesn't exist anymore
as long as you upgrade the drive you're
just going to have drive what we see
here is you know all of our files now
you can upload everything not just work
documents and if you choose to open up
something it's going to open up in a new
tab and if we go back to drive you could
see in the interface here we can upload
files or folders from our desktop
anything we want and when you do it's
pretty quick and you get this little
notification down here sharing features
in Google Drive are pretty much
identical to Google Docs if we go in
here we can right click a file and tell
it to share and you'll if you ever use
Google Docs you'll recognize this screen
additionally a drive is very search
focused you can search all your files
and Google's saying that if you search
for images it can use its image
recognition technology and bring up
files like if you have a picture the
eiffel tower tower you can search for
eiffel tower and you will get that the
pop up and there's also OCR for PDF so
if i search here for snowflake it'll pop
up this result in this PDF which are
found which is pretty great in addition
to the web app there's also a Native
Client for the pc and mac and it's very
similar to dropbox you've ever used that
and if you open it up you you get this
folder view and finder that's pretty
much identical to dropbox and the one
really disappointing thing for us is
that google docs files have to open up
in the web browser there's no way to
open it in pages or text edit you know
if i go here and go to open with this is
really just a web
shortcut so if i open up this file
you'll see it kicks me out to chrome and
you know so there's no way to try to it
just sort of a strange disconnect
between desktop and web one of the other
complaints we have with this native app
is that you can't switch accounts at all
you know on the web app it's pretty easy
to switch in the top right corner but
from here you'd have to sign out and
completely delete your Google Drive
folder or make a new one if you want to
switch accounts which can be problematic
if you have like a work one and one for
personal use there aren't too many
options in the native app but if we go
up here we can see that we get around
selective sync for folders just like for
the web app Google Docs has been
completely replaced by Google Drive
you'll see that at the top way of
account switching and a very simple
interface that will look familiar to
anyone who's used docs if we go into the
top here we just have a list of all the
files and if we go to the right we can
share make files available offline and
there's also a search so we can look
through images like before and OCR and
PDF documents and lastly there's an
option here to upload files from your SD
card on your phone or make a new
document just like in the old docs app
Google Drive is available now for mac pc
and android tablets and phones and it
will be available on iOS pretty soon
