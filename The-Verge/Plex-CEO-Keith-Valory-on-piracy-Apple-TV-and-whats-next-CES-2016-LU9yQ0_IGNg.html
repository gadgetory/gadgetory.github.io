sitting here with Keith Valerie the CEO
of plex Steve thank you so much for
joining us this week thanks for having
so I wanna get into a lot of stuff let's
start top level I don't wanna suppose
there's anything what is Plex so Plex is
a media app that helps people manage all
of their media collections so video
collections photo collections music
collections we add a lot of metadata and
other related content to that and give
you kind of powerful organizational
tools and then allows you to stream that
to all of you virtually all of your
devices all of our big screen apps are
free and you know honestly that's been
the goal over time is to make sure as
many people can use this as product as
possible so we want to make it free and
kind of open up the funnel with so many
different media player apps you're like
juggling a number of code bases like
what it what is the support staff behind
it now how how much of a hurdle is it's
like keep all these like different apps
like support it cuz it's wet
Smart TVs you basically have as many
almost as like Netflix at this point
because of you know with I don't know
what if that is seven or eight languages
were able to cover a lot you know
hundreds and hundreds of devices and the
big one of course that just came out of
the big the problem was the Apple TV one
you guys famously had this post about
like it took five weeks to develop we
got this up just like I think a week
after the MTV launched what was the
reaction to that in terms of like just
like not know it means like online
people really loved it online but like
how much of a subscriber booth did you
get from the Apple TV
we absolutely got a subscriber boost
what was interesting as well is that a
lot of our current users switched over
to it very quickly that's still you know
in a short period of time we still it's
not in the top apps that we have right
now but it's climbing very very quickly
what is the top one I would say probably
the Roku is probably the most you
streaming device the web app is actually
probably the most used device and iOS
and Android are pretty kind of neck and
neck as well so and now that you kind of
curse it so you never like any issues in
terms of like the content itself and I
want to kind of get to this because like
Plex TV you know you were started open
source become a for-profit company you
know and a lot of the content that
people use it's their own personal media
library but we're not really talked
about where that kind of comes from I'm
you know I think it's fair to say piracy
is a big part of that and I think it
makes Plex is really nice does no matter
what the content is you don't
discriminate you do clean it up and make
it nice almost make it user
right what is your personal opinion like
we certainly don't condone piracy at all
and there is lots of ways to get lots of
great legitimate content into the system
we have music and photos and a lot of
people use a lot of guys on our team use
kind of DVR'd content to get it into the
system importantly one of the important
aspects of Plex is that you have this
very secure private content collection
because we are managing people's photo
libraries in their home video libraries
we don't have any view into the content
that people have and by our Terms of
Service we make sure that you know
people have rights to that content part
of Plex past and I was like you've
actually somewhat become a content
provider because VEVO is a part of that
deal that makes it much easier to get
that something was interesting that
Netflix it said yesterday the claim they
make is whenever Netflix launches in the
country the piracy rate goes down now
obviously very clear like you don't
condone any piracy and you don't know
what people are using but do you feel
that there's an interest as you're going
forward to kind of become a content
provider anyways you're performing in a
sense that might yeah legitimate like
the libraries in the content you feel
responsibility for that the way I'll
answer that is kind of thinking big
picture this is not like something that
we're about to release in the next you
know three or four months but I think
the way we view the world is will we be
a content provider will we own content
or license content and I don't know if
that's the direction we'll go what we do
want to make sure is that people can
always come to one beautiful consistent
app on whichever device they're on that
app knows who they are knows what their
preferences are the organization is the
same whether they're on their iPhone or
their xbox or their you know Roku or
Apple TV and I should be able to get you
to the continent you want right you
should not have to go to all these
different silos and you know try and
figure out like gosh I want to see this
movie but I don't know where I can find
it right we should be able to do that so
I think over time whether it's us
linking you deep linking you into
services like Netflix or Hulu or HBO or
us having some content deal we want to
make sure that you can come to one place
and get all that content great well Kate
