I'm here with a Chromebook pixel to
doing Chromebook pixel two things I've
got a bunch of tabs open in Chrome
running Chrome OS of course I've got a
touchscreen here but what's special
about this Chromebook but what soon
gonna be special about all Chromebooks
is they also run full Android apps
natively right into a bunch of windows
here I want to show you how it looks so
here as I said we are inside a Chrome
browser but in addition to Chrome
browsers we have Android apps so here is
Photoshop Express I have a photo of my
good friend Nilay Patel and we can edit
it here this is all happening locally
this is a local image and it's using an
Android app and then I can save it and
now I can just switch to word and this
is the version of word that Microsoft
makes for Android they didn't customize
it for this thing it's just a straight
Android version of word and we can't go
ahead and insert that photo that we just
saved Photoshop right here and there it
is it's in my word document and if I'm
even more excited about it I want to
share this thing I can click the share
button and this is the actual Android
share thing that you're used to on
Android but they've integrated it into
Chrome's interface so it feels really
native so I can just go to this email
here and I can send it out to somebody
which is pretty exciting so in addition
to that there's also like basically any
app that you install on your phone will
work here it's got the full Google Play
Store and it syncs up your apps with
your phone so we can all tab through
different apps we can also even if you'd
like play a game this is using a touch
screen but you could imagine that if the
developer just took a little while to
work on this they could add keyboard
support for this thing
as you can see this is like really
responsive and it looks really really
good and that's because this is not
running in an emulator this is a full
Android device that has the full power
of the processor and the RAM behind it
which is really impressive and then one
last thing I want to show is we've got
these Android apps open but we've also
got Chrome open and they're actually
windowed so you can with Android n
resize your windows move them around it
all just feels like it's all one
operating system even though some of
them are going to be Android apps and
some of them are going to be chrome tabs
so that's it we are still really early
with Android apps on Chrome OS it's
coming to the developer channel in early
June and then it'll hit the beta Channel
after that and then it'll get released
to everybody later on this year so while
it's a little bit not super ready for
everybody to use now I am super duper
impressed with what I've seen so far the
apps are really fast really responsive
and really well integrated in Chrome OS
you should be excited</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
