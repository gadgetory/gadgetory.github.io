together the boys are back in town where
we're reunited and it feels so good stay
tuned for the Virgin Mobile show hi I'm
dieter bohn have a lot 7 i'm chris
sigler and we're back together the three
anchors of the show it is episode 10
that we could July thirtieth the Virgin
Mobile show and I am in my apartment
because there is insane construction at
the verge West offices that I thought
would be done by one o'clock pacific
turns out not done I considered bribing
them to go away so that didn't happen so
here I am at my apartment lounging it
feels really good actually just kind of
leaning back chillin elaborate let's be
honest I think that that calling it the
verge west office is kind of
understating it's more of a verge west
campus it's like you know it's it's the
size of like an apple headquarters kind
of situation it's taking up an entire
city block it's the size of apples
headquarters at Apple's founding in the
garage yes that's the skies okay yeah
okay fair enough fair enough so here's
my question for you guys we haven't been
together in what three weeks now I think
is that right ferry awaits yeah three
weeks oh really River oh yeah are we
gonna be is this gonna yes it's gonna be
like an unmitigated disaster are we
gonna pull this together it's gonna be a
disaster I do you expect us to interrupt
one another all the time but then that's
kind of profit of course it is I am
before we start talking about actual
news that happen in last week which I
didn't read any of cuz I was on vacation
i just want to point out that there is
something like right outside the camera
view right now that i really want to
show you but I can't leave it at that
I'm gonna letter our listeners uh
stew on that for a little while I want
to wear something I'm not wearing pants
actually no um it's uh i can't i can't
tell you i'm not gonna give you any
hints whatsoever there is there is
something that is right outside of the
camera view that I really want to show
you but I can't that's all I'm gonna say
but but you will you will see something
on it on the site within the next few
days well speaking of things that are
out of camera view I guarantee you at
some point in the in the course of this
podcast my cat is going to come and ruin
everything the camera is precariously
balanced on a box which is precariously
balanced on an ottoman and my microphone
is just sort of sitting here like it's
going to be a catastrophe just be ready
um do you take your cat to the office
ever no no she uh she's just fine
staying here actually she's a good cat
very quiet but would not hansi going to
the album well she's had to go to the
bed a lot lately and so anytime she like
thinks she's gonna be traveling she gets
really snarly oh yeah I know the type
I'll be got 4 news I I was good try and
transition but there's no transition for
this uh so apparently the next iPhone is
gonna be announced on September 12
sounds about right I mean that's the
time of year I was expecting right well
everybody was expecting October right
Ella september-october same difference
they're both everybody didn't know yes
so whatever you expected was based on
basically nothing yeah so I mean the
news broke on I'm or her neighborhood
she had it then we've heard from sources
confirming it presumably it's the eye to
eye phone possibly it's the the ipad
mini and going along with that we've got
a you know more purported case leaks
that are more of the same this this look
with the like the metal middle on the
back and then the two glass pieces above
on the top and the bottom I mean part of
me wants to say that this is not it that
it's like we're being deked out
like you know meant to throw us off so
not really and part of you just you know
feeling like iOS 6 is not the Great Leap
Forward that I was hoping for feels like
this next iPhone is not going to be a
huge crazy change in design and so I'm
like I'm equal parts just straight up
believing it partially because it's not
that exciting looking uh well I have no
I'm of two minds on this I I'm getting
really tired as great as the original
iphone 4 design was I'm getting kind of
tired of it at this point but if you
think about it in terms of a macbook
life cycle design life cycle I I can
totally believe that that the thing
would look basically the same as it as a
4 or 4s right sure there's just not a
longer cycle of keeping it that they
settle on this design as we'll talk
about a little bit it's one of the
designs they've sort of liked for a long
time and like they'd have like no
intention of radically changing it so in
four or five years we'll be looking at
you know the iPhone 10 that looks
basically at with the same design
language as the iphone 4 is that the
world you think we live in yeah it
doesn't necessarily need to change
hardware design in phones first of all
has been uses become much more limited
in terms of what you can do because of
the fact though we've been talking about
for such a long time that it's all
touchscreen terminated you know so
previously you could fit around where
you put your buttons or he had buttons
the way that Nucky used to do and it was
a lot of versatility with what you could
do nowadays just like here's a rectangle
I mean this is probably are not
discussing at the apple vs samsung
lawsuit is going on right now one of the
things that Samsung mentioned in its
disclosures was that people want
rectangles well people of course duty
because that's what touchscreen devices
are there just rectangles and like the
go around the rectangle is to just
reduce the bezel reduce the extraneous
beds and just focus on the content and
focus on the device so first of all you
don't really have much freedom with what
you can do
but also i do want to mention something
that we had to kind of a like the
internal friend here on the verge we're
all of us for every isn't like nobody he
said okay let's just sit and speculate
about the new iphone design whatever
reason you just kind of organically grew
and everybody decided to pitch in with a
theories about Apple strategy and how it
was being designed what was going to
happen and is this perpetually leaked
iphone 5 design the one that were
actually going to see and i was going to
cite Billy Davies who's a I'm sorry
Billy Davies this is how sorry abilities
I so sorry to delay is one of our video
my strobes and his point is so good that
i'm just going to you know quote it and
what he said was that apple's goal isn't
to sell iphone 5s isn't to sell millions
of iphone 5s apples go is just so more
and more iphones right and this is why
we're seeing the ipad not be named the
ipad 3 is just been named the ipad most
of us are anticipating the iphone 5 to
also just become the iphone no extra
branning be beyond it yeah you know
we've seen that Apple do that again
going back to its laptop range you know
it's been macbook pro and when people
have to reveal my produce a macbook pro
2011 macbook pro 2012 macbook pro 2013
and apple iterates on the things that it
can iterate on and this is another point
right now you're in a particular spot in
terms of processors in terms of battery
technology in terms of display
technology where you can't really make
any massive leaps like maybe two three
years ago you could you know take off
three four five millimeters of the
thickness of your device you know when
the iphone 4 was first introduced that
was also a year when every other
manufacturer was really just shaving of
thickness from the devices i don't think
many are doing that right now we kind of
reach the plateau in terms of those
hardware innovations and improvements
and I mean real big redesigns Mike
with you know arm a 15 chips next year
assuming they're extremely efficient
power efficient and assuming that Apple
can fit batteries into an ever thinner
space so you know my put my personal
perspective is that the iPhone 5 or the
next-generation iphone leaks that would
be C are exactly what we're going to see
an alligator 4 inch device very much
designed like the old one and I so
forget somebody did a comparison where
they looked at the curvature on the side
of the iOS icons and the curvature on
the side of the iphone and that was the
same so apples attention to detail
extends to how the side of the front of
the iphone is curved and I don't think
that Apple is ever going to change that
because some neat feature it's a
distinguishing feature it's one that
continued from the 3gs to the for design
as far as I can tell and remember um so
really Apple can't do too much in terms
of redesigning the phone and looking at
the sales out of hand up already needs
to do too much at least not yet yeah so
many I mean he go Ahead's how many of
the variables are are fixed now right
there there was a period there was a
solid decade where like the quote
unquote winning form factor wasn't
established the technology wasn't there
and all the components and we've gotten
to the point now where you know you
can't go with a bigger display the
Galaxy Note takes that title and we're
not gonna see anything any bigger than
that because hands aren't that large um
we're gonna see movement and processors
of course that's gonna make the devices
faster but that's not something that's
physically distinguishing and to your
point phul that devices can't get that
much thinner we don't need them to you
know Samsung already took that title
what was in 2004-2005 2006 and with that
was the X 8 20 I think we've actually
talked about on the show but is it you
know it was 5 point something
millimeters it was just absurdly thin it
was too thin um so you know I think
we're gonna see that stable isomer
between six and a half and eight and a
half millimeters what you know what else
can you do it
that it but everything what we hang on
that I feel like this this conversation
like well there's nothing there they're
stuck there in a corner there's no way
that they can get themselves out of the
design it's its iconic and it can never
change again like no that's the Jonah no
modern no no let me finish yeah that's
the challenge of modern design is to
take something that feels that is
familiar and known and has never changed
and using a new technology or new
materials or just you know something
unique on it to make it feel new and
iconic again without just being like a
gimmicky change and you know we see
certain android phones do this right i
mean you know take the design language
of the the galaxy series its iterated
but it feels a little different i think
HTC did with the 1x you would you could
argue that these same design constraints
about get it really thin have a camera
on the back have a big black box on the
front you know they're the same designs
the stories of a chair it's got to be on
the floor it's got to have arms at a
back at a seat but you know it's
possible to have millions of iterations
on that some of which feel like they're
essential some of which feel like
they've always been around but they
those got designed right and so I think
that it kind of is a cop-out to say that
Apple should just they can't design away
from this look that they have currently
that the iphone always has to look the
way it does it's possible for a design
geez yeah I've to make something feel
fresh and new yet within these design
constraints that's the whole point of
design well they uh yeah and that's
exactly the point I was trying to make
which is that the Devils in the details
all these products I do think I your
point is taken on the chair analogy but
I do think that it is a unique the
smartphone is a very unique challenge
for industrial designers globally
because one entire surface of the phone
is already squared away it's a big black
rectangle and there's there's nothing
that you can do with that full surface
right it has to come in the design of
the edges optimally you want to minimize
the bezel around that that that surface
so any design details that you put there
are kind of like cop-outs to the
ultimate goal
rid of that bezel entirely so you know
what that I back I'm finding that the
bezel on the galaxy s3 is too thin when
I'm holding it um I will hit with the
the FATA my thumb the button in the
corner like every couple of days it's
super annoying like I've deleted emails
I'm like ah because I had that I was
holding it I am I don't one pink no I I
I may have experienced that once once or
twice and I don't disagree that this was
remember we talked about this I think
with the the nexus 7 right because a
Duarte is whole thing was that he
claimed that the bezel was intentional I
wish it you know I can see the argument
but it's also a great cop-out for OE you
know we were minimizing costs or this
thing was already designed by a sous by
the time we got our hands on it so you
know but but i can see that argument
sure let me just raise a quick point
here and to interject and say the data's
chair analogy is absolutely terrible and
just absolutely terrible because I wish
you done after I should done a fair bit
of research into chairs and those are
some of the most sophisticated things
for design and there are so many things
I mean it's kind of like think about
what chairs being designed for their
being designed to accommodate your spine
which is just about the most complex
construction a complex bone construction
in the human body I mean whatever I say
about complexity of the spine people
going to correct me and say the brain is
more complex or something else more
complex anyway the point is there are so
many moving parts in the spine there's
so many muscles are so many things to
accommodate and I mean the thing that we
know and defender every piece of
research shows is that sitting down is
unhealthy for is bad for you so when
you're designing a chair what you're
actually doing is trying to is
essentially a form of damage limitation
and there's lumbar support and this
upper back supports and do you have a
neck rest do you not have a neck rest we
I mean you know some like you need a
chair for when you're leaning back you
need a chap when you're sitting up and
typing there they're just way too much
variety and diversity and chair design
see I wait to meet you think and
attachments that you can step on you
know it's more complicated than the
human spine the human heart and that's
what a phone needs to appeal to is it I
mean I'm curious about that was the
cheesiest thing that was the cheesiest
thing sir were uttered on this show yes
I've really put the collection this is
actually think about it it is a high she
complicated or is it simple I don't know
I well it's got four chambers which is
pretty I mean I think some hearts are
just like one chamber right does have
four chambers it is a quad-core device
you might say as beautiful actually
human female uncrate architecture thank
you yeah this is going down okay as long
as we're talking about iphone design we
should get into this stuff from the the
Samsung vs apple case so yeah this was
talked about on the verge cast so I
don't want to get too far into it but in
the discovery Samsung you know had a
whole bunch of documents from Apple that
were images and drawings and like
pictures of a whole bunch of like design
experiments and prototypes that were
rejected for the iphone and some of them
look pretty crazy like there's this you
know this thing that referring to is a
Battlestar Galactica one that's got you
know cornered off edges that you know
looks quite similar to the you know the
the droid razr language a little bit
there's the stuff that's based on
basically the the ipod mini that's got
rounded edges and flat top and bottom I
mean and then there's the there's the
the sony one that actually doesn't the
joni one which actually doesn't look all
that far off from what we've got with
the iphone 4 i mean it's it's
interesting that what we have landed on
with the iphone 4 is something that
Apple has sort of been had bouncing
around in their head for really long
time and for me it's instructive like
when the iphone 4 first came out and the
initial reaction from everybody before
they actually saw it and held it was
kind of like right remember you know
when gizmodo had the leaks and it just
it didn't look that great but then it
you know it finally became
the iphone 4 and everybody you know
loved it or most people loved it but the
initial pictures of it didn't look so
good and my sense is like Apple had sort
of like had that version of the iphone
like deep in their four chambered hearts
from very early on and so when they were
finally able to put it out there they're
really like personally invested and
excited in that particular design and I
think that it hurt them that much more
when their ended up being antenna
problems because they genuinely believe
like that that iphone was the version of
the iphone that they wanted to make from
the beginning yeah the true with I'm
sure that's true with every every
product in Apple's line i would guess
that they're they're planning several
generations out at any given time so i
can't say I'm surprised but it's still
really interesting to see something that
close to the production iphone 4 back in
2006 yeah the thing I was going to
mention is just that I like the
revelation of all of these prototypes
because it does show us that Apple is to
use a flawed and energy immortal company
because a lot of the time and plenty of
people might just you know look at
Apple's track record and the successes
have to pretty much every product and
just think well these guys can't do any
wrong whereas they are company just like
everybody else they do you have setbacks
did you have designs that don't work out
just today I saw this already on this
website on the Internet the verge about
Johnny I've and he was saying the apple
almost share with the iphone entirely
because it was too complex or too
complicated and so there's a whole
there's a whole bunch of moving parts
behind the scenes and the only reason
why apple looks so smooth and so
flawless in its execution is because it
keeps such a tight little secrecy so
when an apple device or an apple design
doesn't work out it's testing is done
this sub secret that nobody actually
knows about it and nobody actually knows
about the failures behind the scenes so
so I like these revelations because it
kind of give us a glimpse behind the
veil or the Iron Curtain or whatever
fanciful way what put it well yeah I
mean a lot of companies are much more
open with you know we tried this we
tried that or think about this that they
like they try and share their thinking
but you know Apple wants us to think
their products sort of comes sweet
generous you know just sort of out of
the the brain of Johnny I've like you
know like Athena coming out of Zeus
anyway and it's it's nice you know
obviously everybody knows that that's
not actually how it works that every
design iterations but I totally agree
with you that it's nice to see the stuff
they threw away relative to the stuff
they actually release yeah I don't know
it's already encourages that image yeah
as far as its bearing on the case I mean
we'll have to see you know we've got
brian bishop there every day live at the
courtroom there's apples opening
arguments got made today you should go
read that i haven't had a chance to look
at it so it would be stupid of me to try
and talk about it too much but we do
know i mean it's a really great article
from matt makari and i'm sure Neal I
helped out like showing what the two
sides are trying to prove to each other
and without getting you know too far
into to lawsuit talk I mean it basically
comes down to a handful of patents on
both sides and and to me the core issues
you know was the the article I wrote
which was you know all this stuff coming
out of Samsung looked like they were
they were so focused on beating Apple
that like did it cross the line into
actually copying like they they're beat
Apple strategy was known internally as
the beat Apple strategy like I I knew
that Samsung competed with apple and I
knew that they were like you know kind
of obsessed with Apple but like actually
seeing the evidence in the documents of
you know just how much focusing on
making sure they get ahead of apple
instead of just winning in the mobile
industry in general is really
interesting like what Samsung isn't
going to beat up an HTC and Sony or
Nokia Samsung is going to beat up on
Apple well but the funny thing to me is
that as obsessed as they have been with
beating Apple specifically their the
actual execution of that strategy is
hilariously wrong you know I mean you
can argue that that the
galaxy s and some of these other Samsung
devices bear more than a passing
resemblance to the iphone but all of the
details surrounding the galaxy s and the
galaxy series as a whole have nothing to
do with the way Apple does business
right and we're only now in 2012 string
to see some small hints of that with
like you know the fact that there that
Samsung insisted on the same ID for
every release of the galaxy s3 which is
actually in the court documents you can
see where they made that call last year
but but there's so much about what
Samsung does everything that Samsung
does their entire business that it bears
no resemblance to to the way Apple does
business whatsoever can I just say that
this this joni iphone with the the jog
dial on the side of it oh man i would
love that like bring back the jog dial
get rid of stupid volume buttons give me
a jog dial I'd be so happy I mean that's
not a Jagran tell is it that's a
three-and-a-half millimeter that's the
three and a millimeter jack isn't well
it's it's not a jog dial like a sideways
jog dial but it is like a rotating dial
on the soil is it I thought that was a
jack know something so maybe I'm i think
this jug house i had one of those in my
rio 500 mp3 player about a decade and a
half ago that is it i mean t actually
you probably just isn't as convenience
buttons when you're totally honest with
yourself but it just feels cooler Buenos
tolle emil I mean what yeah the thing is
they went to the trackball yeah but
seriously though if you if you look at
how many bad average and nondescript
designs were seen smart phones these
days would it really you know do so much
harm to anyone one company's reputation
if they just came out with a crazy
freaky phone they had a jog dial ahead
elusive like old-school things attached
to it so nokia used to do that all the
time right like sony music memories you
thousands yeah yeah that had a job it
has a drug I'll
and it had the flip down microphone
nothing was so badass I had that I I had
that phone and I loved it I had it on
sprint or yeah peace yes as it was
thought at the time when I was in
college but the Nokia in the mid-2000s
went on this terror were they were
releasing just all these insane phones
that you know for any other company in
the world that never would have made it
out of a you know a design study but I
think Nokia you know this was in their
heyday they were you know they had cash
coming out their ears here like what the
hell will throw this out there and see
what happens and i remembered i think
that the first UMTS device they released
but not mistaken i'm probably completely
wrong on this but i think that it was
that that weird like a teardrop shaped
phone where the screen and the screen
was at a 45 degree angle and the on
either side there were like five digits
from the from the numeric keypad it was
insane and you know they did that that
on the 3600 they did the circular
numeric keypad they had the UM that
lipstick case shape phone they were they
were doing all sorts of crazy things and
would be great to see i mean i think now
more than ever we need industrial
designers to really like focus on doing
crazy stuff with these devices because
they're starting to look really plain
and that's I mean that's probably the
main reason why i love the Lumia so much
is because they've they've kind of you
know stuck your neck out there a little
bit and done some cool things both with
colors and with the with materials so
hopefully we'll see so any act recently
Apple used the Lumia as an example of
how not to copy Apple I remember if this
was the samsung case in the US or where
it was but it was on the side a few
weeks ago which I thought was great and
hilarious you know because even Apple
recognizes that the Lumia is a
completely different looking fo ya know
I actually have been using the linear
design as an example as you call it did
n9 design because the n9 was the first
one to come out with it but I still use
it as an example of a good desired and
distinctive design to get it with phones
um and anything that I always say
when it comes down to designing things
is that the good ones just seem obvious
like well of course you're gonna do like
that like of course you're gonna curve
that bit of course you're gonna use this
material I know with apple I always
thought looking at the macbook pro se
two years ago listen Oh three years ago
in fact 2009 I was looking at it and at
a time was one of the thinnest laptops
you could buy and you know it's one of
the thinnest is one of the longest
battery lives it's pretty durable strong
great display etc etc and I'm looking at
him looking at I'm thinking how on earth
do you improve on this it is kind of
like the situation we have with the
iphone 4 to wonder d to disagrees is the
case you know how do you improve it I me
with the iphone 4 is kind of easy you
get rid of all that fragile glass which
seems to break all the time but if in
apple's perspective and in a lot of
people's perspective the iphone 4 design
is indeed iconic and isn't the
superlative then the way to improve on
it is in very small iterative steps such
as with the retina macbook pro but again
in order to make those steps the retina
macbook pro needed the new display it
needed only SSDs it needed to get rid of
the optical drive so it's still the case
that hardware design is driven by what
you can actually fit inside the machine
itself like three years ago you could
really get away with your premier laptop
being one without an optical disc drive
now you can definitely get away so I
mean the rumors that the the new iPhones
gonna have a larger screen right part of
me wonders of Apple genuinely didn't
want to do that that they were happy
with 3.5 but they felt forced to do it
not by the market pressure of other big
phones but they just flat-out needed a
bigger battery and so they had to go
with the bigger screen in order to keep
it thin and that's that's the whole
explanation of why there's going to be a
bigger screen on the the next iPhone I
think that's possible but and I know
Vlad's gonna agree with me I think that
four inches I still think that four
inches in many ways is the sweet spot
for smartphones and yes
and it's a great compromise size between
the 3.5 and the 4.3 / 4.5 / 4 between
seven and eight no the absolutely four
inches is a sweet spot I mean I'll
tolerate a 4.3 inch phone before inches
is where it it just becomes something
that doesn't feel like a chore when
you're walking around with it whereas
with me nowadays but when i leave the
house if i'm using something like the 1x
galaxy nexus galaxy is free you know
name any one of those 4.6 and above
devices I have to think long and hard
whether I actually need the phone with
me it's like if it's the weekend I don't
expect anybody to call me and I don't
need to listen to music because actually
that's the other thing I realize I have
no music listening options other than
phones like I have nothing like if I
don't have a phone this is no way for me
to listen to music on the move that's it
are you saying you go out into the world
without a phone in your pocket dyoods I
do things and and when those thing when
does times happen the only thing I could
think is but if it was like a smaller
phone I will take it but you know I'm
wearing jogging bottoms and I don't feel
like like you know you stick a big oh do
you feel does it make you feel free or
does it make you feel naked or does it
make it make you feel free because you
feel naked oh you actually go with me
yeah just that um I'm quite comfortable
with that I mean I spent two weeks in
the wilderness in Bulgaria I I don't
know how to um you know I had a field
attached with that phone I'm fine
without color well i mean i guess that
is different no you're you're a very
self-confident a man and I am completely
insecure and must have my blankie aka my
connection to the internet with me at
all times IBM wristwatch as well I mean
what what do you really need you phone
that much Bobby Paul one of Paul's
offline pieces I think really hit the
nail on the head with
this whole issue and he's absolutely
right like that the phone is such a
social crutch for getting yourself out
of awkward moments in any situation
right like you know you're on an
elevator with somebody oh I'll check my
email you know so i don't have to engage
this stranger in conversation and you
know you're you're having dinner with
somebody you you know there's a pause in
the conversation normally you would
check your phone I don't have your phone
like things get weird really fast yeah I
actually think things get weird people
start checking their phones cuz then I
just get silently angry but I'm trying
to be tolerant so I don't uh you know uh
scold them for using their phone and I'm
just being patient and let me continue
with their phone and I keep eating and
they keep eating and they continue with
their phone I'm being patient I'm being
a nice guy but then while that's
happening at the back of my mind I'm
also thinking how boring must I be for
this person to continue reading on their
phone and then have the meals it then
I'm just pissed it two and two yeah okay
look let's let's be let's be very clear
email Trump's and eat physical person in
your presence like if I get a new email
that is the highest priority thing going
on at that moment see I versus mater
maybe 12 emails since you know well in
the past like 20 minutes and I haven't
looked at a single one of them I mean
I'm focused and your sis stuffed with
one single email stuff right no but
seriously that if somebody's using a
phone I mean I've been a both sides that
divide right so I can be using my phone
and be having a conversation with
somebody it's no problem I'm
multitasking I'm focused on the
conversation but when you're on the
other side you just feel just shitty
because it's like well your whole
attention like so I mean we know this
right when so much of human
communication is done non vocally right
and in order to pick it up you have to
most of the time see it most of it is
visual and the person is in looking at
you when you're doing that you I mean
what you can meet you're communicating
with only a tiny proportion of
you're available communication tools and
you're just not pleasant and good I
always try to make an effort not to be
using my phone unless i strictly have to
around other people well Vlad I gotta
say in the future you and I are going to
have some very awkward uh one-on-one
dinners I think cuz i can't i can't turn
away from the phone I just can't do it
I'm sorry but nothing personal I assure
you it's nothing personal but if it is
I'm kind of used to it with you I I know
who you are I know what you do um I know
the deals and the millions of dollars
that depend on them so I can kind of
right tolerate you but you're a special
case led blowing my cover as a
international coke dealer there with the
million dollar days come on seriously do
you really expect people to believe that
you actually away on vacation this past
week like you could get away for a whole
week from work I was in South America is
what I was that I'm gonna leave it at
that South America that's all you need
to know anyway did you get it sad day
what did you get a tan in South America
I got a tan in rural Wisconsin actually
Neal eyes home state um it was it was a
good time I I saw a lot of aircraft
actually I'm sorry what we're gonna go
off topic here but let me talk about
this briefly because um every year when
I go to so the event that I go to is eaa
airventure which is one of the largest
air shows in the world it's it's more
than an airshow it's like a whole
aviation convention it's not farnborough
it's like more focused on on home-built
aircraft and general aviation but they
for years they've had a problem a
growing problem with with network
saturation their verizon does okay i
didn't check rising this year but in the
past verizon has done okay both on 1x
and on evdo AT&amp;amp;T flakes out like at
minute one when everybody shows up the
entire network goes down you can't use
data in fact
does this weird thing that I've never
seen anywhere else where you can't even
latch onto HSPA or UMTS it drops you
down to edge and that's still not
functional you can't use edge either but
HSBA doesn't work as doesn't work it was
marginally better this year and that
there were moments there were brief
moment in time where you would be able
to check Twitter or like an email would
roll in and then like if you tried to
send an email would like sit there for
half an hour and then eventually send
and I noticed walking around the airport
that they had set up a few they weren't
cows like traditionally you think of you
know these these events they roll up the
trucks with with the telescoping cell
towers on back that that they you know
they put up and leave there for the
duration of the event they didn't do
that but they had these um bees I mean I
can only describe them as like portable
towers there were literally like uh
50-foot tall cell towers that were that
they brought in and and stuck on the
ground and then surrounded what like
these cement blocks to keep them in
place um and I don't know who they
belong to i don't i don't know if they
were supporting AT&amp;amp;T or a multitude of
carriers but I it did get a little bit
better but here's the thing like as busy
as that event is it is nowhere near the
number of people that would be required
in that size of a space to saturate a
fully built out network so and I don't
pretend to be an engineer but for
goodness sakes like if you're a TNT if
you're any carrier bring it do do the
proper planning for the EAA AirVenture
is not a small event people know about
it all these carriers should know about
and they obviously do because the cows
were on there not the cows but the
purple towers were on site but do the
proper planning you know roughly how
many people are gonna be there bring
enough towers bring enough
infrastructure to make sure that the
network isn't going to go down because i
know that in this case it is not a
spectrum exhaustion issue it is merely a
temporary infrastructure issue so oh you
know they're getting a little bit better
and hopefully in the next few years
you'll catch up maybe they'll start
rolling out LTE there again it's in
rural risk was caught one that rural but
it's in smaller part it's in oshkosh
which is not a very big town
um so yeah hopefully I'll get better
over time but I just want to I at the
very last minute I realized that I had
something mobile related to talk about
with this vacation of mine so I'm glad I
was able to get it out there for you
folks anyway I was actually anticipating
some the sufficient sorry I just I just
wanted to tell you guys that my I just
watched the arrival of the death of my
weekend come through the door i muted
myself some men have delivered like I
would say about 10 square feet of boxes
to be built into ikea furniture it's
taradise it's something I so much fun
we're gonna build a center kitchen
island with it and yeah so ikea so it
should not islands cuz that's like
that's not even furniture that's like
part of the house oh no you would trust
we we spent many many weeks putting
stuff together and planning it together
i'm visiting the store to seeing if it
would work and now I get to build it
it's gonna be awesome and I'm going to
get will see the nice thing about
building ikea furniture is I'm really i
build ikea furniture like I bowl I suck
at it completely sober I'm really good
with like one or maybe two beers in me
and then beyond that I suck at it again
so you got to get right in that sweet
spot yeah I look forward to spending my
entire weekend in that to beer sweet
spot that's exactly what you're talking
about when you say to beer sweet spot
like I'm really sad that I know exactly
what that means but I do uh anyway uh
what were you saying you I think you
were trying to say something earlier I
was disappointed about when you went off
topic when you went up 40 you're going
to enlighten us about airplanes but then
you weren't actually back on topic and
discussed mobile networks which I did I
is it's disappointing from one
perspective but then pleasing from a
whole other perspective if you're really
that interested in learning about my
thoughts on general aviation visit my
personal site where I just wrote a piece
on it um but I am more editorial going
on there yeah I can't we have fast and
the furious in the air
why can't the facts and rios airplanes
they they do that it's called the reno
air races and they're in September I
encourage everybody help I'd love to go
to reno air races i just i'm gonna dream
of mine I just have never made it out
there um alright uh demand something I
suppose I exist anymore what's that you
have a toughness deserve to exist so to
some yeah but just about to try and get
bring us back on topic I was gonna say
the other thing in the documents just
real quick is we finally at leaks of
windows phone 8 devices there's a
samsung Odyssey and Marco I mean yeah
out of Alex hi aunt bottom looks low-end
the high-end one is LTE 4.65 AMOLED
screen and an 8 megapixel camera the
other one's a 4-inch wvga screen of the
5 megapixel camera you know if there was
some secret part of you that hope that
the windows phone 8 devices would like
be radically different we'd be talking
about completely different specs that
live in a completely different world
where I don't know something else would
be on phones that would be like oh my
god like it's not gonna be that world
that you know we're talking about screen
size and you know LTE chipsets and the
the same stuff yeah the green on the
line rage yeah so is there good memories
because I want to take an extended
moment with my rage oh ok I was just
gonna say I think I can't remember which
those two code names is the high-end
device but yeah I advice is greener
Odyssey god is he okay yeah i think the
screen the odyssey is literally the same
part as the galaxy s3 screen which good
part so probably mean more power yeah i
mean they both super amoled the both the
4 inch and the four point six inch I
think I was going to say is that the way
this is shaping up is the samsung is
going to essentially replicate HTC
strategy with the 1 series where the
absolute flagship premium stuff
everything good in it device is 4.6 4.7
inches and then the slightly lower end
mid-range device is 4-inch 4.3 inch size
so this is what we're looking at the 4
inch device me okay yes the Super AMOLED
display boosts wvga which is not as good
as getting an average and I sure HD
display I mean I don't need to explain
why that's the case more pixels equals
more loveliness on the display and it
frustrates me it totally frustrates
before the reason just outlines like I'm
convinced and this isn't like I'm
Callistus this is just my preference i'm
convinced that it's just the fact of
ergonomics that for inched 4.4 inch
device really fits and works you know
it's kind to me it's kind of like the
3.9 to 4.3 inches is kind of like seven
inches to 10 inches with tablets it's a
sweet spot all the sweet range let's
call it the sweetie range right for four
factors and if every company outside of
Apple because we know Apple is going to
stick with just one device so that's it
if every company goes for this kind of
mode where the true premiere device is
4.5 four point six inches and then the
mid-range device is four inches in the
actual sweet range that I'm talking
about then eyes are gonna be frustrated
because I'm never gonna have the perfect
phone like I'm gonna want things from
the top end device but then I'm going to
warn the form factor of the mid-range
device and I'm going to continue with
his frustration where I want things from
one place and from another place for a
third place and nobody ever dares to
actually put them together into one
device there was one except so yes is
that Apple Apple is doing that there was
apple and and also the Samsung blaze 4g
which was a relatively high end piece
with a four-inch screen or was it three
point is 5.9 or for something like yeah
but yeah generally speaking you know the
larger you go the higher end the device
yeah and shouldn't be the case that
needs to be actually I just feel like
companies of old shop it's basically
simple is that they overshot with the
side
also I mean to the same time Samsung
with a Super AMOLED technology super
amoled plus yeah the areola actually
this isn't super amoled plus it's it's a
pentile display that they have yeah at
four point 65 um yeah I can kind of see
that getting a super amoled display 4
inches and at 720p is probably tough and
they can't get the pixels that small etc
etc but you know then that's also one of
Samsung's weakness is if you like
something is very strong with sounds
acknowledging but sort of not
particularly versatile you know so if
Samsung can't ship Super AMOLED display
smartphone as a premier smartphone they
seem unwilling to compromise and look
elsewhere if they can't ship one with
the wrong processor and again they seem
more willing to look elsewhere and to
look for alternatives mean they fill in
supply gaps we've seen them do that with
tegra chips and other things where they
force into it well I guess the Windows
Phone welcome Joe coughing kind of okay
yeah take that point away this has some
per ticket but you know when Samsung has
the freedom it just kind of very rigid
in its approach yeah except I see you
know yeah Chris you said that this
screen on the this part the the Super
AMOLED screen on the galaxy s3 is a
really good part and by and large I
agree with you i'm looking at it now but
since i moved to san francisco and i'm
like walking a lot more i'm looking at
my phone a lot more like when i'm
walking which is dangerous and stupid
but there you go at least i'm not
driving and in the Sun I forgot how bad
these screens are in the Sun upon I
didn't go outside when I lived in
sunnyvale like it's it's terrible and
I'm gonna be switching back to the One X
because of it like I can't handle it ya
know that that's a good point you know
what I miss in fact I was just thinking
about this earlier this week remember
back in the ipaq days they use the
transflective displays that were
actually like get her in direct sunlight
then indoors and that technology is just
vaporized and I don't know if it's
because they can't make them thin enough
or what the deal is but if we could go
back to that that would make the
ultimate outdoor device yeah although
come on yes yeah yeah yeah
means there's a recession you want
somebody yeah okay what are the one of
the original TFT color displays unlike
the palm tree or the visor prism like
when you do outside with those devices
it was literally it would just be
straight up black like you literally you
not see a single thing yeah so then
compaq came out the Tia with the the
transflective stuff and blah blah blah
but yeah I'm really tired of like like I
I the pentile doesn't bother me on the
gs3 but the the sunlight visibility I
just can't handle anymore I did I
actually remember that I remember the
first color displays on feature phone
you know back in the day when he was
like one inches in two and a half inch
displays and it's exactly like you say
they're just disgusting deities with
like one degree viewing angles and no
sunlight readability in all of that
garbage and this is this this is
actually cut part of the reason maybe
while we're so fond of monochromatic
phones like if you think back to your
favorite for memories they're not of
that transitional phase where phones had
like two megapixel 3 megapixel cameras
which all stunk to the high heavens and
couldn't be used for anything and had
the very first color displays it's the
generation just before that I cat lease
in my face it is because I remember I
having a couple of monkeys at last time
you know nomadic1 chromatic this place
did their job perfectly well the
batteries lasted for a couple of
lifetime's um everything it just kind of
evolved and reached a nice maturity
level and I were serious that I ever had
that the worst experience ever had on a
color display was with the the sony
ericsson t610 / t 6 16 which was an
awesome phone in almost every
conceivable way it was the first it was
the first um it was the first phone I
own that made me realize that a phone
could be a lot more than just a phone I
think if that makes any sense and and
the industrial design of it was great
but but the screen was so bad I mean
first of all it like he say dieter went
completely black when you went outside
but it
Adam it had the screen had a standby
mode where would the black the back
light would be off but it would show the
the time and like a you know an in
motion pattern but it was worthless
because the screen was not viewable
without the the backlight on so you
couldn't see it and to the icing on the
cake was that the plastic the
transparent plastic over the display was
so soft that it would just get
completely scuffed and scratched in a
matter of weeks of owning the phone so
you have this haze of scratches over the
this display those are already hard
enough to read as it was so it got to
the point where the only time you could
ever do anything with it was indoors
with the backlight on high basically a
shame because the phone is otherwise a
really awesome phone speaking of phones
that are meant to be used indoors near
Wi-Fi sorry that's terrible republic
Wireless is bringing in another round of
users from its wait list and so they've
got a new device or no longer using the
old busted optimus s they've got their
using the Motorola Defy XT the XT 535
which is unfortunately a gingerbread
device but at least it's you know a
little bit newer than what they had
before and they're sticking with the
same pricing which is 19 bucks a month
for unlimited everything and you know
they want you to use Wi-Fi but they did
get rid of the caps when you're back on
falling back on Sprint's data but yeah
it's not like rolled out everywhere
they're still letting beta customers in
and these things are calling waves and
so you know I don't have one I don't
know what it's like to use one but it is
nice to see even if it's just an MVNO
even if it's you know not a huge carrier
somebody trying to be a little bit
disruptive and like they're taking
advantage of that right if you look at
their marketing materials it's like it's
all like oh we're gonna take back
wireless from these evil monopolies blah
blah blah and like I don't know if this
will scale but the fact that there's a
company selling a phone with no contract
for 250 bucks even if it's not the
greatest phone ever and then charging
you 19 bucks a month and just saying we
know you're going to be using Wi-Fi
we're going to aggressively make you use
Wi-Fi whenever we can
that's actually pretty cool like I i'm
kinda I'm kind of intrigued by republic
Wireless in a way that I wasn't when it
was just the optimus s just because like
that not that I walked to use the defy
xt but it's at least like other than the
fact that's running Gingerbread it's not
like a completely you know ancient phone
its relative i agree with you dieter and
I do feel like you guys in the US have
suffered so long and so hard I'm going
to rest of those crazy crazy multi
prices that you pay for your phone
contracts i mean i can't imagine like
twenty dollars a month is or less than
half your lowest price t and otherwise
way less than half yeah i'm paying for
like five gigs or no 2 gigs of data a
piece unlimited text and like 450
minutes or no so 700 minutes or
something shared 42 plans i'm paying
like 140 bucks for that on eighteen t i
think like 70 bucks a pop so like way
less than half but i mean the question
is will it scale like can this company
operate and make money and actually
compete nationwide at scale and you know
don't forget there still an mvno so it's
one thing for an MVNO to offer this kind
of deal it's another thing entirely for
you know a carrier that is actually
responsible for the infrastructure
directly to offer this kind of deal
surely the dream of the dream of
ubiquitous Wi-Fi never really
materialized materialized right there
was this period in the 2000s where
everyone like municipal Wi-Fi was like
the hottest topic and wireless and that
is largely evaporated i I think that AI
mean I love the concept and I love the
company and in particular I love their
their boxes which are I don't know if
they're still doing this with the defy
xt but with the optimist they they
literally took like the regular optimist
box for sprint and turned it inside out
and use that is the box for the phone
which was extremely cool and it was like
kind of a at the system attitude you
know like it conveyed their their whole
attitude as a company right but yeah you
know I thinking of municipal Wi-Fi so
you know I was at the Google Fiber event
not
got another article that I'm you know
I'm trying to get get written for it but
one of the things i said at the event
and they told me after like we you know
Chris you want to know why aren't you
guys just doing municipal Wi-Fi with
google fiber in Kansas City and like
they're focused very focused on like end
consumers but you know how you're a
Wi-Fi network can have like guest access
so you can give internet access but not
let them into you know your main
passworded network they said like two or
three times that we haven't announced
our guest access stuff yet but it's
going to be interesting so like that
something might happen in Kansas City
that's super interesting with regards to
like bigger Wi-Fi networks and guest
access like I could they didn't say this
but I could foresee them like putting
out a standard that's like look every
house in Kansas City is going to have
our network box that's providing Wi-Fi
so it's easy very easy for us to have
somebody be able to jump from network to
network within a house but since we are
supplying the network boxes for this
whole city basically now if everybody
signs up we could have it such Wi-Fi
network to network across houses and
have it be secure like they could
totally pull that off that's that's very
compelling that is very good the one the
one thing I've always wondered is you
know I'm sure there are technical ways
around this but um you know cuz i've
been following phone for a long time you
know and they're trying to do this whole
communal wat i think but i always
wondered uh you know if somebody
attaches to your network and does
something legal i'm thinking mainly like
you know downloads torrance yeah you
know that's tied to your IP so when the
subpoena comes in for the IP who does
that get routed to it gets routed to
your account you're not with isp so i
don't know how how r if that has really
been resolved but that would be my main
concern we could dream what would happen
we can actually as long as speaking
about dreaming about markets if you
haven't we we put this on the front page
i tweeted it with a typo which is
terrible but mr. Nicol has written a
post in the forums about where as
regulation is not about free market
versus big government and he sort of
uses our constant joking about calling
ourselves communists
like starting off point for actually
explaining the market forces that are
going on in the US carrier market and
it's incredibly good and you should go
read it right now it is it is that it is
the most critical acclaim thing from the
past week and quite naturally I haven't
actually had the time to then read it
but it's getting an everybody Latinos
yeah he basically you know explains you
know how saying that the debate saying
it's either you know free market let
companies be free to do their thing
capitalism versus evil big government
regulation is totally a myth like that's
not actually what's happening here and
it's much more complicated than that and
you know gets into the things that are
keeping other startups from breaking
into it and you know the monopsony or
mon up sony but not believe how do you
pronounce that monopsony anyway it's not
as easy to write it yeah i like i like
opsin ii like that's that's the best
whatever the alagappa neon device two
min anyway so anyway that's that's all i
have to say about that um do we want to
talk about the facebook phone zuckerberg
says they're not gonna do it but
Bloomberg says are gonna do some kind of
collaboration with HTC in 2013 I just
heard somebody go Blair I mean it's
absolutely this 2011 is x 2011 all over
again is already living all over again
that this exact same like progression of
rumors has already occurred and I was
occurring again and we're gonna adapt
any other stuff as another child yeah I
mean seriously they're having Facebook
phones there will be Facebook phones
they just have some extra little lick of
integration looking forward to a
facebook phone that is fundamentally
built around Facebook and built around a
facebook centric operating system
something like the Amazon smartphone
which is definitely actually going to
happen chris sigler call that i think
three decades ago i did and dad's not
going to happen in a Facebook garb
facebook is not going to do that no I
came out of the womb in my first words
were
oh yeah um yeah they see HTC cha-cha-cha
2 is what we're looking at that's that's
how this cha-cha-cha cha-cha-cha is that
what its gonna be cha-cha-cha
cha-cha-cha yes yeah bass GC cha-cha-cha
cha-cha-cha I just the edge I know I
just have no vision of a facebook rather
getting into this entire mess of device
production and then iteration and
development and design and and all of
that stuff I mean look at Facebook's
long-term goals and I mean Zuckerberg I
mean he didn't put it in these terms but
facebook wants to be everywhere on
everything right and they want to be the
social layer that is on every device and
Brian if they do get in the market and
they do end up having any level of
success whatsoever it's going to give
all of their newfound competitors a bit
of a pause when it comes to integrating
Facebook into their services because
then there they might be enabling a
competing phone so like for facebook to
get into the phone market in in this
kind of way could be harmful to their
long-term prospects and it becomes more
harmful the more successful it is and so
I just I don't see how it makes sense
right what's like the end md anything is
the motivation for Amazon to have a
smartphone and to have a dedicated
tablet / media consumption device is
because amazon has so much stuff to sell
amazon is a store that's what Amazon
does right it's a content delivery
system anyone's to deliver that content
as quickly and as immediately as
possible to people with facebook it's
it's what is facebook I mean it's a
means of communicating between p1 and
figures everybody appreciates the
importance of Facebook it has that
critical mass of like a trillion people
I believe that's the correct statistic
as of yesterday and everybody just can't
avoid I'm plugging into it like if you
don't have facebook on your phone where
you know whatever sort of manufacturer
software provider you are
you have one of the major check boxes
left and ticked which you know and again
if you look at Google why Google got
into the whole mobile game the reason
Android exists is so Google search could
be a mobile devices the reason chrome
existed so Google search could be on
browsers etc etc etc it's always been
about google search and by extension
google ads which is the real crux of the
issue but you know google search could
be obviated by a better service right a
lot of people are suggesting that
instead of search engine optimization
people should be doing social
optimization now because a lot of people
are finding things on the web by the
social networks rather than via search
engines not as many to justify that
conversation in my opinion but it's our
right a lot of people are going through
social instead of research um but I
thing is you could replace Google you
can't even place Facebook's millions and
millions and millions of users there's
just nobody who comes even close so
everybody needs to have facebook on the
phone and until that changes Facebook is
pretty much no reason to have a phone
and I'm so right yeah you still the same
I mean complete agreement I like it your
your argument is solid Vlad but keep in
mind that virtually everybody in the
mobile business right now is playing
both sides like I can't think of anyone
who isn't playing both sides assuming
the Amazon Amazon smartphone exists I
mean you already mentioned this but you
know they'll be playing both sides
they're already playing both sides with
Kendall Microsoft is playing both sides
between Nokia and it's other OEMs
Google's playing both sides with exes
wine and and other OEMs there is nobody
who isn't playing both sides so I mean
to suggest that that it would be
strategically a bad for facebook to play
both sides i think is probably um I mean
one level you're right but I don't know
i don't i don't think that necessarily
means not going to do it yeah yeah no
I'm not so fair you should make a
suggestion from my perspective I just
don't think it's worth the trouble like
the possible gains Facebook and not as
high as
possible losses and the possible had I
know it's funny it's almost like these
companies just can't help themselves i
mean if if facebook is indeed doing
something again with HTC it and you know
amazon's getting in like it's it's not
that like they like oh yeah we have a
plan to dominate the world with our
phone it's that well phones are really
important and we should do something so
like we can't we can't help but like try
something and make a phone like they
just it just happens it's like oops oh
hey look right now we're making a phone
right yeah i just said yeah these are
not the same companies hey like i would
expect that kind of let's just be part
of that mainstream thinking to me from
more old-school ceos you know and the
guys at the helm of Facebook and Amazon
are now more modern thinking guys you
know at least from what I know I mean
Zuckerberg is young so we can just
assume he's a more modern thinking CEO
it wouldn't just be caught in the same
waves everybody else um well I mean
social network is any indication he's
not very modern and was thinking about
women right same thing had to had to go
there um all right we've said more than
the facebook phone deserves do you guys
want to talk about Samsung or sprint
earnings I mean we talked about Apple
last week Samsung's still making money
off of phones nobody's surprised by this
and Sprint is still like man I remember
when I was working and running like
Windows Phone experts are no I'm sorry
windows mobile experts way back in the
day and like one of the first like the
second time I hit sprint earnings we
started like making a joke about the
sprint Death Watch because they were
like they were so bad and we didn't see
anything in sight and here we are like
five years later and like does anybody
remember a quarter where sprint had
earnings I made you go hey really nice
job guys congrats that's really awesome
like has sprint ever had a quarter where
you you went like oh wow they're like
really come back this is great
everything's looking on the up-and-up
a thumbs up it's always been like you
know like it's always been like yeah
playing this game with postpaid
subscribers and like the the bulk
subscribers I get by selling the MVNOs
and like it it's always been just hard
well I you know anybody on it profitable
quotas right yeah oh yeah yeah back in
the day but I it wouldn't been before I
was closely tracking them I don't know
about you dieter but it's it's been a
long time I mean there may have been a
couple were like they managed to eke out
a profit but i can't i can't remember a
single time where i was like wow sprint
is like they're they have turned around
and they are tracking upwards and I
don't need to wonder about their
financial health and is a board gonna
freak out like it seems like every time
so like well yeah the nextel acquisition
has has widely been cited as one of the
worst strategic moves in modern
corporate history and it may have been
what is ultimately led to Sprint's
current malaise but at this point I
don't know whether a better management
could put sprint where it needs to be or
if it really is a matter of critical
mass of you know subscriber count where
they can get the economies of scale that
they need on the OEM side and if it's a
critical mass in terms of spectrum
availability to roll out the network
they really need to roll out and of
course that gets gets back to the
duopoly questions around 18 T and
Verizon I don't know I don't know if a
better management team could could bail
sprint out better than they're in
they're currently doing yeah you know I
wonder I mean I wonder when the history
of sprint gets written if the the
overarching narrative is going to be
that they just got super overconfident
because they had early wins they you
know they rolled out there they love
saying that the first digital network
they were relatively early with cdma and
evdo and my max so then that exactly
then like well we are really good at
picking winners for wireless networks
and we're really good at getting out
sweet devices that
fanboys go crazy over so you know yeah
of course we're gonna go with wimax yeah
of course we can we can pick up next
tell in their crazy i tend network
because that that's going that's you
know there that thing is taken off like
gangbusters where we can we cut in is
the future yeah and so i just wonder if
like they just sort of I don't know
believed in their own height I don't
baby that's crazy analysis but they have
had you know with wimax and with I den
like two major infrastructure basically
boondoggles and it's just hard to
recover from that yeah yeah and t-mobile
Phillip whom just resigned so it's a
it's a battleground out there you should
you should just cut this this whole
journalistic kershaw and set up our own
network I think you know what we're
doing I'm sure we only need like what a
few hundred billion dollars for Jim via
know yeah but no matter you know dude
what you know what which seat to pitch
should Apple Apple has the money like
nobody else there's no government
already state has actually any money way
dude they all have dead so pitch to
apple and will say what's up your Apple
specific network will do it or make it
happen you have it all wrong Kickstarter
yes we're gonna order going to start a
Kickstarter project by either t-mobile
or sprint or maybe both if we're feeling
crazy I'm into should be cheap enough to
buy as a pet yeah or we will get a disc
with quality together get a discount
actually glad to make this a little bit
more relatable to you what we'll
actually do is we'll start a Kickstarter
project to buy vodafone which in turn
owns fifty percent of verizon so again
you know what we'll we'll have both the
both sides of the Atlantic covered then
okay but but then if we only own fifty
percent of verizon that means we'll have
to deal with some mustachioed CEO and
negotiate with them whereas that if we
take a horizon I want you know at least
like 50.1 percent
that's true that's a fair enough it's a
good point you know is speaking of it we
have different levels in the Kickstarter
project and so like you know the stretch
goal the top level would be taking over
vodafone well you know at like the if we
meet the goal of like you know a
thousand bucks we'll just buy I don't
know and that'll be enough to buy a case
of TNT to put at the base of all
t-mobile's towers to put the network out
of its misery you know like like it's a
course hey you know it was good hey i
want t mobile they're the underdog I
want him to succeed I like t-mobile yeah
I don't like their current I don't like
their current ad campaign but I'll I
yeah I I feel like they're the only like
truly scrappy national carrier express
the little different is your happy
anymore really no I really don't I think
that they're a little bit too stodgy and
weighed down by um legacy assets to feel
as crappy as they need to feel t-mobile
feels genuinely scrappy to me that just
me Rena I've no I have no scientific
basis for saying that that's just that's
just my gut so guys just before we
actually a wrap up today's show and
let's try and do a little segue and say
on the topic of scrappy underdogs sony
and LG are actually out of the top five
phone sellers smart phone service oh
yeah you said he as you stepping up and
on that topic with Sony now being out of
the top five we can is it a limo scrappy
underdog and this past week we saw a
couple of leagues which or of the if I'm
not mistaken the LT 30 and the LT 29
phones from Sony and in terms of actual
industrial design that basically the
same phone but I believe one of them is
four point four inches the other one is
four point six inches but the
encouraging thing and the thing I like
to be happy about them is that all these
phones that are linked out there running
ice cream sandwich and they're using the
on-screen Android bottoms so Sony is the
only company I've seen yet
of all the android oems to just
completely by motorola motorola i was in
the photon q just got got an ounce
that's got the on-screen buttons and a
physical keyboard crazy I stand
corrected if we decide to release any of
those phones in the UK I'll make sure
its pension exams I mean it got make up
with urban is it's it's sad that we have
to acknowledge it as being a new thing
but it's on the other hand is good that
somebody is doing the other screen
buttons exactly as Google designed them
um so you were very very little bezel
because of that around both these phones
it'll say their design is almost
identical like I was actually confused i
was looking and I was like okay one of
these is LT 29 1 is LT 30 but both of
them look pretty much the same but it
one of them is just a little bit bigger
the other the other 29 is actually we
believe it to be the Xperia GX which was
announced land think you were released
over in Japan the good new got a couple
of really nice problems in the
experience also arrest him yeah the SX
is one that I Japanese guys just fell in
love with a rather our guys in Japan cuz
now Japanese but I'll team over there
Japan just love the sx uh it's about
time Sony action brings those things
across the Europe in the US and it seems
to be happening it seems to be and brute
to us and you know since I'm still
considered the experience kind of a
disappointment particularly because it
will ship it what ice cream sandwich you
know those things um there might be some
rays of hope Sony on the horizon yeah
it's it seems like they're making a
genuine commitment to unifying their
product strategy you know which which if
you would ask me uh you know six or even
three months ago I would have said I'm
skeptical if that's going to happen but
I feel like we're seeing some pretty
encouraging synergy there and you know
we might end up seeing them go the same
route as as Samsung in many ways which
as I say that I realized that's not
necessarily a good thing but
yeah the Samsung is really the company
that eclipse sony it to become like be
ubiquitous the electronics brand yeah
we'll see we'll see if they can use
smartphones as one of their major prongs
for that push back into that leadership
role that they've had taken from them I
mean actually today we also saw leak of
an xperia tablet right which looks just
to be a case of the seventy tablet s
still that it still got that folded
magazine look put name is slimmer its
Lena it has Tegra free system on chip on
the inside it's running ice cream
sandwich again I believe I mean oh this
is this a whole bunch of slides that
will lead to covet it on site but it
doesn't look so nice building like dude
another 70 said yeah here's the thing
like it wouldn't be a virgin mobile show
if we didn't mention the Xperia mini pro
so I'm gonna do that right now with the
exception of the Xperia mini pro if
someone were to ask me what does Xperia
mean I would tell them that it's an
English eyes English Anglophile
anglicized Wow anglicized version of the
japanese word for disappointment so like
taking taking xperia and putting it on a
tablet like that's just it's not gonna
work for me how not not interested so
what are you suggesting that they figure
designed really pretty phone so there
was a clear pretty actually no i would i
would be totally 3x10 which was just so
nice and even the xperia s just looks
really good i mean it doesn't feel that
great in the hand but it looks so good
like I I still feel I see if you like
two companies they gave me most excited
terms of phones sony and nokia maybe
that's just because my most useful
youthful and impressionable time with
phones were spent that those guys were
at the zenith and they weren't a peak
but at the same time they have such a
long history of designing things and
doing it so well uh basically have a
pedigree of doing really great designs i
just wanted to continue you know because
the point of course pay is absolutely
spot-on
the current mass markets giant is Samson
and the it's Korean competitors guys
like LG in some Chinese competitors and
you know those south asia southeast
asian countries but we lost something in
that transition away from Japan like I
still feel um may maybe that's unfair to
the new companies but I still feel like
the Japanese companies like Toshiba
Panasonic and Sony just have a higher
standard of quality and quality
assurance in their products and if their
designs that's how I feel so yes
experience but there's there's a higher
standard of like inspiration in the
design that there's a there's a there's
more of a desire to make stuff feel good
and look cool whereas with Samsung
phones I I don't know if I can think of
a single samsung phone or I was like
right I saw it and the first thing I
thought was oh my god that is amazing
looking I have to have a bit like that
happened Peter Xperia phones Peter the
samsung continuum bro oh my god hey I
was there for the game son continual
lodge oh no I remember at the moment
when they were showing it and like them
we all got to go run to do the hands on
the first question was how they do the
second screen and like everybody there
every tech journalists there like pretty
much at the exact same moment oh it uh
it's just one extreme is a young time
you could hear the room just deflate ya
know the audacity I will never forgive
samsung fully for having the audacity to
paint a black stripe over an AMOLED
display I will never get I will never
let them let them have that back oh look
spa though I mean that's gotta give him
that right the the damage is done III
will not I have the continuum I I didn't
buy it but I had to reviewing it for a
while and uh yeah it's just not not a
good device and I think that is you know
it's interesting i would love to have
the full story i don't know if we'll
ever have it in fact I'm pretty sure we
won't but that is the perfect example of
the
relationship between an OEM and a major
US carrier when completely wrong and oh
yeah yeah you would love to excuse the
pun but it's also the perfect example of
Samsung's continuum of their
relationship with with carriers right so
the container was based on the galaxy s
right it was the last two device that's
right it's like that was the apex of
Samsung just doing whatever and they
were a carrier would ask for and even if
the carry didn't ask for the continuum
just like making a million billion
different versions once they kick out
the platform the galaxy s there were how
many phones were based on the galaxy s
how many phones are based on the galaxy
s2 just hundreds of models it feels like
and now they have swung to the other
side and they've got the galaxy s3 on
every carrier in the US with the exact
same design as it is everywhere else in
the world and I really think it'll be
interesting to see if in 6-8 months if
Samsung is going to be able to restrain
itself from creating a million different
variations on this basic platform of the
gs3 I think they're gonna try and I
think it's gonna be really interesting
to see what that does to you know their
market share and the smartphone
ecosystem in general I think they don't
edema to do that we had the red calluses
free just introduced by AT&amp;amp;T over the
weekend ugly yeah but it's still galaxy
s3 like it's not like a continuum or a
skyrocket or and I don't even I don't
want to try and remember all of the
variance of the gs2 in the gs3 because
it'll just hurt my soul but there were
so many of them I mean am I
misremembering am I just like don't have
like no your dear you're absolutely
you're absolutely right but I I think
that they will be able to continue down
the galaxy s3 path of unification for as
long as they maintain their enormous
market share lead and I as long as they
continue to build the galaxy brand in a
positive way if they can do that then
they can they can own the market in the
same way Apple does it's all about power
baby it is I do want to say the
continuum although we were happy and
laughing about it is a really good down
point to end the show with because we
always need a damn
went to end the show I do you feel like
the continuum one of the most
outrageously terrible design decisions
in recent memory is a good one to end on
we will act before we end though Wow
tables turn I usually I'm trying to end
the show I'm glad won't let me now it's
the other way around we have to mention
that we are giving away an HTC One X
Chris what's the story for how people
can enter to win this HTC One X so the
way this works is we have a very tricky
trivia question that you need to answer
you need to send an email the email
addresses in the post go check it out
but you need to answer the question Neil
I once said that he stupidly loved two
phones and you need tell us what those
phones are I don't want some people are
some people are asking for hints and I'm
not going to give you a single hint
because we've already got a number of
correct responses so this is not an
impossible task the answer is out there
you have to go find it also I think the
answer might actually be in our phones
already we might have had a pretty sure
where she had read in the forums about
your favorite old phones and that's
where Neela I admitted his love for one
of them that's also where I admitted my
love for the same phone because
independently before Neil and I had ever
met and embraced and broke down we both
fell in love with a particular phone was
for your name yeah it was prices so this
consciousness Christmas thing that isn't
in the frame would be very mysterious
today we started off a mystery of
finishing mystery yes all right that
ladies and gentlemen is a virgin mobile
show if if you want to follow us on
twitter you can we are communally
collectively at verge i'm at background
chris's at Z power Vlad is that Vlad
savov and you can email us at mobile
show at the verge calm and we'll be back
next week thanks thanks guys all right
guys
uh this is live uh Peter I want to say
it once that's what you gave cut my way
