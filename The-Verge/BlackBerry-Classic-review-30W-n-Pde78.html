nostalgia would you pay 449 bucks for a
real keyboard on your phone blackberry
says that this is primarily a business
phone and maybe that's true but more
than that this is phone as fanservice
this is the blackberry classic the idea
behind the classic is simple and it's
actually kind of respectable create a
phone that's designed to appeal to
hardcore original CrackBerry fans in
every way possible if there's something
you loved about the 2011 BlackBerry Bold
you will almost surely find it here
everything is designed to make diehard
users feel at home it starts with the
hardware which is characterized by the
return of all the buttons blackberry
lever is called the tool belt and it
includes dedicated send and end buttons
a back button a Menu key and an optical
trackpad none of them are actually
necessary they're all functions that
have been replaced by touchscreen
gestures and by touchscreen button and
on blackberry 10 a lot of those gestures
are actually kind of finicky so having
these buttons does speed things up a bit
and then there's that optical trackpad
which is a hilarious Mouse like
throwback that feels completely
vestigial until you figure out you can
use it to do some really neat
multi-select tricks in your inbox then
you find it's useful but it's still
funny and kind of weird but the most
important buttons are on the keyboard
the keyboard is just great it's fast and
clicky and responsive and just plain
satisfying in a way that glass never is
you could get into the minutiae of
whether this variant of the bold or the
curved is a better one but whatever
there's nobody else even bothering to
make keyboards right now so this is as
good as it gets this thing is blackberry
through and through it's easy to hold in
one hand it has a textured back so you
don't drop it and it has a pretty good
but not great 720 by 720 square touch
screen which works fine for email but it
feels weird for basically anything else
it's also pretty heavy thanks to a
pretty big battery you can't replace
that battery but it lasts just a little
bit longer than your average mid-sized
smartphone so that's kind of like your
favorite BlackBerry's - there's one more
thing from yesteryear that you'll find
on the blackberry classic the processor
it's dated and combined with some
software issues that makes a classic
feel a little bit like it's a weird mix
of fast when you're doing email and slow
everywhere else that's a legacy the old
blackberries that I wish I'd left behind
and one more terrible legacy really bad
cameras the 8 megapixel shooter is so
slow that I missed more shots than I
could make the software on the
blackberry classic is kind of all over
the place it's at version 10 point 3.1
and that means a blackberry has spent
the past
a couple of years layering on every
possible feature request from its hard
core keyboard shortcut customers they're
everywhere and though you don't
absolutely need to know all those
shortcuts if you take the time to learn
them you can do all sorts of neat tricks
but even if you don't having a keyboard
around just speeds up other things from
the home screen you can type to bring up
the BlackBerry assistant which is sort
of like Siri but a little bit better in
some ways and you can type at it instead
of talking at it actually you can do
either because who talks anymore
actually I guess some people do and
luckily for them call quality in the
classic is pretty great but back to the
software because at the end of the day
it's just not good enough for anybody
but the hardest of hardcore BlackBerry
fans there are a few good ideas here but
there are also just too many compromises
there's still two different app stores
one for blackberry software and Amazon
for Android software but that means you
won't get the apps you want and even
when you do they're either out-of-date
or they're just painfully slow and buggy
on the blackberry classic BlackBerry
says that this is primarily a business
phone and maybe that's true but more
than that this is phone as fan service
it's by blackberry people for blackberry
people the people who are still cleaning
for dear life to their aging bulb the
classic will let you keep that
CrackBerry death-grip going but honestly
it's probably time to let go
