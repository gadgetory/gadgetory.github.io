CES booth
and this is the verge will robots take
over the world yes and the revolution is
set for a week from Saturday okay I'm
kidding it's this Thursday kidding again
as much as science fiction movies might
make you think we're ready to rule the
world
we still depend on you for everything
power design manufacturing programming a
whole bag of tricks and for every job
that a robot takes over from a human
there are other human jobs created some
would have to build programs supervised
and maintain the amazing machines that
are robots it's a really impressive demo
the interesting thing is the technology
here isn't that new at the rest of CES
we've seen new displays new form factors
but animatronics hasn't changed that
much since Jurassic Park 20 years ago
the thing is it doesn't have to robots
are interesting when they talk you
listen to what they're saying it works
so well that the Kennedy Space Center is
already using Robo fest beam to teach
kids about science just to get the kids
to listen and the thing is it isn't
about technology it's about the art of
it it is a robot and we want to make it
look like a robot we want to want to
know and see how it's actually moving
and how it's working now if we didn't
have that and we tried to make it more
like a human it actually gets to a point
where it gets a bit scary when it looks
too much like a human but not quite and
in the robotics world we call that
uncanny valley
future abouts another example of this
you could do all this with the tablet
bits a lot more compelling there's a
humanoid presence involved people see a
face on a robot and they get the
drawn-in there's something interesting
about and you see it happen at CES
people will be walking by and they'll
just get pulled into the magic of it and
they'll end up spending five minutes
just interacting with the robot yeah
it's very Universal that it's mostly the
motion and the motion off of his arms
his whole body his head and the emotion
you get from his eyes he's we've got big
eyes that can convey a lot of emotion
that's that's where most of human
emotion comes from because of course
when you're talking to someone you're
looking at their right so you have to
have oversized eyes like we have on Robo
thespian and he's also got LEDs on his
cheeks you know he could be Reds is that
gray or green if he's happy so that
emotion that that motion
you don't need language there's no
language barrier every country every
person can relate to it
the big problem for a lot of vendors at
CES is how do I get people to come in
and actually use my product having a
weird humanoid robot solves that in a
really elegant way it doesn't have a
sharp display or a fast processor but
it's got robot pitch and we respond to
that we want to know more in the end
that might say more about us as human
beings than them as machines
