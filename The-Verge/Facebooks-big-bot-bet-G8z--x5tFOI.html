me drop some truth on you gang bots are
the word of the day and you're starting
to see them absolutely everywhere so
let's dig into it what is a bot a BOTS a
piece of software that lets you do
things you type words into it using
natural language the software
understands and then it does something
the companies are already starting to
use this to do everything from customer
service to letting you buy a new pair of
shoes in fact you may have seen a couple
weeks ago when Microsoft unveiled its
new bot platform and it introduced it to
the world using a teenage bot named cave
you could interact with on Twitter
unfortunately paid turned out to be huge
racist the more you interact with it the
worse it got Microsoft was hugely
embarrassed it wasn't exactly the start
to the bot revolution that some of us
had been hoping for but Sasha await a
because there's a new bot maker in town
it's Facebook and this week at the f8
Developer Conference in San Francisco
they told us exactly what they have in
mind we think that you should just be
able to message a business in the same
way you'd message a friend so today
we're launching messenger platform so
you can build box for messenger and it's
a simple platform
it's powered by artificial intelligence
so you can build natural language
services to communicate directly with
people so Facebook's great idea for BOTS
is that they belong inside messenger
I thought we'd add a few of them my
messenger and see how they do so this is
Pancho Pancho is a weather bot or a
weather cache to be more specific and if
you go ahead and ask it what the weather
is apparently it will tell you so you
can see I've said what's the weather and
it is asking me to tell it where I live
what about Bernal Heights that's the
neighborhood I live
what do you mean so I live in Bernal
Heights is it in San Francisco
California totally it it's a response to
how is the weather in Bernal Heights is
may I send you weekday morning weather
up tickets at 8:00 a.m. so I'm not
completely baffled by what's happening
inside of this chat pod all I wanted to
know was the weather in my neighborhood
and it sent me a picture of a cat on a
treadmill and asked me what my New
Year's resolutions are that sounds like
I made up a joke but that was my actual
interaction with this Jap lot good rule
of thumb going forward never ask a cat
the weather let's see what it's like to
order flowers we can do the Barrington
Get Well bear yeah you keep tapping it
because you want to see it and then
nothing happens you can just see a badly
cropped picture of a bear and some sugar
cookies why don't you want the note to
say we'll just go as sorry I cheated on
you with your best friend at your house
in your garage while you were there
celebrating your grandma's 100th
birthday oh now what's my billing
address are I'm just gonna say it this
is a completely exhausted way to order
flowers like I'm actually rather just
call somebody at this point so it's a
cliche when a new technology comes along
to say that it's not ready for primetime
but in the case of BOTS they're really
not even ready for like afternoon
television they're not ready to go on
Ellen show I'd say they're ready for
Adult Swim midnight TV something you
watch when you're a little bit stoned or
drunk and not expecting very much and
that's surprising because BOTS are an
old technology it was 2001 when we were
all adding smarter child to our AOL
Instant Messenger and using it to look
up movie times in the weather and so the
story with Facebook messengers BOTS
really isn't how far they've come
it's how much farther than they have
left to go what's the difference between
a guitar and a fish what
you can't tuna fish and say I told that
joke to my wife and she left me</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
