we're here looking at the amazon cloud
player for iOS it was just released in
the App Store today it's free it's been
available on Android before but now it's
coming to various iOS devices so it
sorts music by what's on your device and
what's in the cloud the app itself looks
basically just like the kindle app it's
got the same kind of dark color scheme
in the same organization and you can see
you can stream music really easily it
takes a few seconds to buffer obviously
but it's a pretty simple thing and you
can get your playlists and your albums
and all kinds of different stuff that
you have stored in the cloud you know
amazon has a huge library of music and
whatever you buy automatically goes into
your cloud account and if you didn't
have one as soon as you buy an mp3 one's
actually created for you now you can't
sign up for an account through the app
itself and you also can't buy music
through the app itself that's probably
done to get around various Apple
restrictions but if you already have an
account and you buy stuff online it'll
show up here virtually immediately you
can download stuff to your device if you
have a sonnet you want available offline
you can really quickly download it to
your voice and then play it locally and
it'll also go into your iTunes library
so like I bought call me maybe through
iTunes and it shows up here
automatically the app it works pretty
well it's really simple you can search
through your music you get all your
playlists and everything it's definitely
the best way we've seen so far to
completely get out of iTunes if you
don't want to buy stuff through apple
and actually want to have a native
device we've seen things like Google
Music but those work in the browser and
it's not quite as good an experience but
this is a true native app and hooks into
Amazon's huge library and if you really
hate itunes and want to get out of it
this is definitely one of the best
systems we've seen and that is the
amazon cloud player for iOS
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
