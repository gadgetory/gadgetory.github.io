here in the blazing heat of Las Vegas
desert to see the 2016 Toyota Prius now
this is an all-new Prius it's just a
refresh as you can tell it's a very
unusual looking car free assistance have
always been a little strange looking but
I think that they've taken it to another
level here and it shows at the front as
a back and on the sides let's take a
closer look
let's start with the back of this car
kind of has a mere I look to it as you
might remember the muri is to it is new
hydrogen car that they're selling in
California and eventually going to sell
the Northeast Corridor now you would
think that that might mean the Toyota
can back off the extreme looks at the
Prius and save those for the muri but
apparently not I mean look at these
taillights look at the back end of this
car it's kind of insane and the
craziness kind of continues on the front
of this car to you have this this almost
angry human look with the knows where
the Toyota logo is you got a mustache
you got a mouth a well-defined mouth and
then you have these really wild eyes
that are these these compound curve
headlamps with with these angles that
shut down it's a really strong look not
necessarily the most attractive car in
the world but you're not going to forget
it you're not going to think this is
anything else but a Prius alright so
let's check out the inside of the car so
the inside of the 2016 Prius might look
a little familiar it's not a lot
different from the outgoing Prius in
that you don't have an instrument
cluster right in front of the driver
it's in the center where you have two
LCD clusters and warning lights and a
clock below you have the navigation
system climate control and then this
really weird placement for the
transmission joystick kind of makes me
want to play a game and then you have
this this white sort of pearl essence
around that's very interesting and very
striking almost reminds me of the first
generation volt down below you have a Qi
charging pad for a phone this is
wireless charging that exactly fits an
iphone 6 plus of course that's not going
to do me a lot of good since the six
plus doesn't support wireless charging
but if it did that would be a perfect
place for it cup holders pretty
comfortable overall next quick look at
the 2016 Prius still a lot of unknowns
we don't have exact fuel economy numbers
Toyota's saying something in the range
of ten percent better than the outgoing
model so a modest improvement not
revolutionary change we don't have exact
pricing and we don't have an exact
availability date although to it is
saying early next year for that there's
also more Prius news worth coming
there's going to be the Eco model the
toyota says is going to have better fuel
economy than this model which is not a
plug-in the one we're looking at here is
not a plug in the old Prius does have a
plug-in model we're not seeing that here
yet so more Prius news in the pipeline
but for now from Las Vegas that's it
with the 2016 Prius</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
