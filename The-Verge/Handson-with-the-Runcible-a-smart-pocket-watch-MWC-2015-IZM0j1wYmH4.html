I'm here with what might be the coolest
thing we see at MWC this is a smart
pocket watch it's made by a company
called mano ohm it's called the runcible
you can see it's got these wood backs to
it so while we're here seeing all these
companies like Samsung and HTC announced
metal and glass phones this is going to
be something that actually has a wood
back they're going to offer options like
ceramic tin copper brass and they will
actually all be able to swap these backs
- the idea here is to pull you a little
bit further away from your smartphone
with this sort of form factor and it's
going to have you know fewer
notifications on the screen I mean it's
obviously a very unique design so
there's a camera right here in the back
of the device they're actually working
on a pretty cool feature for the camera
that'll let you turn the roundtable like
this - to zoom in focus and Mottola also
tells us that the camera that they're
going to have in the consumer version
will be comparable to something like the
iPhone 5 or the iPhone 5s so it actually
should have a pretty good camera and it
will work well in low light and it will
have some pretty great resolution this
is early prototypes that we're seeing
right now but they're going to look
pretty similar to this when they hit the
market later this year so the goal here
is it's going to be charged by the new
USB type-c the reversible USB and that
will actually give mahtim the ability to
let you put different covers you'll be
able to attach keychains and stuff so
they're actually working on designs
where you know leather covers that will
flip over to the top of the device make
it look a little bit more like a
traditional pocket watch so basically in
a just about every corner of this device
I mean it doesn't have any corners but
every corner of this device is going to
do things a little bit differently than
your normal smartphones for example that
on the maps feature they're going to
offer you the ability to take the more
scenic route it's going to bring you to
your destination on a route that's going
to look a little bit nicer and not going
to be maybe the most direct and
utilitarian way to get to where you're
going I mean it's really a very
Victorian looking piece you've got these
watch faces that keep coming up here
this is just a demo
we're looking at right now but you know
it's really built with sort of past
centuries in mind and its really kind of
a cool device it's really comfortable
holding hand very light would be a
little tremor when it hits the market so
the runs of all runs on Firefox OS and
we're told that when it gets released by
the end of the year
Oh cost you just under the price of a
unlocked flagship phone like the iPhone
yeah this is the runcible from mano</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
