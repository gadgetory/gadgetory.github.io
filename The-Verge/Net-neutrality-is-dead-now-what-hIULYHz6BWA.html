The latest FCC order
took effect on June 11th,
clearing the way for carriers to throttle,
prioritize, and generally
mess with your data.
So what's the internet
gonna look like now?
We're probably not gonna see
any big changes right away,
and the changes won't be anything drastic
like blocking websites
or throttling feeds,
but these new rules give the big carriers
a lot more power over what happens online.
And they're already using that power
to make the internet look
a lot more like cable T.V.
The first place this is showing
up is in streaming services.
Right now, if you want to
pay 10 or 15 bucks a month
to watch movies and T.V. on the internet,
you've got a lot of options.
Services try to compete and win us over
with exclusive shows or lower prices
but as the FCC backs off,
we're also starting to
see another kind of deal
that's a lot more troubling.
So here's one example:
AT&amp;amp;T owns DIRECTV and if
you're an AT&amp;amp;T customer,
you can stream DIRECTV video to your phone
without it counting against your data cap.
That's potentially a huge savings
if you're away from wifi for a while.
And there's a similar deal with HBO GO
and also between T-Mobile and Netflix.
Verizon has an entire service called go90
just designed for this.
That sounds great because it's free,
but in the long term,
it lets carriers pick
winners and losers in the streaming game.
And it's just the first
move in that fight.
As the FCC backs off,
carriers could start
slowing down data streams
or adding caps for non-sponsored services,
anything to give their partners an edge.
Their gonna keep pushing
the boundary of what's allowed there
and without clear regulations,
there's no one to push back.
That's good for carrier-owned services
like DIRECTV and Hulu and HBO GO,
big tech companies like YouTube and Amazon
are probably powerful enough
that they'll come out okay,
but if they get in a fight with Verizon,
they could easily see service slowed down.
And if you're an independent service,
it's gonna get harder and harder
to compete with the big players.
We're gonna see similar fights
in streaming music and other big markets
until most of the internet is controlled
by a handful of carriers.
There's also gonna be
a lot more ad tracking.
Back in 2016,
Congress repealed carrier's
data privacy rules,
so the same companies have free rein
to track where you go on the internet
and use that information
to serve you targeted ads.
It's creepy enough when Facebook
and Google do this stuff,
but because carriers control
your internet connection,
their tracking is gonna
be even harder to avoid.
And those same companies
are already buying up
online media outlets and ad-tech
firms to power the network.
AT&amp;amp;T has come right out and
said it wants its ad business
to be every bit as big
as Facebook and Google.
- AT&amp;amp;T has an amazing amount
of data, customer data.
You pair a very formidable ad inventory
with a very formidable about of data,
information on the
customer, viewership data,
all kinds of other information,
and can you create something unique
just from a straight advertising platform
and change how your monetizing content?
We actually believe there's a
strong opportunity to do this.
- And Verizon has the same plans as AT&amp;amp;T.
There's still something
we can do about this
and it starts with voting.
Right now, there's a motion in Congress
that would stop the new
FCC order in its tracks.
If you go to the link in the description,
you can see which members
of the House signed on
and if your Representative
isn't on that list,
you have a chance to vote
them out this November.
There's even more opportunity
at the state level.
California's already passed a state law
to preserve net neutrality
protections there
and similar bills are pending
in New York, Illinois and other states.
Net Neutrality is still really
popular across both parties
and candidates like Beto O'Rourke in Texas
are making it a central part
of their pitch to voters.
- The FCC's decision to end net neutrality
is bad for our country.
- The more those voters
show up at the polls,
the more Congress can do to
keep cable companies in check
and keep the internet we know intact.
Sorry, I'm like, I've got.
So, that's good for
carrier-owned companies, like
blah, blah, blah.
It's ad business to be as goof-ah.
Facebook and Google.
And Verizon has similar plans.
Has the same plans as AT&amp;amp;T.
Anyway.
