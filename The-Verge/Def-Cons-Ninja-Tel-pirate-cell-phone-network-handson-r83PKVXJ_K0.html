at the 2012 ninja badge if you're lucky
enough to get one of 600 of these you're
given one of these cards go to a booth
they will ask for your handle then you
choose your telephone number and I've
been informed that it's a European
market HTC One V got a SIM card in there
this is their custom wrong we've got a
dialer contacts
tdd service in a DEFCON past they took a
door from a telecom van and they brought
it back this year but with an entire van
and the van has been outfitted with what
I can only describe as a local cellular
tower effectively what we've done as a
team is built a code and a mobile device
from the ground up you know Android is
an incredibly sophisticated operating
system and what's so fantastic about it
is its open nature how customizable it
is we thought to ourselves you know why
not take this open customizable
experience and actually create
limitations and focus on a more social
interaction you know around the
conference so you'll see here the theme
of the operating system is focused on
the Yellow Pages and its primary
functionality is within the dialer for
example or contacts or the messaging
service and what we've also tried to do
is not only weave into it a social
aspect but a way that discovery can
happen where people who they don't know
if they don't know one another can start
communicating right away so for example
we've built a network address sync
function so anyone who joins the network
actually you can see everyone else
they're automatically added into the
contact list and what we've been
observing in terms of behaviors you know
random people are just having
conversations talking about really
really interesting things relevant to
the conference another really
interesting example of what we've built
is we're leveraging a really interesting
technology called alljoyn technology
which is runs over Wi-Fi it's something
Qualcomm's created and allows us to do
peer-to-peer communications we actually
created a vending application that
allows you to dynamically provision
sodas or beers out of a vending machine
simply by clicking on this application
as much as we want to limit the
experience we also want to enable people
to hack the experience we
actually built the Android IDE into the
actual device experience so you can
actually generate your own applications
on the fly within the device or 80b into
the device itself and customize and hack
it from the ground up to build this we
actually used a guy named barcode and
some some friends of his Bob and Colleen
these guys are professional fabricators
they're they've worked on some really
awesome projects for movies and stuff
like that in the back we have a rack
inside here we've got some servers and
up here we have radio gear this is an
edit research USRP universal radio
peripheral software video profile and
some other stuff that's getting into a
duplexer that's going to the antenna on
the roof and this this forms the the
entirety of our part of the network the
network itself itself is completely
self-contained you can't call out to the
outside world there's no data service it
is really just voice and SMS we've
basically been planning this for a year
since last Afghanistan we have the first
sit-down meeting it's all because of of
our sponsors and the help we've had from
all people who contributed to this that
we're able to actually do this and give
these phones away and have them share
this experience and being on a cute
little phone network</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
