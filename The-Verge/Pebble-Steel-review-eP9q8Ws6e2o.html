the pebble steel the steel is the newest
version of the pebble smartwatch last
year's Kickstarter darling
the original pebble was the first
SmartWatch worth buying mainly because
it didn't try to do too much it sent
notifications to your wrist and let you
control music playback on your phone and
that was about it
for a hundred fifty bucks the only real
problem with it is that it's you know
kind of Li you chase a band but it's
still was chunky plastic watch the steel
changes all that at least on the outside
for an extra hundred bucks the $250
steel takes those same pebble internals
and dresses them up in a tighter smaller
metal case with your choice of leather
metal bands it's still not perfectly
beautiful but it's far more attractive
and virtually indistinguishable from
regular watch at first glance especially
if you prefer larger funkier timepieces
like I do
here's an Oktay oh I bought in Paris
last year and then pebbles a little
smaller and it's Nixon of mine is a
little smaller than the pebble but it
has a much thicker band and while the
steel is heavier than the original
pebble it's lighter than this
psychokinetic all in all the steel is a
perfectly wearable watch that draws a
very little attention to itself a big
victory for a device you're supposed to
wear all the time
pebble did make two changes the case
that aren't great the power connector
has been revised so you can't use the
one from the original pebble and the
band is now proprietary you can't just
use any old watch band like the original
that's a big drawback but at least
design is open source so replacements
should appear soon in addition to the
new case pebble is also completely
updated the watches software and the
Android and iOS apps that make it all
work there's now a proper App Store to
download and manage apps and watch faces
and pebbles working with some big names
like ESPN Yelp and Foursquare I tried
all these out and the results are a
little mixed well everything works well
I wanted these apps be more front center
kind of like the watch faces for example
while checking in on Foursquare for my
wrist is awesome diving eight button
presses into the menus to access the
check in screen is a little more
cumbersome than just pulling at my phone
these are just the first set of apps
though and the potential is so obviously
there that it's hard to knock them too
much I want to do all these things for
my wrist I just want to do them a little
bit more simply and with the new
software and the App Store coming to the
original pebble as well there's going to
be a lot of incentive to iterate and get
some of these ideas right where the
pebble continues to shine though is the
basics any notification that hits your
lock screen appears like magic on the
Steel's display and that's still so
fundamentally great that it's hard to
complain about these big
ambitions I wish there was a better way
to manage which notifications get sent
to the pebble from iOS right now it's
just kind of everything and there's no
way to deal with the notification if
you're on iOS I'd love to send a quick
reply to an iMessage to my wrist or just
dismiss the notification entirely but
that just can't happen in Apple's
platform the situation is far more
customizable in Android where pebble has
a rich ecosystem of apps but the updated
Android software wasn't ready in time
for this review that's really the whole
story of the pebble steel it's
definitely the SmartWatch for Android
users but it still feels kind of
incomplete on iOS a one-way receiver of
information instead of a true extension
of your phone that's the dream the
question is whether Apple ever let it
come true the pebble steel is far and
away the SmartWatch you should buy if
you're in the market it's much more
focused and useful than competitors like
the Samsung Galaxy gear the meta watch
and actually exists unlike the rumored
products from Apple and Google that's
important it's fun and useful and you'll
probably like it and that's important
too</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
