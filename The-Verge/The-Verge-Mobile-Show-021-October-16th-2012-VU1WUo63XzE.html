that is the first bubble show or so it's
our 21st on your 21st you totally got a
party as so you should you should
totally stay tuned there's a virgin
mobile show i'm dan seifert i'm chris
sigler and to be very clear i am
stone-cold sober just by the fact that
this is the 21st episode of the virginal
show for the week of october 15 2012 I
have to say dieter your your head dan
and I were just talking about this
earlier your head is like enormous it's
like that's really really frightening I
am you know I have a big head but what
can I stay so uh so would you say it was
a big weekend news i would say that it
was bigger than I expected we know that
the end of the month is crazy um and it
seems like it's just gotten started
early so we had lots of nuts remembers
the Nexus the we had the LG sprint got
bought like out of nowhere this week has
been chock full of stuff to talk about
yeah it's you know I don't know what
this leaves for CES we were just talking
about ces a second ago and I get I mean
I got CES is never a big show for mobile
I guess we'll see it start to pick up
again at mwc in late februari but yeah
this is going to be the biggest news
cycle for mobile of the year in the next
three to four weeks I think yeah it's
gonna be pretty insane and it's it seems
like it's already starting what they
wanted to or not coming so why don't we
jump into that the unwanted thing this
is kind of crazy
this supposed LG Nexus device that has
been fully exposed given a complete
revolt review treatment before it's even
been officially announced and that's
that's kind of kind of insane if you ask
me well I yeah it's crazy presently I
mean you know the software apparently is
super buggy and that's no surprise given
this is like a crazy League device but
you know if this does in fact turn out
to be the next what what blows my mind
about it is how much it looks like the
Galaxy Nexus like we expecting it to be
big on the lg optimus G but it looks
like the Samsung it really does well
what's what's kind of funny about that
is the Galaxy Nexus was kind of you know
in the vein of the galaxy s2 at the time
but with a more rounded shape and more
rounded corners and like this is exactly
the kind of the same thing with the the
the optimist and this LG Nexus it's in
the vein of you know the optimus G but
much more rounded and so that it ends up
looking almost exactly like the Galaxy
Nexus I think if you go all the way back
to the nexus s you can tell that there
is a certain aesthetic that Google is
probably asking for from the OEMs that
it's signing up for nexus devices and
and yeah it certainly seems that that's
continuing here yes well I mean I think
it looks fine it I think it certainly
looks better than the Optimus G which
you know is actually actually I've
gotten both here the 18 teen and the
sprint it's actually kind of a squat
square little phone especially compared
to say the Galaxy Nexus or the the the
1x it's sort of you know I'm not going
to call it stumpy but it's it's a little
bit shorter it's a little bit closer I
don't know if it's exactly for my
throughout me and I'm sure it's not but
it's not quite as tall and so that I
think that putting sort of the Nexus
styling on this Hardware would make it
really handsome yeah I mean that the
photos and I mean don't get me wrong
whoever quote-unquote reviewed this
device took some decent photos of it
that that
potentially made it look better than it
actually looks IRL in real life for
those of you who don't follow the
internet lingo but ya know it looks like
a like a pretty attractive device I
don't know I you know I think I
commented last week that my galaxy nexus
feels huge after using an iphone 5 and
I'm not sure I want to phone I like it
just give me a 4 inch neck like give me
a modernized nexus s right you know
exactly and I think if Vlad were here he
would be screaming from the mountains
and agreement with you yes uh you know
it's funny that you mentioned the I hope
I because I feel like every single phone
I've picked up in the past two weeks
since i started using my iphone 5 has
felt like a heavy brick yeah so there's
there's kind of that now as far as the
the hardware of this LG Nexus obviously
it's very pre-release at this point and
you know that it's definitely doesn't
seem like a finalized device but the
hardware more or less seems like it's
kind of in the vein of what it's going
to be and if this thing launches with 8
gigabytes of internal storage I just
can't imagine using that as you know a
Nexus device if you you know load three
games on there you can suck up you know
fifty percent of your your internal
storage right away so I mean I guess
Google could tentatively or
theoretically offer this in multiple
capacities but it seems kind of odd to
me that they're starting at eight
gigabytes eight gigabytes of internal
yeah that's nothing right yeah I'm
concerned about that I'm concerned about
the fact that we haven't seen we saw the
HSPA version but not an LTE supporting
version 9 18 te go through the FCC we
actually got an email from a listener
who was talking about the you know the
rumors that there might be multiple
Nexus devices and you know he's a little
bit worried that what's going to happen
is that you know you're not going to get
your choice of Nexus on your choice of
carrier that you know you're going to
get stuck in a situation where like
verizon will get the HTC nexus and AT&amp;amp;T
will get the LG Nexus and you know
there'll be multiple devices and
multiple carriers but it'll still you're
still going to be stuck in this weird
world where you know you have to
pick a carrier and that totally limits
what phone you can get I could
completely see that happening as cynical
as it sounds I could I could totally see
that happening just you know given the
the incompatibilities between the
networks for LTE service yeah I don't
think that Google or anybody really has
the power to to pull off this coup where
they have all of these Nexus devices
this X number of Nexus devices however
many we end up seeing deployed on all
four national networks in the US the
odds of that happening I think are
practically nil that would be amazing if
it did happen but I'm certainly not
counting on it I'm not that much of an
optimist uh well I mean it's coming soon
and I'll be interested to see if we do
get multiple I mean wasn't there a rumor
that there was a sony device that maybe
it was a Nexus device yeah those
pictures I don't know they're pretty
really yeah those pictures were not did
not have me convinced and we mentioned
in our post that like the screen is not
aligned correctly the bottom of the of
the screen is is I think four pixels
more to the right than the top of the
screen and don't get me wrong if it's
like an early prototype I could
certainly imagine that like the
components are kind of shoddily put
together but still that's that's a red
flag yeah and if you look deep or close
at the back you can see some evidence of
image alterations so it'd be great if
Sony did an X except Nexus phone I think
a lot of people would be really excited
about that but whether the one that we
saw this week or allegedly saw this week
is it I'm not terribly convinced now
what's interesting to me is that we
haven't heard correct me if I'm wrong
I'm probably I probably have no idea
what I'm talking about I don't think
we've heard a single rumor of a samsung
next-generation Samsung Nexus device is
that correct and as and and so I think
what has happened is Samsung is is
feeling very confident about its
position in the Android world right now
and feels like it doesn't necessarily
need Google's help anymore to do what it
wants to do and that has certainly borne
out with the galaxy s
and the s2 before it really in the note
note 2 so I you know makes me wonder if
we're ever going to see a Samsung Nexus
again I feel like the Nexus is sort of
the safe haven for downtrodden OEMs that
want that want to do something cool on
Android and need Google's help and
guidance and you know their their their
muscle to make carriers carry it and
Samsung simply doesn't need that help
anymore they've taken Android and made
it their own and now it's going to be
somebody else's turn in LG certainly I
think falls into the category of
downtrodden Android OEM the LG and you
know HTC as well even though GC has said
some really impressive devices this year
that's still having trouble actually
selling them and and turning a profit on
them so yeah having Google's help behind
it like it did way back when with the
nexus one certainly won't be a bad thing
yeah yeah yeah the next is one I mean
for many people the nexus one is still
like the ultimate Nexus device you know
like if if if the nexus one had a 720p
display and LTE I would probably still
consider carrying it to this day not
never mind it's it's 512 megabytes of
storage yeah it could install any apps
and glossing over that stuff yeah and
the nexus one was pretty great yeah is
is is one of the first android phones
definitely that took a lot of people's
focus off of the iphone as far as you
know a high-end phone that can really
compete and that's what it defined the
Nexus line going forward yeah it hasn't
always fulfilled that I think the Nexus
S was kind of a misstep but the Galaxy
Nexus was a lot better but so hopefully
if we do get four of these or more than
one of these Nexus devices we're not
going to get like a low medium and high
type of thing but we're going to get
high-end versions from all of them all
the manufacturers that participate that
would be kind of great and it's still
we're still gonna have to wait a few
weeks to find out exactly what happens I
think let's uh let's talk about the the
optimus G I reviewed the the sprints and
the 18 key version and I mean really the
most interesting thing is that you know
LG has got a you know a flagship
top-tier phone on a couple of US
carriers instead of just you know
shipping low and mid-range stuff and
that I'm not even admitting that the LG
intuition exists and that assessment but
like they're good the screen is
incredibly good and surprisingly nice i
think its second in the android space
only to the One X in terms of its
viewing angles brightness its color
fidelity I'm really happy with it and
I'm holding up the the sprint version
now which matches very closely to you
know the international hardware with the
exception of a sealed sim card which is
pretty annoying and like it's I keep
saying like it's not the lake prettiest
phone in the world but it's you know
it's fine it's pretty good and then the
lg's thing is they've got trying to get
this to have it on the camera but I can
so the back panel which is glass I think
but it could be Polly in one glass and
another like LG is both some people that
it's not class everybody else that is so
I don't know why they can't just have a
story straight but the deal is is that
it's actually polarized and so if you're
looking at it at an angle it looks like
it's black and then once you get
straight on then you can see that you
know the pattern finish underneath which
reflects the light a certain way so you
get a black slab then you get this Julie
looking thing when you're looking at it
at the right angle which is kind of neat
that that pattern totally reminds me of
the original live wallpaper on the nexus
one with the lace that i mean the the
the squares and then the the different
colors that would shoot horizontally
more yeah that's what it totally just I
mean if when I first saw that that was
like the first thing I thought I can see
that and then the AT&amp;amp;T version is a
little bit wider actually because it's
got like this like curved rail on it and
the deal is that accommodates the sim
card and microsd slot but otherwise
they're basically the same and um it's
so fast it's got this s4 pro processor
from Qualcomm
it's a quad-core device or quad-core
processor and like everything is really
fast except screen rotation which is LG
software's fault which takes basically
you know 20 minutes for the rotate the
screen ok it's like but other than that
like I don't know why that's so terrible
because everything else is really good
although I do need to I spent a long
time talking about this in the review
somebody needs to take a TNT behind the
woodshed and make them stop putting crap
on phones the the amount of like there's
11 like AT&amp;amp;T apps that are crammed onto
this thing I stuck them all on a folder
18t code scanner AT&amp;amp;T family man AT&amp;amp;T
locker AT&amp;amp;T Navigator 18t ready to go
AT&amp;amp;T smart Wi-Fi live TV my ATT messages
YP mobile and device hall on top of that
I since you know just some of the extra
stuff that they did like there's you
know this quick setting thing in the
notification area and like they don't
let you put mobile hotspot in there
really why what's the problem why are
you afraid of a lot in quick settings
that doesn't make any sense oh I can
tell you exactly why they're afraid of
mobile hotspot in quick settings because
they they want to discourage anything
they is it's for this the exact same
reason that they're trying to discourage
people from using facetime over cellular
they're they're deathly afraid as they
should be of their of their glass
network shattering that that's what's
going on here well that stinks so so is
the is the software situation the the
main or only explanation for the
slightly lower score in the eighteen t
version uh yeah i mean the software is
knowing enough that i had to give it a
lower score on the MTT it's just like it
was just too much the other interesting
thing is a tMT's camera is 8 megapixels
wheres princess 13 and I'm much prefer
18 tease camera um I was talking to a
married woman engadget she prefers the
13-megapixel camera
honestly I think the difference is just
like one of like pure ability I think
with both of these cameras you need to
do a little more work and be a little
bit better at taking photos from phone
than you do with say the galaxy s3 or
the iphone so you can get good shots out
of these but you can't just you know
hold the phone up and click something
the way that you can and the other
phones you need to that you need to
spend a little bit more time and in that
sense Sprint's 13-megapixel camera is
much less forgiving of you know my shaky
hands and terminal ability to frame
shots and check the lighting whatever
yeah once you get above eight I I feel
like it's definitely a gimmick thing
like either the carrier or the OEM was
like we just want to have this giant
number on our spec sheet and blow
everyone away and it's it's not I mean
this is an able an age-old argument
right that the fact that when it comes
to cameras particularly camera phone
cameras it's much more about the optics
and about the quality of the sensor than
it is about the the raw pixel count
because you're not going to blow up an
image from your sprint optimus g2 poster
size I mean maybe you are I'm not you
don't know what it'll do man yeah when I
when I think about this argument I you
know I think about you know I've got I
think it's two years old now a canon s95
which I deeply love and I you know I
thought about Lee that we could have
camera phones that hit that quality I
mean let's talk about computer view
right but if you can't get there yet I
think that wow I was so hot in here I
think that you know you should stick
with what works for the majority of
people and right now that's an 8
megapixel sensor yeah heck I take five
if it meant that I had better low-light
sensitivity i would actually be more
than happy to take a 5 megapixel sensor
the problem is that i think that because
eight is widely perceived as the
standard for high-end camera phones
right now you'd have a very difficult
time coming to market with a five in
convincing people that you're not short
changing them on a key spec so I think
you know that that's just a non-starter
um I just want to point out
and nobody's going to have any idea what
I'm talking about but the the NFC logo
on the 18 teen model which I'm assuming
has something to do with Isis um looks
is up and sorry so that this is weird
double end yes and it looks exactly like
the nests the nespresso logo go ahead go
ahead and Google that and again be ready
to agree with me it looks exactly like
it somebody is doing somebody yeah yeah
that's it is so we uh we finally got
price and release date yesterday for a
little spread eighteen t actually need
update through view with thinking
Tinky's information the Gulf 199 on
contract Sprint's releasing on the
eleventh eighteen t is releasing on the
second and why couldn't they just have
said this when they like announced and
made the big releases of the phones at
mobile con like last week what what's
the hold why wait a week at this this
whole thing about we're gonna announce
the phone but not give you official
price and release date I'm tired of it
the one rule it the same thing with the
razr HD HD max um everybody's doing it
lately and you know is is it I'm
starting to think that it's not that
like they can't do it I'm starting to
think that they know that if they don't
do it that we're going to be forced to
write about them again they'll get you
know they'll get it up there once they
announce the price or at least eight in
all of it later that's interesting I
have another theory which I would like
to run by you guys I think that it's a
domino effect created by Windows Phone 8
I think that Microsoft put pressure not
put pressure just flat out said to OEMs
and carriers that they can't talk
specific dates and prices until their
launch event on the twenty-ninth and
then carriers were like well we want to
plan all these other launches of
flagship devices around those windows
phone 8 launches so we just kind of have
to I mean like we we want people to know
about them that we want people know that
we're getting them but we we want some
wiggle room to play with those dates so
they're kind of in a holding pattern
until they can talk dates for the
windows phone 8 gear I would I would
agree with that theory
except that none of this behavior is
terribly new yeah I mean I mean carriers
and manufacturers have been doing this
for a long time yeah well I feel like
it's particularly bad it is as well this
particular this fall has been
particularly frustrating but I think a
lot of that does have to do with the
windows want something is a lot of the
phones that we've covered recently and
have been announced have been windows
phone devices that were just like oh
here's another phone it's coming to
t-mobile can't tell you when can't tell
you how much right so yeah it seems like
it's it's it's been exacerbated but I
don't think any of it is new behavior
necessarily no no yeah i mean this has
been going on for years i just think
that like we've had like what probably
some between five and ten phone
announcements in the past six to eight
weeks that have all had this mysterious
you know pricing and available the
availability to be announced in the
coming weeks at the end and it's just
it's super frustrating not just for us
but for readers who are trying to plan
their purchases and trying to decide
what they want to buy and when and it
just you know i say one more thing about
the optimus G and that is as great as it
is that LG is sort of like come into its
own and found its own identity as far as
Hardware goes in terms of software and
also their launch party at mobile com
they have huge Samsung envy it's a
ridiculous they like their special
features there's there's qslide which
lets you put this alpha and make video
semi-transparent so you can watch video
at the same time or do other stuff in
the u.s. video they've got a think it's
called why screen or something that that
way cracks me up you continue but
obviously I had to say that the camera
watches your eyes just like you know the
Samsung thing so that it will screen
will stay awake while you're looking at
it they have the states you can do stuff
just by tilting the phone instead of
dragging and dropping in like random to
places like moving an icon on the home
screen nobody wants to do that I don't
know why Samsung insists on I'm offering
an option and then LG just does the same
thing they offer again I really wanna
had a feature called el voice now I mean
I I would be shocked if it didn't happen
it's likewise cream is like they looked
at the smart screen feature looked at
its name opened up a thesaurus it was
like we'll call it that yeah I mean
and it's it's like the same exact
feature I mean correct me if I'm wrong
dieter but it's like the same exact
feature right and and it just like I
hate to say this but it just makes LG
terribly feel like a poor man's samsung
think it's like everything is just like
trying to do what Samsung is doing but
it's not really pulling it off as well
right gonna do like this is a good phone
on its own and so this is why it makes
me super excited for the whatever we're
going to call the next Nexus Nexus 4 I
think is one of the rumors I mean it
looks great I think it'll be really good
news LG has managed to put together some
really solid hard worker but this off
this is messed up because these phones
that these two oughta messages are
coming to market uh in in early November
which is right around the time that we
think that this nexus stuff is going to
happen so you're going to have this this
train wreck this collision of two very
different philosophies both LG branded
products and you're going to have this
mix of carriers I mean you know is is
the nexus for whatever it's called going
to be offered on ATT indoor sprint I
would assume it's going to least be
offered on sprint because sprint has
been very very Pro Google going back to
the the nexus one which was canceled at
the last minute but then they ended up
offering the s and the the Galaxy Nexus
and you know they're very tightly
partnered with Google on google wallet
so how is that going to play out what is
the message that they're going to
deliver to customers who are cross
shopping these products I don't know
well I think you have different
customers shopping these products is
what it is and and just like as it's
always been with Nexus devices they're
not huge sellers they're not huge market
share grabbers somebody who's walking
into a carrier store in the mall to buy
their cell phone isn't going to look for
the Nexus on display they're going to
see flashy software features and things
like that and whatever you know the
sales reps are incentivized to sell at
the time so I think I think that you
know if if LG is able to deliver these
without bugs and and
deliver them timely as it seems that
they're there more or less doing they
could sell a good amount of them maybe
even more so than a Nexus device because
the the people that are looking for a
Nexus device are going to be very
different yeah yeah they're going to
have to be very careful about that
messaging in the store in the store
though because you always I mean there's
there there are always two aspects right
there's the PR line there's the official
company line and how this product is
positioned who's being sold to and then
you have the very often very different
message of what the sales rep is
actually saying to the customer in the
store and historically i mean the the
thing that all of these OEMs
particularly microsoft and and their
partners but but everyone has been
fighting for the past couple years on
verizon and AT&amp;amp;T is you know you're
fighting the reps that are saying just
buy this iphone but now you know what
are they going to say just say this is a
purely hypothetical situation but say
that sprint ranges both out miss G and
then also ranges that the nexus 4 which
for all practical purposes looks like a
slightly nicer optimist tree also by LG
and the software like from from like you
know completely uninitiated customers
perspective it just looks like a
different software not better right like
if you put them side by side in the
store you can say oh yeah this nexus
software is obviously better look at you
know you have to use and then make the
call for yourself I just don't know how
they I mean that's a very complicated
question that these carriers have to end
well I think it's funny it goes back to
some of these software features that LG
and Samsung are customizing their their
their phones with a lot of these look
really flashy in the store when a you
know sales rep is demoing a phone and
it's like oh look you can watch a video
and text at the same time they're not
saying that you'll never do that in real
life they're saying look at how cool
that is and you know and and and look
how I can tilt the phone and drag an
icon around and something yeah where as
you know actual features that are usable
in day-to-day use aren't necessarily as
whiz-bang and flashy to someone who's
buying something in the store I think if
you know and it may very well come down
to this if you know sales reps are
incentivized to sell some the optimus G
line more there
show it off more there you show off the
things that it does more in and they're
going to show in a favorable light those
types of things yep that sell the phone
in the store yep nothing else to say so
it's always so so so dieter so dieter
what's what's the final verdict should
should a sprint or AT&amp;amp;T customer
strongly consider buying this phone in
early November no you should wait to see
if you're gonna do this like that's it
and if you're on ATT I think the galaxy
s3 is a slightly better phone unless you
care deeply about not having an AMOLED
screen you know it's slightly faster but
there's not it's not that much faster
there's not that much that takes
advantage of the the processor on this
thing in terms of software so like it's
weird like this is a really good phone
that I'm probably am NOT gonna recommend
any it's it's sad how often we yeah and
it's happening more and more often now
so yeah yeah which is a good thing it
means that they're making better
products but it's also making it much
more difficult for the best products to
bubble to the top and stand up and you
also feel bad I mean you can't help but
feel a little bad for LG because you
know they're trying they're trying to
I'll say this the optimus G is like like
dita was saying the beginning is the
first one of the first that LG is
getting on sprint in a long time as far
as a high-end device but it's also one
of the first high-end devices that the
company is released that's actually
making it to the US market in a timely
fashion yeah the optimus LTE took months
and months and months to get to the US
market the LTE to the same exact thing
the 4x HD I don't think we're seen in
the top in the US market at all and the
you know the view and the intuition that
took nine months to get to the US market
whereas these ones are they're coming
out their high end their still high end
when they get to the US so I think
that's a big step for LG that they've
been able to accomplish that at least
yeah plus at their their launch party of
the the roof of the
hard rock hotel in San Diego they they
put a woman and I mermaid outfit and put
her in the hot tub like I had to go to
this thing I had to go to this thing it
reminds me of it reminds me of life it
reminds me when I tuned in to the the
live stream of the the galaxy note 2
launch event and there was just some
Buster like doing like card tricks and
I'm like what what is with cut these
companies and their non sequiturs at
these like this has nothing to do with
that like why is this happening right
now and I'm sure that the same thing is
going through your mind either like why
is this happening to me right now like
why is there a mermaid in this school
the other the other Samsung anything
that i forgot to mention i'm going to
see if I can get the the audio for us
right now but I have to take my unlock
pattern off the screen in order to do it
so I mean listen listen to this oh oh
man dude dude any yeah that samsung envy
that that is the inspired by nature get
water droplet that everyone is such a
big fan of yeah yeah also makes me want
to I want to pee a little bit so I just
start on the the video of our very own
podcast feed so i could see this thing
that chris mentioned about my giant head
and yeah it's a big giant head between
you two it's really nice to see you in
the studio Chris and this didn't get
mentioned on the show last week so if
you only listen to the audio version of
mobile show you don't know this but dan
has grown an amazing beard in blades
record it's really lush and its really
lunch it's it still needs a little work
I'm still in the you know looks like
he's trying to grow a beard scruff
scruff stage I think no it looks like
the you know I'm a rugged like I might
be a lumberjack kind of like you know
like you don't know my story but like
I'm definitely mysterious and right I
really should have worn some flannel or
but I guess that's a good luck well
thank you oh ok sorry I hadn't mentioned
that and now I have no transition but we
got to talk about softbank basically
whether they bought seventy percent of
sprint defying okay so they're buying a
seventy percent stake and what they're
gonna do is they're gonna form a new
company called new sprint it's going to
all really creative name by the way
that's they could come up with like this
deal is surreal to me like I get that
sprint like straight up knees capital
because they're not building our LTE
network as quickly as they need to right
now in order to stay competitive so like
I get that what I don't get is a
softbank like me I mean I'm not very
smart about Japanese carriers but I mean
is it is you know sprint that good of an
opportunity that they want to drop how
much was it 600 no uh 12 billion yet you
have to wonder why they didn't I mean
I'm assuming that if they had gone to dt
they probably could have like you know
they probably could have talked about a
deal for t-mobile USA yeah and so yeah
you like I'm really curious about the
specifics of the conversation that
occurred between sprint and Softbank and
whether softbank approached anyone else
because I'm totally on board with you
it's an interesting deal and I'm sure
that there are you know softbank is a
company you you know you look at their
comments from the from the press
conference and it's very very clear that
this is a company that really wants to
be recognized as like a global like they
want to be the next vodafone right they
want to have cousins on every continent
and they want to grow aggressively they
joked about like acquiring docomo at
some point which I thought was was funny
um and also like a really like you would
never hear I don't think you would ever
hear an American CEO joke about
acquiring another company like because
they just instantly get arrested by the
SEC like just not allowed to do that so
I thought that was funny but you
it's an interesting deal i'll be very
curious to see where this leads and
it'll you know I mean sprint has been
looking I love Dan Hesse dan has he's a
great guy he's just like I don't know if
he if he's actually an effective CEO or
not but he he certainly he talks like he
doesn't be asked like he doesn't like
he's a very straight talker and I think
that that's a very important quality for
a CEO of a somewhat downtrodden company
to have and I they've they've been in
many cases over the past several years
they've been a victim of circumstance
and of course a victim of the terrible
next I'll acquisition that almost
deep-six the company altogether which
dan has he was not a part of he came in
after that deal was was finalized so
maybe this is just the break that sprint
needed to really finally turn their luck
around for good we'll see yeah I mean it
is a huge influx of cash and there's
been a lot of a lot of analysis and
speculation going on since then since
this was announced or made official I
guess you could say and you know it it
was it's hard to see what sprint was
doing was going to plan to do before as
far as its LTE network rollout a lot of
it seemed to still hinge on clearwire
and you know relying on that that 2.5
gigahertz spectrum and it'll be
interesting to see what sprint does with
this money this newfound wealth that it
has from softbank will it try to pursue
purchasing 700 megahertz licenses which
is essentially buying them from other
carriers that are any on them or is it
going to try and take that 2.5 gigahertz
spectrum that it has access to that
nobody else is really using and spending
the the insane capital needs to turn
that into an actual usable nationwide
network so be interesting to see how
sprint plays us out I think I really
can't comment too much about how this is
going to help softbank because I'm just
not intimately aware of the Japanese
carriers financial situations and things
like that but you know I imagine they
saw sprint as an opportunity to that is
a company that's kind of been down on
its luck but it has been sort of turning
things around but it needed some help so
and I guess off being saw an opportunity
to make some money with it I really
think it's just a prestige thing for
them I really do but I like I said
before I think they're they're hell-bent
on becoming a global brand and sprint
was a really like clear and present
opportunity for them because this was a
company that you know they've kind of
been like looking to be acquire that you
know it's it's readily apparent to
anyone who's been paying any attention
to this for the past probably two two
and a half years that they've they've
been dipping their toe in the
acquisition water it's like they've
definitely been open to discussions with
people so that opportunity was there but
yeah I mean like we were saying before
why they didn't talk to or why they
didn't end up acquiring t-mobile instead
I don't know it's entirely possible they
had those discussions and they ended up
deciding that sprint was the better
value I I don't know I just hope that
sprint is able to use this money
complete to beef up their LTE network
and you know even though 3g network i
would i would really like to see them
compete and get on par with verizon and
AT&amp;amp;T when it comes to having 4G LTE in
the u.s. broadly and deeply with really
good speeds because like I really think
that more competition that space be
great and you know Sprint's overall
strategy of being the nice guy of
offering unlimited data of you know
being a nice guy letting Google exist on
their network it's easy to be that when
you're you know the loser but when you
actually start competing if they can
hang on to that nice guy philosophy I
think really good for the market and
we'll finally get press releases that
have actual dates attached to when the
LTE will be available so that's crazy
talk dan don't don't get all crazy on me
Sam is coming months stuff yeah do I
talk about the galaxy s3 mini didn't we
talk am I am I completely insane or did
we talk about the galaxy s3 mini last
week on the show yeah it was rumored we
didn't have a phone right minh we show
right before the actual announcement the
decks it was the next day and the
announcement fulfilled all of our
concerns it solidified all of our
worries
in that this was going to be a total
disappointment and yet another just
run-of-the-mill mid-range smartphone
that Samsung cranks out seemingly every
other minute and and there's there's
really nothing to get excited about here
which is hugely disappointing because I
think the whole industry was like it's
got a galaxy s3 name in it it's going to
be high powered but it'll still fit in
my hand and you know it's it that's not
the case in the least bit so here's what
I think is going on with this device I I
think that certain very influential
European carriers went to Samsung and
said hey guys we have a lot of customers
who identify with the galaxy s brand and
identify with Samsung and want to own a
galaxy s3 but they're you know they're
not quite their income wise you have
this huge opportunity to range a device
with us that keeps the galaxy s3 name
but it's down spect and you know let's
make this happen and Samsung you know as
usual is like okay well good so I got
all these galaxy s advance parts lying
around yeah yeah so so I you know I
don't think that they hesitate
particularly because this is a somewhat
limited release device I don't think
that they hesitated to recycle the
galaxy s name which is something that
for the at least the past year and a
half or two years they've kind of shied
away from doing they've tried very hard
i think to keep the galaxy s name at
least focused on the high end product
the galaxy is used everywhere like yes
well that's their android brand i think
tom warren actually sent his best he
tweeted out that when samsung has done
is the equivalent of taking an iphone 4
and branding it in iphone 5 mini it's
totally bizarre like this should not be
called an s3 I it's ridiculous right
yeah I mean the only thing that it
shares with it is its general shape
everything else is different as far as
the screen the camera the processor the
internals a front to back are different
and it it doesn't support LTE I would be
shocked if we ever saw this thing in the
US for that reason alone but you know it
might pop up with a variation to carrier
variation that has LTE for
you know fifty or hundred bucks uh with
some weird name that you know yeah yet
another forgettable that's exactly it
like this is going to end up being
called like the galaxy conquest LTE fan
and that might be a real product by the
way I don't know and then it's going to
lunch on sprint and like three people
will buy it and like we might write a
news post about we certainly aren't
going to review it and no one will it
like it will disappear in three months
that is what was happening Samsung is
control you with a girl yeah oh I'm
telling you right now the mega mini mega
mini we yeah we need to make mega happen
that needs to take off wait I I'm
looking up I have a sneaking suspicion
that there is a galaxy con well there's
a victory okay oh there's a android game
called galactic conquest very close yeah
I guess there's no okay so carriers
there's an idea for you gal conquest
I'll bet you there's a Galaxy victory
there is on Sprint Galaxy victory 4g LTE
or something like yes yes there is okay
so conquest is pretty close to victory
anyway um so let's talk a galaxy note 2
on sprint October 25th for 2 99 99 I be
just there it is I what else you hey
what else what what else you want to say
it's common to spread its it's coming to
sprint but so I actually just got my
first opportunity to touch a note to
last week i sat down with t-mobile and
they showed me a note to and like it you
can't appreciate in pictures how
flipping day let's make like it is like
it is hilariously large like well I
don't have it here to show I guess other
phones yeah it's gigantic it like in
pictures it just looks like a galaxy s3
like oh whatever that looks pretty cool
but no it's like it's huge but no do not
be confused yeah this is a monstrous I
mean and that's fine I mean like the
Galaxy Note sold very well I'm sure the
note 2 will as well but don't like don't
buy it thinking that you're getting a
galaxy s3 with like a couple extra
tenths of an inch of screen real
you're not you're getting like a small
tablet yep in fact in glad through you
he's like he aggressively refers to it
as a tablet instead of talking about it
as a phone or a phablet or whatever else
you want to call it yeah right which--
which bothers me to no end because of
the lack of actual tablet apps but I
think I made that point last week so
right why does God ask I'm how it does
have the and it's got snow yeah excuse
me so I snow is hey our question is the
optimist views Penn called an L pen no
it's called the rubber DM ok cuz it
should be called an L it would be great
if it was called an open yeah that's the
one thing that LG has not latched onto
is taking the el initial and just
putting it in front of various name yes
well they've got cute somebody in the
mole show chat was referencing a rumor
that they might do a cute voice or
something to me ok no right hang on
that's a thing q voice is a thing now
intro yeah oh yeah create hey yes yes a
back in July LG renames quick voice tool
q voice with English version set for
early next year perfect so boom so yeah
the Q pen you have yeah this is great
this is perfect yq word what like
whatever I think it comes from the quick
like they were like they're like we're
gonna do a quick voice and then like oh
wait no we don't need the rest of the UI
CK just drop that link AQ voice and and
makes perfect sense yeah and I guess the
last thing is we speaking of like
finally getting release dates and prices
we've got the razr HD and razr HD Maxx
October 18th in the US and it's 199 299
which I don't think those prices
performant that's exactly what we
expected yeah we call now they're
sliding them into their price points
yeah so yeah and and by the way the
notion of paying a hundred extra dollars
for the max is insane yeah you're paying
100 bucks more for battery life that's
it
which is like you know or it's insane
but like why would you buy the other one
and the same token yeah it's got
internal memory all right dhoni matter
does it so the max has more more
internal storage is that what we're okay
Oh double lke I see double the internal
storage okay still it's 100 bucks but
like then again why would you buy the
other one is like on a two-year contract
you know a hundred bucks to to you know
make a big stink over a hundred bucks
between a phone when you're paying you
know two grand over to your contract is
kind of like you might as well have that
phone at least last all day you say that
but it's like I really feel that I mean
like think about any other product like
there's a big difference between 199 to
not like I get the logic that was spread
over two years it's nothing but you
think you have to think about it in
terms of like I'm going into the into a
store and spending either 200 or 300
dollars today right so that that's still
I I think that for a lot of buyers
that's still like a major factor you
know it's for the same I mean like for
the same reason that there's an iphone
16 32 and 64 me of course you'd like the
64 but I bet the 32 and 16 both out sell
it oh yeah well the most best-selling
one it's a 16 yeah and and fry it
personally I can't bring myself to spend
four hundred dollars for a phone on
contract so yeah I guess that proves the
point yeah yeah I used to go for the the
64 on the iphone and I used to care a
lot about having a ton of internal
storage I don't even know what I've got
on my anymore cuz I don't care anymore
because I don't load it up with me music
I just use audio and I don't pay
attention exactly I guess I'm to a point
to point that makes sense but when
you've got big big apps and big games if
you want to have some like you're not
going to go down to an eight gigabyte
device yeah I've got 32 right so you you
really want to have some space but it's
not as big of a concern as it used to be
that's for sure the only time where it's
it's a problem for me because I I'm with
you a hundred percent dieter I got the
the 16 gig and didn't look back
use mog exclusively for music now and in
fact like I was only using like two gig
of the internal storage the only problem
is that that I can see is that if you're
going like on an international flight or
something and you want two or three
movies to rent each one is between four
and five gig so that's where you start
to run into problems but otherwise this
till I like there's no problem with this
that was the exact reason that i bought
the 16 gigabyte nexus 7 was because i
was like i want to use this on movies or
auntie on planes and i want to be able
to watch you know one or two movies yeah
that was the exact reason that yep can I
point out two things three things I want
to point out three things one skype is
the worst and it switched my mic input
to the wrong microphone randomly which
is awesome too it's insanely hot in the
verge West office and I don't know if I
can handle it anymore but normally it's
not insanely hot in the verge West
office and if you want to work in the
verge west office we just put up a job
listing you're hiring out here re are
you gonna hammer out I am gonna pass out
I'm uh that would be very entertaining
to do it during the that makes for
drinky a nice uh you know book bookend
to the opening where I you know
pretended that I was it's like it's like
where they're not forgeries in San
Francisco again is that what's happening
yeah it's that's I because we have
crossed here New York this week like it
is yeah it's 75 degrees right now and
since I have to have everything all
closed up here for the show it's
probably like approaching 90 in the
office so here's what happened somebody
saw that you were about to die like they
were watching the show like oh D der's
about to die cuz it's really hot so
we're gonna put his job on the board
right now so ready replacement as soon
as he dies that's that's what's going on
here yeah um I'm not even gonna call
attention to what's happening in the
chat right now so okay RAZR MAXX HD like
if you can spend the extra hundred bucks
you should because I've held them both
and unless you're actually holding them
and feeling their weight if you're
looking at it from more than a foot away
you literally
tell the difference like it is the the
razr HD is not that thin and the razr HD
max or is it magic maxx HD whatever is
like a millimeter thicker it's barely
thicker so uh you know despite you know
the fact that it's a penthouse screen
and you know a few other problems that I
have with the software but not that many
surprisingly it's not launching with
jelly bean which is insane and annoying
because Google owns this company I'm
actually kind of like the idea of a
phone that has literally 22 hours of
talk time is pretty exciting for me
because I'm iphone 5s LG the 1x the
galaxy s3 if i push any of them a super
hard I can't get through a day and the
idea that I could just not care is
pretty exciting like I'm imagining
having this phone at CES and just not
worrying about my battery life well to
your point dieter uh you know wouldn't
when the original RAZR MAXX came out and
people would ask me I'm on Verizon what
phone should I buy I don't want the
iphone i want something with LTE i
inevitably told them to buy the razr
maxx because for an average user it
provided a good enough experience and
like i would not hear them complaining
that the battery life was terrible like
they would with any other phone and so I
think that with the razr HD max is going
to be a lot of the same all right where
you know if if you want an android phone
on verizon right now given what we know
because we don't know exactly what nexus
phones are going to come out or how they
are going to perform you know the the HD
Maxx is very tempting for them that you
just don't have to worry about it if you
want any phone on any carrier that's not
the iphone you should wait for like a
couple of weeks to so that we know
exactly what's happening of Windows
Phone we know what's happening with the
Nexus you know because right now like
there's there's some really good stuff
that has been announced and that's
coming out but there's stuff that might
be better like significantly better that
could be coming out relatively soon I I
mean yeah you should not buy a phone
today unless it's an iphone and that's
what you really want pretty much period
yeah and even even then you
might want to just wait a couple weeks
if you desperately can yeah you never
know I mean I'd like maybe the galaxy s3
is still a safe recommendation as a
solid aunt like if you absolutely had to
buy an android phone today it would
probably be the gs3 right yes if someone
put a gun to my head it was like I'm
walking you down to the store and you're
buying an android phone it would be the
gs3 that would be the weirdest hold up
everybody I totally got about the
PadFone yes like the rest of the world
but it's the padfone 2 glad went and got
a preview of it and it's like it's not
bad right you know glad I think really
likes this it's unfortunate that he's
actually traveling back from the padfone
2 event any-any hasn't been yet been
able to join us here but if you read his
preview of the the device he actually
really likes it he really likes the
screen he says it's right up there with
the 1x um you know as a phone he likes
it I think he's still and he made this
point that as a tablet uh and then
eventually as a laptop it still got some
really software issues and kinks that
need to be worked out just like the
original iPad phone did but if you're
buying it just as a phone you're getting
in the same quad-core chip that was in
the Optimus G yeah a 13 megapixel camera
again yeah the 720p display that is
actually using sharps eggs Oh technology
which is the first one of the first
devices that we've seen to use it and
then you know a really solid looking
device it's super thin it's got a nice
build quality so I mean there's a lot to
like here what kind of bizarro world are
we in now we're asus and LG are making
phones with you know the latest
processor that other guys don't have yet
and incredibly good screens and decent
software like I I'm really confused well
what what was bizarre about it for so
many years was that LG made somebody the
screens and it couldn't put a good one
bones right so now it's finally just
like well we're gonna put them in our
own phone but yeah as far as like a sous
is concerned this is is not something I
would have expected to see 18 months ago
or even a year ago for that matter so so
I I hate to be the
yeah the wet blanket on this love parade
for the padfone 2 and vlad could
probably shoot me down here someone
effectively but from the pictures that
that he he posted it looks to me like
there's just an enormous amount of black
area below the screen I you know I
thought the same thing to be honest with
you when I saw the pictures yeah and
above for that especially decide by
sudden exit that way yeah from the front
of the phone it looks like a mid-range
device just because the screen looks
very small relative to this to the
outline of the device itself that's
complaint number one complaint number
two is that I still don't understand
this concept like WTF like why why are
we putting why are we putting phones in
tablets when we can just have a phone
and a tablet like no one has effectively
explain I know you guys have tried it
but I'm gonna try again okay because it
just carries it carries your day the
tablet it carries your dealer right tell
me the tablet yeah yeah if you can tell
the tablet for like a hundred bucks or
like 75 no more tried to do that with
the laptop and it like Phil as early I
mean this is the lap doc idea right
where you eventually get your phone all
the way to a laptop and the phone is
powering the whole shebang because it's
got this really you know modern
up-to-date processor but the software
steps to get there don't exist really to
make it a viable platform right yeah
it's just it's it's so like so i think
that the that shared data plans kind of
alleviate some of what you were talking
about dan like you know a year ago that
may have been more true but now like if
you're on a mobile share plan or
whatever verizon's equivalent is called
i can't remember then that that becomes
less of an issue but then also some
people say well you know you have the
giant battery and the tablet that can
power that can you know charge the phone
yes that's true but they're also like a
million other ways to charge your phone
so i was thinking about mobile share
over the weekend and i got really really
angry did you start through why do I
have yeah why do I have to pay an extra
ten bucks to put another device on
I'm mobile share plan or 20 bucks oh
it's a great question Jeff just charge
me for the data that i'm using like
could you imagine if you had to pay
comcast an extra ten bucks just to turn
on another computer in your house well
you know for to that point comcast will
charge you more money if you want
another cable box in your house but but
it's their equip your rennet you're
physically running above yeah that's a
good point yeah um yeah I mean it's it's
it's outrageous uh but so is a lot of
what 18 teen tries to do so I mean well
I mean nobody's doing it nobody's
offering you know here's pay us 100
bucks month and we'll give you you know
four gigs of data that you can use on
whatever you want however you want like
nobody's doing that I mean it's likely
technically if you want to get really
technical about it you can use that data
wherever you want on 18t by moving the
sim around which actually what they're
trying to make they're trying to make
difficult on you yeah I know I I have a
forum post with that I actually have a
statement from ATT I just haven't
written it yet but provisioning phones
in eighteen t is a huge pain now because
you can't to have all the features on
the iphone five work you need to be on a
mobile share of a plan and you need to
call them and have them provision it to
the imei the unique identifier for the
actual phone hardware so that mobile
hotspot and FaceTime will work if you
take that SIM card out and stick it in
an android phone or I don't know a palm
pre I mean whatever whatever other
smartphone they use the data that you
want a windows phone the phone calling
will work with the data will not you
need to call them and have it be
provisioned off of the special iphone
plan and on to the android or you know
other generic data plan so that data
will work there now let's play it's
actually always been but what seemed and
I thought it was dit was different
before but 18t tells me it's not is if
it's provisioned as a you know generic
data device to Android Windows Phone
whatever you use feel to stick it in an
iphone and have those other features
work but that's not the case now and
then I guess it wasn't the case before
so if you want a like officially
sanctioned mobile hotspot on an iPhone
in eighteen t you've got to be on an
AT&amp;amp;T plan and if you want data to work
at all on a non iphone smartphone you
need to be provision there so
what used to be really simple swim sim
swapping is now you put the sim in you
call AT&amp;amp;T you wait for 10 minutes you
talk to somebody you say hey I'm in a
different phone now provision me now
like I'm all worked up about this but
this is not a problem that 99% of people
have but it's still like I mean they're
not just one percenter problem there
dieter that you write but it's it's the
the principle behind it is you know ATT
isn't treating their devices agnostic
Lee it's you know you need to call them
and get the provision for the specific
data plan for the specific phone that
you have and that's like it's in the
same vein as why am I you know having to
pay for each device going on you know my
data bucket I get that there's a certain
amount of load that goes on the network
for having another device registered on
it etc etc etc so like I know it's not
going to change anytime soon especially
because it's a big revenue stream but i
want the carriers to be more like dumb
pipes and i want them to treat the stuff
that connects to their network equally
and this is a tiny little step in the
wrong direction yeah i mean it's it's
really like just the carriers are
fighting becoming that dumb pipe that
you know we would like them to be and
would hope eventually that they become
but they're going to do everything they
can to stop that from happening and
having you requiring you to actually
call them to interact with them to
switch a device is just one more way to
do that and the funny thing is that they
carriers fight so hard to reduce the
amount of time that customers need to
spend on the phone with them like it I
remember at mwc I had a discussion with
oh the name of the company escapes me
what what is the shoot what is the come
all the way they made that hotspot thing
that when you talk about no no that the
the company that that got into hot water
for transmitting all your co Carrier IQ
Carrie I think right here your IQ so you
know they're they're real business model
is not being able to actually you know
coming up with these metrics that
carriers can use to like tweak service
and like fixed hours that are
performing optimally and this and that
and the other thing and they were in the
process of rolling out these new tools
that were actually customer-facing tools
so that a Kerry Wood roll these out to
its customers and they would be able to
log into like this portal and see all
these stats on like how many dropped
calls you've had and like why the calls
were dropped things that like you know
customers probably calling the customer
service for all the time and it's just
there's nothing that customer service
can do is just it's kind of like wasting
their time so that was carrier iqs
proposition to carriers is give them
access to this information they will
they will call you less and carriers are
always looking for ways self-help tools
those sorts of things to make it so that
you don't have to get in contact with
them because that costs them money every
time you do call them so here you have a
very seemingly a really easy thing for
them to say you know well we're just
going to use one APN for all of our
devices and then that way like we stay
true to the spirit of GSM you can move
your sim around just like you're
supposed to be able to and what do you
know we also don't get a we don't
generate a support call like and instead
they're you know they're they're
throwing that advantage away just
because they want to I mean I'm sure
they have some technical some you know
random technical reason why they're
doing it this way but in reality let's
be honest there's no reason that
facetime over cellular can't run over
the existing APN well i mean i would i
would like to know how european carriers
would handle it because that's a perfect
example like yeah people can switch from
an iphone to galaxy s3 as they want in
the UK i highly doubt they have to call
02 to switch it over right um so yeah
maybe there's a technical reason but
does it really need to be a technical
reason right and on that depressing note
I have nothing else you guys there
anything you guys want to add we won't
talk about Isis I don't really want I
mean adult you know it's coming finally
maybe the logo looks like the nespresso
logo but I already actually I don't
think that's the ISIS logo that's just
the that's the NFC logo that 18 he is
using
it's awful yeah I guess I'm just looking
through our other news items for the
week yeah oh you know what we should
touch you guys are going to kill me for
this but I do think we should touch
briefly on the ipod touch review because
okay um you know that there used to be
this running joke that like a really
really common like device combo for
business people was a blackberry in one
hand and ipod touch and the other or an
ipod not not even an ipod touch but just
an ipod of some sort and and I you know
this is still I think a really
compelling product for a lot of people
who for one reason or in either front or
another either want a non-iphone or need
to have a non-iphone probably for
business but still want you know still
want access to all that iphone stuff and
and this looks like a really sweet
device i'm really excited that the
bringing colors to it you know I I think
it's incredible yeah yeah it's it's a
gorgeous device and it's really well
made and the it's like incredibly thin
with insane how minute you can't like
appreciate how thin it is until you
actually hold it which is we say every
single time but it's really that the
truth here I think with the colors i
think that Apple identified a target
audience for this with that you know
this is a huge device that teenagers
love and parents love for teenagers
because they don't have to pay for a
data plan on it and they don't have to
pay for another line on their cellular
plan they can give the kid a prepaid
phone take the school in emergencies and
then their kid has all their games and
apps and I message and everything on
their ipod touch and I think these
colors you know just speak to that as
well that you know the kids will eat
this up right so what makes what makes
me wonder about the ipod touches why
aren't we seeing these colors on the
iphone and i think the answer is
probably it's probably just like
everything else bad that happens in the
world is probably the carriers right i I
don't think skills I don't I don't think
it's the carriers because you die I
think I think Apple would do it
regardless if it wanted to
not if they wanted to put colors on the
iphone I think it would do it i don't
think the carriers have that kind of
clout over over apples design philosophy
but yeah it's a good question as to why
we don't see it in the iphone unless
they're just trying to separate a
premium versus a slightly less premium
line but i think that the number of
phones that they need to produce is huge
and they want to bring costs down by
from that volume and i think it's also
multiple skews you know it's it's one
thing to offer you know four different
colors I best buy it's another thing to
try and you know get verizon to have
those color stocked in their stores it's
it's a it's an entirely you know if you
get you don't have the color you want at
best buy it's out of stock you know
whatever but if they don't of the color
you want to verizon i mean you know the
idea that they would have to stock all
those different multiple models when
these you know all these companies have
done such a good job of minimizing the
amount of inventory that they have to
carry i think that it's you know it's
possible but i think that they say of a
ton of money by not doing it yeah both
Apple and carriers that is very good
point yes yeah yeah but it's kind of bad
that I want a own an iPhone and I carry
an iphone but I still want one of these
ipod touches can you man can you imagine
if the iphone 5 was the thickness in
fact i can already tell you not the 5s
but the iphone 6 they're gonna be like
good news we made the iphone as thin as
our old ipod touch now and and chris is
just gonna die inside because he just
really wanted more battery life yeah i
mean like i would still rather have and
I well maybe not now like now that I'm
used to it but like a couple weeks ago I
just wanted a phone that was the
thickness of the 4s with more battery
life and now they've gotten me used to
the stupid 7th know like you know
they're gonna keep making it then and
I'll be like oh this is stupid then I'll
use it for all be like oh this is
actually pretty cool and then yeah you
know like it's it's a vicious cycle
anyway I'm just I'm I'm saying nothing
of important we talk a little bit about
the loop cuz I would kind of love the
loop on my iPhone the way you would
katha could be rad yeah I don't know let
me sir a big deal man Oh in what
circumstance just explain to me
and under what circumstance you would
use the loop you know what i would do is
because the button depresses to go it's
a push push button yeah i would just
play with it all day long I would be
sitting on my desk and I'd be like click
click click click clack click click and
that's probably the real reason that I
wanted yeah that's fair that's that's
totally fair yeah I'm just realizing
looking at the bottom of the ipod touch
here they physically can't make it much
thinner because of the the diameter of
the three a half millimeter jack they're
almost getting to the point where
they're they're hitting that limit and
what really worries and st. Pat where
they had like a jack that was like half
rubber and half metal and then it could
it could expand out when you plugged it
in but it would reduce down to the
thinner form factor I swear I saw patent
from Apple on that like four years ago
probably yeah one surprise me but but I
can totally imagine apple just going
with a proprietary I mean they basically
went with a proprietary headphone jack
with the first generation iphone for all
practical purposes I could see them if
at some point they decide they really
need need to make like a four millimeter
thick phone I could totally see them
saying well we're just gonna have to go
with a 1 millimeter wide jack and
everyone's gonna or the you know they
would eliminate the wire entirely and
use some sort of wireless yeah yeah yeah
they could use apt x or something but
for build I'm just trying to think about
that I would say that would be we got no
laces Howard that came out last year in
2011 what did um the 3.5 cutting a 3.5
jack and half oh the the padding right
yeah yeah okay so you're telling me is
that this is going to happen pretty much
that's a virgin mobile show everybody we
