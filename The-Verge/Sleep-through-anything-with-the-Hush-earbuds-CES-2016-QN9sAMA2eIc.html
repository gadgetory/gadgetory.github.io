CES for I don't even know how many days
now and I am pretty tired I have not had
a lot of sleep this week as is always
the case at CES but if I had these
around me at every event maybe I would
get a little bit more these are the hush
smart earbuds and what they do is they
fit into your ear and they connect to
your phone and they can play all kinds
of noise to help you get to sleep
so they slot it like this you have to
kind of put them in your ear and then
slide them back down and they're
actually really comfortable so you can
lie sideways on a pillow and they don't
they don't dig into your head at all
it's not like sleeping where their
phones or anything if I have this white
noise or and I mean like I would not be
thinking that I'm in the middle of a
super-busy CES event right now although
there are incredibly bright lights
shining on my face so it's not the ideal
sleeping environment but another good
thing about these ear buds is so you can
go like this and they are they're very
easy to sleep on your side where this is
a kind of Docs that they have which you
just put the earphones in and that helps
the pair to your phone the sound or
plays locally on the headphones once
you've uploaded them from the phone so
that's what allows them to have pretty
good battery life throughout the night
and so they shouldn't die on you and
let's just leave before way more than
like eight hours these are the hush
earplugs and that was the customer
mattress and these two things combined I
think they're probably the best chance
of getting any sleep at all at CES for
