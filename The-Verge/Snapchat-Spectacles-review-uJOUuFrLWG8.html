best camera is the one that you have on
to you so what if that statement was
literally true what if you could wear a
camera almost all the time that's the
promise of snap spectacles and they're
pretty awesome
now spectacles are the first hardware
product from snapping the company
formerly known as snapchat and they
really deliver on that promise even for
someone like me who carries around a
camera all the time I'd really consider
bringing these with me as well and a
part of that is that they tie right into
the snapchat app every video you shoot
on these glasses gets sent right to your
phone and from there you can edit it and
upload it or share to your friends I've
spent about a week with spectacles and I
found three really good use cases for
them one is experiential videos two is
face-to-face interactions with the
people that you know and love and three
is making videos that look and feel like
memories now spectacles are good at
experiential videos because they leave
your hands-free it lets you interact
with whatever you're doing without
having a Juggalo camera there's also a
really wide angle lens on that's not
quite as wide as a GoPro but it works in
the same way is sort of stretching the
image making everything look a little
bit more exciting especially if it's
only at arm's length landscapes and open
scenes look pretty good in spectacles
but where you're really going to see it
shine is when you're holding something
in your hands or playing around with
something at arm's length
now spectacles are also really good at
filming interactions with people and
that's because snap went out of its way
to make sure that everybody knows that
you're recording and that's what this
whole recording light is about instead
of an ominous red light that's telling
everybody that you're filming them it's
this friendlier white wheel of Lights
that spins and sort of lets everybody
participate in the experience if they
want
I didn't can I get a Shack burger fries
and a large iced tea get a drink tray
I needed that part of that is the fact
that the camera shoot at 60 frames a
second another part is the wide-angle
lens but it's really actually all about
the fact that the camera sits there
right at eye level it's almost
impossible to get that point of view
with basically any other camera and it
makes a world of difference even if
you're not in the video in the end being
able to capture something the way that
you saw it is a really powerful thing
they were boring videos that shot of me
pouring coffee or opening the door that
I still felt an emotional connection
with that I wouldn't normally feel with
if I had shot them with anything else
and then of course there were more
emotionally impactful moments like
greeting my dog at the end of the day or
going out on a date with my girlfriend
where it really shines so there's two
big problems with spectacles they don't
really ruin the experience but you are
going to have to live with them if you
want to use these one is if you shoot a
lot of videos in spectacles transferring
those videos can be a pain in the ass
right now we've spent a good chunk of
the day shooting this video and shooting
videos on spectacles and it is now
trying to import eighty three videos the
problem as it builds a bunch of those
videos up and waits to transfer them is
it takes a lot longer if you shoot maybe
five or ten videos it'll take you about
ten seconds of video to transfer but if
you shoot eighty-three of them it sort
of bogs down and it's taking a lot
longer than 10 seconds is signaling
twenty or thirty seconds the other big
problem with spectacles has to do with
the user interface with spectacles you
shoot the video on the glasses get the
way for them to transfer and then once
they've transferred the app dumps them
all into day by day groups and so you
have to go into each day and slide all
the way over to find the video that you
want then tap again to edit or do
whatever you want with it and then tap
again to be able to post it to your
stories it's just three or four times as
long of a process if not longer than any
other interaction you do inside the
snapchat app and that's after you figure
all that stuff out there's
is still a learning curve beer if you
haven't used snapchat a lot but if you
take a couple steps back I feel like
there's more going on here than these
just being a supplement to snapchat I
think the reason that staff is calling
itself a camera company now is that it's
starting to test out bigger ideas like
being able to capture videos from your
point of view that feel like memories
and in that sense spectacles feel more
like a beta test for what's coming next
sure they're 130 dollars they're really
hard to buy right now and the video
quality isn't quite there yet
the idea that spectacles represent are
much bigger than what we have today I
got this hold on Google glass or a GoPro
nope and our food is right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
