ears would be like trying to make one
pair of shoes to fit everybody's feet I
mean it's impossible you know what
Johnny you're right I'm Ross Miller and
this is 90 seconds on the verge Apple is
negotiating the purchase of beats for
3.2 billion dollars the deal could be
announced as early as next week the
story was first reported by Financial
Times and later confirmed by Wall Street
Journal Bloomberg and even dr. Dre
himself by way of Tyreese first began in
hip hop right here from the mother in
West Coast believe beats was founded in
2008 by dr. Dre a music mogul Jimmy
Iovine according to NPD it commands
around 59 percent of the premium
headphone market and has essentially
replaced Apple's white earbuds as a
status symbol but thinking long-term
beats also has a subscription music
service beats music launched in January
and according to recode has only managed
200,000 users a far cry from the nearly
10 million using Spotify but iTunes
radio hasn't fared much better in a
single track dala model that Apple
pioneered is declining subscription
services seem to be the future and Apple
just bought its way into that market
also Apple has been on something of a
hiring spree lately just today it was
revealed that Apple has hired the head
of Nokia's Lumia photography division
who co-authored the paper on PureView
technology but those hires serve a very
utilitarian purpose for Apple it's not
beats as technology that's worth 3.2
billion dollars it's the name itself a
well-known and very lucrative brand an
apple buy an image well that's pretty
new territory for the company for more
on Apple check out the verge coming up
dr. dre finally earned his tenure and
becomes Professor drink</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
