today we're taking a look at the
Instagram direct the next time you open
up Instagram there'll be an inbox in the
top right corner of the app opening up
the inbox will take you to a view of all
the messages that you've sent and all
the messages that you've received it's
not a series of back and forth messages
though every message consists of a
single picture a single video and then
we'll place to chat beneath it
you'll be able to keep sending messages
back and forth inside of a single thread
but you won't be able to send any photos
back if you want to send a new photo you
have start a brand new thread in that
way it's a lot more likely commenting on
a single Instagram photo rather than
sending photos back and forth you'll
have a search out old photos that you
sent very easily I chose to scroll
through the entire inbox of everything
that you've ever sent
fortunately something's a little ugly
the way but hide it and if you regret
sending something out you'll be able to
delete it and it'll instantly vanish
from whoever you sent it to you'll be
able to send a photo by clicking the
plus button at the top of the Instagram
inbox or by just going to its normal
camera menu once you take a picture
you'll then get to choose between
followers or sending it directly to one
of your friends you can choose up to 15
different people to send it to you and
once you send it off it'll tell you just
how long it's been before they seen it
Instagram direct is otherwise pretty
simple it's just a way to send a single
photo and then talk about it with your
friends it's basically a little private
area of Instagram rather than an
explicit way to send messaging back and
forth you'll be able to get his tram
direct right now by downloading it on
iOS and Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
