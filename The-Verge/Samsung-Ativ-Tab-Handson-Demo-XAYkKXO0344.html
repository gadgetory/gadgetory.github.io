berlin 2012 and we've just second a very
first look at the windows 8 each tab i
presume that's how you pronounce it this
is a brand-new Windows RT tablet it is
running a samsung snap a Snapdragon s4
dual-core processor 1.5 gigahertz has
really impressive display like if you
look at the viewing angles right here
they're really nice and impressive and
Samsung describes as having complete
windows 8 functionality which means you
get metro right here and if you just
press the Windows key down here you also
switch into the usual desktop there's no
swiping around to be done desktop it's
kind of familiar windows 7 interface and
then press the Windows key again
switches you back out it's a very thin
tablet nine point nine millimeters in
profile has a couple of very finely
hidden speakers one on the right one on
the left I might not be able to pick
them up in his light flipping around the
back it has this brushed look that
Samsung is promoting with galaxy s3 the
galaxy note the occasional to that we
just introduced its still plastic as a 5
megapixel camera around here the back
over here it has hdmi and USB ports and
not full size and has micro SD card slot
power button volume rocker and a
headphone jack so pretty standard fare
but it's also very thin so it's very
good looking tablet it has this mats
around which is actually under glass so
there's glass covering up a mats around
and this is xbox music kicking up and it
looks very thin it is very light it has
a little dock / charge and connected
down here to bottom I presume and is
Samsung's first Windows RT tablet we
presume again so this our first look at
Samsung 80 tab</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
