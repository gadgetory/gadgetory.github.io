afternoon and share more about our
vision for Yahoo Yahoo is about making
the world's daily habits inspiring and
entertaining and quite honestly there
are very few places as inspiring and
entertaining at CES as many of you know
we announced in November that
award-winning journalist author and TV
host Katie Couric would be joining Yahoo
as our global anchor and today I'm
excited to have Katie with us here at
CES my first got into the news business
35 years ago and as many of you of a
certain age know it was a very different
time I've often said it was the time
when her ass was two words instead of
one thank you for getting that show
could you tell us
I think one of the most exciting things
for me personally about these efforts of
the opportunity at Yahoo is it really is
a blank slate as many of you know I
really enjoy interviewing so I'm very
excited the prospect of interviewing
newsmakers
politicians sports figures
philanthropist anyone who we believe has
an important and interesting story to
tell so I'm really excited to announce a
new product today it's called Yahoo News
digest and at its core it simplifies
news and eliminates the problems of
information overload
Yahoo knew digests our new product
provides you with two daily summaries or
digests one in the morning and one in
the evening they both contain all the
important news the stories are
algorithmically produced but editorially
curated demonstrating the perfect blend
between technology and journalism today
I'm excited to announce that David Pogue
the award-winning tech columnist that's
selling author and tea
host will lead our tech magazine so yeah
I picked that picture off of Flickr I I
thought it would suggest impact and
drama and power and yeah I see it it
just kind of looks like the cover of
Dianetics our country and our
technological level I think they break
down along the same lines I mean let's
face it it's like California and New
York and everyone else so I think let's
face it you guys are part of the bubble
on the edges right everyone at CES is a
gearhead you you know what a Snapdragon
processor is you care about bus speeds
you have a Google+ account okay thank
you I wrote that one myself
thank you so you might ask well aren't
there already many consumer technology
sites that could help yes absolutely
I'm not going to name any names but
they're out there
this is yahoo.com slash tech at Yahoo
Tech first of all we have a language
we're going to speak and it's called
English called human it's absolutely
gorgeous it looks like nothing else out
there so today we're going to be
launching the site in fact what I
thought would be cool is if we launched
the site right now now I've never done
this I don't I don't know if there's
like a big lever of the Ebro
or a big red button of course it's an
app I should have known so with that
ladies and gentlemen I hereby welcome to
the world our baby Yahoo tech
we've made some exciting announcements
today and we look forward to sharing
more with you in the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
