here in Dallas Texas it's software mad
scientist's lab of John Carmack by his
own admission and we're here checking
out this headband on display now I know
you've heard that these virtuality
things been done for years and years and
years this is a lot different this is an
early prototype we're using a heavily
modified oculus rift headset and we're
can use we're gonna check out the doom 3
BFG edition in a completely different 3d
landscape so I'm go ahead and try this
on again this is an early prototype
there's wires everywhere John's actually
gonna help me put this on so actually
what I am doing right now is it's got
accelerometers and gyroscopes in there
and I can actually tilt my head and when
I do the whole view goes with me
otherwise the same controls apply you
can still move the gun up and down what
you're seeing on screen is actually
obviously a something a little more
polar when you look at it through the
headset though it's actually an really
pristine 3d it's actually really
surprising how well this works
especially when you get up close to
something and actually jumps out let me
see if I can uh get myself in a bad spot
here that's a good one all right so uh I
know we say this a lot of the industry
that you like it's something you have to
see yourself to believe and we really
cannot capture it well on picture that
is the actual truth I mean even looking
down here to see the textures it's not
the highest resolution we're looking at
a 1280 by 800 split screen the immersion
level itself is a completely different
I'm looking at the details here and be
able to actually interact the one of the
nice things about this is the field of
view is a close to if not 90 degrees and
you can really get a sense the feel
because you don't actually see the edges
of the screen and that really caters to
the immersion factor so before we got a
chance to play the head matter we
actually tried the traditional 3d method
which you know I think of many people
after they're watching this kind of
familiar with this is something entirely
different the immersion level here is
really something to behold
so anyway that is the new head mounted
display really like no other for the
doom 3 BFG edition that's coming out
later
this year pricing and availability
beyond that is still kind of to be
determined and yeah hopefully he comes
out at some point this year a chance to
play it for yourself this is brought to
the verge reorienting to real life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
