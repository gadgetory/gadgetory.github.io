speaker that's meant to take on Sonos in
Amazon by combining great sound and a
smart home assistant in the form of Siri
for the ultimate home device one of
apple's big focuses with home pod is how
it uses technology to make sure music
sounds great no matter what the space it
uses a microphone ray to figure out
information about the room you're
listening to music in and automatically
Tunes itself to offer the best results
and while it'll be awhile before we can
get our hands on one to try it ourselves
early impressions are that the home pod
offers some really good sound apples
also making series smarter with home pod
especially when it comes to music so
you'll be able to ask more detailed
questions like who's the drummer in this
song or what was the top song on may 5th
2016 which is pretty cool unlike the
Amazon echo or Google home home pod puts
music ahead of being a digital assistant
but it can still do the usual batch of
stuff you'd want from voice control the
system including weather reminders
timers news sports scores and more you
can even send AI messages but you're
limited to whatever Apple has on offer
through Siri instead of being able to
install your own skills like on Amazon
echo or Google home home pod also works
as a central hub for smart home
accessories with apple's homekit if
you've got smart lights or outlets that
are compatible with apple standard
you'll be able to control them by voice
through home pod and since home pod is
always connected to Wi-Fi you can use it
as a bridge to control smart home stuff
from your iPhone even if you're away
from home home pod will cost three
hundred and fifty dollars from the
launches in December which is a good bit
more than just picking up an echo or
Google home but if Apple can really
deliver on the sound it might just be
worth the price
