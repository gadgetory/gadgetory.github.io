buy a Levi's trucker jacket for over a
year that's how long it's been since
Levi's and Google announced this jacket
it's the trucker commuter jacket with
project jacquard built in and it has a
pretty expensive price you might call it
a designer price it costs three hundred
and fifty dollars so why the long wait
and why that very expensive price
well this jacket has intelligent
capacitive fibers woven into the literal
fabric so that you can just do that and
music starts playing it connects to your
smartphone via bluetooth app so let's
check that out
so once you've paired and set it up this
is what the app looks like you've really
only got three four core gestures and
you can customize them to do whatever
you want so the brush in which is what I
did to play my music
this one's really neat the DoubleTap
when you double tap and then it just
gives you whatever your next direction
is to go home which is pretty clever and
then you can also just cover your sleeve
to stop whatever the you know action is
that it's doing when jacquard is hooked
up and you're on your bike it
automatically defaults to reading all of
your notifications out loud which is
potentially annoying but you can go in
and set it to this thing called ping
which means it will only allow calls and
texts in from people that you actually
care about so you're less distracted on
the road but really one of the more fun
things you can do and you should
actually just see how this works is you
can see how these capacitive threads
work so if I open this thing up these
frets represent the threads on my sleeve
so I can like it's kind of fun you can
kind of see where your fingers it's also
pressure-sensitive and yeah it's just
kind of fun to play around with but the
point is you've got these very simple
easier member gestures that you set up
yourself and once you do that while
you're riding your bike you are able to
just get you know the quick information
the quick song change that you need
without having to hassle with it the
cuff will also vibrate when you have an
incoming notification so it acts a
little bit like a SmartWatch in that way
and you can do other weird stuff like
you can you know
count the stuff if you're a bouncer I
guess you can get to check the current
time see how long it'll take you to get
to where you're going and so on so
that's it it's a very simple app but
that's on purpose because this isn't
meant to be gadgety it's meant to be
just a thing that helps you do a couple
quick things while you're riding your
bike so that's how the app works but the
app kind of isn't the point the point is
that this is just a nice jacket and in
fact you can treat it like you would
pretty much any other jean jacket once
you take off this little cuff dongle
thing which is how it connects to your
phone set it aside you can throw the
whole jacket in the wash so you can just
treat it like anything else and it works
really well for its purpose which is
people who commute by a bicycle it's got
a little extender on the back reflectors
pop the collar there's another reflector
and pockets for all of your gadgets so
350 admittedly is a bit more than you
normally pay for a jacket like this
especially from Levi's but it's not
crazy for a very nice piece of clothing
and if you want your very nice piece of
clothing to maybe make you less likely
to look at your phone while you're
riding your bike because don't do that
then it's gonna be worth a look
so that's the Duquette so that's the
jacket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
