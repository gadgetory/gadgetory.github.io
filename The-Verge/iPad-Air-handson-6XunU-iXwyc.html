this is the new iPad air
this is Apple's newest full-size I've
had it has the same nine point seven
inch Retina display you've come to know
and love but it's in a dramatically
smaller thinner or lighter package so
for comparison here's my old busted up
I've had three and you can see just how
much smaller there was the special
decide how much thinner it is and
actually you really got to hold it
because it is just incredibly light in
your hands it's almost like as light as
the original iPad Mini was in terms of
performance it's ridiculously fast it's
much faster than my old iPad sitting
there a lot faster than I've had four
that I've been playing with the office
it's running iOS 7 so very familiar
there five-minute pixel camera on the
back 1080p camera on the front and
overall just the same I've had
experience probably very familiar with a
much smaller thinner and importantly
faster packaging the new iPad air starts
at $4.99 for 16gb version 529 if for 60
gig with cell goes up from there with
storage and it's available November 1st
and a whole bunch of countries</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
