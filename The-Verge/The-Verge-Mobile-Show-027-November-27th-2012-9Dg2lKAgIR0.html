where we talk about mobile this is
episode 27 for the week of November 26th
2012 we have our entire team here which
is very very exciting let's sound off
who we are because that's how we start
podcast now I am dieter bohn i have
class saba i'm dan seifert my name is
chris sigler and i don't know about you
guys but I am just an angry cranky hot
mess and it's gonna show on the show a
little bit today we're gonna argue I
feel Chris are you are you ready to are
you and be cranky I'm gonna take you
down I'm gonna tear you limb from limb
you're gonna be a bloody corpse by the
end of this show Wow well but maybe I'll
be a zombie and I'll rise again I like
not going anywhere with this uh so as I
said this is a holiday weekend for you
guys in America how come you come back
home stressed out and frazzled and rates
fight because I'm off my regular
circadian rhythm I'm off my you know my
my habit of working all day and then
going to sleep and waking up and working
again and drinking somewhere in there
usually after work today before work no
um see I told you I was off my game um
no but my thanksgiving was actually
really good I've got a new niece got to
see her and got to hang out with my
brother and my sister my parents and
in-laws well actually they're not in
law's my sisters in-laws it was a ton of
people do you guys have good
Thanksgivings I did we actually hosted
it here at our house which was an
experience but it went okay and we
didn't burn the house down so yes we
could say that was just a success um my
mind was legit i got an ipad mini with
LTE holiday she's pretty awesome i love
a leader nigger dieter and I lead with
you know we're the families here the
wheels were good chris is like yeah I
bought myself an ipad mini
and I think that wish is the only one
who actually spoke to our audience
nobody else really gives a damn about
families or but anybody else would do
right and besides like a good LTE
network is like the warm embrace of a
family member I could really do it one
of those right now because at the moment
i am connected to the internet
essentially by shoestring i'm using my
phone's hotspot which may or may not let
me down during this podcast because
virgin media as usual a provider of
cable internet which supposed to be rock
solid and reliable is stinking right now
ce o-- simply your enemies are also you
gotta post i have to breathe out what's
going on in the in the chat for the
verge mobile show right now if you're
not watching us live you're really
missing out because everybody is laying
out all the specs for the proposed nexus
kin device and i gotta say it sounds
pretty awesome that sounds horrible just
by name is sounds horrible regular SD
cards look be 4i den that's great guys
full size SIM card exes oh the nexus one
is the bass or factor device ever
created nexus one bring back the
triangle excuse excuse me that the kin
the kin one not the nexus 10 the kin one
is the best form factor of any device
yeah you know when I had a palm pre I
thought you know what would really make
this device would be if you just smushed
it and that would really have just
nailed that device in them and you know
the kid one really really yes thank you
Dan I've got a veer that I could grab if
you really want we could we could debate
the their tiny little sliding devices um
actually speaking of operating systems
that probably don't have a real chance
in the market we finally got a look at
sailfish which is from a group of people
called Jolla Julia I think they I think
they
yalla yalla I'd like to pronounce it
holla I want to cook pronounce it hoya
how about i know i i'd be like we can
only refer to this company of haha Jol
la it is based on Mego and I think out
of everybody here Vlad probably has the
most affinity for for this OS yes we can
let him sort of break it down what we
saw and that's great because I haven't
seen it yet let's break down I can sum
it up in one sentence uh it looks like
something you could do with a custom
android lock screen in 2010 wow that's
hard man well I mean it's just it's i
don't know it actually there's there's
something that like blackberry 10 stole
from me go and so this is also based on
Mego and so there's like live tiles for
your active apps and then you know left
and white swipes and whatever um I mean
it looks fine but where is it going to
go it'll run android apps yeah you know
what else runs android apps the playback
right and that really worked really well
well the playbook you have to submit
their just gonna do it straight i
believe is the plan and so you don't
have to admit the thing that's crazy
about this is like i know i'm pretty
sure that they're releasing like
developer kits and all that other stuff
but like they're also plan to release
their own a hardware for it if I am not
mistaken which is kind of insane to the
thing sorry I just realized we had like
two different glads and the hang out at
the same time disconnected and
reconnected which is pretty amazing
actually I mean look this windows phone
blackberry 10 back at stoja moment
connection guys and the lag and your
connection to we've been talking for
like 15 minutes about you and you just
caught up yeah I guess go
I would like to see a viable third
ecosystem and I do think that Windows
Phone still has the best chance I'm just
putting that out there to absolute
silence let's move on we haven't seen I
mean are you seen you private dieter
you've probably seen blackberry 10 more
than any of us um but I guess we haven't
seen it on the marketplace yet and we
won't until january thirtieth or shortly
thereafter depending on if they can
actually pull off the real launch I mean
I guess I mean let's just talk about it
now since and came up I mean we we got
to interview tourists and Heinz along
with a whole lot of other people he
really made the rounds and you know I
mean we didn't really learn a whole lot
knew about blackberry 10 they're
planning on having a couple of surprises
for the launch they're probably going to
be related to the services that they're
going to use for media hopefully it's
something interesting but probably it
won't be and what what's really
interesting to me is that room is sort
of got these plans Heinz keeps talking
about the future of mobile computing and
if blackberry tez even a little bit
successful then they're planning on like
trying to be the de facto tablet OS for
enterprise and like seriously taking on
Microsoft I mean Heinz wouldn't say I'm
taking on Microsoft but read between the
lines it's like wow that's like really
insanely ambitious it wow is that
ambitious Microsoft has no traction
whatsoever I don't think that's it I
mean that no he's not talking about it
phones he's talking about in computing
period he thinks at that blackberry 10
on a tablet like can just be your
computer
okay I don't want to say anything
terribly negative or be especially since
i haven't seen blackberry 10 on a tablet
uh nobody has yeah i like my skeptic
Punda tree is like raging right now
because I don't see that happening at
all I'm kind of afraid to pitch in
because I don't even know how about my
lag is over here um just do it man I'm
just saying like I'm just saying like
steel frames of dieter and Dan every
three or four seconds chris is just
keeping it legit and he's just staring
down at screen oh well behind his
quarters remain under telling it lizard
go yeah no no I'm with you guys I'm
following
you
roses buttock all right are we back on
the air cuz I gotta not everything right
now we're back I believe if someone
could yes there we are back you guys
miss those that using point Vlad totally
laid down some eloquent knowledge and we
don't even want to continue because
there's nothing else to say about mobile
after what he said when we were off air
yes she had just eaten yeah thing I
think it was a good point I'm but I was
just saying that it's not out of the
realm of the reasonable for RIM to
compute Microsoft on this computing
stage because Microsoft covered
two-pronged approach having the old
desktop interface and the new modern
interface it's just kind of a patch
Patrick system until the next version
and until the future because the future
for Microsoft is going to be this
touch-centric interface and that's the
future for Microsoft and Microsoft has
the big enterprise business market does
the future for all business we're all
going to be doing work with such capable
touch-centric devices interfaces it just
where everybody's going so room
obviously it already has a relationships
businesses it already has the network
established it just needs to have
quality of software and hardware to back
that up which as usual is the big
question mark I mean I'm all for aiming
high but i don't know like it seems like
it's kind of a stretch and it's I I
agree that we're going to see you know
something like a tablet interface take
over and sooner than we expect but I
don't think that I don't think that grim
should be getting ahead of itself in
this regard I mean yeah I me add that
that's exactly how I feel I feel like
rim needs to lock down its core business
first which its like before trying to
reach out and catch the bigger doesn't
point then what is room school core
business because everything is falling
apart for him this is true that's a very
good point i mean when i say core
business I mean mobile technology as far
as like smartphones yeah
which are not selling right but like so
I mean baby that does the point like if
you ask me it's just as crazy for him to
be competing with Microsoft and the
enterprise is this for room to be
competed with smartphone leaders at the
moment because the company is showing
zero in terms of competitiveness over
the past what is it two years so I mean
what are we what are we basing any faith
Abrams bulb our chances here's the like
rim still has the same team that of
employees that it used to build
smartphones like that's what they know
how to do and it'd be one thing if like
the company did like a total about-face
and flipped its whole staff and then
suddenly started building laptops and
tablets and everything like that and buy
tablets I mean not the PlayBook that
would you know maybe they have that but
like the the smartphones is what rim
built its business on right so I feel
like it'd be a lot easier for the
company to actually rethink how it's
doing smartphones and do that right than
to try and tackle a whole nother market
okay well yeah is that the mouse the
markets aren't going to be different
right that's that's kind of the future
that he's looking forward to yeah yeah
but I'm saying is can you name the last
innovative really competitive leading
smartphone developed by rim the best
ribs smartphone ever was the curve 8900
and I don't think I'll ever beat that
Wow and that was how long ago 2009 I
think yeah right so mean that's what I'm
saying it's it's kind of a really
pessimistic downbeat outlook but the
fact is that room has no evidence to
show that it can compete in mobile so if
Boston wants to go and just be you know
aggressive and jump into a whole new
category you might as well because I
don't think room has that competence
that we assume it has because I they
shone out right and I mean to be I think
initially they're talking like health
care and other really you know specific
things before they try and go into
computing writ large but you know what
it doesn't matter we won't know what
chances are until after we see what
blackberry 10 toes and that's a ways
away so we'll just have to wait and see
us Chris yes I would like you to lay out
your thesis that you were ranting about
on Twitter so that I can tell you that
you're wrong would this be the debate
that we were having over the weekend
yeah so it's very simple and and it's
very simple and very correct what what
I'm what I'm positing is that we are
nearing an inflection point in mobile
where specs are stabilizing to the
hardware specs are stabilizing to the
point nobody's ever said that before
I've never heard that that story mobile
before that specs are stabilizing that's
really interesting continued specs are
stabilizing what are going to be
stabilizing to the point where users are
going to be dis incentivized to upgrade
at this breakneck pace they're not going
to feel there's to spend money at the
same pace that they've been spending
money over the past five to seven to ten
years and at least in the in the segment
of the market that already owns
smartphones and as that happens carriers
are going to use one of their trump
cards which is their ability to lord
subsidies and lock devices over their
users and that opens up the market and
and presents you know clear and present
opportunity for for carriers like
t-mobile that play nice with unlock or
play nicer with unlock devices for these
kinds advices things like the Nexus 4
and products in that category too kind
of flourish and it's going to turn
carriers that much closer into the dumb
pipes that we all want them to be so one
spec race slowing down I mean let's just
grant that although I thought the cons
okay I was trying to be nice that's cool
before these agos goes ahead and slams
Chris's major point we can't take that
for granted at all the specs slow down I
think for us being constantly in the
industry I think that things move slower
than they actually do move like just
think back we're just busy roads alone
yeah just think back to the fact that a
monthly but a year and a month ago the
720p display on smartphones sounded
futuristic and out there now we have
1080p devices come si es we're going to
see in 1080p device from Samsung and LG
to be sure just once is growing so
quickly but what's but what's after that
flat there's there you're not gonna see
4k mobile displays I mean even 1080p is
absurd I like I get that the I get that
the DNA is it has an awesome display I
don't need it I'm fine with 720p and I
think that a lot of users are fine with
720p but fine upgrade everybody to 1080p
about 4.5 inches or whatever that's fine
you can't go above that either note
there will be no such thing as a 4k
mobile display and if there is it's
going to be a pure gimmick okay Chris
okay I'm being a bit too but I'm good
with this place but but there's also
with this place is the point about
obstacle lamination which has now become
pretty much standard this thing's like
gorilla glass which are making display
so much stronger and nicer we can you
talking about thickness being reduced I
mean the iPhone 5 is the thickness and
weight is for the user ID ti4 is my
buddies with this well I don't know yes
it's concerning 40 stress it Chris plan
look okay every single point that you
mentioned okay nobody not a single human
being maybe you but you're not a human
being not a single human being is going
to buy a phone because the OEM or the
carrier says it's got laminated glass
and and nobody's going to to your point
Chris there are ads and AT&amp;amp;T stores that
advertise the one x+ is having
64 gigabytes of non partitioned storage
you know letters I in the ads well
that's just sad man that's another yeah
that's that's reddit oriole way but uh
no I mean and and but but furthermore
the the the thickness race is nearing an
end and and I was speaking to an
employee of an oem recently who will not
be named who told me that they have
actually conducted research uh they've
conducted a you know focus group studies
where they've determined there's like an
optimal thickness that you like below
which users can't even detect that that
is getting any thinner and uh we're
nearing that point and once that happens
is all it's going to be entirely about
you know battery capacity and stuff so
phones aren't going to get any thinner
at some point in fact in what was it
2006 or something there was that samsung
x 8 20 or whatever it was called is 5
point something millimeters and phones
actually got thicker than that because
people realize that a five millimeter
phone was stupid so but and and the
iPhone 5 is what seven points something
millimeters so so that is that is a red
herring my point is that you were
getting to to the point with processing
power and and display quality like even
the 1x which is but you know by mobile
terms an ancient phone at this point a
processing power screen camera thickness
all these things are reaching a plateau
beyond which the like the improvements
and the user's ability to perceive those
improvements are going to be very
incremental to the point where you are
not going to feel the need to buy a new
phone every year ok so I think I think
cameras are one area where there
actually is room for improvement and
noticeable improvement because you know
my cell phone doesn't take DSLR quality
photos yet the other big thing is
obviously a battery life which is like
you know that had that's kind of stayed
stayed still for well everything else
has been you know accelerating so
quickly battery life still kind of
is a bummer on most phones and then
you're saying that processing power is
there I think you know eat in this year
alone we've seen such great leaps in
processing power moving from to like
second generation dual-core processors
to these quad core processors where
everything is getting faster and
smoother I still think there's room for
improvement there that's not to say 15
people I mean just look at much faster
like the the quad-core s4 pro is and
look how much faster the the a6 in the
iPhone 5 is compared to previous
generations like it's well here's my
point let's let me let me put this in
different terms I think what I'm saying
the point that I'm trying to make is
that if you look at a pc if you look at
it's like for example right now i'm
talking to you on a three and a half
year old imac I feel absolutely no need
or desire to upgrade it it's because it
has a core i7 it's got it came with a
king of ram a one terabyte hard drive uh
and you know there's there's nothing
that is compelling enough in terms of
processing power or what have you for me
to upgrade that machine and I think that
we're going to start to move the mobile
industry into the same or very similar
upgrade pattern that the pc industry has
been in for the past 20 years okay and
like if you look at wait wait wait wait
wait let me make a point maybe one more
point look at look at pentium fours look
at look at pentium fours from 10 years
ago look at the clock speeds of those
devices we've actually come down in
clock speed what we were at three point
0 gigahertz plus now we're at 2.6 to 2.8
so let's clock speed is is like you're
you're comparing clock speeds across
different architectures so listen I
think that in the spec race Chris's
point that we are reaching a point where
the core specs on a phone are good
enough to last more than a couple of
years is probably true in terms of
processors yeah via reticle e in terms
of battery life in terms of display
technology like the core specs I do
think that there's still a pretty good
chance that we're going to see
innovation in other spec like zones like
the camera like I don't even know
I don't know adding something crazy that
I haven't thought of that will continue
to drive innovation or drive purchasing
cycles from a hardware perspective but
you won't be NFC that's for sure the the
point is let's grant that that's
happening that we're going to hit a
point where phones are in the same zone
as computers you don't need to upgrade
every couple years to feel like you're
up to date one like all these companies
make a ton of money based on this
aggressive upgrade cycle and there are
there going to be incentivized to
continue to keep it going and I think
they have levers that they can push to
make that happen requiring a phone
upgrade in order to get a new version of
an OS for example you know continuing to
push the subsidy model in certain ways I
I think that to believe that verizon is
just you know waiting for the day for it
to become a dumb pipe is pretty what's
the word what sort naive no I don't
think that they're waiting for that day
to happen I think that that's going to
happen and they're gonna have to deal
with it right so what I'm saying is they
have got ways to prevent that day for
coming and i'll let me give you an
example that so let's look at a market
where the hardware just flat-out doesn't
matter that people maybe are on a five
year upgrade cycle if that but these
companies that control the pipes still
have a lot of power and that would be
the cable industry when's the last time
you know you upgraded your DVR who cares
right you get it once you rent it you
might upgrade to a new T Bo if you're
really into it but whatever but that
hasn't stopped these cable companies
from still continuing to exercise
obscene and intrusive control over how
we watch TV right and to think that we
you know our it's inevitable that we're
going to have a nice and free and open
system for cell phones though like the
rest of the internet just because we're
getting to a place where a you know
phones might look more like computers in
terms of their spec upgrade cycles
I think that the it's much more
complicated than that I think that you
know the fact that what the point I'd
like to make is like we've got these
insane mobile share plans where you've
got to pay per device to get on the
network right but imagine having to do
that at home with your computer like to
get on the Wi-Fi at your house like
that's insane right so why are you
assuming that that sanity would apply to
cell phone networks when they have the
power to just say no I mean the bottom
line is we talk about this like verizon
gets to decide what goes on its network
18t does to the only reason that stuff
is unlocked on ATT and and unlock works
on that network is because they're like
being nice how long are they going to be
nice when you know they're up against
the wall I don't think that they're
being nice I think that they're playing
a very very delicate political chess
match with the FCC to determine just how
how much of an asshole they can be
before before the FCC brings the hammer
down and yeah my bday yeah like the SEC
is not a grandmaster at chess like the
ATT is playing chess the FCC's playing
tiddlywinks they're playing checkers
right they don't they're not shown any
ability to exercise real power in the
past few years and I don't have a whole
lot of faith that that they're going to
and and here's the thing Chris I I want
to believe you're right that we're going
to be in a world where like we just have
got phones like we have computers and
worry free to use one I need any network
we want and you know we'll get the
spectrum thing figured out and the
compatibility figured out and all that
stuff will happen but what I'm saying is
just because specs normalize doesn't
make that world inevitable we have to
make it happen and right now we're not
making it happen why I always I
appreciate your your input
I'm now going to refer to you as a tool
of the of the carriers have no I'm
saying we've got to fight that the tool
for the carriers is just assuming that
they're gonna roll over and die they're
not no I don't think that they're going
to roll over and die I think that it's
inevitable that this is evolution this
is this is the this is the carriers
getting their comeuppance for 15 years
of of pushing these subsidy hangovers on
to its on to its customers that this was
this moment was predetermined the moment
that the first smartphone came onto the
market that it was inevitable it was a
statistical method ability that the
market would reach this point that the
market would saturate that specs would
saturate that that that customers are
going to get smart this will this ain't
going to happen and it's Anna's
companies like Google that are going to
end up ultimately pushing it I that
doesn't mean I like the Nexus 4 i still
think it's a fatally flawed device but I
think that Google is a very important
piece of this puzzle long-term wonder
what he says Martinez they're not
pushing for it anymore they they totally
they they gave in to verizon and now
they're just not even engaged they're
just like yeah well we'll just putting
it on a lock networks like that's legit
but it's not just not whatever Chris
sounds so much like the architect from
the matrix this is a mathematical
inevitability this has been built into
the system probably getting yada yada
yada I'm not convinced by christie's
argument and the reason i'm not is
because on the p ec under this upside we
still have so much blood web being
loaded on by companies and we still have
people being forced into upgrades they
don't need just by pure marketing and
shapiro and salesmanship and in fact is
you could say it was inevitable that
people will start stretching out that
great sac was longer over there but
they're not as long as they should be
just given rational information i think
it's much more likely that we're going
to build a national grassroots Wi-Fi
mesh network upon which we can use our
free and open unlock devices than we
are to get verizon to just back off and
get out of our way and AT&amp;amp;T and Sprint
and whomever look I like that business
blog that I I'm as much of a pessimist
as any of you guys and and and I know
that you all can vouch for that but I
really strongly believe that this is one
point where you are all horribly
horribly wrong and I'm not I'm gonna
laugh in your faces and and throw unlock
phones at you you know when when this
comes to fruition there's one thing I
could say against the whole spec
stabilizing and customers are not going
to be pushed into new phones every year
is that not only do carriers make money
every time that someone upgrades their
phone every year but so do phone
manufacturers and if you keep your phone
for two to three years and you know
Samsung blesses it with a couple of
software updates Samsung's not making
any money off of you after day one they
would love to sell you another phone at
six months and love to sell you another
phone again in six months so it's like
either it's going to be either pushed on
you whether through hardware or through
software or through the carriers or
whatever I don't think that any of these
companies are going to roll down and and
and and just let their cash cows you
know take two to three times longer to
cash in than they do now well one thing
to consider though is that I mean I hear
you but one thing you have to remember
is that we're still the u.s. is still
only at fifty percent smartphone
saturation or just under like every
night upset so I there there's still a
huge market to be sold into and and I
think that that OMS would feel very
empowered to be able to sell their
phones directly to consumers the way
they want at the price they want instead
of having but how many because that's
gone so well for PC manufacturer how
many others feel like the end user is
their customer though I only company
that actually feels that way is apple
and and every other OEM and and I guess
yay google now which Google doesn't
really technically produce its own
hardware but every other OEM their
customers are carriers they're not end
users and that's why they bend over
backwards to me ya know happy you're
you're absolutely right the way the
market
only works you are absolutely one
hundred percent correct I'm envisioning
a world where this is not the way the
market works right man I'm saying well
that that I want to live in that world
that you're envisioning Chris but I'm
saying that it's not inevitable it is
inevitable by speaking of you know what
we have answering machines on our land
lines wasn't inevitable the FCC had to
like pass the Carter phone and like make
it okay to own a phone instead of rent a
phone like that wasn't that wasn't just
something that was like proof magically
going to happen because of technology
like because technology is not an answer
like it has to be so you're saying give
more teeth to the FCC give more teeth to
you know the regulations them to make it
possible to make these things free and
open and interoperable but you just
conceded that the FCC does have teeth
well they did they did minutes in the
70s I think what everything that's
happened recently with LTE networks and
with the 700 megahertz auctions and
things like that have shown that the FCC
does not have the teeth that it had
maybe once add in the 70s I wasn't there
but you know that today's like the the
700 megahertz auction was Google was
involved specifically in it to push a
clause that mean that forced carriers
that adopted the 700 megahertz spectrum
for their LTE network to make it
interoperable and they can allow any or
they have to allow any device on there
and what are the carriers go and do they
go and make divide and demand devices
that are not compatible with their
competitors networks and they just like
skirt right around it can i just pick up
another point that that made which i
think is really important the one about
Apple and Google considering the end
user as their customer I think in order
for us to reach Chris's house in
scenario we need to have every device
manufacturer think in that way and work
in that way yes I'm going google aren't
just trying to sell you the device like
in Google's case Google is trying to
show you the cheapest device possible
the same is going to be true of Amazon
when it reduces its own smartphone chris
sigler exclusive he had that months ago
yeah
but the point is Apple Google and Amazon
I got to try and sell your services
which the smartphone is just a device to
reach into those services right they
make their money whether free search for
advertising for selling your music
content etc samsung at the moment
doesn't sounds really makes this money
from hardware st. 40 G which which I get
Sony and they get their money from the
carriers they don't get their money from
you because the carriers by their phones
and then they subsidize them and sell
them to you like so there that's why
they are want to make carrier XYZ as
happy as can be and that's why you see
things like a verizon logo on the home
button of the galaxy note 2 verizon i
mean even though the tramlines you're
talking about the tramp stamp these
companies anyone what VZ navigator
installed on every single Android device
which is like a costly less as good
option nice good option then what's
built into Android itself right but but
I'm just going to say all of these
companies are also quite aware of it
because we've got nokia with its mapping
software none of this other software
trying to burn yourself into a services
company room has always been aiming to
be a services company as well as a
hardware company and everyone needs to
kind of move towards using the device
again it's kind of meshes with
christie's idea that specs i'm going to
matter so much in the future and i guess
we all agree that's going to be true
which is not agree on how long the
timeline is going to be to get there but
ultimately every single one of these
vendors of hardware is going to have to
be a services vendor as well because
they're just a hardware vendor then
they're just be a puppet of verizon ATT
tune up to that point even though Apple
does offer a lot of services through
itunes and things like that it still
makes the bulk of its profits through
hardware sales but Apple is kind of
unique in that I'm gonna give this also
goes back to this discussion we had last
week about boot loaders on Android which
sounds like a really nerdy whatever
topic but like if if specs normalize and
we we want to be able to stick with our
phone for you know 34 years we need to
be able to make sure we've got the
latest software we can do what we want
with that phone it's not arbitrarily
lockdown and I mean what's the
motivation behind
locking down an android phone with a la
coupe or even you know an iphone so
you've gotta jailbreak it right it's not
you know it's not a mistake those are
happening right it's not an accident and
so in order to get to chris's beautiful
dream world of openness we have to make
sure that you know we're buying devices
with unlocked bootloaders uh we're
buying open devices so we should all go
out and buy a nexus 4 right now except
we can't because Google sucks at selling
yeah let's let's talk about this since
we're so talking about selling to the
end user let's talk about how Google is
not able to actually sell to the end
user oh can they have bungled indic they
like they put the thing out last week
the whole store went down you couldn't
even like put it on track order or
pre-order two weeks ago sorry two weeks
ago cuz i ordered what I've been waiting
for it so I know it's take took two
weeks to like figure it out and they
went live at noon pacific today and it
worked for all of like two minutes and
any people in our chat are still trying
to buy them right now like and they're
congratulating each other if they had
one go through google what this is a
deal so what's crazy about this is when
you board order something from a
standard online retail whether it's from
amazon who does everything very well
with this or ebay or Apple or whoever
might be ah the system is programmed to
be like we have X X number in stock say
a thousand phones in stock and once a
thousand orders are placed the Buy Now
button turns into a pre-order by now
turns into sold out and Google can't
seem to figure this out because Google
itself is saying if you go visit the
page now that the nexus 4 isn't sold out
we can't sell you one right now but it's
not sold out so come back later because
it's system isn't set up to handle the
demand properly which is just boggles my
mind like ecommerce has been around for
you know a major part of people's lives
for over a decade now yeah Oh Christian
do you want to go back to our argument
since you didn't get the last word I'm
sorry didn't mean to transit no no no I
was just debating how hard to make fun
of you guys that I had a nexus
more like two weeks ago and uh yeah I
the nexus for that you paid like a
fortune for because I'm just gonna turn
that right around I a Touche Touche I'm
still not buying one and you know after
all maybe I will after all my ranting
about trying to support free and open
but I mean OD say you can't well so I
mean people are saying in our chat room
they're saying that they're able to get
one into their car and then when they go
to checkout it disappears from their car
it's like this is what you expect from
one of those fly-by-night daily deal
sites and last I checked Google's not a
fly-by-night company they do stuff on
the internet so I don't I just blows my
mind how badly they bungled this not
once because the same thing happened two
weeks ago but now twice in a row but as
things that Google Checkout right goo
has offered check out services to other
parties for ages and this is not news to
Google it's some disconnect from what
its system does not say how many it has
in its warehouse to it doesn't tell its
system its purchasing system its
checkout system that it has X number
available to sell I mean that's as far
as what I can tell that's what it seems
to me also congratulations to
you
come down get her back we're back we're
on air again so the moral of the story
is that our google hangout is powered by
the same servers that play next door
yeah so we're going to we're going to
constantly be in your car and then
suddenly removed and then back in your
car and then something remove and then
you'll find a week from now that you
actually purchased eight virgin mobile
shows which will be shipping sometime in
the next three weeks um do you want
agrees hat do we want to point out that
the nexus for the the LTE chip that was
found inside it does in fact work
although only on like some random bands
and no look but Google Google should
just stop beating around the bush and by
t-mobile USA like that they like there
was when we were at Google's campus
everybody was using t-mobile pointing
that out no right and and the same has
been true since the since the nexus one
days and I mean they obviously have a
major crush on t-mobile and I think
that's largely because t-mobile is by
far the most open at the big four
largely because they have to be largely
because their networks underutilized and
because they don't have any subscribers
then it would be the one that is like
for sale I don't I don't think 18 to you
would be like okay right so I'm just
saying Google go ahead and just you know
reach into your massive coffers and make
this deal happen and then we can get
this little charade over with we all
know you're in love with t-mobile and
run every search the g1 yeah versus the
g one that's a very good point going all
the way back to the original big one yep
um well as long as we're talking about
picking phones and buying phones we did
refresh our smartphone buyers guide for
the US carriers and you know we all had
input on this and we basically decided
that in terms of a general
recommendation for most people on
verizon attn sprint we're recommending
the iphone 5 or the galaxy
yes 3 t-mobile of course is the next
four but make sure you try and buy it
from google if you can and I mean you
know we you know as always when you make
a pic people kind of go round and round
with it but we kind of just felt like
you know these are the best phones for
most people that you know if you want
android the galaxy s3 because it's got a
big enough management out of you guys
well okay what more commitment out of
you guys so coming okay I I saw of a
guide and he's just so repetitive I
totally agree but it just for pets it's
like verizon iphone 5 galaxy s pretty
well here's here's how you guys is free
you know a lot of us have been doing
these buyers guides for years right uh
and and every single year we've had to
say if you're on this carrier you should
buy this phone and if you're on this
carrier you should buy this phone and
we're recommending eight different
phones across the board yeah this is the
first time that I can remember or recall
in my experience where we've had that
arguably the two best smartphones on the
market are available on every carrier
save for tmobile which has the nexus 4
option uh and and i think that's that's
awesome we've been a just tell people
yeah i could just tell people oh I don't
care what carrier I go buy an iPhone 5
or all you want an android go by galaxy
s3 it doesn't matter what carrier but
that's what I'm saying I need you guys
to pick pick one of them that like just
pick one defensive 1 e to the FM 500 GS
free which is your favorite well I
believe we we said iphone 5 was a top
pick yeah then the secondary option was
the galaxy s3 yeah okay easy enough no I
don't think i'ma go ahead Chris I just
think I mean I hate to be I hate to beat
around the bush but I really think that
they're such different I mean look I OS
Android we all know it's a holy war like
you can't I mean you can get people
who've been using iphone since the
original iphone and they're going to
want the iphone 5 you have people been
using android for 23 years and they're
gonna want the gs3 and they're both
great platforms and but they both have a
ton of apps so I don't think I mean I in
many ways I don't think that it's fair
to say the iPhone 5 is the best and if
you don't want to get the iphone 5 you
should get a gs3 I think that it is okay
to put them both on the same i'm the
same pedestal yeah yeah i will say that
you're not you're not really losing
anything by going with the gs3 yeah and
in terms of picking the gs3 over other
android phones you know there's pluses
and minuses to everything but we just
you know the the broad range of animal
accessories the removable battery it
just you know it makes a whole bunch of
every phone makes compromises and the
compromises that they made on the galaxy
s3 tend to be the best for the largest
group of people if you desperately want
a 1080p screen sugar get the DNA if you
you know if you really want you know if
you'd like the way she see takes
pictures better get the 1 X 1 X plus
whatever but for most people this is
this is what went with now I think now
one thing that we can say conclusively
is that if you own a phone or are buying
a phone that is not on our buyer's guide
you have made a really horrible mistake
and and you should you should be ashamed
of yourself and you should probably
return whatever you bout ya to be
enemies you have warnings about the
absolute worst choices to my so if
anybody oops for those up seeing the
guide then they're beyond salvation and
correct me if I'm wrong but we took off
all the warnings to not buy blackberrys
because we just assumed everybody has
that message oh right that should be
crystal clear by now yeah you could
still buy a blackberry for multiple
black grades especially for verizon for
ungodly sum some money on contract so
it's yeah and no no topic about
BlackBerry's the funny thing is they
were always kind of a premium device
over here in the UK because you had to
pay extra for blackberry email exchange
server and all that stuff nowadays
Vodafone is doing special promotions
with pay-as-you-go freebies for
blackberry so so now it's gotten to a
stage where you have to discount it on
pay-as-you-go contracts just to get
these phones out the door it's gotten
that bad yeah I believe this year in the
US the only black right models that were
troduced into 2012 we're like the 9320
or something like that which was a very
cheap a curved variation on boost mobile
and maybe a verizon and they were paired
with these us like specialty inexpensive
BBM plans yeah they didn't require
special smartphone plan yep it's also
interesting me Chris you wrote a
four-post about this and you're actually
you were living in the world that I live
in that you know pick whatever phone you
want and then just get an iPad Mini or I
guess we could generalize this and like
just say that whatever phone you got is
fine but like I think are we all of all
four of us on board with having a small
tablet be it an iPad Mini or nexus 7
like I I love having a tiny little
tablet around with me all the time yeah
it's awesome yeah i agree i never really
thought I would um to be honest with you
because it there's so many things i do
on my Nexus 7 that are redundant with my
smartphone or redundant with my laptop
but I was we were when we were bantering
earlier before we started the show I
said you know the tablet is perfect for
when you're sitting in bed sitting on
the couch and you say you want to read
an article that's a few thousand words
you don't want to break out your laptop
and you don't want to read it all in
your smartphone and that's where tablets
and it's awesome and what makes it even
more awesome when you have something
like the iPad with LTE or the new Nexus
7 3g it's not locked to your house so
you can be sitting in a park course you
know anywhere you go and have the full
capabilities at your disposal which is
pretty cool let me just quickly say if
anybody wants me to assess the benefits
of having a small tablet they can find
one and i will use it and then i'll tell
them how i feel about having a small
tablet but i can say that i have gotten
to the point where I appreciate the
benefit of having two devices wanna be a
bigger one because going back to this
example of being on the couch or in bed
or whatever using the HTC One X is a
great example this is a such a massive
screen I can just stream things from the
BBC iPlayer or watch stuff on YouTube
etc and just drain that phone's battery
and keep my regular phone fully charged
up because if I'm just constantly using
my regular phone for everything what
would be an android phone or an iPod or
whatever you know you just use up the
battery a lot so if you have a secondary
phone where you do more battery
intensive things in that phone or device
maybe it's a galaxy note gets not to as
a nice big battery in it that just a
benefit that I can see so again being a
7-inch tablet be an iPad Mini or nexus 7
makes a little sense Vlad I i'm offering
this to you live on the show if you'd
like I could send you the google i/o
review nexus 7 so you can yeah i'll take
that the white edition yeah it's white
now I have to accept that it is just
dirty and scuzzy at home looking on the
back I guess the right stains like it is
it there's definitely a spaghetti stain
on this note for sure small tablet also
doubles as a coaster / dinner plate I
use it all the time as a coaster all the
time um and Google shirts are hanging
out right knee out yeah I'll take it out
clean it if you promise not to be
disgusted by it i'll let you play around
with this because it's insane that you
haven't played around with one it's no
detail you know that's perfect actually
you should have said it to me we should
do a giveaway it's gonna be like one of
those game on jerseys from NBA player
because i don't you have to order yours
disgusting horrible town oh that he's so
mad he just quickly he rage quit ah so
look I I don't want to I'm not going to
name any names but I will say that there
is a lot of revisionist history among
the Apple pon de tree community because
for a long time there was a strong
belief among that group of individuals
that anything beneath 10 inches was not
appropriate for for doing a lot of
things and I think that I the iPad Mini
is dispelling most if not all of those
beliefs if I could play devil's advocate
here for a long time I think that was an
argument that was used that will
just misguided because the reality was
anything that below 10 inches uh was
just a sucky tablet yeah it was a long
time where you know there wasn't
anything good there because there wasn't
any good tablet option and then you have
the nexus 7 and even I guess maybe the
original kindle fire could say kind of
changed that where you have these
smaller tablets that are still capable
devices especially with the nexus 7 i'll
say with the nexus 7 uh that and then
and then of course the ipad mini where
you know it makes sense but when we're
talking about the first 7-inch tablets
of what was it the original Galaxy Tab
was terrible device and then you know
the blackberry playbook was a 7-inch
tablet those a terrible device so it's
like I could see what they were saying
but they were just saying it the wrong
way if that makes sense that makes for
our expense and I totally agree and ever
since I mean I tried I tried the
playbook for God's sake I tried the
kindle fire the nexus 7 was was really
what sold me on this far in fact because
it was you know a genuinely good table
up the size and um you know the ipad
mini's in the same zone you know we've
talked about before i wish it was a
little bit less wide but i love having
it um i guess a lot of at how an apple
we should mention that apparently dude
get fired today I wasn't charging what
was his name guy in charge of maps
anything my guy you've never and the
only buddy he would work that he worked
it next with steve jobs and he came he's
been at Apple for like 11 years Richard
Williamson and then also apparently Eddy
Cue is reportedly talking to Tom Tom to
get there you know location data in
order so that they're not depending so
much on Yelp there was actually a story
we saw yesterday that made the rounds
that there's this um there's this famous
pot dealer in San Francisco he's like
the truffle guy he sells like truffle
pot infused things I don't know and he's
got like he's got a thing I think you do
know Dean I think you do know very well
i think you know you don't pretend like
you don't know I'm high right now
um anyway he's in like you can search
for him on Apple maps like he's there in
dolores park and you know it's stuff
like that that they just got to get
resolved what is that guys anyway so not
only is he in everybody has like 50 for
Yelp reviews it's felicity yes he's like
a restaurant basically except ee sells
pot I actually missed this story and i'm
very disappointed he's two cents
illyrius yeah just open up Apple maps
and search for like dude I'm gonna find
it it's like truffle guy or something I
have to start in San Francisco though
right yeah truffle guy just search for
truffle guy 53 of using the ALP right
there in dolores park he's been arrested
recently apparently but yeah there he is
truffle guy good times um that was a
great advertising study that we should
do more of those I is able to use nokia
here for iOS i haven't yet i haven't
used it um officially i installed it and
opened it it was like oh this is what
we're dealing with and then i moved on
with my life because it is you know we
tear it we tear everybody apart when
they do this and it's a web app in a
wrapper and that's never been a good
experience um we constantly berate
google for doing that with uh with the
gmail app we braided facebook for doing
it for so long in iOS with the facebook
app and an apple nokia is doing it here
with the nokia here maps on an iOS and
i'm searching for it in the app store
right now and of course it's not working
because the App Store and I oh here we
go finally is the worst like it's
terrible I search for stuff that I know
exists and it just doesn't appear I
always I always like when the App Store
tells me I have updates and then doesn't
show me the updates yeah so lately what
I do is I open up the google search app
in iOS and i use that to search for apps
and then i click the link to go into the
app store from there and that is way
more effective than just searching
inside the app store itself how sad is
that
yeah you guys must be looking for some
really obscure stuff Oh like what's my
sap sources have been pretty reasonable
and if enzyme searching for pretty
random stuff like like I said I think of
last podcast I've been looking at ex
supermarket apps which generally suck
and other you know London cedric things
and this ends and pop up maybe it's a
regional variation thing yeah I'm sorry
to the yelp reviews on truffle gun but
speaking of companies that don't know
how to develop apps for other platforms
we now have a outlook.com app on Android
and uh how bad is this app this bad this
app when I downloaded it and I was
searching for when the news broke I was
like this has got to be a fake app i'm
downloading like that somebody is
somebody is trolling me with a fake app
that's in the the Play Store and no it's
the official outlook.com app that looks
like it was designed for android 2.1 and
it is like the ugliest thing I've seen
in ages yeah and like they're there
screenshots they've only got two
screenshots they don't actually show the
UI they show like a random compose
window with a squ a six and then they
show like the welcome screen like come
on guys you've gotta be kidding so so
here's here's the thing that um with
this this particular thing is we always
berate google for treating iOS users
like second-class citizens with their
services and the iOS gmail app is not
nearly as good as Android experience etc
and that's exactly what Microsoft is
doing here with Android users but the
problem is that Microsoft and out look
like they're trying to capture gmail
users and part of their press release
when they announced that they had this
android app was how many gmail years as
they've attracted to look calm and how
many millions are using outlook calm and
switched from gmail but when you provide
an app like this why would anybody
switch from hotmail to gmail or gmail
the hotmail especially on Android yeah
like this is this is who you're supposed
to be selling to and this is what you're
putting out there it's I i think i felt
trolled I've just felt
um yeah sorry i'm giving a discussed
with and chat everybody's really excited
about the truffle guy shout out from
earlier today um I guess that's news oh
no we should have actually no we
definitely should point out that thought
Warren's got a piece up on the verge
about Apollo Plus which is a iterative
update to Windows Phone 8 that will
finally add VPN and some Wi-Fi fixes you
know I wasn't on board I wasn't on board
with Windows Phone 8 but now
and VPN just like NFC Oh Chris's chris
is so excited he left to go by thank you
google thank you God hey actually we can
we can try and see google just by
pointing out because I'm kind of psyched
about this you can now send up to
thinking about attachments in gmail
using your google drive which I just
like like now there's just no reason for
me to ever worry about some of something
being too big for me to email somebody
well I'm I'm you know I've been whatever
I have a big attachment I'm throwing it
into dropbox and I always worry like am
I going to move it later do I want this
link to be public here's the problem
here's the problem for me though is all
my storage that I've paid for is in
dropbox oh yeah and i only have the five
gigabytes of free google drive storage
yeah I think I well and my problem is I
you know I have two different Google
accounts and I'm you know I don't want
to pay for storage on both of them right
um so blah your hay nadie se is I was
trying to pick up koo koo sow hang out
does it kristijan one ball no seriously
does home is that where you went is he
here is he back Chris what hey are you
guys talking to me yeah Chris when we
said was that you've got it so excited
about the he had a new features in
apollo cover that you guys it was those
photos Assad I bought one of each color
of the Lumia 920 chris is busy trolling
us about DLNA and its massive epic
success what's the what's the other
standard that they're pushing with the
nexus 4 because with an air cast
miracast that's another I don't care
standard that's not going anywhere I'm
growling that so i will say on my Nexus
7 I wish that I had an airplane like
option on it because it's annoying like
if i buy if i buy a movie from the Play
Store and I watch it on my Nexus 7 and
I'm like sitting in front of my 40 inch
TV I'm like why can't I just watch this
on my TV or why can't I just plug this
thing into my TV
through an hdmi cable and I don't have
that the Nexus 7 and it annoys me ya
know it's like it's it's like actually
embarrassing that nobody other than
Apple has been able to figure this out
it's like such a basic and fundamental
thing now that we all have Wi-Fi
networks now and it makes such a huge
difference in your experience on iOS
devices that is like really stupid like
what makes air place so powerful is that
you can go into any media app on an
iPhone or an iPad and they all have that
that air play button on them where you
can shoot the content to whatever and
you can't do that you can't do that on
an Android device or Windows Phone yeah
and you know and you can't do it you can
do it a little bit here and there and
there's some people figured out DLNA and
now Google is doing this thing like they
do with the Q and now they're doing a
Google TV you are like that streams
directly to the device but not instead
of from your phone or from your tablet
and then you you know you're real
control like a smart glass is kind of in
the same zone I guess that makes a
little bit of sense but it's just so
much easier just be like from my device
to the screen and not worry about if it
you know I've got a compatible app on
the the box or on the TV right yeah I
know why isn't there like some
fundamental standard that is built into
every single smart TV still an etiquette
it's not dealin a little B miracast it's
that mere cast and that's people we're
asking for they're trying to do they
just suck at it yeah I mean what what
really where it really falls apart on
Android is the fact that there is no
enforcement of support for shooting the
media from any particular app out to
these standards right yeah that's where
it falls apart like I don't want to send
an mp3 to my phone using DLNA like I
want to send whatever app I'm using to
my TV and on that note I'm done Michelle
