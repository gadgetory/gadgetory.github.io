Windows 10 is off to an amazing start
it's the fastest-growing version of
Windows with both consumers and
enterprises we need to infuse into our
computers and computing intelligence
intelligence about us and our context
but we want to get started with Windows
10 and what that opportunity represents
to all of you and do that let me please
welcome Terry Myerson up on stage thank
you
hello developers and today we're so
excited to share with you while we've
been working on the anniversary update
to Windows 10 coming this summer for
free to all of our Windows 10 customers
but with this anniversary update you're
now going to be able to use this secure
and easy biometric authentication with
your apps for the anniversary update
will introduce a whole new Windows ink
experience our goal is to make using a
pen with your device as seamless and as
easy as pen and paper unit and this
anniversary update will come to your
Xbox one and of course the anniversary
update will come the hololens ladies and
gentlemen how y'all feeling this morning
with this anniversary update man I'm
pumped we're gonna completely modernize
the PC now let's talk about more
personal computing and getting a little
bit productive here all right make some
noise if you still write stuff down all
the time on pen and paper our goal with
Windows Inc is to really combine the
naturalness and the speed of pen and
paper with the power of a PC this is the
ink workspace all things ink are here
these are the three tasks people do most
I'm gonna jump in on that in a second
but look at this my most recently used
pen apps I can get right back in and do
what I was doing also down here tips and
tricks so users are gonna know what to
do this pen we're gonna walk you through
that all right today on Windows 10 we
have eight million monthly active users
of sticky notes and three million daily
active users so of course we're gonna
make this better I can get to my sticky
notes right here check this out I wrote
the word tomorrow and because we're
combining the power the pen in the PC is
see it turn blue
so if I touch it my homie who rocks it
reminders for Tana's easily able to come
up and actually set that reminder
72% of people still use pen and paper
here's what I want to call out because I
have the power the PC I can do some cool
stuff I have a ruler so maybe these
lines we're not as cool as out one of
them to be look how I'm easily able to
come in and rotate this I can come in
and get my mind super straight I can
come in this let's say I want to go for
a hike and I found a really cool route
just to go do this now watch what
happens this cake is gonna be smart
enough again to try and know that that's
2.1 miles watch this I can make a little
place and say here's where we're gonna
meet and then up here I'll say maybe
we're gonna stop and do some lunch and
then up right up here maybe I'm gonna go
and say here's we're gonna picture when
I turn this to 3d that egg is smart
enough to actually stick to that thing
check this out we've all done it whether
you're helping your children with their
homework or if you're teaching yourself
but look look how you this is now in
word I cross out of words it's gone
maybe I don't like this whole Erica okay
we've always had anything in word but
watch how the text is actually flowing
also if you're like me and you're not
artistically inclined maybe when you
highlight stuff it looks like this
that's cool look what happens now also
today PowerPoint does a great job at
aligning things naturally on vertical
and horizontal accesses let me show you
what the ruler can do here so two things
when I move this ruler with two fingers
I'm easy I'm able to easily control the
rotation when I use one that rotations
locked so what I can actually do is move
this down here and snap these objects
alongside this ruler and Adobe is
embracing this I'm going to talk it
through something they made for us check
this out it's very faint but that's a
stencil called a French curve it's
willfully fakes Adobe does not want
their tools to get in the artists way
all right but watch what happens
simultaneous pen and touch is enabled
with the Windows ink platform ladies and
gentlemen that is just the beginning
there is no way I could show you all
this on stage there is so much more
coming and this is an open platform
partners like Twitter Bank of America
Starbucks Hoover Disney Square Enix
Yahoo world wide wrestling and more and
Facebook will be bringing a new
universal app for facebook Instagram and
messenger to the store very soon we want
windows to home for developers so I'm
excited to announce that today we are
releasing Visual Studio update 2
and a preview of the anniversary SDK so
next I want to move and talk about web
development so today I am so excited to
announce the bash shell is coming to
Windows this is native in boon to Linux
binaries running on Windows through the
magic of a new windows subsystem we
partner with canonical to deliver this
great console experience which you'll be
able to download directly from the
Windows Store and so today I'm excited
to announce that we're adding desktop
app converter for win32 and.net apps and
games what this converter does it takes
an existing desktop app and converts it
into a Centennial what we now call a
modern desktop app so I'm also happy to
share that Sage 200 will be coming to
the Windows Store this summer hello
everyone good morning this morning we
will demonstrate how Windows 10 provides
the most productive and efficient
platform for developers of all sizes so
h2 HD running is a modern desktop
application taking advantage of all the
features that Windows 10 enables today
I'm pleased to announce Xbox dev mode
giving developers the ability to convert
the retail Xbox one into a development
kit we will also be adding a single
unified store across devices we will
also be bringing Cortana to Xbox one and
the foundation for some of the most
requested new features features like
background music will also come with the
anniversary update we'll announce new
anniversary update features for Xbox one
and Windows 10 at e3 in June welcome
onstage hololens is co-creator kudos
ánotá we're related to announce and we
couldn't be more proud microsoft
hololens will start shipping to our
windows developers and to our enterprise
partners
I love them for piloting amazing
Universal Windows applications created
specifically for mixed realities in our
new holographic landscape and today I am
honored we have dr. pamela davis team of
Case Western Reserve University School
of Medicine in two of our team members
Henry and Jeff join us today we're going
to show you some of our work on our
holographic Anatomy program Henry can
you tell us which organ in the body aids
in digestion and also makes insulin yes
that would be the pancreas to be a
little hard to see it behind the stomach
here but thankfully with hololens it's
really easy to get the best view of
things so one of our switch gears to
talk about this conversation is a
platform we can teach computers to learn
human language have conversational
understanding but we want to take that
same power of human conversations and
apply to everything else a personal
digital assistant that knows you knows
about your world and is always with you
across all your devices so this is the
rich world of conversations that we
envision people to people people to your
personal digital assistant people to
bots and even personal digital
assistants calling on BOTS on your
behalf bots are like new applications
and digital assistants are meta apps or
like the new browsers it's built
natively into Windows but it's not
limited to Windows it's going to be
available on all your devices whether
iOS Android across all of your
applications please help me welcome
Marcus ash from the Cortana team good
morning everyone sir I've got this
beautiful all-in-one with a nice big
screen you can see at the top left
corner Cortana is ready for me to have a
conversation this experience is going to
be shipping in the anniversary update
it's also going to be available in 13
countries here's an early preview of
some new experiences that will release
in the coming months the idea there is
Cortana's now in Outlook and she's look
my email send Chuck the PowerPoint that
I worked on last night sure thing I
found this PowerPoint document is this
if I can go ahead and get that sent and
we were talking about getting together
after the keynote any Michigan I can go
ahead and respond right here for my PC
Ratana knows that I'm talking about
meeting with Ben she offers to add this
to my calendar and then she tells me you
got a couple of other things there can I
help you move these in this case I took
a taxi last night and for Tana found out
that there was a receipt my email and
she's offering to help me put that into
my expense report thanks Marcus
these are our communications tools in
our case we have Outlook and Skype what
have you brought the world of box the
new applications to be able to do
anything we're moving into a world where
you will soon be able to plan trips shop
even talk to intelligent BOTS
all from within your Skype chats so
right away as you're seeing here there
are some new things in this next
generation escape you see this visual
video mail so we have a video message
with the transcript right below so in
this next generation if you have the
other thing that you'll notice in the
canvas is my personal assistant Cortana
is always there in the upper right hand
corner or even as you can see here she's
subtly improving my messages by
highlighting key points in my text like
kotas so now you see Cortana is actually
sending me a private message I'm going
to tap that and I go into the one-on-one
conversation I have with Cortana so
she's telling me the custom cake spot
would like to know my location for
delivery and yes I'll share it so right
away what you're seeing here is that the
agent Cortana is actually brokering the
conversation with the third party bought
the cups and cake spot
please block my calendar for kotas from
April 10th through April 12th and right
away the other thing you're in Lotus
here is that Cortana actually has
contacts from my previous chat with
goodies so even though I just told it
the dates it actually knows the location
and you know that it's from the
conversation with Beauty now Cortana is
proactively thinking about the next
steps in coordinating my trip so she's
actually suggesting that I connect with
the Westin bot anybody that knows me
knows I normally stay at a Westin bot
and so what you see here now is Cortana
has actually introduced the Westin bot
into the conversation but not only has
she done that she has given the Westin
bot context so I don't have to repeat
myself the Westin bot knows this is for
Dublin and it's for those particular
dates and now because Cortana has all my
relevant details the Westin bot can
actually leave the conversation now
we're seeing a third aspect of Cortana
she knows my connection she knows who I
communicate with the other thing you'll
notice is that Cortana because she has
context about why I'm pinging Danny as
she's pre-populated the text with
context around when I'm going to Dublin
and basically why I want to talk to her
and I now have the pleasure of
announcing we will also be bringing
intelligence into real-time video and
the best part is that starting today
developers will have access to our first
ever Skype bot SDK also to make this
even sweeter for developers as of today
Skype consumers will have access to bots
in our latest Windows iOS and Android
apps with hololens becoming available we
are also bringing intelligence into your
virtual conversations with Skype for
hololens
we envision a world of many
conversational canvases so today I'm so
excited to introduce a brand new
platform for creating intelligent and
connected BOTS the Microsoft bot
framework to show you what it's like I
put together a simple bot that orders me
a pizza from Dominic
I'll say hi to my bot and it'll respond
if I say slash order it'll take just a
second and there we go my order is on
its way now up next I'd like to
introduce Lily Chang who's going to give
you a sneak peek at some upcoming
intelligent tools coming to the bot
framework in the future so here you can
see a user has said can you deliver
three large pepperoni pizzas to my crib
so you're laughing so you know
and I know that my crib is slang for
house but the system doesn't know that
so it's really easy for me if I think
it's appropriate to tag it add as a
location and save well today I want to
introduce you to Microsoft calm slash
cognitive our new portfolio of
intelligent services and we have 22
api's for you to get started with for
free today all I need to do in this app
is either take a photo or upload some
image URL let's just take this desk here
and use it it calls into the new vision
api's and what it's able to do is able
to recognize objects in the image if we
also give you a confidence score if the
confidence is low you know we're not
quite sure if we're seeing what we say
we're seeing take it a step further by
not just recognizing objects but also
figuring out the relationships behind
them and then using natural language to
create a coherent description of what
you're seeing in the image it thinks
it's a herd of cattle standing on a dry
grass field so it trips up it says I'm
not really confident but I think is
Leonardo da Vinci sitting in front of
the mirror and she seems neutral face
this demo is a quick little app that we
put together to show you a service we
call Chris we had some kids here read a
book about giants and you can clearly
see that Chris gets that kid is not
talking about dancing he's talking about
giants and the fact that they love large
bags and one developer truly inspired me
this last year very close to home for us
at Microsoft I want to see what he
dreamt of I'm Sachi shake I lost my
sight when I was seven
I joined Microsoft 10 years ago as a
software engineer
I think it's a man jumping in the air
doing a trick on a skateboard when
you're talking to a bigger group
sometimes you can talk and talk and
there's no response and you think is
everyone listening really well or are
they half asleep and he never that I see
two faces forty year old man with a
beard looking surprised twenty year old
woman looking happy I can use the app on
my phone to take a picture of the menu
and it's going to guide me on how to
take that correct photo most camera to
the bottom right and away from the
document and then they'll recognize the
text read me the headings
I see appetizers salads paninis pizzas
pastas I think this is just the
beginning now um the this momentum it's
not just cuz it Windows 10 is off to the
fastest adoption</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
