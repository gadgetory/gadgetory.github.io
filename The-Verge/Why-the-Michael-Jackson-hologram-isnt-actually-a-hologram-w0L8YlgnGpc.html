and performed last night at the
Billboard Music Awards almost 5 years
after the singer's death but while this
might look like the future of posthumous
performances the trick itself is
actually about five centuries old the
projection of Jackson materialized on a
golden throne before launching into
performance of slave to the rhythm there
was moonwalking there were taped fingers
there was dancing paramilitary cyborgs
because well because Jackson's
appearance is just another in a series
of musicians both living and dead who
have had their images projected on stage
for live performances the most famous
examples perhaps Tupac Shakur from 2012
could shell a music festival the
likeness was created by visual effects
Tito's Digital Domain which reportedly
took four months to create the
projection of the rapper at a cost of up
to $400,000 and this past April Janelle
Monae in MI I performed a live duet from
both New York and Los Angeles with each
singing alongside a 3d projection of the
other but it's not just musicians
recently-elected indian prime minister
modi used it to make appearances at
hundreds of campaign rallies across the
country and it's not actually a hologram
not in the way we picture in science
fiction like Star Wars the technique is
called Pepper's Ghost and dates back to
the 16th century so while the illusion
is not a new invention the advent of
lifelike CGI has only recently allowed
us to resurrect celebrities and
musicians so did it work
reaction so far have been mixed the cgi
hits up against the so called uncanny
valley with Jackson's face looking
obviously artificial up-close there's
also some technical issues in the ABC
broadcast that were later fixed for the
official video on VEVO it also begs the
question could someone actually make a
pop star from scratch
Japan's Hatsune Miku is an entirely
digital creation voice and all inna
she's played to sold-out crowds and at
the 2006 Grammy Awards Madonna's sang
alongside entirely fictional act
gorillas so while the practice day is
still rare enough to warrant shock and
awe it won't be long before you're
paying top dollar to see your favorite
musician or speaker living dead or
completely made-up
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
