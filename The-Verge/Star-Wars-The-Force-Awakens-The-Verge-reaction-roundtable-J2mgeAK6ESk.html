verge roundtable all about Star Wars The
Force awakens not just the film itself
but literally the culture around it as
like the last year has been nothing but
Star Wars consuming all merchandising
and culture and pretty much everything
there is to have so do a little bit of
context we saw the force awakens last
night everyone here we are going to talk
about spoilers a lot so if you haven't
seen the movie yet maybe just pause it
come back to us later it'll still be
here but anyway let's let's go ahead and
get started so I'm Ross Miller I'm gonna
be moderating kind of helping everything
go along and these are the experts who
are actually going to be talking Sosa's
uh-huh so I'm Lauren Gresh I write about
space so I know something about stars I
think
I'm Tom Condon I do video so I know
something about film I'm Sean o cane I
really like Star Wars and I'm Kwame
Oklahoma news editor and I occasionally
review films cool so you're the one with
the job title here well let's go ahead
get started so this is literally less
than 12 hours ago we'd all just saw the
movie for the first time so what was
kind of your immediate reaction and also
now that you've had like a little bit of
sleep how has that changed a little bit
of sleep sleep is pretty much operative
as fact if I got to ever sleep so that
was it was great
we are literally this is a new movie to
an extent but we are still obsessed and
talking about all the old nostalgia
stuff and I think I think it's like you
were talking about earlier it is a new
new hope yeah our reviewer Tasha did a
really great job of summing up how I
feel personally it was just it was an
alternate universe version of a new hope
set in the same universe and I thought
that was very OnPoint and I fully
understand I'm gonna be in the minority
here and most people will be like yes is
what we want we don't want the prequels
where that are completely different from
the beginning we want you know what
we've know and love however I feel like
it was it was so mimic it mimicked a new
hope so precisely and it just felt like
there it didn't move anything forward
for me I wanted something new and I
didn't really get that yeah I mean I'm
willing to split the difference like I
don't disagree with you entirely and
like I'm you know I'm gonna get
but really was like basically a beat for
beat remake in a lot of ways of a new
hope like you have the desert planet
which was basically Tatooine you have
the invasion of the Citadel which is
basically the Death Star you have the
last strike in the end and the explosion
it's like all these moments even like
the Most High Isley of cantina scene
like basically the same but like enough
was different where they're setting up
all these new beats that going to happen
the next movies were these new
characters which are fully fleshed out
and it felt like JJ Abrams does this a
lot like he did this really really
purposefully in like kind of badly in
the Star Trek films like particularly
with the star trek into darkness but
like this one he did the same thing but
he did effectively the same thing this
movie but it worked because he very
clearly cared and was trying to get fans
to not only forgive the past and like
forget the prequels but also like create
this new saga within this saga today I
had a weird experience because I am
purposefully a spoiler drunky so I came
in knowing pretty much the entire film I
was like it was like I'm not gonna like
be disappointed by the fact that it is
like the same style where storyboard
kind of struggled together and shuffled
around and like that way I just like
focus on the moments to me Star Wars has
always been the moments I didn't see the
original ones in the theaters I would
just know these certain key moments like
there's a style there's a performance to
it so like yeah it's it's a it's a
reboot of myth essentially it's about
how the characters man this is JK the
story it's about the characters I the
story is so important to do so here's
the one thing I think what I wish I
would have seen is that he was very
clear one point you're like oh I get the
formula I get it and like I wish there
was just that one thing you would do
that with the formula just a bit
you know what I mean yeah like it
doesn't like you know I'm gonna let's
get into the big spoiler that Han dies
right sorry everyone but so that whole
scene is happening and I feel like
they're drawing it out like making you
think well maybe it's not because it's
so long one of the same thing you just
expect to happen happens yeah like that
was not a twist for me that was very it
was like somebody's gonna die in this
movie and then when it as soon as that
happened I was like Hans dad
it even Kris my boyfriend Scenic's me
he's like oh
about to get big everyone everyone
theater saw it regardless of the fact
that you could see the obi-wan like
foreshadowing of that but like any
easier things like even like he could
still die but you could still like put a
twist and they're like what if at the
end because like they made issues with
between Leia and Han right like what if
Han didn't like be really nice to kylo
at that in that scene like what if he
was like a stern father yeah and like
the the scenes where Kyle was like oh
he'll he'll let you down and stuff like
that like what if that came to a head
and that was the images for him to
actually call him and not just well I
have to do it cuz I'm even know what if
Han killed kylo like what if it they
just kind of went crazy I think that
would that would have been that would it
was truly shocked me we're shocked me
too cuz Harrison Ford's not gonna sign a
three-year anyone going into the film
thinking that he was gonna be around for
all three
especially because all the marketing is
doing like you know he's like I'm done
guy movie that injured him he's not
coming back so I saw that I mean I like
all of you guys saw that coming from the
moment that he sees him out on that cut
like we could rename a lot of the Star
Wars movies just like the father and son
on a catwalk I mean is like of all the
tropes they redo this was like I was
like really a catwalk again well it also
old sage dies right well so a bottom was
pick I mean where did they all go but I
didn't really mind I didn't really mind
the way that they played it like I knew
that he was gonna die but that scene was
not only incredibly well acted which I
think you can say about almost the
entire movie I think some people
probably won't love some of kylo ren's
stuff especially with his mask off but
like I thought that scene was so acted
and it could have been screwed up by
acting really easily and by bad dialogue
and I think they played it really well
and even though you knew he was gonna
die that turn I mean they give kylo Ren
that beat he has that moment where some
people in the audience probably believed
it some people probably bought like oh
he's gonna be good like maybe he's not
going to be the bad guy in the next
couple movies and then it was it was one
of a number of really subtle touches by
JJ Abrams throughout this whole movie to
happen here that I really loved which
was just not only does he turn in his
emotion
a little bit but it's right when the Sun
goes out that's powering this this
weapon and the blue on his face
disappears and it just goes to red and I
thought that was like it was really
impacting even though I knew it was
coming I loved the way they played it
and if if I if I was hoping for them to
like really change up the formula I care
less about it happening in really the
first two thirds in the movie and would
rather have had it happen with to me the
big one was the Death Star like or the
star killer base like the beats through
the first two-thirds of the movie yeah
the beats and they even make that joke
the beats through the first two thirds
of the movie I'm okay with you kind of
like rehashing them and messing with
them but knowing that that's what's
going to be at the end the entire time
as soon as you see nothing knowing there
to have to do a trench run knowing
they're gonna have to find a weakness
like that made that whole part kind of
like you could feel the air kind of get
sucked out a little when they showed it
and everybody was like man this is gonna
be where it ends which is why I'm glad
that like they really went the extra
step in like brought ray to Luke at the
very end of the movie because at least
gave it gave you one more little bit of
scenery that wasn't just like they're
celebrating and it's over let's talk
about that because I feel like maybe I'm
on the outside opinion on this but I
hated that scene scene
oh no we also joked it was like oh
Luke's just been standing looking at the
ocean for years it's not just that it's
just like if you're gonna like languish
in that moment for so long yeah just
give me something the meme of like this
shot for Mike her face to his that was
like one more shot of his face where
he's like I feel like the internet has
ruined me because like that was my
thought too when I'm watching the
ceiling I'm sure it's very beautiful my
first thought is this is a three-panel
meme it's gonna be on reddit soon as
there's a home video release and it's
gonna end with I gotta poop like that's
how it's gonna end
that's happening do you think of the
helicopter shot there cuz that kind of
sucked me out a little bit that was like
a bizarre reviewer said it was like his
favorite shot ending shot of a man
action brighter than that all's well did
too on Twitter like
it was a pattern that said that or
brinded I really love the same
difference I wouldn't find with like the
last shot being on Rey holding out and
then you cut that would have been fine
with me well I mean I think I do all of
what I think they're setting up there
which is so Luke Skywalker disappeared
after he tried to basically start a new
jedi order starting with Ben kylo Ren
and that went haywire so he felt like
Han did super responsible for this guy
becoming super evil witch like you think
he'd know that that was like a pretty
good possibility by this point with
dealing with the force but and also your
genetics he goes in exile and is like
you know we all rot whatever but what I
love what that scene sets up because
it's like this idea of like that's what
where that little head nod that Luke
kind of does and you can kind of see his
eyes welling up a little bit - it's like
she's handing him that lightsaber and
he's like no we really can't do this and
she's like obviously like no like I'm
I'm like probably gonna be the most pure
force person ever so like listen to me
and I like I like where that's gonna go
I think that's like this well that's the
tension that's gonna start the next
movie and like this movie felt like I
think Emily your shooters are this the
best day today was like it's it could in
fact be interpret isn't another trailer
like this is just exposition for a new
trilogy yeah I mean I thought they were
gonna end with the Falcon go in
hyperspace I thought they were gonna cut
it there and then when they actually and
then I was like wait no they they got to
that Island I was like oh no they filmed
they're like we've got one more scene
yeah
well that's also okay I want to talk
about the bad guys because they were the
ones I had the biggest problem with it
seemed through so absurdly evil to the
point where I was just like like I get
it the dark side is dark but the Empire
at least it seemed more Machiavellian to
me it was like they wanted to make
everyone fear them into submission by
showing these big shows of strength by
destroying a planet they didn't kill
everyone all the time we didn't have to
they're already in charge they were in
charge they were Nazis
yes believe was very clear that they
were not
I'm not sure if that's a political
entity they were Nazis like there's
there's so much more than politics for
the first-order but then here we have
what are their the first-order
and they are from the ashes of a
completely decimated Empire well what's
really great is the film doesn't
actually have to go into that and like
they didn't bother doing that and I
think that was a strength the film
actually was like making it more
ambiguous I guess but to me all it
seemed like they did was take the bad
guys and make them better take the Death
Star and make it bigger you know like
there wasn't it there was one of the
jokes that totally didn't land where
someone was like so it's like a Death
Star but even bigger yeah like I think
Maz actually says like I've seen evil so
many times first it was a Sith yeah then
it was the Empire now it's the first or
as like okay men we're all on the same
page there's a self-awareness well
that's the universe that it exists in
now is like that's basically how its set
up is like they're like The Return of
the Jedi didn't end with the Rebel
Alliance defeating the Empire it ended
with them wounding them severely by
beating their second version of their
greatest weapon that like you know
despite all the shots of like he walks
and people on course not like dancing
around it's like they had a lot of work
to do after that that's what the
original novels are really set up was
like that are hard in that part not part
of cannon anymore it's like like how do
you go apart a convincing people that
like yeah the Empire really was bad
listen to us we're the New Republic we
want to set up a whole new Senate which
is what corrupted in the first place and
so like that struggle even though all of
those specifics aren't don't exist
anymore they're starting to build those
back out in more novels and they're
trying to set up that struggle of like
how do you rebuild the society after
it's been affected by this thing the
problem is they like totally dodged that
in the movie you can address it a little
bit I think because like here's this
alright here's this giant new weapon
here's this like ten times bigger Death
Star they're gonna they're gonna use it
to do horrible unspeakable things they
aim it at like the center of the
Republic but they give that scene so
little weight and it's like yeah if it
was about it I wouldn't know who
was killed on this planet they show one
Johnny I know what planet was no it was
the hosnian system but that's all I mean
like originally when they do with Leia
they blow up her planet right and they
make us give that seen a ton of like
presents and wait because like you see
all the run through the viewscreen you
see her coming to this shot like I mean
you get like a lot of play where like I
wonder I wonder at at some point if it's
just like if it's not really worth doing
that exact thing again right like yeah
maybe like the reason that was quick was
because like if you try to put emotional
states behind it again it's just like oh
it felt like just a show of force for
the sake of it like this is their war
machine that they're going to
demonstrate their power even though
they're this highly fanatical
radicalized sect of the old Empire I
don't even think the show of force is
like like the weight is missing is like
the problem is they just disabled like
alright so here's the resistance which
is the fighting arm of the Republic
that's like trying to like bring this
galaxy back together here's the first
order like the guys that can mess it up
and they do they mess it up they kill
the entire fleet basically and they ruin
like where the new Galactic Senate is
being set up and that doesn't even get
more than a line and it's like hard to
understand like at first when those when
that whatever is happening the Sun power
turned into laser beams or whatever the
literal that stuff shoots out as a star
killer base right and it's like it's a
beam but I actually know it's like these
kind of little beams and then it like
starts to illuminate these like little
balls that are out in space which is
like so far away or something like they
did a bad job setting up like the place
of all these things and then it starts
to go towards what looked like tiny
little things I was like oh it's like
part of like a bigger like galaxy
spanning weapon it's gonna hit these
things and almost like on the Death Star
like refocus and the one bit it's like
no they was those were just four planets
that apparently hang out right next to
each other and like like yeah cuz if I'm
rebuilding an entire galaxy I definitely
want to put my entire fleet and the
Galactic Senate on four planets that are
right there right right then everyone
know
so you'd assume there's like maybe a
local government here and there but
that's not like the resistance is
probably like the new New Republic thing
everything's being set up so I wanted to
say about that yeah and I don't know if
maybe I'm on the moon or it is I feel
like that was like the strength of the
film was not going into all this right I
think so but I just a moment don't worry
I agree it needs more weight but I feel
like in the same way and there was a
couple things I thought they did well
like so captain phasma right she gets
one name call near the end of the movie
in this very simple way - like Boba Fett
call like one named Colin yes in the
second movie was in yeah and it feels
very much like the original trilogy did
where you know merchandising is gonna do
a better job of like naming and like
making these characters real things than
the actual films themselves and that
leads to like I'm excited for like the
next generation of kids to like nerd out
about that because it's not in the film
and it's like cool to know that those
facts that aren't in the film and it
feels like there are enough of those
little things that like well what is
these worlds why are they important I
feel like that can be filled with a lot
of supplemental material that nerds can
just like and I think I think that was a
be of the first Star Wars it was a
simple story with a very complicated
universe and like that's like that's it
now it's like go market it it's a
cynical way to put it in or go build
this world around it and like create
these little pockets if you want to care
about you can do it which is the loop
I'll still kind of Semak away looking at
it but like it's a beautiful way of
saying we're going to just build a world
in a playground to explore and this is
just like one part of it that kind of
keeps it like I got a through-line like
you I feel like I feel like that stuff
was the worst part of the prequels like
the big lactic stuff that way yeah I
mean that's tipping the boat too far in
the other direction
we just went to pure exposition and just
want to being completely well at the
same time it's like if we're talking
about kind of the political struggle the
power struggle I wanted a little bit
more than just the we're bad guys and we
like to kill people because that seemed
to be the main motivation for me it
didn't seem to be and I know when I was
listen to the original Star Wars also
wasn't bad
that's the thing and if you go back and
given that this is like a pretty
assiduous remake of that film then you
have to like go back and say well that
was a simple story that didn't really do
anything in terms of world building
except for what was just said plainly
and like you can do what you want in
that world and like assume things but
like there wasn't a whole lot you can
only assume so much they run a risk to
you like Emily brought this up really I
think she said it really well in the
first cast it's like there are like
horrible unspeakable things that happen
and like all the movies and like all
this stuff and they're presented in very
weird ways and you can see how like the
filmmakers behind these movies always
have a hard time trying to figure out
how to present them so like you know
Anakin Skywalker who's gonna kill a
bunch of kid Jedi's like how do you
present that without it being I mean
they probably did a really bad job with
that one but like this is the same thing
it's like okay how do they cripple the
entire Republic like let's blow up all
their planets kill like billions of
people and like destroy their fleet but
like if you if you bask in it a little
too much then you're like getting maybe
you're showing this atrocity that you
need to move your story along like a
little - you're laying it a little too
bare for like what is ostensibly a kids
movie but but yeah I mean this all comes
back to your original point which is
like the bad guys are probably the
weakest part of this movie as next - how
much it like copies the structure you
need to make this comparison it but it
felt very Abbot are like in terms of
like the bad guys were just we want this
one thing and we will do whatever it
takes to get it well that comes from
like the way that they built out those
characters I mean kylo Ren's like the
best of them all yeah as far as like the
bad guy at least that internal struggle
going yeah and he's yeah and I love I'm
so excited to see where he goes and the
next two movies especially because not
only has he been doing this sort of like
Gollum ish kind of like light and dark
struggle in his own mind and speaking to
himself but he also has like I loved is
another like kind of touch that I think
JJ Abrams pulled off really well which
is like here's this fanatical person
who's super powerful and super evil and
he wears this mask only out of this like
shameless devotion to this thing he
doesn't even understand and then to the
point that like he will willingly take
it off and be like hey look I'm just the
dude and then like by the end of the
movie he needs the mask because Rey
slashes some kinda light
just so great like and that's a great
point to that just like go into a
different place for a second like
nothing here was nothing movie was about
twists like it was built with the idea
of like you couldn't get this movie
spoiling it's fine like early on by the
way that's her son
that's Hans done okay cool like let's
take of the bask off early on like let's
just play it on performance and
execution less than like oh my god it's
a twist because that only counts once
and this is a move that's going to be
seen multiple times probably this
weekend probably everybody here right
while still setting up a ton of mystery
to go forward like like staying on the
bad guys side Snoke
can we talk about speaking of gone I
think all of us probably like kind of
fell back on our tears a little bit when
he first appears because it's like other
than that cantina scene up into that
point the movie the use of CGI was like
very sparse and very smart and not you
know it was what we've heard is that you
know this return to practical effects
but we get to that scene and it's like
here's that here's this massive person
or whatever he is and like is like the
most like computer-generated monster oh
my god he did not look scary to me at
all yeah then they pull out and I saw
the little light control panel on the
thing I was like oh good it's gonna be a
hologram and it was a hologram why not
just make it a blue hologram I could do
that like CGI I just felt so weird and
then so like obviously they're trying to
set up like you want to know who this
guy is the supreme leader it was just
the it was like such broad strokes for
for those guys and there's like
necessary master I mean that's one thing
that Star Wars is always hat right yeah
bit like there's almost always just to
sit at a time and they're almost always
master and underling yeah apprentice so
obviously they were setting that back up
again but like what's gonna happen we
were talking about this is like it's a
giant hologram he's gonna be like you
know yeah big I hope he's human sized at
least but like but like I don't know
where they're gonna bring that I
definitely not interested like I'm
curious what he what his story is and
stuff but like I didn't leave the
theater being like man I got to know
what Snoke is all about like it was just
too
it was two hands we never cared that
much like where Palpatine came from
mother he was just an entity yeah yeah
you don't even see him until Jedi so and
then like you find out in the prequels
you're like well you know what some
things are better left unsaid I think
what this film did head and shoulders
above the prequels and in some ways
above even the original trilogy was just
pure dialogue and character work because
that did the heavy lifting of the myth
building like JJ Abrams knows how to
build characters like again like cent
lost don't talk to you know like serious
like the acting throughout was brilliant
and like I think the exchange is between
my grades the exchange we didn't have
that we didn't a bad droid humor in this
movie now there's the thumbs up lighter
moment which was like that was the
Hokies part but I loved it yeah it was
smart but like going back to the scene
on the the gangway plank whatever it was
just like the subtle choices that the
actors made that like build out this
entire internal struggle but with kylo
Ren the history that Han had with him
the history that Han Han with Leia would
happen with kylo what Hal had with Luke
such that he failed and the fact that
would destroyed the new the entire New
Jedi Order like that was packed in that
one scene and creates this entire
universe around them in one area what
I'm really excited for with these films
is where the prequels had to introduce
new characters who had stories ahead of
them they didn't have backstory that
influenced what's happening in their
lives now and now we have all these rich
characters with like motivations beyond
just well I'm a smuggler and I'm trying
to be good or I'm a princess
trying to be a badass you know like but
like there's so much for the future to
go and I'm like kylo Ren is really
interested in because it feels like
exactly what you wanted from the
prequels and Anakin this like idea of
someone who's like right on the edge and
like having to live those two things I'm
like I'm really excited to see how that
plays out for three films rather than
you know the last third of episode 3
yeah just like the really right guys
like he's like the Anakin Skywalker
turning into Darth Vader that we
deserved about the one who
because he's gonna it's it's gonna get
brutal yeah he is
they made him incredibly powerful they
also made ray incredibly powerful and I
know that like this is gonna be a point
of contention I think once people see it
a little bit more and if you're if
you're really like a fan of the original
trilogy is like there was some super
power stuff going on here like these
were like some super heroes but I don't
I don't hate as much how quickly Ray
adapted to the force cuz it set up a
really cool we got to talk about ray
because it's been way too long that we
have not talked about the probably the
best Star Wars character ever yeah
honestly she was by far the best any
time she was on screen I was completely
enthralled so I think and I think that
was that also speaks to the strengths of
this room I know I've been criticizing a
lot but the best part I think of a force
awakens where are the new people yeah
like the new elements I thought were
really strong like it's like there's a
lesson learned to and like this is where
I'm like I don't care that was a kind of
reboot than you hope because they did it
the better way that she's the anti Luke
she's not a whiny little person I fully
thought she was on her own and she was
about that she was sort of down that out
which is like the coolest thing I want
to make camp in an Abbott she actually
let goes into a Star Destroyer like yeah
this is like where I go scavenging it's
amazing like they make her a capable
human being where's like she's gonna be
a badass cuz she already is so just
giving these like to a skill that's
saying everyone in some way wasn't like
a novice like Finn of course he's a
great fighter he's been dedicated whole
life Poe we know he's a great
Starfighter
like it wasn't like these are just
chance to almost were they lucked out
like everyone was a capable human being
that just happened like like when the
moment came just acted on it and like
did very convincing stuff and also like
you're saying very nuanced portrayals
like a very broad stroke
characterizations capable in a lot of
ways too not just because she can like
jump around a Star Destroyer or not just
because she can I mean you know climb
around star killer base and yeah I mean
there are like tangible reasons why she
is like this capable like strong person
in a very physical sense but also in
like emotionally like we're one of the
first scenes with her is like that whole
thing where Finn showed up in her town
and they're like on the run now because
there are there's an attack going on and
she's
like why are you holding my hand why
don't we could talk about this for a
while because like I think this is from
my favorite part of the movie because
where I was mad that JJ didn't subvert
things he suffered like every
expectation of what you expect from a
female role right right like immediately
when she Ganza Falcon and it wasn't
going well I was like oh no don't be
woman driver don't do it don't do it and
then she pulls off like that
that was the finest display of Ariel's
like effect I've seen in a long time
yeah I said it before we started I love
that this shot that like one of the
first shots that we saw from this movie
a year and a half ago with the
Millennium Falcon doing this like
loop-de-loop and like winding up up low
on the the sand was not Han Solo it was
heard making that maneuver and and that
they also they gave it weight like there
was a reason for her to get low like
they there was enough little exposition
to like not just make it a cool thing
but like she made it happen and like
every moment like the entire time she's
in that film they set up a expectation
of like oh we have to go rescue her oh
wait we got there and she seems well are
you all waiting Han Solo on like how to
fix his own ship or even if he's not
even saying it at the same time of her
which like plays for humor she's just
doing it and he's like oh and like he's
still stubborn enough as like who Han
Solo is to not thank her like there's
that one moment where like he walks away
and she just almost looks at the camera
like so great I think my favorite part
about her though is you know I there's a
tendency when at least when I see women
in film when they're strong they have
like a hard exterior you know that it's
like they can't be emotional they can't
be goofy but the best part about her is
that she is so charming and she makes
jokes and she's she does mess up - she's
not like she's not like Tom Cruise in
Mission Impossible who like can't do
anything wrong but at the same time she
still has these really great qualities
about her so as it was felt really
relatable because it was like oh I make
jokes too I can crack jokes but I can
also kick ass like Rey can you know
which left all the room in the world for
Finn to do some of that other stuff well
yeah then he was like oh sorry he's like
the livewire who like is also to
livewire II for his own good it is like
almost to bumbly for my taste but like
it were it played
like because he's boyega is just like
incredible and I had not seen until very
recently attacked the block which is
like his breakout movie which wasn't
even that big but like is a really
incredible movie and I I watched that
before this movie because I wanted to
get a sense of him and he plays such a
different character in that movie he's
like the cool calm collected like leader
whereas here he was like I said he's
like this bumbling ywír who has like
really cool motivations and stuff but he
he played it so well and it was such a
new energy to this kind of cast that
were used to I think the interesting
thing about the new cast is like I think
it's very easy to see ray as new Luke
and Finn as new han and Poe is like Rey
kind of subsumes all of those three
original characters in her way and like
it's still a new character and like the
others do that too in their way like
Finn is he wants to be Luke and he's
kind of han but he can't be that so he
has to be something different I think
the characters are new I think they're
completely new it's their circumstances
that haven't changed yeah so yeah like
you said she is very different from Luke
but she has a very Luke backstory finn
and rey are a little bit deeper but Poe
was probably the same kind of surface
level although forming as hell yeah but
I didn't feel like we got enough time
with them I felt that a lot about some
of the characters too like we got a lot
of time with Rey and Finn and I'm very
happy about that but mbta I'm like
surprised we haven't just talking about
be yeah yeah is just perfect there's
nothing else to say but everybody else I
mean they you were talking about Captain
phasma it's like they I feel like
there's so much marketing about her and
we don't even see Brienne of Tarth space
and they're going to and Kristi but you
know what put like honestly I do like I
was excited by that like I was excited
by the idea that she could just keep the
mask on the entire time and be that sort
of like faceless badass without being
like I'm a woman too you know like I
feel like that's like a trope that could
hold all the time where it's like you'll
need the metroid trope yeah you don't
need you don't need to pull the max like
she can just be that faceless badass and
like live in that yeah
but you know we've got that other saying
all this stuff and was starting you to
start wrapping up but what was
interesting was like we talked about
this is a cookie cutter script in extent
to reboot of Star Wars I don't see them
being able to like do the same thing
with Empire episode whatever is gonna be
now eight which is Rian Johnson's next
big thing like where do you see this
kind of going forward and if it was in
anybody else's hands I would be
wondering how they're gonna do this like
remix formula for Empire like that's
where it would feel like it was going
but knowing Rian Johnson Rian Johnson
like I mean I love his movies just on a
surface level but he is also I think he
is very under a lot of people don't know
who he is
I mean he's director of brick director
of looper he'll sued Brothers Bloom
which is like one of them more it's like
Edgar Wright level funny with its visual
stylings I mean there's stuff that
happens in the backgrounds of frames in
that movie that made me laugh harder
than I've left it dialog in movies and
so like he's like the perfect person to
follow JJ Abrams and take that kinetic
filmmaking style and keep things light
and fun but also develop these
characters because like he's such a good
world builder like the way looper opens
up is like this person comes into a
scene and like tries to steal something
from some guy who lives on a bus in this
like really broken-down part of town and
the guy who just like comes out of his
bus and just shoots the guy dead and it
like that was like a that was a scene
that I remember being like wow you just
told me so much about the world that
this movie is set in without saying
anything whereas any other director
would like like Christopher Nolan would
have given you ten characters telling
you about like how the world is lawless
and like it would have been totally
awful and so like I seeing how he's
gonna take this story like I've fate
that he's not just gonna make Empire
like he's gonna take it in this weird
new direction where there's this really
big struggle between Luke and possibly
his daughter Rhea you should talk about
that you should talk about that
I don't want ready to be Luke or Hans
daughter I don't want that either I
think the strength of the force in the
original trilogy is that he's daughter
she's quiet
like the strength of like the four
Simenson trilogy was that anyone could
be a Jedi you could be a Jedi and that
was undermined in the in the prequels
words like this whole notion of lineage
like oh the greatest Jedi's were
obviously Skywalker's and now that most
of Jedi are gone then it can only be a
Skywalker and the fear is like you not
you how you now have been so low and
then you potentially have Rey Skywalker
and I feel like that's just makes the
world really small it would be cool to
see another like I don't know maybe I
should roll back on that statement but
another like virgin like midi-chlorian
birth just this idea that like Anakin
was a child born that had bikes really
strong force powers like that that could
happen again for another like lineage
that's not Skywalker
I like the idea I like right yeah like
if they roll back oh yeah I can flip it
cuz I think they're that's what it looks
like they're hinting at right is like
you think oh he's gonna go to Luke and
ask Luke to trainer and maybe then
they'll set up some new Jedi Order but I
think it's gonna go the other way it's
gonna take ray showing power that like
Luke it was like oh it's not even gonna
be worth it like I'm not gonna be able
to train you yeah and there's gonna be
that and there's and then there's gonna
be I do hope we get into some of the
deeper stuff that like we'll still have
to stay in the ancillary like novels and
everything but I hope they address in
the next one this idea of like everybody
else in the galaxy like is kind of not
sure what's going on like no one really
totally knows what happened I mean
they're how the Republic died is gonna
be a big part of the next maybe two but
yeah I mean that's where I'm hoping to
see it go I think let's I think we're in
a place which really start wrapping up
so the final thought the question I want
from everybody is what is the one big
question you walked away from this film
like wanting to know that could be comic
may be made from I found a video game or
a comic book or TV show or maybe the
next film I made that was it for me I
just like what destroying the entire
Republic does like because like this
this whole effort to like rebuild
if it wasn't in this movie like you know
you come out a Jedi basically went kind
of winning the battle but then like you
really start the process of like
restoring peace to the galaxy and like
they're what they've built up was just
swept away like really really quickly
and so like how that impacts I mean now
you have this rebel resistance again
essentially and whoever I don't think I
don't know who they ship the bad guys to
is it just gonna be Snoke and like kylo
Ren and it what's left of the
first-order like how many of them were
there on Starkiller base like I I don't
know who sets up is like we know the
good people are and we know that their
resources are severely impacted so who
are the bad guys now because I'm not
totally sure I guess for me is I guess
for me is like with the reunion
potentially or just a meeting of Ray and
Luke
I would love to see an exploration of
whether or not the Jedi are are really a
force for good in the galaxy because you
touched on this and the prequels then
you know was inadequate and it wasn't
really effectively done but the Jedi are
kind of useless like yes Luke defeated
the Emperor and Darth Vader technically
speaking but they helped precipitate the
Clone Wars they helped bring about the
downfall of the Republic and Luke just
failed in bringing about a new Jedi
Order because of his nephew like can
this you know this whole notion that you
know the force is good and evil black
and white like the world is the world as
a whole is really really gray and like
everything else is very complicated and
though the whole notion I was just like
we have to hold on to the good it's hard
to actually do and I don't think we've
actually seen that yet and that's a
really good opportunity to do that in
the next movie
I think maybe my biggest questions are
just more of the back stories behind
Finn and Rey I mean you talk about Ray
but I'm really kind of curious about
Finn cuz I'm not sure if there's more to
his defection than just oh I saw my
friend get killed and I was asked to
slaughter a bunch of innocent villagers
like that sucked
also I was a janitor yeah
but also and that leads me to my other
thing it's like I feel like more people
would leave then if that's what it took
so then I feel like there must be
something deeper into why he of all
people left and maybe there's more to
his backstory who knows I mean I it
could just be that simple or it could
not but I'd like to find out I think
there's a reason they're right near the
end we hold on him sort of being
rehabilitated and I think there's a
reason why we hold on him there and I
think that ok that's why they're setting
that up yeah I mean he's definitely
coming with us for the next two movies
so I'm sure there's gonna be more to his
story too I think the one thing I'm
wondering before the future is you make
a film with such like exciting gender
politics and then you have Colin
Trevorrow probably the worst job I've
ever seen with drastic world yeah in
terms of that like two huge offensive
wait yeah yeah they're like I I don't
equate like this film and how excited I
am to see that character evolve and grow
and have her journey possibly end by
with his direction it scares me terribly
it's funny how much we have time up we
have time to fix it how much we've
talked about trying to get away from
like the original now that we've sort of
we've used a new hope again to like
launched up this new part of Star Wars
and like we want them to get away from
some of that original stuff but like now
we're seeing like Rian Johnson really
could make like the the deep but still
action heavy Empire kind of movie and
then Carl and Trevor can come in and
make like the schlocky Return of the
Jedi and like but then I what are
calling Trevor Rosie walks
I wonder yeah the thing that we've all
really avoided here we've treated this
like it's just another trilogy and it's
gonna be you know like what is it going
to be like when we get to the end of it
and Chris plant brought up we were
talking this morning like a really good
point like there's no end of this like a
lot of people have written like the
really smart line like we won't be alive
to see the last Star Wars movement I
like the implications of the line really
hard in line I looked at my wife and I
was like we're probably gonna take our
kids to the like 10 years and we'll take
our kids to like the continued
sorry and like it's just gonna always
probably live with us because it will
probably keep making money no matter
what and I hope it ends a trilogy at
like Episode nine and like they just
take a break for it ups attend do you
like sixteen thousand spin-offs right
but you're probably right yeah I mean I
think that cycles I mean they're already
doing spin-offs like oh I would say
though that like this film if if this is
true and we will have to start with us
for the future
it was a really great start like I think
in the day I left the movie kind of like
back and forth and if I really liked her
if I was like okay with it but like as I
like platform to start with and like I
think the bridge seemed to like it felt
like a bridge film into this world then
like yeah we are gonna live in this role
of Star Wars for a while and the world
that they built was a great starting
point so it's a great TV pilot which is
a JJ honestly being blamed in Lindelof
more okay and on that note I want to
thank everyone for joining me I would
thank you guys for watching at home if

different take our three brilliant film
