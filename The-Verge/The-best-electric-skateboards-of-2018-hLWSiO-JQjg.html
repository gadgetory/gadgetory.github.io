everything these days from cars to bikes
to scooters but one of the most fun
things to ride with an electric motor in
it is an electric skateboard and believe
it or not the markets actually grown
enough over the last two years that some
of them are pretty useful now especially
in cities you can even use some of these
to replace other transportation options
a good electric skateboard should have
more than just a few miles of range it
should also be fast not just because
that's fun but because you need the
speed to be able to get around obstacles
and avoid danger it should also be able
to stop really well too and it'd be nice
if it was cheap but most of the best
ones are still pretty expensive so you
want to make sure you're getting the
most for your money unfortunately it's
not that easy to find one that takes all
those boxes but if you choose carefully
you can find something that gets you
really close and still lets you have a
lot of fun big surprise the best
electric skateboard comes from a company
called boosted and the best one that
boosted makes is its new boosted Plus
which takes almost every box on the list
the plus has an advertised 14 mile range
which is really more about 10 to 12
depending on how you ride but that's
enough to cover most trips without
charging I can make it all the way to
work and back to my apartment in
Brooklyn without charging in between and
that's about a 12 mile round-trip and
more casual rides you basically never
have to worry about charging boosted's
boards are also super durable the Plus
like its predecessors is really flexible
you can basically jump on it and never
worry about it breaking and you can even
ride the board through water it's also
fast with a top speed of about 20 miles
an hour which is frankly as fast as I
ever want to go on an electric
skateboard but more importantly it has
really good braking which is something
you really need what you're going 20
miles an hour I also find boosted's
longboard the easiest to ride out of all
the other options it has really big
wheels which grip the road really well
it has four different ride modes you can
start off slow and maybe most
importantly booster just makes the best
remote it uses a spring-loaded wheel to
accelerate and brake and there's just
the right mix of tension and play in
that wheel so that the movements aren't
too sudden so you go flying off the
board loose it also makes the best app
of any other electric skateboard company
out there which shows you stats like
range it has an
domitor for how many miles you've
traveled it's just the most robust look
at all the stats that you've generated
while riding its boards the pluses size
makes it easy and fun to ride but it's
also one of the board's biggest
drawbacks at 16 pounds this thing is
just not that easy to carry around when
you're out riding it and the charger it
comes with is also pretty unwieldy
though the longer range means you
hopefully won't have to carry that
around as much another place where the
boosted plus loses points is its price
even though it's cheaper than the last
model it still cost $1400 but so much of
the competition is at or over that
thousand dollar price point that I'd
argue this is where your money goes to
the farthest for a completely different
kind of ride boosted's new short board
the mini is a smaller counterpart to the
plus it's a stiffer board so the ride
comfort isn't quite the same and it
weighs about the same at about 15 pounds
but I'm fine with those trade-offs for
the price the base-level mini starts at
eight hundred dollars and has about
seven miles of range and boost it sells
an extended range option that goes up to
fourteen miles for a thousand dollars
they're the smallest and cheapest boards
boostin has ever made but they offer so
much what I love about the big boards
the durability the app the ease and
speed of the ride in a smaller package
that's hundreds of dollars cheaper one
of the only drawbacks about the boost of
mini is the ride comfort everything
feels like it rattles around a bit more
because of the smaller wheels stiffer
deck and the shorter wheelbase
this just ultimately means you have to
be a lot more careful on the mini with
bumps and cracks in the road while it
might be able to match the boosted Plus
on range when you have the extended
range option I didn't necessarily want
to ride it on the same kinds of commutes
that I was doing with the longboard
because you just have to be way more
careful so if you want the quality of
the boosted longboard experience but in
something that is cheaper and definitely
easier to carry around the mini is
basically better than any other electric
short board out there or let's put it
another way boosted isn't the only
company around making electric
skateboards but based on our experience
they're definitely the farthest ahead
one of the only other startups to
generate as much buzz about their
electric skateboards as boosted is a
company called inboard and their m1
skateboard is really the next best
option out there at $1,000 it's cheaper
than the boosted plus but it only has a
seven mile range what's cool about the
m1 though is that
easily swap oval batteries and inboard
cells spares for $200 a pop so you can
effectively double or triple your range
depending on how much you want to spend
the m1 has a stiff neck like the boosted
mini though it's almost as long as the
boosted plus I actually like the
flexible boosted deck better but the m1
is pretty smooth and some people prefer
the stiffer deck especially at higher
speeds it also has motors integrated
into the wheels which means you probably
won't have to worry about maintenance on
things like belts as much and it means
the m1 actually coasts pretty smoothly
two inboard does a lot of little things
right - they have a really good app that
shows you stats and helps you update the
board's firmware it has a pretty good
remote not as good as boosted's but
still one of the better ones out there
and there's also tail lights and
headlights on the board which is good
because it just helps you stay noticed
on the street overall it's a really
impressive first try from what's still
relatively new company and it's not a
bad option in place of what boosted
things one of the few boards that
actually matches the boosted and the
inboard on performance right now is the
actin blink Quattro it uses motors in
all four wheels for a top speed of 23
miles an hour and it has a range of 22
miles but the Quattro is a nightmarish
product first off the braking is just
really bad there's basically no way not
to stop suddenly which is basically a
safety hazard
it weighs 25 pounds which means it's the
worst to carry around the remote is
really bad and it cost $1,700 Acton's
made a name for itself making some weird
electric right Able's and even a smaller
electric skateboard before but the
Quattro is just nowhere near the quality
of these other boards that we've been
talking about there are a lot of other
options for Electric skateboards and
long boards on the market now there's
modular versions there's off-road
versions there's some with really crazy
range but the problem is a lot of them
are still really expensive and also a
lot of them are just kind of junk the
truth is there's still no great and
cheap option here so if you want to make
sure your money goes the furthest with
great range impressive reliability and
awesome performance there's nothing that
beats what boosted has to offer
hey thanks for watching I knew there are
a lot of other Electric skateboards out
there so let us know in the comments
which one you like the best and make
sure that you subscribe to the new verge
