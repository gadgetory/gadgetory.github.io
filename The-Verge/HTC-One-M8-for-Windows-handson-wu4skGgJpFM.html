and we are taking a look at the HTC One
m8 for Windows it is quite literally an
HTC One m8 running Windows Phone it's
the exact same hardware as the Android
version that was released earlier this
year it's got the same single unibody
metal frame same 5-inch 1080p display
the same duo camera on the back with a
four megapixel ultra ultra pixel camera
it's also got the IR port up top here as
well quite literally the exact same
hardware as the Android version but it
is running Windows Phone 8.1 Update
which is the latest software from
Microsoft
it's got Cortana built in it's got
various tweaks to the Start screen here
you can have folders and things like
that you can hide the on-screen buttons
here so it's a latest software for
Microsoft it also has a couple of things
that HTC has added to support the duo
camera and the other unique hardware
features on the m8 HTC has built its own
camera app which will look really
familiar to you if you are familiar or
if used with the Android version the
camera app supports the same type of
after-the-fact features that you can do
with the duo camera on Android it's got
the you focus and the foreground ER and
the 3d dimension things so you can tap
to refocus using you focus just like you
can on Android HTC is also included it's
blinkfeed service it's now an app that's
on the Start screen but it looks pretty
much the same as it does on Android and
then finally HTC is also built its Sense
TV app for Windows now so it supports
the IR port on the top of the m8 so you
can program your TV and cable box in
there and use the device as a remote the
HTC One m8 from windows is available
starting today from Verizon's website or
you can pick it up in Verizon stores
tomorrow and it's priced at $99 with a
two-year contract
