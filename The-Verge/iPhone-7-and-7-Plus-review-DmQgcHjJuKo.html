we're going to talk about the headphone
jack but let's start with something fun
the iPhone 7 is water-resistant it's not
quite as water-resistant to Samsung's
phones but it's still not gonna freak
out if you get it wet and that's awesome
the new iPhone 7 and 7 plus look more or
less exactly like the iPhone 6 and
6-plus from 2014 there are some small
differences like stereo speakers tweaked
antenna lines and bigger camera bombs
but the biggest change in the new iPhone
is the removal of the headphone jack
it comes with lightning ear pods and a
dongle for using your old headphones
which costs $9 if you lose it Apple's
forcing a big change by taking away the
headphone jack and the ecosystem around
that change is pretty immature this is
all going to be really inconvenient
while everyone adapts and builds
adapters Apple is also pushing wireless
audio really hard and I got to try out a
pre-production set of ear pods the new
wireless earbuds
I can't review them since they're
prototypes but they worked pretty well
even though every single person I showed
them to thought the case looked like
dental floss apple says it needed to
take out the headphone jack so could add
all kinds of other new features to the
iPhone 7 like better cameras the taptic
engine haptic feedback system water
resistance and maybe most importantly a
bigger battery so the real question is
whether all that stuff is worth it and
whether it's worth upgrading the iPhone
7 while the world around us is still
adjusting the biggest io change in years
the iPhone 7 is one of the most
beautiful refined designs Apple's ever
made particularly the two black ones
where the antenna lines blend right into
the sides of the body but let's be
honest the second you stick this thing
into a case it looks just like the
iPhone 6 the galaxy note 7 might have
problems with exploding but from a
visual design perspective Samsung's
definitely pulled ahead this generation
inside the case these are completely new
phones though with a bunch of
interesting ideas take the home button
for instance it doesn't move anymore
instead it's totally solid the taptic
engine makes feel like a click when you
push down on if the phone is off doesn't
move at all you can set it to three
different levels of feedback but none of
them feel like a real button I'm ok with
this but other people have tried my
phone really don't like it your
gonna have to try it yourself to
understand it the taptic engine also
adds all kinds of other fun feedback to
the phone when you drop the notification
shade down that phone bumps a little bit
it's way more useful than 3d touch which
I always thought was a gimmick and still
hasn't really caught on the iPhone 7 and
7 plus also have the new a10 fusion
processor it's fast but it wasn't
noticeably faster than my iPhone 6s plus
during my boring day to day use
I'm sure high-end games and other apps
will eventually take advantage of this
new processor but that'll take some time
the real news with a10 fusion is it has
four cores
two of which are special low power cores
that means a phone can use less power in
out stressing it saving battery life in
about a week of use I got 8 to 10 hours
a day of battery life with the iPhone 7
and about 10 to 12 hours of battery life
with the 7 plus that's pretty much what
Apple claims but depending on how much
you use your phone during the day it
could be just the same as the 6s the
other big news the iPhone 7 is the
improved camera it's improving over the
6s but it is not a huge lead but it's
about the same as a galaxy s7 the front
camera on both new iPhones has been
upgraded to a 7 megapixel sensor while
the rear camera on the regular iPhone 7
has a faster F 1.8 lens and optical
image stabilization both which improve
low-light performance and the 7 plus has
a radical dual camera system on the back
with two 12 megapixel shooters a
wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens the
two cameras work together as a single
system so you can smoothly zoom from 1x
to 10x and eventually Apple will enable
some fancy depth tricks that will blur
the background like a much fancier
camera here's the thing the camera is
only a little bit better day to day you
might not notice it but at the edges of
performance in low-light with extreme
detail it is noticeably better the major
tells are that the sevens wider aperture
lens leads to a slightly softer
background and colors are a little bit
more vibrant straight off the camera and
where you'll really see that increased
vibrancy is on the iPhone 7 screen which
can display a much wider range of colors
than the 6s it's a very noticeable not
only is a screen warmer than the success
display but photos look amazing on it
you can definitely tell a 7 photo apart
from the success when you look at them
on the 7 other phones with dual cameras
the honor 8 let you do very impressive
focus tricks Apple says a forthcoming
software update will enable a similar
depth effect for portraits but for now
what you get is the ability to switch
between 1x and 2x modes by tapping a
button and digitally zooming between
them and then up to 10x front cameras
are almost more important than rear
cameras in our snapchat world and the
iPhone 7s front camera is excellent it's
not quite as wide angle is Samsung's
cameras but it's bright it's sharp and
the retina flash is still a terrific
idea the new iPhones are on iOS 10 which
is a terrific upgrade over iOS 9 it has
a slick new version of iMessage with all
kinds of new features a new version of
Siri that can be extended by third-party
apps better integration with smart home
devices and a ton of other new stuff of
course you can get iOS 10 on any recent
iPhone so it's not worth buying a whole
new phone just to get it but it's
definitely worth upgrading in general
the world just isn't ready for the
iPhone 7 the most interesting feature of
the dual camera doesn't ship at launch
apps have you been updated to use that
taptic engine the entire ecosystem of
new headphones and adapters required to
make use of lightning and wireless audio
is just getting off the ground right now
using the iPhone 7 in case feels just
like using an iPhone 6s with a weird or
home button and more dongles it's kind
of like Apple shipped a prototype of
next year's iPhone disguised as an
iPhone 6 that's not all bad the iPhone 7
is a terrific phone with a great camera
in a gorgeous display if you need a new
phone right now
sure buy one the iPhone 7 starts at six
hundred $49 for 32 gigs of storage and
goes all the way up to nine hundred and
$69 for a seven plus with 256 gigabytes
of storage but unless you're excited to
live that early adopter life you won't
be missing out on much if you wait
another year
so good one more the brightness needs to
come down</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
