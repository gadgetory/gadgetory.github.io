spiring 5k display to the 27-inch iMac
it was the best screen we've ever seen
in an all-in-one PC and move the company
closer to putting Retina displays on
every Mac now it's 2015 and Apple has
almost hit that goal with the launch of
its latest IMAX the display is even
better and now there's a smaller 4k
version that looks fantastic in its own
right on the outside Apple's new iMac
sticks to the same aluminum and glass
design a tad for years now the ports
around back are also unchanged two
Thunderbolt 2 ports 4 USB 3 an SD card
slot headphone jack and Ethernet there's
no USB type-c which is a real pain since
you've got to reach around the iMac to
plug anything in so a reversible plug
would have been real nice but then you
get to the screen and it's crisp
impossible to distinguish pixels there
are 14 point 7 million pixels in the
27-inch model 9 point 4 million on the
new 4k version at both sizes the new red
and IMAX can display a wider color
palette than before making everything
you see more vibrant and true to life
it's not something you always notice in
daily use but professionals will
definitely see the difference these new
iMacs are also a perfect way to watch
and edit the 4k video clips from your
smartphone say an iPhone 6s plus which
is what we use to shoot this entire
video inside both IMAX feature upgraded
faster chips Intel's new skylake
processors power the big one
though not the 4k model don't be too
worried about that
since both machines are plenty powerful
the smaller one lacks any sort of
dedicated GPU so it won't do much good
for gaming and whatever you do make sure
to upgrade the hard drive because apple
sticks a painfully slow 5400 rpm hard
drive and the cheapest IMAX so moving up
to a fusion drive or SSD is essential
along with the new IMAX come new
accessories
Apple has redesigned its magic mouse
keyboard and trackpad and all three are
now rechargeable the Magic Trackpad 2
has seen the most changes it's bigger
it's white and now supports force touch
just like Apple's Mac books if you push
a bit harder on the trackpad you can
look up words in the dictionary or see
addresses and maps or preview links it's
useful stuff but it's also the kind of
thing most people probably just forget
about
keyboard and mouse have seen slight
design changes and you'll have to charge
the ladder by plugging a lightning cable
into the bottom it's kind of weird but
thankfully all three lasts a month once
they are charged so those are the new 5k
and 4k IMAX they're super powerful and
both have amazing displays these are the
best IMAX Apple has made yet but they're
also not exactly cheap
you'll spend at least $1,800 for 4k
model that works the way you want it to
mm if you want something really great
and the bigger one also claims way over
$2,000 once you add a fusion drive or
that new Magic Trackpad but those are
prices worth paying because apples IMAX
are already the best all-in-one PCs when
you factor in design performance and
customer support now they're far and
away the best-looking ones - and they
come in two sizes</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
