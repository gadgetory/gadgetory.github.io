with Apple because you you have a
relationship with Apple and in fact I
and I don't know I don't know what your
relationship with was like with Steve
Jobs and I do want to talk about the
post Apple jobs but I know that you guys
had talked at least one time I was like
standing off to the side I think maybe
when you met him I don't know if you've
met you had met him before this I think
it was maybe the iPhone 4 after the
iPhone 4 announcement right is that the
first time was it the first time you met
him that was so I was standing like off
doing some photographs of it and I saw
Jobs come over and be introduced to you
no no no no job doesn't come over to
even rato you were they say they say
would you like to meet Steve right and
then you're like you were brought down
there were some but there was something
there was somebody drifted in one
direction okay Caitie cotton asked me if
I'd wanted to meet him and and I
actually said to her I said has anybody
ever said no to that she said no right
and and I and I saw you guys wrap it a
little bit did that does that
relationship go beyond that I mean did
you guys did you email know each other
did you ever have any no because he
actually they actually Jobs actually
cited you as a response to what was this
over was this flash or it was either
that it was either the dev tools when
they kind of banned third-party devs
yeah there's something to do with flash
and and you had written a big one of you
guys remember this but there was a lot
of controversy about the app store and
the kind of tools you could use or flash
it was one of those one of their
controversies about things we don't want
on the iPhone right and you would
written a big piece on Darien fireball
all right and job said go read Darren
fireballs post on this because we think
this sums it up for us and we think junk
goobers take on this is insightful and
not negative is that what is that yeah
how was the traffic on that it was just
crazy I mean it really was it's died far
and away the most traffic post and that
wall it was is one of those things were
some random guy emailed Steve Jobs some
other guy like a developer you know
somebody nobody had heard of right had
emailed Steve Jobs and Steve Jobs just
wrote back this one line john Gruber's
we think john Gruber's take his
insightful and not negative and that was
it he responded in an email and then the
guy who did that got the email and
you know where some people would get
emails from Steve Jobs and then put it
on a weblog and say Steve Jobs sent an
email and everybody goes nuts it's at
the top of tech meme you know the next
day yeah that happened yeah so it's like
second or third hand though it's some
random guys site you know which never
got big traffic I mean you should have
just been sending out those emails as
Steve Jobs it was easily like a 25% bump
like they know like if you look back at
like my month-to-month stats it was
easily like 25 30 percent higher than
the month before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
