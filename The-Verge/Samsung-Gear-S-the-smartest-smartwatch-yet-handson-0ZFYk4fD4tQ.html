this is the Samsung gear s it was
announced last week but this is Samsung
as you know SmartWatch it's running
Tizen and the different thing about this
is it's not really actually in need of
your smartphone very often it has a 4G
connection and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and
everything it needs to basically run all
by itself it's not designed to replace
your smartphone so much as just let you
leave it home for a while so the best
new thing about this it's running Tizen
and the best thing is that it actually
has good notifications so you can see
the full text of somebody who texts you
or calls and you can actually just call
them right back and you can do pretty
much anything you need to do from your
watch itself you can send emails back to
people from the watch you can say hey I
don't know who this is that I'm texting
but you know that's okay
hey guys okay you send text message and
it's done it has a lot of the same Tizen
apps as some of the other watches the
app store is a thousand strong and
getting bigger all the time it has all
the S health stuff it'll measure your
sleep and your steps and all kinds of
and stuff the biggest problem that it
still has is that it's just big it has
nice looking watch faces s voice is
handy being connected this way is great
but it's just going to be big on your
wrist it has a really lovely 2 inch
curved OLED display that looks really
great but it's just big on most people
the replaceable watch bands will make it
a little easier for a lot of people but
I think having a watch this big is still
going to be a problem for some people
but this is the Samsung gear s we don't
know when it's coming out we don't even
know if it's coming to the US yet but
this is at least for now the latest and
greatest Samsung Smart Watch
hey guys thanks so much for watching
