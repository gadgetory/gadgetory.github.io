that was involved in making hardware,
I wouldn't have started the company.
When you start looking at
the lists, it's daunting.
Did you ever really think about
tariffs up until recently?
Was this a thing that
you tracked closely?
No. Not at all.
It's been a bit of a wake-up call.
Even us, like we
were watching it in the news,
we weren't really thinking about it
until we got the bill, and were just, like,
“All right, we have to up our costs
because, you know, we
can't just eat that stuff.”
The US basically wanted to renegotiate
the current trading
relationship with China,
and the tariffs were the mechanism
the Trump administration chose to sort of,
in effect, force China
to the negotiating table.
Friday, President Trump
slapped a 25 percent
tariff on approximately
$200 billion
worth of Chinese imports.
We'll take in well over
$100 billion a year.
We never took in 10 cents
from China, not 10 cents.
President says China
pays the tariff, but it's
US businesses and US
consumers who pay, correct?
Yeah. I don't disagree with that.
Again, both sides, both sides, will suffer on this.
Gadget makers are subject to
political policy just like everybody else.
Over the past year, the
United States and China
have been in a trade war that involves
both countries putting
tariffs on various goods.
The consequence has been that
independent gadget makers
who already might have
small profit margins
are having to rethink
how they do business.
Unlike some other aspects
of their jobs, tariffs are
totally outside their control,
yet have major implications.
Companies are reacting to the tariffs,
and consumers might soon see the effects.
(bouncy electronic music)
So I’m Zolty. We are in Breakfast,
which has been around about 10 years,
and we are a group of
multidiscipline designers,
artists, and engineers who make kind of
the most high-tech,
crazy art installations
that are happening in the world right now.
We try to actually make one-offs.
I'd say that is our specialty.
It's just not the most efficient,
and it is the most costly.
Breakfast creates
large-scale installations
that can end up in
museums, building lobbies,
or anywhere that wants to
show off inventive art.
Their most recent project is Brixels.
These are Brixels.
Brixels are something we
came out with in October,
essentially as one of our new mediums.
So motor, PCB, all of that just plugs into
another PCB back here, and then
there's a timing belt that spins this.
This is how the new version works.
So with importing stuff,
what do you get?
How does it come in?
I mean, you're
looking at all of this.
This is actually a good
setup right over here.
How many of these pieces are
getting hit with tariffs?
I'd have to go check the slips,
but at the end of the
day, almost everything
I'm looking at is steel, aluminum, and PCB,
and all of those things get tariffed.
Right now, the US
puts tariffs on hundreds
of billions of dollars
worth of Chinese imports.
This means that if a company imports
a tariffed good into the US from China,
they're going to see that tariff cost
reflected kind of like a sales tax.
Every product that's made
is given a very specific tariff code,
and these codes form a
classification system.
Raw materials and parts like steel,
aluminum, and computer chips have
their own codes that have tariffs
placed on them when imported from China.
These codes are selected somewhat
randomly and are subject to change.
Right now, it also means that a code
for a fully assembled good that's imported
might not be tariffed, even if
that complete product contains parts
that would be tariffed on their own.
This means the cost of production
for the companies that
use these parts goes up,
and they need to figure
out a way to make up
that extra cost,
especially if the situation
goes on longer than it already has.
Zolty's team has considered getting
their supplies from the US,
but the raw materials come
from China regardless.
So whether it's Zolty
or the US supplier,
someone's always going to
end up paying that tariff.
I mean, this is a good example of…
this was made in Brooklyn,
this was made in China,
and they're pretty much identical,
but one costs half the amount,
and that's the one that comes from China.
And on top of it, they have to
pay the tariff to get this in here.
The Brooklyn people.
I mean we have to pay it the same way,
but this is kind of the situation
where if the whole goal is to be
creating more jobs in the country,
you know, if you put the tariff
on this one, it's half the price.
So even paying that tariff,
if we're trying to keep our costs down
it doesn't convince us to go over here.
I'll continue to say if we can
pay the person here to do it and we can
make the business work,
then we would do it.
But, you know, at the scale and the amounts
that we have to pay for this stuff,
we wouldn't be able to sell these things.
Technology's running our lives.
You know, it's obviously
our phones and tablets,
and it's governing everything around us,
our data, our houses, our communication.
But most of us don't
understand how technology works,
and we can't be creative with it.
We can't be creative with electronics,
and so littleBits was
kind of an answer to that.
Ayah founded
littleBits in 2011.
The company makes magnetic modular pieces
that help kids learn about engineering.
littleBits are a product that
could be subject to tariffs
so their VP of operations, Diana Pincus,
monitors the situation closely.
Luckily for us, in the
first round, no impact at all,
and only in the second and third
did we start having a few parts
that we were bringing
in really get impacted,
and so we don't really know how to
predict what's coming. But
we have a few components
that are impacted that
we pay the tariff on.
What are those components?
One, in particular, is a,
we call it a tackle box.
It's basically a plastic container
that we send with some
of our larger collections
for people to put their product in.
So it's a piece of plastic. In the
third round, that was impacted.
That's so random, and it's funny
because it's maybe like the least
technological thing that
you guys actually ship.
Yes, exactly.
In the history of littleBits, we had
been buying our bits from China
and then doing final assembly in the US.
We actually moved that
full assembly to China
right toward the beginning
of my tenure here.
So before any of these tariffs,
but even with this new scenario,
we would still make that same decision
because it's still cheaper
for us in the long run.
Tariffs are complicated, as are
the political circumstances
that caused them most recently.
Brad Setzer is a senior fellow
for international economics
at the Council on
Foreign Relations who has
studied and monitored the situation.
From what I understand,
if you build a phone,
let's say, completely in
China, it isn't taxed?
It doesn't have a tariff.
Whereas if I import
the chips or the PCBs or whatever
into the US and then build my phone here,
I'm going to be paying tariffs
on those specific parts.
That is now basically true.
That's a consequence of the decisions
that the Trump administration made.
In broad terms, the US imports
a little over $500
billion from China.
In broad terms, we in the US have put,
or the Trump administration
has put, tariffs
now on $250 billion of that trade.
The half that was left
out without any tariffs,
in general, is final consumer goods.
So fully, clothes, assembled
computers, cellphones.
The things which receive tariffs
either at the 25 percent
rate or the 10 percent rate
tend to be intermediate goods, parts.
It's a little bit arbitrary, though,
and I think that's what
you just highlighted.
We, in many cases, have tariffs on imported
electronic components,
but not on the final good.
Does that cost
eventually get passed down
to the customer, or how do companies
typically make up for
that added cost to them?
So a company has a choice.
One choice is to raise their prices.
They try to pass on the increase
in cost entirely to the consumer.
They run the risk of
seeing their sales fall
and the consumer ends up
paying a higher price.
In some cases, companies may decide,
Hey, it isn't in our interest,
even though our costs have gone up,
to fully pass that on to the consumer.
We have competitors.
Those competitors aren't
producing in China.
They're not going to raise their price.
Let's absorb some of
the increase in our cost
through reducing our profit margin.
And then there will be
companies which say,
Hey, I want a better
deal from my supplier.
I want my supplier to cut their price.
Otherwise, I will find another supplier.
In which case the tariff is, to some degree,
borne by the producer in, say, China.
I think the empirical evidence
on the last round of tariffs is that
the bulk of the cost has
been borne by consumers.
At this point,
the Trump administration
is going to pursue tariffs if it
thinks it'll advance its goals,
and us consumers, we're going to
have to deal with the consequences.
The gadget makers, however, will
keep on doing what they always do:
churning out new products and adapting to
whatever challenges come their way.
For anyone maybe getting into this space
or making things, making
products, whatever it might be,
I think you could look
at the tariff situation
like any other real business problem.
I wouldn't say that it's so different
than other things we've experienced
in that contingencies is crucial.
So like if you're going to go and build
a company on something,
you can't expect that,
you know, we live in this perfect world
where you're always
going to get the same stuff
and it's always going to be the same price
and it's always going to show up
when it's supposed to show up.
So this is kind of just one
of the bumps in the road
of business, which is
you need to make sure
you're compensating for
the stuff you don't know
or don't see coming down the pipe.
My advice is: start a
company with a mission.
It's the most powerful fuel you could have
for the kind of business that we're in.
I think, in general, but also particularly
for the kind of business that we're in
because when things are tough
and you're having a hard
time because of tariffs
or because of supply chain issues
or because of a copycat or because of
all sorts of things, the
mission keeps you going.
And I think that there's no better thing
to advise an entrepreneur to do
but to really make sure that
you're feeling the mission.
Thanks so much for
watching In the Making.
If you haven't seen all the episodes yet,
make sure you go back and watch those.
I'm going to be gone for a little while
because I'm going to be working on
my podcast Why'd You Push that Button?
So make sure you check it out.
It premieres for our
fourth season tomorrow
anywhere you normally get your podcasts.
All right, I'll see you later.
