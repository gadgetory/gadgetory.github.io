episode where a giant tech company has
been analyzing user data for decades and
now it's using that information to shape
human behavior I changed my phones and
shipping us products to improve our
lives
oh wait that's okay so that actually
isn't a black mirror up so but it sure
sounds like it exactly the plot of a
nearly nine minute long internal video
from Google so what is this video and
what does it say about Google's future
the video is only meant to be used
internally apparently as a thought
experiment to provoke discussion about
the possibilities of data it was created
in 2016 by Nick Foster the head of
design at what used to be known as at
Google X that's the company's moonshot
factory where they make things like
hot-air balloons that deliver Internet
connections the video was supposed to
stay internal but my colleague glad
salve of obtained a copy of it if you
wanna watch the full thing you can do it
at the verge comm will have a link in
the description here's what Google had
to say to us about the video we
understand if this is disturbing it is
designed to be this is a thought
experiment but the design team from
years ago that uses a technique known as
speculative design to explore
uncomfortable ideas and concepts in
order to provoke discussion and debate
it's not related to any current or
future products and you know what I
agree with them this video is disturbing
it's really weird and eerie there are
references to Pinocchio Harry Potter
Richard Dawkins there are closed steps
of insects and human faces it's just
meant to feel like a sci-fi film the
video basically makes one grand
comparison what if user data is like DNA
but for our behavior what if like we
were able to sequence DNA to the benefit
of our health and medicine we could send
how sequence user data to make similarly
grand improvements in proposing this
idea Google brings up a number of
fascinating possibilities it also brings
up a ton of potential ethical and
privacy concerns in the process the
central idea presented early on is the
concept of a ledger
that's basically the word they're gonna
use to refer to all the data that they
collect and assemble on you
this codified version of who we are
becomes ever more complex developing
changing and deforming based on our
actions in this regard this ledger of
our data may be considered a Lamarckian
epigenome the Lamarckian epigenome he
just mentioned refers to a pre-darwinian
theory on evolution which isn't actually
that important really the science
reference is just there to frame the
idea of a file that collects all the
data generated on us which can then pass
down to future generations like your
children or even just the population at
large to impact the future and their
behavior and that's where it starts to
get a little weird because the video
introduces the idea that maybe your data
doesn't belong to you what if we thought
of ourselves not as the owners of this
information but as custodians transient
carriers or caretakers that drawing with
the weird blobby humans is really creepy
and not just because of the drawing it
basically says that I don't own my data
but my data belongs to my entire lineage
if not my entire society and all
societies to come which is a huge leap
about how we think about data privacy
we're currently freaking out about
Facebook data leaking this is talking
about creating a repository of
generations worth of data to be worked
and studied upon forever the video
imagines a number of ways in which this
data could be used it starts out pretty
simple initially the notion of a goal
oriented ledger may be user driven as an
organization Google would be responsible
for offering suitable targets for a
user's ledger whilst the notion of a
global good is problematic topics would
likely focus on health or environmental
impact to reflect Google's values as an
organization once the user selects a
volition for their ledger every
interaction may be compared to a series
of parallel options this is basically
like your phone's assistant making
suggestions based on what it knows you
like so if you're trying to be more
environmentally friendly it might
suggest you take an uber pool home or
buy organic bananas but listen to that
one more time and pay close attention to
the phrasing here initially the notion
of a goal oriented
maybe user-driven initially the notion
of a goal-oriented ledger may be user
driven the implication here is that
eventually Google or some grand AI will
start taking a much larger role in your
decision making the AI might start to be
proactive about going out and gathering
data on you so I can start providing
even more services in the example given
the ledger is missing data about your
weight so it goes to incredible lengths
to get it it uses the data it knows
about you to create the perfect scale
for you and uses your design interests
to design the scale and then 3d prints
the scale and offer us to sell it to you
all so that it can pull that weight data
back into its system to know more and
more about you and again this isn't all
that far from what's possible today
Google and Facebook both serve ads and
news based on your interests and
sometimes that's helpful I read articles
all the time that I'm served but the
added benefit for those companies that
with every article I click on or don't
click on they're getting more
information that they can then use to
tailor even more products and services
to my tastes not to mention a lot of us
wear wearable devices that send
information back up to those company's
servers which they can then use to
suggest health tips to us
in the final portion of the video it
jumps ahead to a world where Google has
decades if not generations of data and
with that information the company can
map patterns of behavior or even disease
mental illness and social issues it
concludes in the suggestion the ledger
can change from a system that collects
data to one that uses data to actively
solve problems for individuals if not
entire populations these are incredible
possibilities and there may even be some
reality there but the one thing that
video never does is question whether it
should be done or thing to be done
ethically it never asks if this data is
really as valuable as they make it out
to be or how we can scientifically prove
any of this out I actually take a lot of
issue with the premise of this video I
don't think my data is really that
representative me it's just these
residual points left over for
advertisers to targets up to me it's not
human behavior and on top of that this
data isn't even representative of all
humans it's just for Google users what's
most scary to me right now
is that all this video is presented as
possible and there's really no one right
now that can stop it or put a check on
it there's no new universal ethics
regulator that can make sure that tech
companies aren't messing with their
users lives there's no one making sure
that any experiments are being conducted
in a safe fashion or that changes are
being made that actually help people
this kind of stuff is already happening
several years ago Facebook briefly
altered its newsfeed to see if we could
make people happier or sadder and it
worked
Facebook was behavior to alter people's
emotions this is a giant tech company
using data to manipulate humanity and
again Google says that this video was a
thought experiment and it's not
reflective of any current or future
products but even if that's the case
this is still a scary glimpse into the
thinking in Silicon Valley these
companies are awake to the possibilities
arising from our data we should be too
or else one day and may not be ours
thanks for watching if you have a chance
you should definitely watch the whole
video because it is fascinating and
actually just really entertaining for a
filmmaking perspective to promoting a
lot of the movie blodgett a you can
check it out we'll have a link in
description below let us know in the
comments what you think we'll be around
