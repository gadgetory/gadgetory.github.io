viciously horribly murdered right now
and you wrote a story about it yeah tell
me about the story you wrote it well I
wrote a story about a SAP called slack
which is kind of like an AOL chat room
from 15 years ago but with all your
colleagues in it but has as good of a
search as Gmail and what it can do is
replace the way you talk to your
colleagues but also all the emails
you've been sending around your office
and all the gifts and all the weird
stuff and and everything like that okay
but isn't that like every chat app ever
haven't they all tried to do this like a
watch at rooms tried to do this I guess
it was like my middle school friends not
my colleagues but like what's different
yes like but like none of them have
succeeded in doing any good
multi-platform apps with like any
indexing or search or anything like
Gmail at all and they also have support
for like every attachment you've ever
sent me I can be like all the weird cool
gifts that David's ever sent me I can
see them all inside of one pane or let's
say we're working on an article together
which we do sometimes
Noren can see all those things together
and search for them whereas like man how
much time you spend going through email
trying to find the right conversation
but this is all assuming that you're
like pretty descriptive you know we're
writers after all but I still have
trouble searching for things sometimes
so crew I think that's a problem with
both email and slack biggest slack is
better than like the janky subject lines
I was just right like hey in email
subject lines which is horrible when
you're trying to search for something
yeah but here's the other crazy part
it's like if you using Gmail or
something like that not only does it
feel really sluggish in general this is
real time so it's like chat but it's
also like you can plug in all these
things that used to clog up your inbox
with notifications like let's say
there's a new bug report that somebody
files let's say there's a new
notification from Twitter that somebody
followed advert a lot of people a lot of
developers especially have like a
bazillion notifications for all that
stuff now you pipe them in through slack
and it's all in one thing and you can
search for it and there's even a slack
bot that can show you whatever you want
Jurassic Park pictures pictures neill I
on a boat whatever you want those are
actually the only two things yeah that's
good that's fine I'm happy so who is
slack killing email for so it's killing
email surprisingly for enterprises which
is like a super hard market to get into
but companies like Adobe and eBay and
PayPal are using slack to talk to each
other the weird thing though is that
it's not like the whole company's using
it it's like smaller teams within the
company are using slack and they're
talked when you talking to each other on
this thing
and they're still emailing like some
people outside the company but I think
the point that we're getting to is where
we need to be where the way I talk to my
friends might be on Facebook or whatsapp
or iMessage the way I talk to people at
work is on slack the way I talk to my
family is through some other app that's
like a little more family oriented and I
think that's the point we're getting to
the point is like email has no context
it's just text with like these big
chunky attachments and the phone app
probably sucks and doesn't let you
search for what you're looking for and
let's say somebody joins your company
they start new email address they get a
new at the verge email address they're
starting from blank slate with slack you
get an address and you can search for
anything over the whole history of
everything that you guys talked about so
you think we're done with this thing
where it's like I have one service that
communicates with everything cuz that's
all email is good for right so as long
as you like definitely email you I know
that for sure for everyone on earth like
right do we not need that anymore
it's always gonna be there just like
phone numbers or something like that are
always going to be there in some shape
form or another even if if 50 years
we're not using phone numbers or
anything like that it's almost like
you'd have it set up so that if somebody
does decide to call you it'll just
forward through to your your snapchat
call or whatever it is and I think
that's the big idea is that we're
finding better ways to communicate and
email I think is going to be around for
a long time I mean the slack CEO admits
that this is how we still talk to people
outside the company but for small teams
I think that having a chat slash email
real-time chat thing AOL altogether is a
really good solution so basically just
you know snapchat me or slack me or DM
me or pick anything just please for the
love of God stop emailing me yes
