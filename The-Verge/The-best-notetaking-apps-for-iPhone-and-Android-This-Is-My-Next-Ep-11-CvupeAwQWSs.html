it's for you know taking notes but when
your phone is involved there's actually
a lot more you can do
sometimes your notes are text sometimes
their pictures are weird drawing
sometimes their checklists and who knows
what else a really good note-taking app
can handle anything anywhere at anytime
and that's why Evernote is the best
note-taking app on the planet and it's
the best on almost any platform - it can
be a little unwieldy at first but it's
so incredibly powerful that we'll always
be able to work with whatever you're
doing if you just want to keep a list of
text notes there's great organization
tagging and sharing built into both iOS
and Android you can also clip from the
web to Evernote or take pictures or use
the reminders feature to make it to do
next everyone works everywhere which is
one of its best features and I mean
everywhere iOS Android Mac Windows the
web Windows Phone even blackberry but
the best thing about Evernote is when
you turn it into a huge apposite ory for
everything from great dreams - funny
gifts to class notes and you'll know
it's all there when you want to
technically Evernote is free but for
five dollars a month or $45 a year you
get better offline access better search
and more security I pay for it just to
have offline notebooks on my phone but
whether or not you do want to pay for it
Evernote is still the best note-taking
app of the market it's only real
competition is OneNote Microsoft's great
note-taking app it's finally come from
Windows to other platforms - OneNote is
structured just like a standard notebook
which I like on the desktop but it can
get a little bit overdone and confusing
on a smaller screen still it's
incredibly powerful it's free it syncs
to lots of different platforms and it'll
take pretty much anything you throw at
if you're not in love with the way
Evernote looks or can't handle its
initial learning curve OneNote might be
the perfect choice for the third good
app on the list is simple note it's
crazy fast it has really good search and
it's really seamless across platforms
but it only works for plain text if
you're just jotting down notes to self
there's nothing that's easier or faster
but you might find you need more than
simple note offers beyond those three
there are literally hundreds of apps for
iOS and Android but they're usually
either less functional or less enjoyable
than the best three or book on iOS you
might try G notes or awesome notes or
notes tab or notability but they all
offer less than ever
vesper is maybe the best looking notes
app but without sync or support for
forms it's really hard to sink your
teeth into on Android the list is even
longer papyrus and write and scribble
and fetch notes actually fetch notes has
a neat tagging system that I like but
that's not nearly enough to use it
Google keep in particular is a great
Android app with a really useful widget
but it's still a little basic and not
nearly cross-platform cross-platform
really is important you might not have
your same phone or laptop forever but
you want to keep your notes forever and
having them accessible anytime from any
device is huge
luckily all three of the best
note-taking apps work on all the most
important platforms and they all work
well every and of those three Evernote
is simply the most powerful it's the one
most able to adapt to whatever you
deciding if you're going to dump your
whole brain into one place and you
should make it ever
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
