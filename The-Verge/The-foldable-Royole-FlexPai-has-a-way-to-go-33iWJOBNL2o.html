FlexPai portable device.
Some of you wanted this.
Now you've got it.
(futuristic music)
This is the very first announced
and distributed foldable phone.
They call it a phone.
To me it's a foldable tablet,
because this is the thing that you do.
And just as you're about to close it,
and it feels like it's
about to snap broken,
it snaps into place.
In the case of this device, actually,
the funny thing is, it
turns into 2 phones.
So when it's like this, in tablet mode,
is when you can actually use
the full 7.8 inches of the display.
It's a four by three aspect ratio.
308 pixels per inch.
1920 x 1440 resolution.
You got speakers up at the top.
Power button.
Volume button surrounding
a fingerprint sensor.
And then basically nothing.
USB-C charging port, no headphone jack.
And these are the rubber
bits which create the hinge.
But, actually I am a little bit surprised
by the reliability of this hinge.
Every time I'm trying to close it,
it feels like it's just about to break
when I get to this point.
And then just as I'm like,
&quot;Yeah, the screen is going to break,&quot;
it snaps into place, and it's quite firm.
Now, it does leave you
with one of those like,
Microsoft Surface
Book-like gaps back here.
It survives people being quite
rough with it in their usage,
and it does turn into a tablet.
Now, is it a good tablet?
Is it a usable tablet?
No.
Is it a good phone, is it a usable phone?
No.
But, Royole is a company
that was literally founded
for the sake of making flexible displays.
The founders of the company,
they're Stanford graduates,
they founded it in 2013,
and they came up with
a not .1 millimeter thick
flexible display film.
Out here in the CES 2019 booth,
they have it on handbags,
on hats, on t-shirts.
So, it's cool, as far as technology goes.
But in terms of implementation,
in terms of the way that it's being done,
this thing is so far from finished.
The camera is terrible.
The interface is terrible.
When I'm trying to just pivot
from portrait orientation into landscape,
sometimes it works, most
of the time it doesn't.
When I'm trying to switch
it into phone mode,
just the way that you naturally handle it,
your fingers are all over the screen,
so you're triggering things you
don't want to be triggering.
At the moment I'm looking
at it, and it's upside down.
I don't know why it's upside down.
I'm usually good with technology.
I feel like my grandfather.
But even the display technology
itself, I'm looking at it,
and it's not particularly great.
It has a lot of vibrancy to the colors,
as OLED usually does.
But it has all the hallmarks of really,
really early AMOLED displays.
Like I'm talking S-AMOLED's first
and second generation AMOLED displays.
That means there's
banding in white sections,
the lighting seems to be inconsistent,
and I'm seeing like these dark patches
in the middle of the display.
It's not right.
Again, making the display
flexible is no mean feat.
In terms of engineering,
that's an achievement.
But I just feel like this
thing needs plenty more time,
and plenty more work,
before it becomes a real
retail product, which is funny,
because Royole is actually
selling it in China.
They're selling it for 8,999 Yuan,
which translates to something like $1,320.
And you can actually
buy a developer edition
for $1,320 now in the United States.
I do need to give them
praise for build quality,
which even though it's quite
chunky, is really quite good.
If you're the kind of person
who likes a little bit of chaos
in their life, a little
bit of unpredictability,
and you're just tired of
the same old technology
doing the same old things that
you actually want them to do,
this is the phone for you.
And, I mean, I don't
always call them phones,
I call them foldable tablets,
because it's a tablet that folds.
And survives drops, apparently.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
