here today
it's hard to believe but it's only been
10 weeks since we started rolling out
windows 10 around the world 110 million
devices are now running Windows 10 we're
very excited to announce that Facebook
will be building all new Universal
windows apps for Facebook Instagram and
messenger we're gonna start the next
chapter for Windows 10 with new devices
designed for Windows 10 we've got an
incredible games lineup coming to Xbox
one and this holiday we'll be upgrading
all Xbox ones to Windows 10 enabling a
whole new Xbox experience and bringing
our Xbox gamers their number one
requested feature the ability to play
their Xbox 360 games on their Xbox one
and there's no better way to play all
these games on new limited edition
consoles that we are introducing this
holiday we also have a new elite gaming
controller a controller like no other
this is the most advanced gaming
controller anyone's ever created
now speaking of devices that are
breaking new ground let's talk about
hololens
hololens creates innovative experiences
that are simply not possible on any
other device or any other platform today
we're excited to show you mixed reality
gaming on hololens we want to take mixed
reality one step further so we've got
something new to show you
Holograms you can hold let's talk about
another part of our lives here is the
new Microsoft band we figured out a way
to optimize the screen size and redesign
the screen itself so it curves plus with
the gorilla glass the organic LED screen
is scratch resistant and optimized to be
more responsive to touch we added an
eleventh sensor a barometer now you can
track your fitness with even more
precision by measuring elevation changes
in real time the new Microsoft band is
the only wearable device that offers
this kind of deep functionality across
iOS Android and importantly Windows
devices and Microsoft health is now
Windows app that works across your phone
and PC providing you all of this data
wherever you are so throughout the last
year we have worked to bring in these
new partners and we're ensuring these
experiences are risk optimized so if you
want to use uber you're just one touch
away if you want to do a guy to work out
with Gold's Gym you're just one touch
away you can pre-order the band later
today and it will be available beginning
October 30th and will retail for $249
let's talk about devices that we design
to make people more productive than ever
before let's talk about surface and
Lumia
let me introduce you to the Lumia 950
family there are two antennas in this
product but why no matter where you're
holding it we will choose for you to
give you the best connection you could
possibly have we also have the octa-core
and hexa core processors I have two
phones to introduce you to today we have
the 950 which uses a hexa core processor
and the 950 XL which uses the octa-core
the phones come with a 5.2 inch and a
5.7 inch screen they're absolutely
beautiful organic LEDs all the
generations of work that have come into
the camera on these new products will
blow your mind it's got a 20 megapixel
sensor which is just beautiful
it's unbelievable in low-light there's a
USB type-c connector on the bottom of
this product this is the Microsoft
display dock ok this dock will enable me
to connect my phone via that USB type-c
connection right there and utilize a
large monitor keyboard and mouse with
these little nice ports okay to get a PC
like experience this is my phone start
menu because this is my phone my actual
phone experience is not broken while I'm
utilizing the desktop experience of
continuum but the phone is powering this
whole thing this phone is actually
connected to this display dock means I'm
getting full HDMI out of the back of
this that means I have full 1080p video
that means I have full robust
ground-shaking audio coming out of that
so you know the products start at 549
they're available in November make sure
you go and check them out for sure so
I'm guessing you want to talk about
surface
it's the fittest most powerful core PC
ever shipped by far start with the
screen
we went from 12 inches to 12 point 3
inches in the diagonal 5 million pixels
on the screen we're introducing
something that puts touch pen soft on
the eyes perfect contrast the pixels
screen all together and we're calling it
pixel sense technology I'm going to walk
you through pixel sense to covered what
else it's 400 microns thick that's point
4 millimeters that is the thinnest cover
glass with Gorilla Glass 4 on it ever
shipped on a tablet we also have our own
custom chipset that brings it all
together and it brings the best pen and
touch experience you've ever witnessed
or felt on any product and on this
product right here we give you a full
year of battery life
you guys want a pen storage we created
it for you but even more important we're
introducing an interchangeable pen tips
traditional apps like Lightroom
Photoshop Illustrator all touch and pen
enabled new apps like draw board bit wig
from guys out there that want to create
things some beautiful things
my favorite stat pad 30% faster than
surface pro 3 we're putting a terabyte
of storage in the product you go pick it
you wanted 60 gigabytes around yep we
did this is the surface pro docking
station notice how I say surface pro for
those of you who have been asking what
about surface pro 3 ok this docking
station it works with surface pro 3 it
has 2 4k displays out of course it has 4
USB 3 o connectors it has a gigabit of
Ethernet speed it has everything you
want to duck but it's just this little
package here this is the new surface pro
type cover this is the lightest thinnest
type cover we have ever shipped we've
put in a pro key set on this product
what you'll see is what we went from
this type key set design where we have
now filled out the entire key set for
your hands don't worry though
this product works perfectly with your
surface pro 3 we then took the trackpad
we made 40 percent larger that was a big
deal if you want Windows hello we have

you guys wanna talk about another
product the first laptop ever built by
Microsoft and it really finds everything

expect in a laptop thirteen and a half
inch diagonal straight across
it delivers six million pixels to your
eye six million there is nothing close
to it
nothing 267 dpi and the depth of this
screen is remarkable pound-for-pound
this is the fastest 13-inch laptop ever
made anywhere on any planet if you
remember that surface dock we talked
about earlier it works with your surface
book I'm supposed to use it as a laptop
and never think twice it is the ultimate
laptop but at any given time if I want
to I just pull it off that's it and now
that quickly that elegantly I can move
with this device and I can just plug it
back in so simply and it locks in it's
