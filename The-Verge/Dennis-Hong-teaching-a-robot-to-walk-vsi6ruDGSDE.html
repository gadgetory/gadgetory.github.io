movie star wars for the prey first time
at all my way back home in the car I
decided to become a robot scientist and
it never changed my mind and I'm here
today my name is Dennis ha I'm a
professor of mechanical engineering at
Virginia Tech and the founding director
of Ramallah
robotics is a really a really wide field
from one end of the spectrum from where
the mechanical sciences mechanical
engineering kinematics design to the
other end of the spectrum where the
computer science side of artificial
intelligence and anything in between you
really need to know everything to
develop a pool system we first try to
generate walking motion just by you know
almost like a stop-motion animation just
creating the emotional legs and
hopefully it's gonna walk and it turns
out that that's not the case
both Charlie at Darwin use a method
called GMP zero moment point control
method CMP walking is more like a robot
walking trying to keep my GMP right
under my foot so as long as you can
create a motion that the CIP is under
your foot or the foot support polygon
then theoretically you've got to be
stable humans walk in a very different
way first of all when you walk you swing
your legs swing your leg touch the fall
stand up again and then you fall forward
and you swing your leg and your body
also swings forward now zmp is probably
the most stable way to implement bipedal
walking the problem is inherently zmp
method can only work on smooth hard flat
strain so the next step in biker walking
is a good example is our new robot
sapphire you probably know the big dog
from Boston Dynamics they're very
impressive for Lake robot think of
sapphire as a two leg version of the big
dog people when they see our robots
because they watch sci-fi movies like
the iRobot and they say wow this robot
Charlie walking this is rainy and cool
but why cat why doesn't it jump why
doesn't it run power source is a big
problem the batteries that we use
releasing polymer batteries can for
example power up Charlie for only about
fifteen or twenty minutes better
actuators that mimic biological muscles
better we need more compliance and
different way of doing force control so
all of these component technologies need
to catch up be catched up to develop the
next generation robotics in about ten
years
hopefully we'll start to see a more of
domestic robots that can actually help
people in the home one of these robots
to use tools to go for
he asked a robot hey fetch me a beer
from the fridge you do not want to have
a special refrigerator just for the
robot you want to go but to open up the
door of the fridge or pick up the phone
use the scissors all the tools designed
for humans thus I believe developing
humanoid robots is very important</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
