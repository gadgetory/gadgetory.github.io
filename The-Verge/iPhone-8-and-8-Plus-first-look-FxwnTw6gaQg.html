Steve Jobs theater in Apple Park in
Cupertino their brand-new theater and
we're looking at the brand new iPhone 8
and the most obvious thing you're going
to notice and you pick up one of these
things this is the iPhone 8 plus is that
it now has a glass back apple says it's
the hardest glass ever put on a phone
sure it does pick up fingerprints but
really not that bad and it's got sort of
a nice cloudy finish under the glass so
I think it looks way better than the
seven actually they also did a really
good job blending in the glass into the
edge of the rail on the side otherwise
everything else is pretty much like the
iPhone 7 that you know it still has
touch ID unlike the iPhone 10 it still
uses that you know forced touch things
so it's not a physical button on the
back is 212 picked 12 megapixel cameras
and then of course the regular iPhone 8
just has one but on the 8 plus it's
actually really impressive because it
uses optical image stabilization so your
telephotos will be a little less shaky
and when you jump into the thing you can
go right into portrait mode and you can
choose all these different options that
will automatically adjust the light and
when you point it at somebody's face so
you can identify this guy here it will
move closer it'll automatically set it
to the stage lighting Apple of course
has a bunch of sample shots here so this
one's really impressive here's the
portrait and we can adjust so here's
what it looks like with the effects this
is the original photo they were able to
identify the face and then apply a bunch
of different lighting effects assume
just the face which is really impressive
is it as impressive as actually doing a
thing with the DSLR yeah maybe not but
it's way better than any other camera
gimmick I've seen before inside there is
a new chip it's Apple calls it the a 11
Bionic it's a fast chip you know they're
always faster the display is a retina HD
display and it has true ton like an iPad
pro and what that means is the it will
detect the ambient light the color of
the light and automatically adjusts the
color of the screen to match the light
which is really cool so if you jump into
the brightness settings you can turn
your tone on and off of course the
lighting in this area is very nice and
bright white so you can't see a
difference but if it were like a yellow
room the screen would adjust so wouldn't
look so harshly blue which is pretty
cool another thing I'm really happy with
it has stereo speakers this speaker at
the top gets really loud alongside the
speaker at the bottom so when you're
watching movies you hear it on both
sides no there's not a headphone jack
life goes on but one thing I didn't
mention because it hasn't glass back it
supports wireless charging with the Qi
standard that's Qi if you see Qi and a
work and you could just set it down and
Apple is promising that in the future
it's going to create an all-new charging
standard that'll work with many many
devices at the same time intelligently
and automatically so here you go this is
the iPhone 8 it's going to be available
on September 22nd the regular model
starts at $6.99 for 64 gigs and the plus
is a hundred bucks more for much more
