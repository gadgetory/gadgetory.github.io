they're a bunch of awesome panels lots
of people in cool costumes but you know
what I'm really excited about we're
spending the day with Brian came on how
do you feel about coming on there's
lovely I especially like you know people
didn't use to wear costumes I guess when
I started doing this and now everyone
does so it's visually spectacular right
yeah absolutely
it's totally hungry off to a good start
fear and cheesecake isn't that where
comic-con for yes sorry just abyss
Isabelle from hi I'm Brian Vaughn I
wrote that and I just want to say you
look awesome it is great to see you yeah
yeah sure totally it's surreal it's
awesome how are you I'm sorry to just
cost you what's the meat in the meatball
you're not sure okay that's fine
you're getting a lot of you're not
 around of it I took care of
Mexican forest
we're ready to review the food at the
Javits Center do you have anything that
you really want to start out with I have
some things I would really like to avoid
it is surreal to have it out cliff Chang
and I have been working for so long but
we haven't shown it to anyone we didn't
give out any previews we just wanted to
see can we just say we're doing a book
about for 12 year old girls in 1980s
suburban Cleveland it and see if people
would check it out and they did against
all odds I don't know who these weirdos
are what was the reaction bin to the
French in me stand on guard because some
of the characters are like
french-canadian we have a francophone
comedian character he is from Quebec and
so I've had a québécois friend someone
who works for Cirque du Soleil gives me
translations and everything but
sometimes I will veto him if I want sort
of English readers to recognize a word
so some stuff is a little off but I've
just decided in a hundred years French
will have evolved slightly so these are
not mistakes if you're reading any wrong
French it is just a world building that
we are doing
that you likely sold out of there's no
way I'm eating that people know how many
times you said it's not gonna make me
eat it that is terrible
I feel as you took everything that you
love about Kate and stripped it away so
there was just like the idea of like
what cake should be is I don't know it's
not know it's terrible and
flourless cake excuse my language that's
what you've done I can't contain myself
it's actually nicer to have a few
different books it was too much weight
to put on saga it was the only thing I
was working on but I love now getting
the switch from writing a sort of space
opera for perverted adults to sort of
then like a young adult adventure
yeah then to a weird Canadian comic it
keeps things fresh and the happiest sort
of juggling it 90 different things
unless
that is authentically good no Joe this
is the finest meal I've ever had and if
I were on death row tomorrow I would
request go to the basement of the Javits
Center and get me a chicken taco bowl
because this is how I want to shuffle
off the mortal coil want a fry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
