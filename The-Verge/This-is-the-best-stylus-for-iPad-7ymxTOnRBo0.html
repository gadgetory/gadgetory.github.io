built its tablets that you don't need
anything more than your finger to
control it that's great if you're
browsing the web checking Facebook or
ordering seamless but if you want to
draw or write on your iPad you're gonna
want to stylus
we're used to writing drawing and
painting with something in our hand and
a great stylus gets close to replicating
that it should also make creating art a
lot more fun a good stylist does three
things it's easy to use it works with a
lot of apps and it draws exactly what
you want it to that's why the best outs
you can get is the sensu artist brush
and stylus the sense who doesn't use
Bluetooth or require a battery so it can
work in any app and delivers the most
natural and consistent results of any
stylus I tested what I love about this
sensitive stylus is its rubber tip it
has a really smooth glide over the iPad
screen but it also has just the tiniest
grab to it that makes it feel like
you're actually writing on something
this is going to sound really simple but
the other great thing about the Setsu
stylus is that it actually works pretty
much every time you use it as long as
you apply the slightest amount of
pressure while writing or drawing the
sensi stylus is going to make a line
which is more that could be said for a
lot of other styluses even better the
big rubber tip means you can use it from
a lot of different angles and even use
the side of the stylus for shading
that's a big reason why the sense who
gets an edge over close competitors like
a d√∂nitz jot Pro and jot mini they're
both really natural to hold and use but
you're stuck writing straight down
coming from an angle and you're out of
luck the job may be a touch better for
handwriting for the iPad just isn't cut
out for that kind of precision the other
really cool thing about the sensitive
stylus is that when you pop off the back
there's a brush underneath that you can
use to simulate painting it's really
helpful for when you need to fill in
large areas and it's surprisingly great
for doing other things in painting
navigating menus with a brush is
strangely fun the brush doesn't have the
same precision as the rubber tip but
it's a great option to be able to switch
over to a basic stylus will get the job
done just fine for most people but if
you need some more powerful features
like palm rejection or pressure
sensitivity you can find that with a
Bluetooth stylus before you get too
excited you should know that Bluetooth
styluses are going to be bumping into
the iPads limitations even more than
regular styluses it just doesn't build
to work with them you'll have to deal
with some small frustrations every now
and then but you can absolutely get
better results if that's something you
need then you should get it down it's
jot touch the jot touch is a Bluetooth
stylus that offers customizable buttons
palm rejection and supposedly over 2,000
levels
sensitivity being able to make your
lines thicker or thinner depending on
how much pressure you're applying is a
huge time-saver no more digging around
in menus every time you need to change a
setting it takes a bit of getting used
to but once you have the rhythm down
it'd be a lot more powerful than a
regular stylus the other big bonus to
the drop touch is it's two customizable
buttons you won't be able to take
advantage of these in every app but in a
few apps you'll be able to set them up
to do a bunch of different commands like
undoing a stroke switching over to the
eraser or pulling up a menu the jot
touch is also supported by a lot of the
best writing and drawing apps out there
like procreate and adobe draw online
when an app doesn't support it that's
fine too
as long as the jot touch is connected to
the iPad you can draw with it it just
works like any other basic stylus the
one thing you will want to watch out for
is that the jot touch doesn't work
perfectly with the iPad air - every once
in a while it just stops drawing mid
stroke it's not a complete deal-breaker
if you have some patience but it is
annoying it's an issue that you'll run
into with other high-end styluses right
now - the jot touch also does palm
rejection but like the other Bluetooth
stylus as I test it it's really hit and
miss good palm rejection would be a huge
deal we're used to writing with our
hands on a sheet of paper after all but
the iPads touchscreen just does not want
to let that happen
that's why if you do choose a Bluetooth
stylus you should definitely choose one
with pressure sensitivity there are some
good Bluetooth options that just do palm
rejection like a doughnut zone jot
script and fifty threes pencil but for a
little more money you can get a jot
touch and do a lot more although I do
wish every size with copy pencils eraser
feature with so many stylus options for
the iPad it's the small differences that
make or break them at the end of the day
you really just want something
consistent that's why Ciencias artists
brush and stylus is the best stylus you
can buy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
