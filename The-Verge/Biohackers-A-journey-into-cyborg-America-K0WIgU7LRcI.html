begin I'm ready
how much can I push the human how much
can I consciously evolve the human body
to do more to do it better do it fast do
it stronger
I just want to see how far I can push
the human
hi my name is Tim cannon I've been
working on a small project with my
friend Sean Sarver here my name is Sean
stiver I'm a cybernetics engineer by
Lunt I am a barber by trade I want to
see if I can't make the human evolve
faster than what nature is allowed it to
be you know I say I've wanted to be a
robot since I was a little boy you know
what I mean and it's true I've wanted to
be a robot since I was a little boy and
it looks like I'm getting close we have
to separate power supplies one going to
this solenoid electromagnetic coil
that's wrapped around my finger embedded
in my finger is a neodymium magnet I
have a little magnet implanted in my
pinkie and I've had it for almost three
years now I was alerted to a discussion
and it basically says any kind of
electromagnetic field you'll be able to
feel it and I just thought oh my
goodness how awesome would it be to see
something to know the physical shape of
something invisible to the naked eye
sorry I was out back I live with my
parents s still hood I just live in the
basement
I moved back in 2008 when I got on the
Air Force was it enlistee of the United
States Air Force for six years that's
how I got a lot of the electronics
grounding um because to do that they Air
Force sent me through a qualifier course
called electronic principles I got a two
year degree and associates in software
applications programming when it comes
to where I get the the majority of my
information it just ends up being Google
Wikipedia and then YouTube I've worked
in piercing in tattoo industry for a few
years prior to this after I was on the
military I'd kind of had like a head
full of emotional issues and some stress
issues where I was just kinda like a
non-functioning civilian I was just like
I can't do this I can't do that anymore
I was like frying my brain come on let's
go ya jerk was just kinda like an
intellectual exercise it started out as
we're doing another video here for you
it's just another demo all right here we
go test one this is a device built by
cyborgs for cyborgs we've secretly
placed a box in front of Tim while he
was blindfolded
this is our first stab at making
something that's truly useful that is
solely meant to interact with people who
have implants we're going to continue to
try to bring you the craziest shit
you've ever seen in your life I think we
both realized right there there's like
this is what I'd rather be doing with
all of my con my name is Tim cannon and
I'm Shawn Sarver we are the development
team for grindhouse wet where's your
I'll come down show you the lab Rock the
lab the basement the basement let's take
a look here um we also built a
transcranial direct stimulation device
it electrocute your brain you're like
alright here we go
you ready to get your brains out buddy
yeah I'm ready don't know how into
biohacking you are but this would be
like your first biohacker
yeah first grind first grind you never
give you like a twitch yeah you'll get
it yet
that alright just get ready you're gonna
feel the light okay so mostly they call
me a biohacker this is experimentation
on the lowest of low budgets anything
can be used to stimulate nerves provided
the subdermal and it gives off the
correct current and you can't really go
wrong I saw a couple of talks one was by
a left anonym one was by a guy named
Kevin Warwick the one by Kevin Warwick
was a really incredible display of what
was possible this is the sort of
implants
you could try yourself Kevin Warwick is
the only professor of subjects in the
world he's a based out of England he
implanted a chip with a hundred pins on
the on a trunk nerve of his arm and then
he was able to across the ocean right
maneuver this hand over the Internet
guy's wife gets one and they do this
experiment where she starts to move her
hand and he can he can feel it in his
mirrored hand now I know that maybe this
is a on the on the verge of fetishism
but that's about the most intimate thing
I can think of on the planet to actually
truly know what somebody's feeling like
some of you feel quite bored being a
human quite limited in what you can do
particularly your brain doesn't perform
how it should so what are the
possibilities of an upgrade
fundamentally devices stimulate nerves
all we need to do to do that is to give
off a current anything that gives off a
current and his safe inside your body
can be used to subdue on device given
some pain I think left anonym was always
a little bit disturbed you know what I
mean like I definitely think she
probably had a couple couple of screws
loose or maybe had too many drinks when
she was doing some of these things
because to think that you could put
metal in your body without it having a
bad reaction is probably probably a
little foolish so I sat down in my
kitchen with a vegetable peeler I said
you know and I decided to put things in
my hands she's clearly insane she's not
like like I'm not going to like like law
and state like break scientists up but
we do try apply like the scientific
method like come up with a hypothesis
test it and find the results I mean
she's just doing crazy insane shit the
first time I ever sat down it went
horribly horribly wrong and the whole
thing with cept
put myself in a hospital over two weeks
there's us like the self-destructive
aesthetic quality about it but I
wouldn't say that's like the head for
everyone a lot of people really go a lot
deeper into it than I guess I do for me
it was something I read about that just
interested me deeply and it's something
that kind of just like sat in the back
of my mind and that I just thought it
would be really interesting to be able
to experience this world that nobody
else could I now have a digital input
channel and once you have that you
really have the beginning of the first
computer interfaces in these very
natural ways you pretty much have two
ways to go there's the medical field and
then there's the piercers and frankly
the piercers are just much more willing
to talk about it it's been a lot of just
people talking about various procedures
that they want to do and how they would
go about doing them and then giving it a
try and sometimes that's scary and
sometimes it works out
we're on our way into Pittsburgh proper
we're going to hotrod piercings I'm
going to get a tiny rare-earth metal
implanted in my ring finger it's going
to give me a sixth sense the ability to
feel electromagnetic fields
you have all of these colleges here some
of them specializing in things like you
know robotics and artificial
intelligence and deep computer stuff
some of them focusing on medicine for a
while the city was dying and so you have
this kind of element of kind of
anti-authority freaks or welcome kind of
you know angry pissed-off youth kind of
vibe going on you're no shortage of
freaks here and that's that's great and
so when you have technology and
biomedical research and a pissed-off
angry population that loves tattoos
converging together this is bound to
happen and why Pittsburgh it's got the
right amount of fuck you
I guess you're giving one right yeah and
then you're good yeah mmm I mean with
the magnets that like right around there
Yeah right around there the lines where
the incision goes the circles where the
Meg it's gonna end up whatever you're
ready we can go ahead and begin I'm
ready
good okay I'm going to put a good amount
of pressure on your finger here
and take a nice deep breath in for me
and let that out
I just keep on blowing that out I
believe there are some there would be
people who would state that the Pierce
who does the magnet implants and people
people do my modification are
technically committing assault on you
the way the DUI route is like you're
obviously circumnavigate like the
government agencies that would be in
normally involved in a project like that
like like the FDA is it approved it's
like a legal gray area where it's I have
that kind of control over what I do with
my body but there are laws on books that
could be read in a manner that's would
state that I don't have that freedom and
liberty and if you would like we can
experience your first little magnetic
trick sure oh that is so cool ha ha ha
ha that is awesome and totally worth all
of the little bit of payment that was
hell yeah man
Jesus clean you up and bandaged you up
and good to go
awesome go ahead and take a nice deep
breath in for me and let that out
feels really warm all that blood it's
nice and warm just use the breathing
okay nice hombre study the whole time
it's like a 400% increase in cyborg
population in Pittsburgh this first
cyborg community is growing faster than
any cyborg community in the world state
of the housing market honey what day is
it you got to be kidding me get your
truly free credit score at
creditkarma.com Society is definitely
changing and evolving and there might be
a time when procedures such as this
implants are a lot more mainstream in
order for that to happen the procedure
for getting these done needs to be also
advanced a lot more because going to
somebody and having them cut open your
finger and put something in still going
to make a lot of people cringe and make
a lot of people seem that it's not worth
it people can't understand because it's
so simple and small but it adds such a
layer of richness and data that you know
to not do it seems insane to me so one
nice thing I do like about being a
barber it's like I can talk about this
stuff to regular people I can hear like
their thoughts and feelings on they
think it's all possible it's all real
it's all almost here it's like 10 15
years away it's just like it's not that
far away it doesn't have to be that far
away I view it as kind of taking the
pain for the people
who are going to come after me want you
know you take the pain now we're paying
now so that it will become socially
acceptable later companies you know mega
corporations that can actually bring
this stuff to market because they can
pay to get through the red tape and pay
to get through the bureaucracy they're
gonna get that money back in spades Tim
and I don't imagine we'll be the only
people making side break even for the
most successful we could possibly
imagine one thing the only company is
gonna be someone out there he's like I
have eight billion dollars to spend on
this nobody's going to want to get
surgeries for that stuff on this they
will they'll be left behind they had no
choice you know what I mean you want to
be obsolete I want to make myself faster
not so I might better killing machine
run be faster like fuck cheetahs why
should they be the fastest thing I'm
curious to see if it is possible to
consciously push human evolution to a
post human be
you know I'm curious to see if that is
possible I want to see if I can do that
if I'm capable of doing that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
