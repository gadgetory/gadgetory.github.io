heck am I in the middle of the desert
very few things would cause me to travel
some 60 miles away from our home base in
Las Vegas
just as CES is getting into full swing
the chance to drive a 460 horsepower
Corvette Stingray though yeah that will
do it
I'm here at Nevada's Spring Mountain
Raceway today to look at a new feature
coming to the 2015 Corvette the
performance data recorder you've heard
of the quantified self well think of
this is the quantified car
the combination data logger and forward
facing camera that outputs video to an
SD card you stick in your glovebox
the result looks like something straight
out of a video game but let's back up
for a second why would you want to do
this your daily driver is a minivan odds
are you won but then again the Stingray
is no minivan
this is for track day warriors the men
and women who spend a Saturday on an
entire weekend logging their car around
twists and turns for the pure thrill of
it it's IRL Gran Turismo it's a blast
trust me it's not just about driving
though we need to show off your asphalt
conquests which is why the GoPro camera
has revolutionized the track day at this
point it's hard to find a car in the
local track that doesn't have a couple
action cam suction cup defenders well GM
caught on to the trend concealing an HD
camera right in this stingrays headliner
as our Accords the videos overlaid with
a bunch of stats racers care abouts rpms
current gear lateral G's so on after
which you can eject the card upload the
video to youtube and brag to your
friends about that sick lap you turn to
Laguna Seca in other words it's
definitely not for everyone in fact it's
not even for all Corvette drivers it'll
be an extra cost option available later
this year and pricing hasn't been
announced but if analyzing your driving
mechanics to squeeze another second out
of your lap times is your idea of a good
Saturday night GM has the coolest
product in town or in this case 60 miles
outside of town
