heck am i in the middle of the desert
very few things would cause me to travel
some 60 miles away from our home base in
Las Vegas just as CES is getting into
full swing the chance to drive a 460
horsepower corvette stingray though yeah
that will do it
i'm here at nevada's spring mountain
raceway today to look at a new feature
coming to the 2015 Corvette the
performance data recorder you've heard
of the quantified self well think of
this is the quantified car the
combination data logger and forward
facing camera that outputs video to an
SD card you stick in your glove box the
result looks like something straight out
of a video game but let's back up for a
second why would you want to do this
your daily driver is a minivan odds are
you won but then again the stingrays no
minivan this is for track day warriors
the men and women who spend a Saturday
or an entire weekend flogging their car
around twists and turns for the pure
thrill of it it's ir el gran turismo
it's a blast trust me it's not just
about driving though we need to show off
your asphalt conquests which is why the
gopro camera has revolutionized the
track day at this point it's hard to
find a car in the local track that
doesn't have a couple action cam suction
cup defenders well GM caught on to the
trend concealing an HD camera right in
this stingrays headliner as our records
the videos overlaid with a bunch of
stats racers care abouts rpms current
gear lateral G so on after which you can
eject the card upload the video to
YouTube and brag to your friends about
that sick lap you turn to Laguna Seca in
other words it's definitely not for
everyone in fact it's not even for all
Corvette drivers it'll be an extra cost
option available later this year and
pricing hasn't been announced but if
analyzing your driving mechanics to
squeeze another second out of your lap
times is your idea of a good Saturday
night GM has the coolest product in town
or in this case 60 miles outside of town</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
