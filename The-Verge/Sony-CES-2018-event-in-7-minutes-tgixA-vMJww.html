it's really great to be back here at CES
to participate in our consumer
electronics industry's annual gathering
of the best brightest and of course the
most innovative one of the highlights of
our camera lineup has been a full-frame
mirrorless alpha 9 which features a
silent shutter that is a game-changer
for certain types of shooting where the
shutter sound has compromised your
ability to get those magical and
spontaneous shots that you are all after
the Alpha 9 also features
industry-leading 20 frames per second
high-speed continuous shooting with
accurate focus and exposure to capture
moments nearly impossible to do in live
sporting events like the moment of
impact with the golf ball here
incorporating the same 1-inch type image
sensor used in our claimed rx 100 series
cameras is an ultra compact waterproof
and robust form factor the RX zero
allows you to take stunning shots in any
condition when the rx0 is combined with
our optional accessory camera control
box which we just announced today you
can connect up to a hundred rx0 units
together Sony Mobile has continued to
advance our flagship Xperia smartphones
mesmerizing users with impressive super
slow motion technology at 960 frames per
second which is stunningly fast you'll
have video playback four times slower
compared with any other smartphone as
screen sizes get bigger and bigger
providing a superior picture quality
becomes even more important to your
satisfaction and having a technology
inside the television is the secret
ingredient in delivery the quality
imagery that you all desire and that is
why we have focused on developing a
proprietary picture processing
technology that optimizes picture
quality whether you are viewing sports
movies streaming content or playing
video games we now have a new OLED
lined up to show you here at CES that
will provide access to our premium level
OLED TVs to even more people around the
world these OLED TVs feature Sony's
unique 4k HDR picture processor called
x1 extreme for those of you who seek
even more immersive acoustic experiences
in your home our new sound bar is a
perfect match with your Bravo it is the
world's first 3.1 channel sambar that
supports Dolby Atmos bravia sois
activation is improving thanks to the
built-in Google assistant voice
activation in command also worked with
smart speakers such as Amazon echo
Google home and of course our own smart
speakers and all of these models will be
available beginning this spring we're
also working on the future of TV
technologies focusing on creating the
next generation picture processor for
our TVs here our prototype x1 ultimate
has twice the real-time processing power
compared to the current x1 extreme x1
ultimate optimizes and delivers
unprecedented picture quality whether
it's for a 4k a ke LCD or an OLED panel
10,000 nits that allows for
approximately 100 times wider dynamic
range compared to the current TV
broadcast standards and that is the
maximum brightness that the HDR format
can express and here these are our
latest truly wireless sports headphones
so in addition to their exceptional
sound quality for the first time in the
industry we have achieved both noise
cancelling and splash proof in a
remarkable compact cable this form
factor and they will be available in
both truly wireless as well as behind
the next styles and are arriving at
retail in the spring if you want to
bring the exceptional audio and visual
entertainment to your home but minimize
the presence of gadgets in your personal
living space
we have a new life space UX projector
now with built-in speakers I strongly
believe that there is still room for
even more innovation in consumer
electronics you know when Sony's
consumer electronics business was
struggling over the past several years I
was actually asked often why I was
retaining those business units but quite
honestly the answer was absolutely clear
to me and that is because there was
still so much that we can do to innovate
to bring you the most meaningful
creative and entertainment experiences
through all over Sony products the
Xperia hello is a communication robot
developed to become a beloved member of
your family it can recognize each member
of your family with its face detection
and also assist you
via voice command launched in Japan in
November this miniature personal robot
provides essential information such as
news traffic and weather information as
well as video chat and today we're very
excited to introduce one of our latest
accomplishments announced last fall in
Japan once again I bow thank you
I bow is an autonomous robot and will
quickly become a member of your family
right I bow now because of eyeballs
artificial intelligence instinct
technology over time I Bowl actually
recognize you and also deepen its
emotional bond with each and every one
of its owners the new eyeball is also
connect to the cloud via wireless
network and continually accesses
knowledge accumulated from its
interactions with its users it is at
once a charming companion but also a
technological feat and this is exactly
the type of product that delivers
condole technology that inspires
emotional involvement and ladies and
gentlemen I bow is just the beginning
thank you for coming today and on behalf
of all of us here at Sony we look
forward to spending time with you right
here during CES thank you very much
