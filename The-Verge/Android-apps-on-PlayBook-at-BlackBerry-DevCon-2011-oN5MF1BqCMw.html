you can hit the back button and you back
you mean application screen so next time
I'll show you is a 3d gaming app is
based on OpenGL and open to you this
hardware accelerated in our Android in
our faculty runtime so is the 3d you can
straight nice movement so these these
apps you're showing this just really
didn't take any code changes at all to
get these apps up and running on no no
source code changes you didn't even have
to decompile you at Sewickley every
packaging it's just silly packaging
exercise ok so that's the second app
that I want to show you the third app is
a media right so you guys are like watch
movies and stuff so is on the movies on
the Wi-Fi connections little slow over
here but that's very cool
and if you want to watch you so this is
picking up local information from the
GPS you that's correlation providing
local local recommendations so really
integrated with the underlying platform
okay so that's that's how pretty sure
you for the help of the apps okay let me
hand you over to camp will show you how
you can use the existing Eclipse project
that you have but I don't do it and we
targeted towards label device okay
excellent let's take what can you do
Chris let me show you power in a
prepackaged an Android application so
here the screen we have the familiar
Eclipse environment with a delete
anything this is the combination of
human need for any setup standard
environment for Android developers get
it and we have a project here API demos
which is a sample project comes
prepackaged with the Android SDK and
actually hear it here running on
standard Android emulator so nothing has
been changed you unmodified example and
Chris to the board is on a blackberry
playbook what we need to do is just just
add a blackberry in nature video again
pretty familiar concepts absolutely and
again you do launcher the same way as
you launch any other accused project so
here we have the editing billion
admitted you plug in and the blackberry
extension is installed on Eclipse and
they call a labret together as such as
why we see this can seamless experience
so me this is also has integration with
all the tools that growth will take this
package it up and get it delivered down
onto the simulator within the
environment run upon the playbook
absolutely yeah and I should let while
a great wine here is want to show you
something so
q here we have the application morning
yep looks like his way but it's monique
in some way below foiled again by the
Democrats but good point to get
processes you're using your existing
Android to absolutes to build your
applications and then your retargeting
that application towards playbook yeah
it's simple simple repackaging step as
you say many days after coming across to
that any changes are all assistance
truly new packaging so so definitely
encourage everybody to get out to have
Express if you have any case if you want
to see them running on the play book and
just see how easy it is to look in this
environment so thanks guys really
appreciate you coming up thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
