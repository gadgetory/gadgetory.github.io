adrianne jeffries champion rugby player
rugby being the game I made up where I
fall asleep on my rug while eating ramen
this is 90 seconds on the verge Apple's
iPad air is now on sale the 9.7 inch
tablet which is both thinner and lighter
than previous models is available in
both silver and Space Gray pricing
starts at four hundred and ninety-nine
dollars for the 16 gig Wi-Fi only
version meanwhile Apple's iPad Mini with
Retina display is yet to receive an
official release date other than Apple
saying quote later in November finishing
up that last round of Angry Birds Star
Wars won't be so difficult anymore the
FAA is officially allowing the use of
some electronics during takeoff and
landing provided the devices in airplane
mode and held or placed in the seat back
pocket during the initial takeoff and
landing passengers will no longer be
told to turn off electronic devices
Airlines will first need to submit a
plan to manage electronics use before
the new rules can be implemented while
the new rules weren't expected to go
into effect until next year the FAA is
now saying we'll see broad changes by
the holidays Lockheed Martin's iconic
sr-71 blackbird spy plan is getting a
sequel according to Aviation Week the
company is currently working on an SR 70
to that could reach Mach 6 cruise flight
that's twice as fast as the sr-71 which
still holds a number of aircraft speed
records and was capable of outrunning a
bullet test flights wouldn't likely
begin until 2018 but the plane should
fly so fast it'll land in 1998 that's it
for today's top stories coming up
tomorrow we visit an alternate universe
where 90 seconds on the verge is called
one and a half minutes on the verge and
there are more puns too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
