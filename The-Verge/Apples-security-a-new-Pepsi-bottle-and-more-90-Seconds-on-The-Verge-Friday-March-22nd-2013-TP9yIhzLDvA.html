to you by mercedes-benz a major security
hole has been discovered that allows
Apple passwords to be reset with only an
email address and date of birth it
affects all Apple customers who haven't

you change your birthday as of right now
Apple's password reset tool is currently
unavailable quote due to maintenance
Apple is acknowledge the vulnerability
and says it is quote working on fix in

reason has been given for his early
departure and no successor has been
named yet had Janikowski not stepped
down his term still would have been over
