Sunday just live tweeting and updated on
everything every bit of Oscar news that
comes out of the telecast kind of
incredibly warm in here it's like maybe
200 degrees fairy I think when they
roasted all the white nominees and like
this short clips was my favorite part
this is definitely the funniest Oscars
I've ever seen so the man of the street
pick it was a little weird I mean it's
funny that Chris Rock went out to
Compton movie theater to talk about
movies that people aren't watching
people and the movies that people are
watching and it's particularly egregious
for a straight out of Compton because
it's it should be exactly the kind of
movie that is lauded by the academy but
the problem with the bit is that it kind
of positions black people as these oh
these talking has they're crazy and kind
of ignorant about what art is if I had
to think of one moment where everybody
in our office was screaming and saying
what just happened it was probably when
stacey dash came out to wish everybody a
happy Black History Month I've been
intently watching Sam Smith in the
weekend who have both performed of those
two I think the weekend did a much
better job sam looked a little nervous
he looked at he sounded a little flat
occasionally he looked like Jude Law's
weird cousin can I talk about the fact i
had no idea that Dave Grohl performed
we're just like two and a half hours in
and the big thing that's happened so far
is that Mad Max was kind of sweeping the
technical awards 31-6 not a lot
surprises except of course the best
winner of the night spotlight well well
deserved I didn't think it was gonna win
I thought the revenant had a lot of
momentum going in I thought spotlight I
was going to have to go home pretty much
empty handed and then lo and behold
people loved dramatic journalism movies
I guess Mad Max was robbed yeah I mean
Mad Max is if you wanna talk about a
complete movie going experience Mad Max
is the best film of the year oh yeah the
ticker was this crazy innovation on the
Oscars where they just show all of I
guess everybody prepares all their
acknowledgments in advance if they're
gonna win no more randos and acceptance
speeches i think that was like the pitch
i haven't been paying any attention to
it at all has anyone been paying
attention to it i honestly barely
realized it was a saying it didn't
didn't work i think the main point was
to get more substantial speech stuff out
there which worked to a degree there
were some good moments of people kind of
shouting out causes I'm excited to see
if Leo wins just because I'm tired of
talking about it I don't know what he
would do to himself if he lost again I'm
worried for him we could only a watch I
don't really know if what he did in the
rabbinate counts is acting because like
going somewhere and actually being cold
and actually eating an animal heart and
actually far thing isn't you're like
acting it's just like doing things that
are awful I hope that Leonardo DiCaprio
wins because if he doesn't the
Internet's gonna have to say something
about that yeah the internet is going to
be completely out sufferable
tomorrow after Leo one I'm so thankfully
the mean should die at this point I've
come to peace of Leo Winnie I was ups
fighting it all the way up till the
moment he won because I'm not a fan I've
never really been a fan I don't believe
a word that he says in any role I never
believed him in a role I don't even
believe him when he was doing his thank
yous he didn't vape on stage she was a
little disappointing I'm still good okay
good I think it I think it turned out
pretty well
