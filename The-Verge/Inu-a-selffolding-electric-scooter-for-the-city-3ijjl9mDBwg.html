by a company called green ride for the
express purpose of getting around in the
world's biggest city but the big
question is what's it like to ride it's
a lot of fun it is not exciting like an
electric skateboard can be it's not as
fast as an electric car but this thing
is something you would definitely want
to ride every day to work it has
regenerative braking so you can keep the
battery going longer than most other
electric scooters there's even a leather
seat so I mean this thing is just as
comfortable as you're gonna find an
electric scooter rides real smooth got a
really cool suspension and a brake
actually works really well too all right
most electric vehicles go really fast
off the start this isn't going too fast
but this is actually really Pleasant
this is cut-price now why is this good
for commuters first it charges really
fast you can charge this thing fully in
three hours and you can get half of a
charge in just an hour
second it folds up so that you can pick
it up and go you can bring this thing on
the subway get off the subway unfold it
and keep riding solves that problem in
the last mile getting to and from work
or your home this isn't really going to
be for everybody it's not really meant
to be it's a high style high-class kind
of thing if you think about like a vest
is like an unattainable object this is
the electric version of that but you're
getting a lot for that style not only
the really crazy bells and whistles but
this is a head-turning kind of scooter
now when it launches in Europe in New
York next year you're gonna be looking
at paying about four thousand dollars
for it as nice as this thing is I don't
know if I'm gonna want to buy it but
whatever this thing inspires that's what
I'm gonna want to buy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
