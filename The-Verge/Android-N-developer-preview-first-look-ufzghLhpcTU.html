world by releasing a brand new version
of Android today it's Android n but it's
the Developer Preview it's a very early
beta release it's not the sort of thing
you should install on your phone to use
every day but you can install it on a
nexus by going to the website
downloading all the files or soon today
they will be letting Nexus users update
over-the-air directly so you don't have
to lose all your data which is really
cool but you probably shouldn't do it
unless you've just got a test device
lying around we haven't have a test
device lying around so let's show you
what we were seeing so far in Android n
so the biggest news in Android End is
that they've updated multitasking so you
can have more than one app open at a
time it works both on phones and on
tablets so you'll see I hit this
multitasking button and it pops up
really quickly you can still quit stuff
but what you do is you hold down on the
little bar at the top you drag it up to
the top and put all this on your
multitasking you can resize the things
you can open up the other app in the
other window and so on if you go back to
the home screen the second app that you
have open actually shoots up to the nav
bar up at the top which is kind of
clever and so I open up site downloads
here it hops back down and so it works
pretty well it also will work in
landscape basically it just copies the
portrait landscape stuff that most
Android apps are capable of doing that
said it can be a little bit buggy
although I will note that we got it to
work pretty well with third-party apps
just out of the box before eventually we
got to a crash so this is pretty early
but it's great to see android finally
handle this really happy about that
the next big change you're going to
notice is in the notification shade so
these notifications look a little bit
different than they used to and they
also have a lot more information inside
them so you can still drag down on any
you know notification with more
information to look at it you've one
finger to finger drag you can also reply
directly to people from the notification
shade for any app if a developer builds
it in and the same way that hangout does
and you may have noticed these icons up
at the top this is a little thing
Google seems to have borrowed from
Samsung these are the quick settings
they're there right away when you pull
down you can also pull down again to
expand them into the old quick settings
mode and it's paginate 'add and you can
edit it to move stuff in and out of it
as you like so we can take hotspot put
it back to the main quick settings and
now there's a hot spot there so that is
pretty neat
and speaking of settings I want to show
a couple things to you so you can
actually now just hold down on one of
these quick settings to jump right into
the settings for that thing so I'll jump
right into Wi-Fi if I go into the entire
settings here you'll see that they list
a lot more information tells you a Wi-Fi
network you're on what is going on with
everything here it even gives you little
suggestions if you want to you know you
should set up a screen lock you should
change the wallpaper and there's another
feature called data saver which you can
go in here and you can turn that on and
it will restrict apps from you know
using too much data and you can even
choose which apps are allowed to use
however much they want here so we'll be
playing a lot more with that feature
soon some stuff that's a little bit
harder to show you there is a new
version of doze that is able to work
even if it's in your pocket and you're
moving around so that should really help
with battery life and you can see here
in the the battery meter here it shows
you how much time is left right from the
notification shade which is pretty cool
so I got to say overall I'm actually
really impressed with this build of
Android n the animations are way faster
everything seems snappier and I know
that this is a fresh brand new device
and everything is always nice and a
brand new device but it really looks
good now the important thing to know is
this is not everything there is to know
about Android n Google says there's
going to be much more that they're going
to tell us about it and I'm pretty sure
they're going to do that at the Google
i/o conference in May and you can
guarantee that we're going to be there
live to tell you all about it if you
want to know more about Android or see
some other stuff that we've done you

YouTube and hit that subscribe button
