Sony's booth at CES 2018 and I am with
the ketta schedule at the show is it the
new iBook I'm a cat person normally good
you are pretty I'm like am i cute too
thank you thank you ever thank you so I
bow is one of Sony Sony's iconic grants
it's a it's a range that dates back to
the late 90s in Japan it was a whole
series of robot dogs but it's been
brought back for 2018 with this new
model and it's a lot more advanced than
previous ones you can see these
expressive OLED eyes that he seems to be
giving me the puppy eyes with there are
touch sensors all over it so you can pet
it under the chin on the top of its head
on its back and you can see how he
reacts to the sensation of being petted
there's a camera in his nose so we can
recognize people in the family that he
lives with and there's a camera on his
back which helps orientate it in his
surroundings and of course the whole
point of AIBO is that it's a robot pet
right so it it can sit it can fetch it
go and shake your hand it can pick up
the bone if if we can align itself with
a bone it's not that not the greatest
environment to recreate a home with all
these people and Wi-Fi signals flying
around so I was using to cut the camera
right now to align himself with the bone
and if we're lucky he's gonna look down
and pick it up with his mouth
well it was it was a good tray good good
boy
so yeah this eyeball model is a lot more
technologically advanced than previous
ones that came out you know 10-15 years
ago
there are 20 through actuators in the
body there's touch panels everywhere to
help you kind of pet it and give it
realistic animation and feedback the
battery life is about two hours it uses
this camera on the rear to locate its
charging stand and it takes about three
hours to charge up from there so it's
kind of like a robot vacuum cleaner with
legs and yeah these OLED eyes are
leveraging Sony's technology that the
whole point is that it's meant to
interact naturally with your voice and
through the camera in its nose it'll
actually recognize family members that
play with it more and sort of build a
stronger relationship with them it'll
it'll actually interact with them in a
more friendly in realistic way all of
all of these technological advances well
the concept isn't totally new the
technological advances are there to help
build a more realistic relationship with
the dog and that's actually a really big
deal because well the idea of a robot
pet may seem strange in Japan like there
was a huge huge community of AI both
owners who got really upset when her
support for the line ended there's no
longer a technical support for IO in
Japan and some people have even gone as
far as to give funerals for their dogs
so this is the kind of thing that people
really do feel a bond with and the
technological advances are actually
going to improve that kind of bond so
eyeball is only confirmed for a Japanese
release right now just like the original
eyeball line was Japan only this new
model is shipping in Japan from next
week the price is around three thousand
dollars and there's no plans to bring it
to the US just yet but it it's answering
English commands right now so here's
hoping that robot dogs will be filling
the homes in America sometime soon
we're stopping right now he's going to
sleep oh he's got a selection about with
another dog okay sorry sorry I said we
killed over</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
