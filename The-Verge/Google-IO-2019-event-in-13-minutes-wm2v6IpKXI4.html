- Good morning, good morning.
Wonderful to be back here at Shoreline
with all of you.
Last year we launched a
new feature in Google News
called Full Coverage,
and we have gotten great
feedback on it from our users.
We'll be bringing full
coverage directly to Search
to better organize results
for news-related topics.
You can even now see a timeline of events,
and we'll be bringing this
to Search later this year.
Podcasts are another important
source of information.
And we'll be bringing them
directly to Search as well.
- With computer vision
and augmented reality,
the camera in our hands
is turning into a powerful
visual tool, so today we are
excited to bring the camera
to Google Search.
Now when you search for
something like muscle flexion,
you can view a 3D model
built by visible body,
right from the search results.
Not only that, pretty cool.
Not only that, you can also
place it in your own space.
(audience gasping and cheering)
Okay, today let me show
you somebody new ways
that we're making Lens
more helpful to you.
Say you're at a restaurant
trying to figure out what to order.
Lens automatically
highlights the popular dishes
at this restaurant, right on the menu.
And of course if you wanna know more,
you can tap on any dish on the menu
and you can see what it looks like,
again, at the restaurant.
And of course check out what other people
are saying about it on Google Maps.
By the way, when you're done eating,
Lens can help pay for your meal.
Not so fast, it's not picking up your tab,
but it can calculate the tip
and even split the total.
But we're starting to think of other ways
that we can connect
helpful digital information
with the things in the physical world.
So I'm gonna give you just one example.
You're flipping through
a Bon Appetit magazine
and you see a recipe you like.
Soon, you can point your
camera at the recipe
and see the page come alive.
- Duplex enables Google Assistant
to make restaurant
reservations on your behalf
by actually placing a call.
But now we are moving beyond voice,
and extending Duplex to tasks on the web.
Say you get a calendar
reminder about an upcoming trip
and you wanna book a rental car.
You can just ask Google,
book a National car rental
for my next trip.
The Assistant opens the National website
and automatically starts
filling out your information.
It's acting on your behalf
and helping you save time,
but you are always in control of the flow.
What you just saw is an early preview
of what we are calling Duplex on the web,
and we'll have more
details later this year.
- What if the Assistant was so fast
that processing your voice, that tapping
to operate your phone
would almost seem slow.
This next generation Assistant
will let you instantly operate
your phone with your voice,
multi-task across apps,
and complete your calendar
will even work offline.
But it also has to be personal enough
to really help you.
We call this feature picks for you,
and it'll be launching on smart
displays later this summer,
starting with recipes,
podcasts, and events.
Now beyond your preferences,
becoming more personal means the Assistant
will better understand the
people, places, and events
that are important to you.
If you shared important
people, places, and events
with the Assistant, you'll
be able to ask for things
more naturally, and rest assured,
you're always in control.
You can edit or delete
this information at anytime
in the updated you tab
in Assistant settings.
I'm happy to share the
Assistant is also coming
to ways in the next few weeks.
Now I'd like to show you this
future of how we're improving
your mobile driving experience even more.
Introducing the Assistant's
new driving mode.
Just put your phone in the car and say,
hey Google, let's drive.
Driving mode will be available this summer
on any Android phone with the Assistant.
- Part of the way we built for everyone
is by ensuring that our
products are safe and private.
If you're in Search, you
can tap on your photo
and you can quickly access
the most relevant privacy
controls for Search
in case your data in Search.
Here, you can view and
manage your recent activity,
and you can easily change
your privacy settings.
Last week we announced
auto delete controls,
which you'll also be able
to access right from that.
Data helps make Search
work better for you.
And with auto delete, you can choose
how long you want it to be saved.
This is launching today
for web and app activity.
We'll be rolling it
out in location history
in the coming weeks.
One tap access to your Google account
will be coming to our major products,
including Chrome, Search,
Assistant, YouTube,
Google News, and Maps.
And speaking of Maps, if you
tap on your profile photo,
in addition to finding easy access
to your privacy controls,
you'll find a new feature, incognito mode.
Incognito mode has been a popular feature
in Chrome since it launched,
and we are bringing this to Maps.
While in incognito in Maps,
your activity, like the places you search
and navigate to won't be
linked to your account.
We wanna make it easy to enter in and out
of incognito and Maps will
soon join Chrome and YouTube
with support for incognito,
and will be bringing it
to Search as well this year.
- Today there are over 2.5
billion active Android devices.
And this year, display technology
will take an even bigger leap
with foldables coming from
multiple Android OEMs.
Foldables take advantage
of a completely new
display technology.
They literally bend and fold,
from phone to tablet-size screen.
And Q maximizes what's
possible on these screens.
Another exciting innovation is 5G.
And Android Q supports 5G natively.
Now in addition to hardware innovation,
we're also seeing huge firsts in software
driven by advances in
on-device machine learning.
All this protects user privacy.
And this is OS-wide.
No the same on-device machine learning
powers another useful Q
feature, which is smart reply.
With smart reply, the
OS helpfully suggests
what you'll type next.
It'll predict the text you'll type,
even emojis, and it's a huge time saver.
What's really cool is this works now
for all messaging apps in Android.
Now there's one more addition
to Android Q that's small
but you've been asking
us about for a while,
and that is dark theme.
And we're launching it in Q.
You can activate it by
using the quick tile
or by turning on battery saver,
and in fact it will help you save battery.
You should always be in
control of what you share
and who you share it with.
In Q we've brought privacy
to the top level in settings,
and there you'll find a
number of important controls
all in one place.
Activity data, location history,
ad settings, and you
decide what's on or off.
With Q your device will
give you helpful reminders
whenever an app accesses location
when you're not actively using that app.
In Q we've brought location controls
to the forefront in settings
so you can quickly review every app
and change location access
with simple controls.
We wanna help people find balance,
and that's why we've created
a new mode for Android.
It's called focus mode.
When I enter focus mode,
I can select the apps
that I find distracting.
Focus mode is coming to
devices on P and Q this fall.
In Q, family link parental
controls will be built
right into the settings of the device,
so when you set up a device
for someone in your family,
family link will help
connect it to a parent,
and you can review any apps
that your child wants to install.
Now there's a ton more in Q
that we don't have time to cover.
A ton.
Everything from streaming
media to hearing aids,
to better connectivity, to new gesture UI,
and more, so today I'm excited to announce
that Q beta three is available
on 21 devices.
- Over the past year
we've brought the Nest
and Google teams together
to deliver on our vision
of the helpful home.
And today, we're further
simplifying things,
bringing all of these products together
under the Nest name.
Introducing Nest Hub Max.
It's a new product that has a camera
and a larger 10-inch display.
If you wanna know what's
going on in your home,
you can choose to use it like a Nest Cam.
And just like a Nest Cam,
it's easy to see your event history,
enable home and away assist,
and you also get a notification
if the camera detects
any motion or see someone it
doesn't recognize in your home.
The camera has a wide angle lens
and it automatically adjusts
to keep you centered in the frame.
You can chat with any
iOS or Android device,
or a PC with a Chrome browser.
You can also use Duo
to leave video messages
for members of your household.
Nothing is streamed or recorded
unless you intentionally enable it.
And you'll always know
when the camera is on
with a green indicator light.
You have multiple controls
to disable camera features
and a physical switch on the back
electrically disconnects the
camera and the microphones.
But today we're also extending the options
to personalize using the camera
with a feature we call face match.
For each person in your family
that chooses to turn it on,
the Assistant guides you through a process
of creating a face model,
which is then encrypted
and stored on the device.
Then, whenever you walk
in front of the camera,
Hub Max recognizes you and
shows just your information
and not anyone else's.
And in the morning, I
can walk into the kitchen
and the Assistant knows to greet me
with my calendar, my commuting details,
the weather, and any other information
I need to start my day.
You're also getting full stereo sound
with a powerful rear-facing woofer.
And now when the volume's up
instead of yelling at the
Assistant to turn it down
or pause the game, with the camera,
it's as simple as a gesture.
You just raise your hand.
All this will be available on Nest Hub Max
later this summer for just $229.
And today, we're lowering the price
of the original Nest
Hub from $149 to $129.
Next I wanna talk about Pixel.
I wanna introduce you
to the newest members
of the Pixel family, Google Pixel 3a
and 3A XL, designed to
deliver premium features
at a price people will love.
They start at just $399.
- Pixel 3a comes in three colors.
Just black, clearly
white, and a new color,
purple-ish.
(audience laughing)
Pixel 3a supports Blue Tooth 5.0,
and USBC digital audio,
and we've also included a
3.5 millimeter audio jack.
Pixel 3a can take amazing
photos in low light
with night sight.
We've also enabled Pixel's portrait mode
on both the front and rear cameras.
And our super res zoom applies
computational photography.
Starting today on Pixel phones,
when you use walking
directions instead of staring
at that blue dot on your phone,
you're going to see
arrows in the real world
to tell you where to turn next.
(audience cheering)
Pixel 3a has adaptive battery,
uses machine learning to optimize
based on how you use your phone.
So you can get up to 30
hours on a single charge.
And, with the included 18-watt charger,
you'll get up to seven
hours of battery life
with just 15 minutes of charging.
On the software side, you get the latest
Google security patches
and updates for three years
including Android Q this summer.
Pixel 3a and 3axl are
available in 13 markets
starting today.
- Thank you, and enjoy the rest of iO.
- Now before I go, I wanna
share a little something
that a lot of you have been asking for.
Check this out.
(uplifting music)
Stop.
No hey Google needed.
And it's rolling out on smart displays
and Google homes in English-speaking
locales starting today.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
