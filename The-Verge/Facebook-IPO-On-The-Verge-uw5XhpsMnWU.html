heard about this new site everybody's
talking about it apparently you can
connect with friends and family Oh your
ex-girlfriends will haunt you forever my
if I had any ex girl sir audio be thanks
thanks a lot yet it rub it in did you
saying no but so Facebook filed for
their IPO they're going to go public
they're going to be a publicly traded
company and you have a theory about it
what is your theory well you know I
think this is like the moment when the
internet kind of grows up right i mean
facebook is you read the filing they
filed with the SEC they're gonna say
we're be a problem you all are going to
read it don't either fine I did it I did
it for you want to be clear and the only
lining is where Mark Zuckerberg says in
the filing he writes a letter in the
middle of finally numbers numbers
numbers charts and then a letter from
Mark Zuckerberg Lurie's like I made
facebook because I wanted it to exist it
was nuts right also says is that human
relationships are of the fundamental
yeah fundamental unit of society unit of
society the basic society unit I don't
say is a society unit how many of
you can you quantify you see make a
society more face before Facebook now we
know what the fundamental building block
is yeah give it really it's not the idea
that the company that some kid in
college just was like I want it to
happen and now it's as big as GM or
Apple or Microsoft you know it's one of
these amazingly huge parts of American
economy yeah I think that's that makes
it real you know and once there's a lot
of money and power in one place the
government kind of like follows behind
like oh we should regulate this and I
think that's what you're seeing you're
seeing use or use Facebook to or operon
yeah to figure see your face on facebook
I like it's not easy to yeah I just like
the law I like that no need the house of
the Senate it's like I mean you know
what let you see what happens I mean
what's the worst thing it couldn't get
it right so we actually can you just
imagine a politician Mitt Romney
standing up there I me like do you like
me do you like he means it yes very
people hovering over that bloody oh
really I don't know I don't know I agree
that face this IPO is is fundamentally
different than like a Google IPO I mean
a facebook is very much part of our
culture and I definitely see it as like
permanent fixture in internet years like
five years that's permanent that's term
another God years I get internet yeah
five years is a lathe like my internet
here is like is like short it's like 10
years instead of seven that's it i'm so
confused right now no idea what you
thought them out yeah you don't think it
has staying power so you're saying i
just think i could it very well could if
they keep on innovating but they don't
have any sort of luck they don't have
any sort of guarantee you know I maybe
got one point in my life I was doing a
ton of social activities on myspace wow
you were used my city my competitor more
than I use social studies can you get
out of my detail on the bomber on my
Smith hey what I was I would like your
mama drama and lies man what's your
social and I spent my social capilla
capita capital you know we actually did
a video you actually have a video i went
down to wall street cuz i wanted to try
to talk i was like i'm gonna talk to
analyst and wall street guys about
facebook the facebook IPO weirdly they
did not want to speak on camera as if
they were doing something secret or
illegal yeah uh but but there is really
humble you're just super hungry its not
us the money we're just up here just
moving it around we're gonna take credit
for that but uh but there are a lot of
Belgians who wanted to speak to us with
his on but up but it's actually really
interesting we just talked about what
people thought of facebook and if they
thought it was like a viable company and
take a look at this video it's quite
interesting hey this is josh from the
verge and as you know Facebook just
filed for their IPO so we came down to
Wall Street in downtown New York to talk
to people about Facebook we got to find
like people with money who want to spend
it on Facebook what's your name and what
do you do to patel I'm wait a minute
what is this for so I'm just going to
ask impression about Facebook and you
know we'll see what happens their stock
is about to go public would you invest
in facebook uh probably not myself I
