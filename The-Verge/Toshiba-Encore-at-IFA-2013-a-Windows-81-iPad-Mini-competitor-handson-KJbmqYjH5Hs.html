verge and we're looking at toshiba's on
call tablet which is the latest eight
inch Windows 8.1 tablet and now this
comes with the Intel bay trail processor
so you get the full support of the
desktop here and it's or traditional
applications closure is actually
shipping version of office on here as
well so you can get to word and excel
etc and now this is one of the first Bay
trial devices on the actual device we
got a 2 megapixel camera at the front
here which is which Tosh proclaims is
optimized for skype calls and then we've
got the usual capacitive windows button
at the bottom here and then towards the
side of the device we've got the power
button and the volume controls and in a
8 megapixel rear camera and and then at
the top got micro HDMI and a micro USB
and say if you want to use the normal
USB on here you can have to use an
adapter and you've got the headphone
jack and then a microSD slot down the
side and looking at the sort thickness
and size of this you can just about hold
it in one hand and so it's kind of very
similar to how the ipad mini fills it in
the hand and if we take a look alongside
the ipad mini you see it's a little bit
it's a little bit taller and probably
around about the same which you can see
the top of the device sort of points out
there in terms of the bezel um i'd say
they're fairly similar but obviously the
height is there's a little bit more
bezel on the Tosh over here and now this
isn't a final version so apparently the
final version might maybe a little bit
slimmer and we can see it's a little bit
thicker than the ipad mini here and in
the rear the device isn't final weaver
so that's going to come a slightly
different finish and that was the
toshiba uncle and 8 inch windows 8.1
tablet that's coming in november</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
