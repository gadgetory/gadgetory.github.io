- And welcome to WWDC 2019!
(audience clapping)
I'm excited to share
with you this morning
how we're gonna make tvOS
even more entertaining and more personal.
We completely redesigned the Home screen
with full-screen previews
of the best TV shows
and newly released movies.
(audience clapping)
Everyone in the Home
gets their own Up Next list
plus personalized recommendations
for new shows and movies to enjoy.
And it's easy to switch
between family members
using the all new Control Center.
It works just like you
would expect it to hear.
tvOS also delivers Apple Music.
You're gonna be able
(&quot;Rainbow&quot;)
to see lyrics to your favorite songs
in sync with the music.
Now, Apple Arcade is also
going to look amazing
on the Apple TV 4K display.
We're extending support to two of the best
and most popular game
controllers available:
Xbox One X!
(audience cheering)
Yes!
(audience cheering)
And PlayStation DualShock 4!
(audience cheering)
Now, let's talk about Apple Watch.
- Now, across all the Watch faces,
we're introducing taptic chimes
and when enabled on the hour,
you'll feel a silent taptic on your wrist
and if sound is on,
you'll hear an audible chime like this.
(bird chirping)
First, we're bringing
more Apple apps to Watch.
The new Audiobooks app, and
Voice Memos, and Calculator.
And we're now making it
possible to create apps
that run independently on the Watch,
no longer requiring a
companion iPhone app.
watchOs 6 now enables
the Streaming Audio API
so you can go adjust your Watch.
Now, to make it even easier
for you to discover these apps,
we're excited to bring the Apps Store
to Apple Watch.
(audience cheering)
You can purchase and install
an app directly on your Watch.
- So in watchOS 6, we're introducing
activity trends.
(audience clapping)
It'll compare your progress
over the last 90 days with the last 365.
If the trend show that you're
maintaining or improving,
you'll see an arrow pointing
up and that's great!
Keep doing what you're doing.
Let's talk about your hearing health.
The new Noise app uses a
microphone to detect decibel levels
and can notify you if it's reached a level
that can impact your hearing over time.
If you tap the Noise app,
you'll get more detail,
and you can use the complication to check
which is to raise and arrest.
Now, there's one more new
feature in health and fitness:
Cycle Tracking.
So in watchOS 6, the Cycle Tracking app
gives you a simple, discrete way
to visualize your cycle
right on your wrist.
You can log key aspects of
your period and fertility
including symptoms,
and you can be notified
when it's about to begin.
You can also choose to receive
a fertile window prediction
so you are better informed
and because we wanna make this available
to hundreds of millions
of women around the world,
Cycle Tracking is also
available without a Watch
in the Health app is iOS.
(audience clapping)
- iOS 13 is a huge release,
packed with lots of capabilities,
but we know that nothing is more important
to our iPhone users than performance.
Unlocking with Face ID, now 30% faster.
We've changed the way
that we're packaging apps
on the App Store.
You'll see that your
downloads are now 50% smaller
and updates, 60% smaller.
(audience clapping)
We are bringing dark mode
(audience cheering)
to iOS.
Look at that.
(sensual music)
A gorgeous dark wallpaper
and notifications look great.
Let's take a look at our widgets.
Just awesome.
We'll start with News.
Check it out with a
gorgeous, dark appearance
and your Calendar.
Let's take a trip into Messages.
You see how your images, your emoji,
they all look just fantastic.
(upbeat electrical music)
And some new tricks
because now, when you type, you can swipe.
Let's take a look at our new Share Sheet.
It looks awesome in dark mode
(audience cheering)
but you notice in the middle,
sharing suggestions,
intelligently based on
who you share with and
who appears in the photos.
Your Music looks great in dark mode.
You go through some of my recent playback.
Of course, start playing
(energetic rock music)
some music here
and now for the first time ever,
time-synced lyrics.
Now, Safari has new options
(sensual music)
to quickly change text sizing
and as per website preferences.
Mail gets desktop classed
text formatting controls,
(upbeat electrical music)
including support
for rich fonts.
And Notes gets this
beautiful new gallery view,
support for shared folders, and much more.
Next, Maps.
- You'll notice in the
upper right-hand corner,
there is a new binoculars button.
When I tap that,
I get a brand new look-around window.
Yep, this is the right place to drop in
so I'm gonna go full screen.
With look around, I get a
gorgeous high-definition 3D view.
This is my favorite part.
Turn your phone and hold on tight.
Smoothly move down the street.
(audience member cheering)
- Now, for the first time
you can share your location
to an app just once and then
require it to ask you again
next time it wants it.
(audience cheering)
Next, I wanna turn to log in.
We've all seen buttons like this,
asking us to use a social account log in
to get a more personalized
experience with an app.
And so now we have the solution.
It's called
Sign in with Apple.
(audience cheering)
Tap it and you're authenticated
with Face ID on your device,
logged in with a new account
without revealing any
new personal information.
So, we're introducing something new.
It's called Memoji Stickers.
(audience clapping)
We automatically create
a sticker pack for you
for each of your Memoji.
Now, of course, you can
use them in Messages,
but we've also incorporated them
right alongside Emoji
in the system keyboard.
I wanna turn the Camera and Photos.
You can see at a glance,
all your settings.
What's really cool is
we're bringing all of this
to video for the first time.
You can rotate a video.
(audience cheering)
- I'm so excited
to show you guys the new Photos app.
I just tap down here at the bottom
and you see Days is absolutely beautiful.
The clutter of the similar photos is gone.
I can just scroll and enjoy now.
So you can see videos like this time lapse
play automatically for me,
really bringing my library back to life.
So, let's head over to Years.
So Years gives me a high-level
overview of my library.
What makes Years really
special is that it's dynamic.
And Photos knows I go
to Dub Dub every year.
So now, it's showing me all
of my Dub Dubs for the past.
- Lets get started with AirPod.
First, when you're wearing AirPods,
Siri will now be available
to read your incoming messages to you
as soon as they arrive and
you can instantly respond.
Another great new
feature is audio sharing.
We have all had a time where we wanted
to share a movie or a song with a friend.
Now you can with just a tap.
We are bringing hand off to HomePod.
Now, when you walk through the door,
just bring your iPhone
close to your HomePod
to instantly hand off your music,
a podcast, or even a phone call,
and you can just take it with you
when you leave the exact same way.
Today, we're introducing live radio
so you can ask Siri to play stations
from iHeartRadio, TuneIn, and RADIO.COM.
This year, we have our
biggest update to CarPlay
since the beginning
with a CarPlay dashboard
where you can now have your
music next to your Maps,
and you still have room
for Siri smart suggestions.
And it now works with third-party apps
like Pandora and Waze.
- You may notice there's
been one thing missing
from the iOS 13 story and that's iPad.
(audience cheering)
We're calling it iPadOS
and I'd like to give you a first look.
So, watch what happens when I swipe over.
I can now pin my widgets
right on my home screen.
(audience cheering)
We're bringing multi-window
capability to apps on iPad.
For instance, I have a single
note right here in Notes,
but what if I wanna have
two notes side by side?
Well, now I can.
Now, browsing in Files, of course,
you have icon view, list view.
Well, how about column view?
Great for digging through
deep file hierarchies.
You get a great file preview right here
and quick actions for
things like rotating images,
making PDFs, and great rich
metadata right at the bottom.
Now, also improving the
way you can share files.
For instance, in iCloud Drive,
we now support folder sharing.
(audience cheering)
That's right.
You can now plug in
a thumb drive.
(audience clapping)
Thumb drives, external
disc drives, and SD cards
all show up right in the Files app.
But now, this one's really great too.
Sometimes when you're
working with a camera,
you like to import directly
into an app like Lightroom,
and now you can.
We're also bringing in a download manager
to Safari.
(audience cheering)
So, navigating long documents,
you can now grab the scroll indicator
and jump anywhere in
the document instantly.
Moving cursor is easier than ever.
Just pick it up and drag
it where you want it to go.
And selecting text, just
put your finger down,
and drag out a selection.
You wanna copy or cut?
Just three-finger pinch to copy.
Three-finger spread to plop it right down.
- Let's turn to the Mac!
This is the new Mac Pro!
- So, we're using a brand
new Intel Xeon processor
and it has up to 28 cores,
six channels of super fast
ECC memory, and 12 DIMM slots,
enabling an incredible 1.5 terabytes
of system memory.
(audience cheering)
So we're bringing PCI
Expansion back to the Mac.
It has eight internal PCI slots.
Now this I/O cart has
two Thunderbolt 3 ports,
two USB-A ports, and an audio jack.
And there are also two
more Thunderbolt 3 ports
conveniently located on
the top of the system.
This includes Adobe, Autodesk,
Serif, and Blackmagic.
We're all announcing support
for the new Mac Pro today.
SideFX, Red, Epic, and Avid
are also announcing support today.
- It's a 32-inch LCD display
with over 20 million pixels.
It's a 6K retina display.
(audience clapping)
And so we call this display
the Pro Display XDR.
- Now, if you look at
other systems configured
with comparable components,
you'll see that they cost around $8000.
The new Mac Pro will start at 5999.
It's gonna be available this fall.
The Pro Display XDR will be 4999
for the display itself.
(audience clapping)
The VESA Mount Adapter will be 199
and the Pro Stand, 999.
- It's macOS Catalina.
We begin with iTunes.
The future of our iTunes
is not one app, but three:
Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple TV.
And now I wanna turn to something new.
We call it Sidecar.
Now, you can use your
iPad as a second display
(audience cheering)
for your Mac.
Now, Voice Control, let's
you control your Mac
entirely with your voice.
We're also bringing it to iOS as well.
(upbeat music)
- Open Maps.
Show grid.
Long press it 20.
Open App Switcher.
Four.
Tap share.
Tap Tim.
Tap send.
- And next, I wanna turn to a new solution
that helps you find your Mac
should it ever be lost or stolen.
It's called Find My.
Now, Find My combines Find My
iPhone with Find My Friends,
and it's not available on the
Mac and iOS devices as well.
But also for the first time,
we're bringing Screen Time to the Mac.
We've been working on a new project
and internally, we
called Project Catalyst,
and it's new technology
that lets developers quickly
and efficiently create apps for the Mac
based on their existing iPad apps.
An ARKit is a major update.
Now, this is insane.
(audience cheering)
What used to require
painstaking compositing by hand
can now be done in real time.
(audience clapping)
Motion capture, just point
your camera at a person,
and we can track it in real time.
- This is Minecraft Earth.
- [Man] This use Motion Capture
and make your character wave.
Try to one wave.
Let's try to trick it to double wave.
Cool.
- And of course, all
of this great software
will be available to
our users in the fall.
Thank you!
- So we've never seen
this before in Logic.
I've got 300, 400, 500.
(audience cheering)
We can now have a thousand audio tracks
and a thousand software
instruments in Logic.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
