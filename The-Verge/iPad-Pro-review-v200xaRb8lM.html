notable thing about Apple's new iPad pro
is its giant size or it's gorgeous
high-resolution display but actually the
more interesting thing about the new
iPad pro is its price because when you
consider the price of it seven hundred
ninety nine dollars for the base model a
thousand seventy nine for the
top-of-the-line iPad pro then an
optional $99 stylus $169 keyboard you're
entering a new category the big leagues
that's as much as Apple's own MacBook
Air or a Microsoft Surface pro and
they're you know real computers not just
tablets I know I know the distinction
almost feels outdated but isn't that the
point so the big question around the
iPad pro is who is it for
do you really need this much iPad and
can it replace your day-to-day laptop
okay let's start by talking about how
big the iPad pro is it has a twelve
point nine inch diagonal display larger
than any iPad before it and at a pound
and a half it's also on the heavy side
for an iPad but as with almost
everything in tech gadgetry it's really
a matter of relativity is the twelve
point nine inch diagonal display big
sure for a tablet but that's about the
same size and weight as Microsoft's new
surface pro 4 and it's still smaller
than my 13-inch MacBook Pro and lighter
than the MacBook Air the iPad pro has a
super high-resolution display so photos
videos even text look insanely good on
it it has Apple's newest chip
architecture the a9x chip which apple
claims offers double the CPU and double
the graphics performance of the chip and
iPad air 2 and apple claims ten hours of
battery life though in my test it came
in just under that it is without a doubt
the most powerful iPad ever in fact
there are a lot of things about it that
make this feel like a full computer it
can multitask with split screens so you
can run various apps like mail and slack
or Microsoft Word in Microsoft Excel
side-by-side in their full size and if
you pony up for the Apple pencil you can
do printing remarkable stuff with
software like AutoCAD 360 paper by 53
Adobe Photoshop fix mix sketch
I've been working on my dream kitchen
and paper making a mock-up of a
Christmas card and Adobe comp I edited
photos and Photoshop fix I even tried to
design a 3d model for a car in the app
you make although honestly it looked
more like a car crash than a car there
is something unapologetically Apple
about revealing a white pencil and
calling it pencil and charging $99 for
it and it's lacking some basic design
elements that something like Microsoft
Surface stylus has the top part of it
doesn't work as an eraser it's not
magnetized and it doesn't have a clip if
you want to get old-school nerdy and
stick it in your shirt pocket or
something but this pencil is
technologically impressive we're using
other styluses often results in a tiny
bit of latency the Apple pencil felt
really accurate when I was using it it
has a tilt sensor so it knows when
you're shading basically it felt like
using a pencil then there's the keyboard
maybe even more so than the pencil Apple
really is taking a page from Microsoft
here with this cover keyboard but the
addition of Apple's own keyboard really
does make the iPad pro feel like a PC
replacement it looks like a standard
iPad Smart Cover but a quadrant of the
cover is all keys using a magnetic smart
connector the iPad snaps into the Smart
Cover keyboard and then the keyboard
itself draws power from the iPad so you
don't ever need to charge it it's layout
mirrors the MacBook keyboard layout
though it's missing the whole top row
and of course a trackpad ok so just who
is the iPad pro 4 the most obvious
answer is that it's for people who just
want a giant iPad and have some cash to
spare but it's also for people who want
to play in the surprisingly big world of
creativity apps for iOS and it could end
up being used quite a bit in the
enterprise market
the bigger question for everyone else
then is whether this can replace a
laptop on the one hand it can't
fundamentally do all the things and
MacBook can it can't give you Adobe's
desktop versions of creative apps or
even Apple's own Final Cut Pro and while
split screen and slide over features are
nice it just isn't a replacement for the
ability to position and manipulate
multiple windows on a desktop but even
with those limitations I can say firmly
that it comes dangerously close to being
a macbook replacement i would actually
take this on my next business trip in
lieu of my
top I have never felt that way about an
iPad before five years ago Steve Jobs
said that pcs were trucks implying that
tablets would be cars or something else
more efficient that never happened with
the iPad which consumers have primarily
seen as a consumption device not a
creation device but with the iPad pro
that very well could change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
