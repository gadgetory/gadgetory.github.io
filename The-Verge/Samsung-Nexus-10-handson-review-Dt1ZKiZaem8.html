this is the Nexus 10 it's the largest in
Google's new tablet line and it really
does fit right in with the Nexus 7 and
the new Nexus 4 phone it's fairly
average size for a tablet it's about the
same weight and thickness as the iPad
and it's well made but it's it has this
rubbery smooth back that just doesn't
feel as good as the dimpled material on
the Nexus 7 the key feature of the Nexus
10 obviously is its display it's ten
point oh five five inches and it's 2560
by 1600 resolution is just huge it looks
amazing it's every bit as good as the
iPads Retina display and I spent a long
time trying to decide which was better
before calling it a tie there are little
things that each one does better or
worse but for the most part they're both
fantastic video looks amazing even
high-def 1080p footage but text is
really where you see a big difference
between this and lower res displays no
matter whether the text is large or
small it looks crystal clear and there
are no jaggies or missed pixels the
biggest problem it is actually makes
some elements look bad so I'm hoping
that developers and site owners will
upgrade some of their things like they
did for the retina iPad the Nexus 10 is
powered by a dual core Exynos processor
along with two gigs of RAM and Android
4.2 and it really does work great it's
performance is on the high end of
tablets without being remarkable but
that's mostly due to the fact that it's
pushing so many more pixels than most
tablets everything is smooth and fast
and there are some odd Android caused
lags but those are fewer and further
between with every new release Android
4.2 also brings a bunch of new software
features unfortunately I didn't get to
test two of the coolest features lock
screen widgets and multiple accounts but
those will be here for anyone who buys
the device once it goes on sale you also
get a swipe light keyboard that lets you
move your finger around the screen to
type which is much better than typing on
such a big screen with your fingers you
get a new settings pull down and in
general you just get overall stability
and performance improvements even with
the huge and pixel dense display this is
definitely the fastest and smoothest
Android tablet I've used and that
includes even the Nexus 7 battery life
is also really solid despite the great
screen I used it basically constantly
for three days before I needed to charge
it and that's pretty good but there's
still a huge problem with the Nexus 10
and it's the same one the Nexus 7 has
and any other Android tablet it's the
third-party app ecosystem in a vacuum I
think this is every bit as good a tablet
as the iPad but the iPad has 275,000
tablet optimized apps that
and work great here you get phone apps
blown up to huge sizes and resolutions
and it's just not a good experience the
Nexus 10 starts at $399 for 16 gigs of
storage you can also get 32 gigs for
$499 it's $100 cheaper than the iPad and
if you just want a way to watch Hulu and
Netflix or rent movies you'll probably
be thrilled with this device but without
an app ecosystem to match apples this
isn't nearly the all-around tablet the
iPad is and it certainly can't replace a
computer in a way that the iPad might be
able to the Nexus 10 feels a little like
Google's way of showing off how good an
Android tablet could be almost as if
it's begging developers to help move the
platform forward I don't know if that'll
happen but if and when it does the iPad
might actually have a genuine competitor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
