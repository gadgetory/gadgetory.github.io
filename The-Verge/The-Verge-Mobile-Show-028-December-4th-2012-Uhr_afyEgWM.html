this is episode 28 it's the week of
December third 2012 we're going to talk
about things in the mobile world that
happened this week so many things that
happened and we're going to talk about
them as I said this is really choppy so
I'm just going to say that my name is
dieter bohn to move on my name is Gladys
have oh I'm dan seifert and i'm chris
sigler and were only ten minutes late
today I feel pretty good about that yeah
I feel pretty good that this is the
second week in a row that we're on a
Tuesday so yeah congrats to us and
roughly the same term that were supposed
to be on Roy what we would have been on
time today but we found we found some
some toys in in google hangouts that
distracted us yeah well in other words
we were playing fart sounds because it
was a good time we like them they're fun
um so yeah so I don't know I I think it
was a relatively quiet weekend news
which means that what we're actually
going to do is probably rant and
complain about lots and lots of other
things um the chat room has already gone
back to what we talked about last week
which is that we need the Kin nexus 2 to
be released which makes me really happy
um so I think the first thing I want to
complain about is windows phone 7.8 uh
it's coming out in early 2013 now
Microsoft has finally said and I mean
there's some security enhancements to
exchange but the big new feature is the
the new smaller live tiles and maybe I'm
crazy but this shouldn't be that hard
push out I personally think that it has
more to do with with Microsoft's desire
to give the windows phone 8 devices
enough of a head start on shelves
because if you if you if you get 7.8 out
there quickly I think that you
disincentivize some
owners from upgrading to Windows Phone 8
in a timely fashion so that that might
have something to do with it well I
don't know I mean let's be fair
Microsoft people need a Christmas
holiday break as well come on his
december who does anything useful in
December I was thinking about this Oh
buena onda right this is gonna be the
month where nobody makes big news
intentionally like if you 7.8 is not big
news don't don't over its don't oversell
it bland 7.8 is the smallest news
imaginable well fair enough but in the
context of the windows phone ecosystem
this windows phone seven point a and
this Windows Phone 8 and there's all the
rageaholics who bought the Livia 900
thinking the smartphone beats test was
over and then that's the most ironic
thing that has happened this entire year
nokia n80 saying smartphone beta beta
test is over and then the Lumia 900
being the absolute beta like test run
for the Lumia 920 launch that's exactly
the way that I see it so I mean I'm
totally on board with dita this this
whole thing windows phone 7.8 it's
almost a question of why isn't it out
already like you only give it a small
modification read you should just get it
out let people have it and that's the
other thing you should have the
confidence or you should have faith in
the innovations of Windows Phone 8 to
distinguish it from some point it
shouldn't be just a visual tweak my
people shouldn't be able to see 7.8 and
I look I like it I like whoa it's all
the same thing you should have some
underlying strengths there as well yeah
I mean I just we were so happy with
Microsoft and how they managed to get
updates out the door previous to this
they you know they did really well with
7.5 all things considered especially
compared to you know what they've done
the past especially compared to android
and I know that this is like this is not
the platform of the future but you had
these early adopters they're already
angry about the fact that
getting a windows phone 8 upgrade you
give them this bone and now you're
making them wait for it just I don't
know do what you need to do to get it
out as soon as possible and it is a
little bit oh wait there's new theme
colors that might be the problem they
couldn't figure out the CSS codes for
the new theme colors they've been
they've been debating between FFF eight
and f FF seven and they just haven't
decided which to be fair I was a pretty
hard hard to beat yeah no it's it's a
it's a tough call look I mean for one
thing keep in mind I think tom warren
our very own tom warren microsoft ponded
extraordinaire pointed out that 7.8 is
microsoft's play in the entry-level
market for the foreseeable future so
this isn't a throwaway it's tempting to
think of this version as a throwaway
platform but in some ways it's not
because until the hardware required to
run Windows Phone 8 gets pushed down
market enough to go into China and all
these other places they're going to need
to keep 7.8 and that that line that
technology path alive but as I say
dissembler is not a good news month
that's all we'll go to say look oh I
know I know I know exactly one thing
about Europe and that's that Europe has
like six months of holidays here so I
think that's where this mentality of
yours is coming from wed Wow no I mean
what what is that to go forward to your
probably going to overeat dramatically
then you're probably going to feel
guilty about it you're going to
over-exercise dramatically on one day
then there's going to be sales that is
going to be regretful overspending
during the sales and in January
everything will be just you know on
another clearance sale you'll be a few
pounds heavier and there we know you
software to be excited about like the
only thing we've had to be excited about
this month is gmail two-pointer for iOS
and we already ripping at Frank to
shreds ok we want to talk about our
before we move on I just want to point
out that i have a windows phone 8x here
in blue this time which i'm pretty
excited about does it make the power
button any better yeah it feels a lot
bluer but apart from that now all right
gmail to point 0 for iOS on the iPhone
on the iPad it's available and it should
be downloadable now earlier today you
had to like get the direct link to
install it from the App Store's of using
the update but it's out and i am happy
enough with it that i have turned off
notifications i haven't turned off email
but i'm turned off all notifications and
badges for the built-in email client and
i'm just using this for email right so I
I did the a similar thing I've had them
turned off for the built in client for
ages and I've been easing sparrow but
today when i upgraded to the new gmail
app i turned off of sparrows
notifications and I turned on the gmail
one so we'll see how well that works so
here's the thing about the gmail app on
both Android and iOS and on the desktop
actually a webview I use mail plane the
thing that keeps me hooked I you know I
used to think it was the archiving and
then I thought it was the labels but I
realized that the thing I care about the
most is the threading and more to the
point when you're looking at a giant
thread of emails with 50 people replying
with their you know favorite cat gifs or
whatever the thread happens to be it all
appears on a single element and you can
scroll through the whole element and you
don't have to like scroll or tap or like
scroll and like initiate something to
switch to the next email you've got that
entire email thread chain on a single
view they all get marked red and you can
just scroll through them really quickly
and that's why I never could get into
Sparrow because it was too much of a
hassle to move from one email to the
next within a chain and so despite the
fact that there's some problems with
this gmail app still some witch or
google's fault and some of which are
just limitations for what they can
manage to do on iOS it scratches
is my gmail itch just enough and now I
will turn it over to Chris who wants to
complain about this app out life so
here's my take first of all it is an
improvement i will i'm going to try and
be as level-headed about about this as i
can it's an approach it's it's a noted
improvement over the completely the
complete dumpster fire that Google what
but but that's that's really not saying
much and and so so you know if you think
about how long google has spent doing
seemingly nothing to this application
factor they bought Sparrow the only
viable competitor to the Native Client a
few months ago and this is what they've
come up with is little disappointing to
me there are a few things that are
already bothering me um one is that you
don't have a granular control over
notifications or they're either on or
off essentially on my android devices i
always keep notifications limited to
priority inbox because you know with
with enough training really doesn't take
a lot a lot of training at all you can
get priority inbox to the point where
ninety-nine percent of the time it's
doing the right thing with your yeah
email and to be fair i managed to do
that pretty well on iOS I I turned on
the you know the VIP stuff and I pino
marked a few people as the IP and it
wasn't perfect but it was pretty good at
just getting the alerts for stuff that I
want and I do I don't use priority inbox
like I don't just look at that I know
everything else I look at all of my
email got all of my email but just for
getting noticed for getting
notifications priority inbox is super
convenient yep yeah so that's that's one
thing and then and then also it bothers
me that that this is and I you know I
don't think there's anything you can do
about this this is apple's fault but but
this app appears to be just a webview
much like the app before it and you know
that's that's google's fault yeah I
place the entire blame on Google I mean
Sparrow is a third party email app
that's a full native app that's not a
web view at all now are you sure that
everything here is completely a web
you because I mean things are quick
enough that I sort of wonder if its a
mix of web and native code like going
the course navigation go into settings
and tell me that's not an HTML page yeah
no but go but the thing that brings up
the settings like the the panel sliding
around and everything it's a bunch of
web views in sort of a native shell it's
a rapper right yeah what I was going to
suggest is that even if it is you know
based on the web view is starting to
move away from that and it's time to
feel more like a matey but even if it's
still rough around the edges but I do
feel like this entire discussion so far
has submitted the biggest and most
important change which is that the color
of the icon has changed it's it's an
outrage it is an abomination what I
color code my home screen out of whack
now I mean the this is like muscle
memory that you've got built up for
particular location of your home screen
that's gotta disappear because it's no
longer I mean come from a dark
background to a white one it is pretty
odd I mean yeah it is good i got its
gonna take on there a thing on the
bottom like it's sitting on something or
it's raised up and though in a weird way
and then chrome has still got a dark
background around its icon so now if it
is any background around chrome well yea
though that would he talk about there's
the black whatever okay well that yep
that's right in my face right there
right improve their but really i mean to
be a bit less facetious this two points
that piqua t to race here the first is
that i see essentially once again
google's kind of bringing something out
that doesn't feel like it's fully
matured fully polished so you see the
ideas you see the new design and the
design language and you know we're using
google hangouts at the moment the same
loading animation that you see in google
hangouts this multicolored circle which
seems to be flipping around i love it
yeah that's replicated exactly in the
the gmail app for iOS now so Google is
working towards this consistency in this
uniformity of knowing that you using a
google program so that's fine but
everybody on our team has remarked that
the speed isn't great and there's lag
some people is putting more lag than
there is in the gmail one point whatever
versions what out what I was to say is
I've been using the previous version of
gmail exclusively as both you guys go to
sparrow within the native iOS mayo app I
mean it hasn't been a great experience
but I wouldn't go so far as calling it a
dumpster fire because Chris described I
mean it was survivable um but as one
thing so as a dumpster fire technically
I mean unless that dumpsters full of
kerosene you proud of you got a pretty
good chance of getting out of a dumpster
fire alive not if you're in the dumpster
well it depends on what's in the
dumpster I mean no no I mean de jure is
right I mean it takes a lot to kill a
human being you would've let them fire
but maybe not if you have to use it for
like a year straight that's all I gotta
be honest i'm using it a time on an
iphone 5 and i don't see the legs other
people are talking about so I think the
animations are pretty cool the
animations are in my opinion slicker
than they are on the android app uh and
you know scrolling is really fast and
all that other stuff um does this thing
though they slicker but they're not
quicker ooh and then yeah if i rhyme it
that means it's true and the other thing
is the android app the big advantage
that it has is the fact that you can
just swipe laterally between email
threads yes that again gets to deeds
point about being really quick yeah no
that's definitely omitted from for
whatever reason from this version of the
ios app which i can't understand one
thing that we haven't mentioned yet is
it actually does support multiple
inboxes now which is a huge or multiple
accounts i should say which I totally
should 45 tabs to get from one account
like seriously the one
yeah yeah it's terrible three three tabs
but closed forever man what well Jesus
County they just want one final point to
raise which again is about the visual
style the new app which brian bishop
from our team noted everything is kind
of being enlarged like you little
avatars now if you don't have a specific
avatar or the person doesn't have a
split hotel in your contacts they get a
big letter so when i get an email from
dan i get a big d and all these visual
elements have been enlarged and the text
is kind of being shrunken down and you
see less of each email in it which
people say looks pretty great on the
ipad application but makes the iphone 5
seem a little small like it needs a
bigger screen which i think might be
slightly intentional google spot just a
troll apple just be like our app is so
epic you need a bigger screen the iphone
sorry i'm just add a picture to uh to my
deal all right now realize it wasn't
there it's not acceptable decent dozen i
would just like to say uh that the
dieter is destroying me and letterpress
right now what has you can see well
because this is a letterpress fanboy so
he wanted to make sure that right I only
wanted as a show I only use devices and
platforms that have letterpressed on
them uh which means I can't actually use
this windows phone 8x that I just showed
you guys oh my god um yeah no I just
thought I'd get in a few rounds of
letterpress while I was waiting for you
guys to finish what your whatever it was
that you were talking about okay this
was so so terrible because not only did
Chris completely derail the conversation
but he also looked to his left and beats
audio branding by his headphones the
thing that I'm already annoyed and
irritated about was just visible for
like a solid five second beats free ads
oh lets you switch it to go DJ
headphones
yes so I he can't hear anything we're
saying right now no get your smack talk
in now I can respect Chris again yeah
well that would that was a complete and
utter derailment of the whole
conversation I look um I'm relatively
happy with the with the thing I'm it
makes it easier for me to be using an
iphone and because I've been balancing
between Android and iPhone like
literally like twice a day the past few
days it's getting kind of embarrassing
do you feel that you know one of the
biggest complaints about heavy gmail
users on the iphone why they use android
is because of the gmail experience it is
it enough for you to just kind of forget
about android for now yeah maybe I mean
there's a bunch of apps on iOS that I
didn't think I cared that much about but
I do actually love a lot that aren't
available on Android but there's a bunch
of stuff on Android that like it's hard
for me to give up and it's like really
little things like the unlock I've got
an unlock gesture instead of typing in a
code it saves me you know a quarter of a
second every time i unlock my phone
which given the number of times I'm like
my phone every day adds up to a million
years I could you be happy iOS latest
for iphone 5 what's that the YouTube app
for iOS has just been updated for the
iphone 5c oh yeah it does it let you
airplay yes streaming videos of their
play really cuz that that's they took
that out before right or they did
something to take that away and so I
yeah called jasmine yes that's that's
big deal check out the verge calm
there's gonna be some news on it in a
little bit he's gonna says it does it
work on the iPad down yup optimized for
iPad an iPhone 5 okay could just break
this news before I was posted on the
verge we did Wow hey sneak preview for
those that listen to the Virgin Mobile
show or watch a virtual show well its
life got to give something back to the
people
as so far my take on it is i've been i
finally got my nexus 4 in last week
after much of a delay and I've been like
try living with my nexus 4 and like
occasionally going back to my iphone
parts at times are the day and i think
for me the biggest difference is there's
a lot of things with the android
platform that i like and the main OS
that i like better than iOS but when it
comes to the apps the third party apps
just are really frustrating me uh for
starters like I was complaining about it
earlier on Twitter today that like
there's no good camera app for or photo
apps for Android that I can find none of
them seem to compare to the third party
options that are available on iOS and
you know what what do you want photo
editing photo sharing was no no like a
photo-taking like like I use camera plus
a lot on the iPhone because it gives me
control over exposure settings and stuff
like that some camera nerd and the ones
I've tried for Android just don't work
as well and are frustrating to use and
stuff like that so I mean that's just
one example but there's you know others
where just the third party apps are just
so much better and so much easier to use
and that a better design on iOS it makes
me sad because I really like the android
platform and using the intro platform
well I'm just going to mention because
it surprised me picsart on Android is
really nice photo editor um is that an
editor though or is that like a suit er
no it's not a she's definite say in a
party you can how do you confuse an
editor with the first person shooter
maybe that's my problem as a whole but
yeah it applies a bunch of tweaks and
coders it has a really nice color
isolation setting where you know you
select color like red and it desaturase
with the other colors and I thing that
surprised me actually is that I found
pics out on Android user enter phones I
can't find any iOS App Store and so this
is like the odds exception where Android
has an app that iOS thousand I mean I'm
sure this one here's an animal yeah
there's an analog to it well there has
actually one of the other things we need
to talk about this week there's a
feature on Android for facebook
Messenger that's not available and I
um they've had on certain Android but
not all android phones which is actually
kind of knowing SMS integration and now
in a few countries and they're going to
launch a worldwide as quickly as they
can they've got a thing where you don't
need a facebook account to sign up for
facebook Messenger which is to me really
interesting you'd think that with a
billion users that they would that would
be enough but they want to make sure
that you can still use facebook
Messenger to talk to everybody not just
your Facebook friends they're trying to
recontextualize it as just a general
messaging app instead of Facebook
messaging app yeah i think it's a it's a
very very like definitive sign that that
facebook isn't playing when it comes to
message i I've always thought of
facebook messages being a sideshow like
you know it's just a feature of facebook
and and this just goes to show you that
they're out there to kill SMS they're
out there to take on the what's apps and
the kicks of the world and that is a bat
ni messages the world and this is a
battle that's being very actively wage
right now and somebody is going to win
it and ultimately long-term it's not
going to be SMS also ultimately long be
very interesting thank you can see
player yeah the winner might not be
crowned in the US either so I mean let's
we've got I message we've got blackberry
messenger which is still big in certain
countries notably the countries where
Facebook is first launching this feature
we've got whatsapp with its you know I
think it's a 10 billion messages a day
but they won't say users we've got kik
with 30 million users we've got 30
million users we've got cock over 30
million users we've got kako talk and
chat on well chat on whatever nimbuzz 10
whatever ten cents the messaging app as
I forget and like half of these
messaging clients are like talking about
users in the tens if not the hundreds of
millions so like there's no shortage of
contenders in this space and you know
facebook wants to I mean you know I did
the post it arose morning facebook wants
to make every phone a facebook phone and
if it doesn't have a chance to win on
messaging that that's problem
and I mean for me it's it's sort of like
you know why can't facebook just let
this one go why does facebook feel like
it needs to win here that's the really
interesting question and that's you know
the futures phones man we're talking
this is this is a podcast about the
future right now that's deep man that's
it yeah but I mean I don't know that we
need to be asking that question instant
messaging is something that doesn't have
a dominant player at the moment and he's
open to somebody to grasp it into own it
and it's just another you know just
another branch to any one of these big
companies whether it be Google trying to
gchat Facebook words own messenger and
apple with I message it's just another
way to poor users in and you know you
pull users in you start data mining them
you start selling later you start
advertising to them etc etc and I'll say
you make money and so everybody makes
money so it makes sense why everybody
would want a slice of the I am pie and I
was just thinking recently I need to
standardize on some sort of instant
messaging platform because I've got a
bunch of contacts with people just
fragmented all over the place someone
skype I'm getting I messages from like
two people you know there's gchat but
then you have multiple accounts for
Google and yeah yes I got an aim account
I've got a yahoo account that the
question here is flat is how will you
standardize on that if everyone is
sending you messages from various
accounts isn't it kind of you can't
really standardized on something if
everyone that you're talking to is using
different things right I will tell you
how but I will tell you how on the verge
hopefully later this week nice but but I
mean that doesn't point at this point
you can't standardized unless you get
absolutely bic whaty on one service and
that could be facebook Messenger and
this is what Facebook is trying to do by
removing what is essentially a very very
low barrier to entry because as neither
said a billion people already have
facebook accounts most people who have
access to the web
have a Facebook account already but
Facebook is nudging that aside just
asking for your name and a phone number
which again is a play for these
developing markets where people probably
use IM and text messaging a lot more
than ourselves right we do we tweeted
each other I guess we do that more and
twitter is the good analogy here because
Twitter only really matters as much as
it does be composed solely because it's
because you know everybody's on earth
you know I mean originally maybe it had
technological advantages in being so
simple and we hadn't even know what fits
illogical that's what it was I mean
right now getting reason everybody's on
twitter is because everybody isn't it
it's a cell-free for my Twitter doesn't
want to be a messaging platform they've
they've relegated direct messages to
absolutely absolutely you know a submenu
of a submenu and their app right which
stinks and I can't I can't agree that
everybody's on twitter i think a lot of
people that are in our circle or on
twitter um no like not what asked me
well for instance if i wanted to send my
wife a message i can't do it on Twitter
cuz she doesn't use twitter ever yeah I
mean I think what I'm glad assays and
everybody that matters yes but upon also
making isn't that Turner is that much of
a direct person-to-person communication
platform like I rarely actually use
Twitter as a way to be having a
conversation with one other person or to
other people it's usually to communicate
with everybody else but my point is
we've standardized on Twitter as this
information distribution thing just
because anybody is using in the same way
this is I not to toot my own horn but
that i called i call the twitter is back
in january and it's come true i called
them a broadcasting social network and
that's what it is it's a broadcasting
network that everybody happens to be
able to broadcast on yeah there's a
little bit of social in there and
there's a little bit of archiving but
not much and they're promising to fix
that but it's you know it's not a
publishing platform it's a broadcasting
yeah they want to be I'm happy with that
definition I think it fits as long as we
talk about messaging we would be remiss
if we didn't for the virtual show
briefly wish text messaging SMS short
message service a happy 20th birthday
died already wow I didn't think very
good Chris can get a sound effect for
the birthday wah wah wah I think it's
has too many steps here right no I got
this wow I like I feel like that's not
appropriate yeah I do this let's not do
this just goes is so so what guy so can
I just want to boil this down for you
guys there there are only there only
three almost went there are three
problems my break is that bugs you today
there are three problems with SMS that
prevent it from researching to become
the dominant instant messaging / mobile
messaging platform for the foreseeable
future one is the 140 character limit is
obviously a huge issue right to is
presents information which i think is
key to any good platform and presents
information isn't just like away status
it's also things like you know seeing
when people are typing that is you know
optional reader seats and then three the
fact that at present you need a phone
number or phone number is your only form
of identification when in fact there
there can and should be much easier ways
to identify yourself to to send and
receive SMS is and that's something that
then basically all other platforms have
figured out I message is kind of trying
to be a little I would argue well too
smart about it with the way it
integrates email addresses and I'm in a
weird situation right now where like
people with iphones can't text me
because yes goes to a non-existent phone
same say
for me yeah so but but regardless these
are all problems and I don't blame SMS
for having these problems because the 20
year old platform but but you know
there's some effort there's there's
there there's a a ground swell of
support among certain carriers for
supporting and unfortunately the name
escapes me there's an acronym for it
there's some SMS framework that is built
into ims which is part and parcel with
LTE and and some carriers are already
rolling about I think metropcs has
deployed it and it has presents
information it can do a few other select
things so that's really their last and
best hope for keeping messaging with in
control of the carrier's if that fails
then it is going to become a dumb pipe
thing for them where they're just
transporting the data on behalf of all
these other services that are out there
yes I want that future to come but yeah
I don't I have lots of thoughts and
feelings about this which would probably
be boring because they're not fully
thought through but they're close and
i'll talk about them later do want to
talk about some you SMS this uh police
have called on Congress to require SMS
logs for full two years it's bad it's
there you go yeah it's anya kind of
crazy i was under the impression that
carriers held on to SMS messages for a
lot longer than apparently they do for
some reason i had in my head that they
all carried him hold on to him for six
months or 180 days but apparently they
only hold on to him for about a week and
police don't like that because that
makes it hard to use them at a court
trial yeah as opposed to a jumbo trial I
I strongly believe okay so this is
actually another another problem with
SMS discuss is that it isn't encrypted
like any any messaging platform that you
use should be encrypted end-to-end
and I message allegedly is in fact we
were talking about this earlier today on
the team the fact that I message apple
claims that I message is encrypted but
they've never shared any details on how
its encrypted or what that means they
also they also claim that facetime is an
open standard is this true that's a very
very good point um so so yeah but but
but that is an obvious weakness of SMS
and it is very disturbing to me to think
that things that I have well what okay
Vlad let me hear your counter argument
the counter-argument is that the only
thing you're really arguing for with
this encryption thing is just the
illusion of some sort of security some
semblance of privacy I don't let it go
no no no what I want well here's what I
want I want it so that if somebody wants
to crack my my my stuff I was gonna use
a different word there he wants to crack
my stuff they need to throw a
supercomputer at it for a week then they
can have it if they if they want to put
that amount of effort into seeing what I
bought on Amazon and by all means well i
think i think what it means is that
Chris really just wants to be able to
send his credit card information over
text message to whoever he wants without
worrying about it getting well obviously
of course I mean my problem with a lot
of with this I'm actually a teeny tiny
minuscule e miniscule amount conflicted
about these these text message records
because this is gonna sound lame but we
this is how we talk to each other now
this is how we send letters to each
other now and there should be a
permanent archive that I have the option
to like save for posterity so future
generations can read my messages because
you know I'm a genius and people are
going to want to know what I was saying
to people and I want to give them that
opportunity I mean when we look at you
know famous writers and scientists
through the ages we like have that
letter is that they wrote to their wives
and their best friends and like somebody
thought to save that stuff and we're not
thinking about saving any of this stuff
and I know it's you know very short
messages and it's a
ephemeral and whatever whatever whatever
but there's going to be this weird at
black hole of context information about
our generation that was never there for
previous generation I can assure you I
don't know if if I agree with that
because those those longer letters that
you they were writing to their wives and
their family members that I mean we're
just emailing them now and those are all
archived and saved if you are they if
you leave it if you want it to be if
you're you know you couldn't it out out
you put it on a DVD drive that will keep
the ground that'll last about 10 years
before it degrades into nothing you try
to be around in a thousand years I'm
serious like this is why I wrote this
rant hang out I'm not done this is why I
wrote this rant about paper but you know
all those months ago uh there's no
there's only a very small number of
companies that are thinking about
storing and maintaining data over
millennia um I think one was called
millennium or something anyway uh and
and so when we talk about phone
companies keeping records of SMS yes
it's a privacy issue that's the most
important thing and that needs to be
fixed but when we're talking about
messaging in general there should be
easy ways to export the data and there
should be easy ways to archive the data
and it shouldn't and this is the next
thing you know when you use facebook to
message somebody or you use gmail to
email somebody I mean that's using being
used for advertising in the short term
but there's also a whole social graph
that you we don't I mean what is
Facebook doing with the fact that it
knows that I'm talking to you know
certain people on messenger I don't know
are they using it to better target me
for ad so I don't know should that be a
core function of messaging in this day
and age what Facebook is tried to do
exactly what you said these which is you
know build a timeline built around the
person so assuming some future geniuses
or Jeanne I or whatever now show up and
use Facebook extensively and religiously
and the way that facebook wants to be
used we could have a really detailed
breakdown of exactly what they've done
but here's the trouble and I think it's
really
well I guess so but I think it raisin a
really good point but I also think
there's another angle to it which is
that when we get that timeline of the
future what Thomas Edison whatever
whoever what we're going to get when I'm
just going to get those really awesome
community kaise with his contemporaries
where he discusses business strategies
and how to capitalize on such and such
innovation we're also gonna get he's
freaking music playlists for every
single day he's scrobbling activity will
see every YouTube video that he liked
will know about the cat in Japan that
makes him laugh every night at 1am in
the morning and and this is the trouble
back in those days when people wrote
those letters that we treasure now and
which we find revealing about their
personalities those are the only things
that they were pretty produced terms of
content now we produce so much freaking
content that you could you just don't
have any filter to like bring out the
important stuff and and that's the
difficulty like people just either over
produce all the under produce like some
people just take pictures of everything
around them and everything in that life
and angels becomes meaningless and then
other people don't take enough pictures
and find that years pass by and then I
have any connection to the memories that
they built up over that time and that's
you know sad it sounds it no seriously
um the privacy point though I just
generally assumed that somebody
somewhere has access to my stuff
exclusives so that's just how I operate
it's it's a paranoid Joshua cops teen
inspired kind of way to be you you
shouldn't accept that you should you
should demand 128-bit encryption of
anything that you're sending and
receiving are you uh are you ask
somebody something receiving it for me
and as somebody can look at it I mean I
remember I remember back in the day I
used to get emails that people would put
their their pgp key and
they're in their email signature like
every single you know thanks so if you
wanted to you could you know go turn on
EGP and have an encrypted conversation
kris chuck i want to know if your moves
in letterpress are encrypted ah they are
actually yeah I wouldn't dream of
playing letterpress unencrypted yeah the
words that he plays I don't think
they're in the English language so they
must be encrypted that's just but so
look I think first of all dieter I think
that you're a significantly over
romanticizing uh this this content that
we're generating I mean like you know
with the exception of a few luminaries
they're actually you know millions and
millions and billions of people that we
know nothing about over history yeah and
and that's because you know none of
their communication has been preserved
nothing that they did has really been
preserved and I think that you know to
vlad's point i think the exact same
thing is happening now except the
opposite where we just have this
constant stream of noise that nobody is
going to bother to take the time to do
anything with the bigger issue that that
I really fear for our our future
generations about Oh somebody just uh
friended me on game center you can beat
Chris at letterpress yeah the the bigger
concern the bigger concern I have is the
fact that nobody is going to have any
good usernames for any service yeah and
and I'll be damned I'll be damned if
anyone is going to be allowed to have my
user names after I die by the way
whoever on xbox has the username back
lawn i will give you money to give it to
them it drives me like I managed to pick
a word that nobody uses and so I can
usually get it on most services but on
xbox there's this one person that like
put those strings of letters and numbers
not numbers letters and vowels together
very unhappy about it it's a debate i'm
usually i need to be perfectly fine
because there aren't that many flats
avos anywhere on the globe anyway so i
can just stroll in and be like that's my
name give it to me not on gmail and I
praise the hell out of me is like who
the hell needs Vlad sever apart from me
I did I'm sure it's gonna be kind of
like Vlad on Twitter which is one of
those abandoned accounts and you know
hey can you just go with bladvic what's
this noise chris is getting more friends
on gamecenter apparently hey uh oh yeah
I am um hey Vlad I just did a quick
google search and turns out that there's
a Vladimir Sabbath who is an Olympic
lifter yeah and when are you saying that
he has bigger muscles and Vlad does
that's a very good point i didn't think
about that that I can't believe that's
possible yeah he hasn't won any medals
though I'm looking to see what country
he's Bulgarian middle heavyweight class
Oh dieter I meant to say on xbox it's me
is it you you mad oh man we need like a
like I'm saying before the podcast all
your version of this podcast is going to
sound quite fucking about those beavers
game center note sound effects and
applause I mean it's gonna be grand yeah
but the thing is we've got a couple of
trophies visuals which people aren't
going to see and as soon as they go up
somebody giggles it's like these guys
must be high if you just listening to
this and people just like TV I got
accused of being legitimately hi it was
it last week both in the chat and on
Twitter and so I had to say that I was
actually only high on life and it's
because you know I'm standing and I like
to bounce around when I'm trying to have
fun and I try to have fun with you guys
because I like you and I think that we
should be engaging and interesting and
it's hard like right now this isn't
engaging interesting so let's move on up
north london it's like a whole different
world ok would you describe him
as a brother from another mother what no
sister from another mister just a weird
of no no we're good friends and
colleagues and we'll leave it at that
but anyway Aaron got a hold of the
galaxy camera for us he did a really
thorough review and it's it's a
frustrating thing it really is because
it's well designed it works really nice
and quickly and if it were actually a
phone with a massive camera on the back
of it it could have some potential but
the trouble is just the camera it can't
function as a phone so all of that good
stuff would enter it 4.1 and the great
processor it's snappy is responsive 4.8
inch screen it's an LCD it's a really
gorgeous one 720p as far as I was
concerned and Aaron is a massive samba
samsung fan I want our boy you just
submitted Samsung fan 4x massive tracks
Samsung products religiously so as he's
concerned is the best display the
Samsung is put on any of these devices
so that's high praise the trouble is
it's still just a really really fancied
up camera and as a camera it stinks it
is actually worse than most pony shoot
since price range which well is it it
stinks on a couple of levels right it
kind of stinks on handling and it kind
of stinks on image quality right right
yeah yeah I mean well the thing is with
pony shoot cameras they've kind of
eliminated the physical controls anyway
like you're not going to go and find
$200 point shoot cameras with knobs and
dials and really handy physical buttons
and controls that they just kind of
disappeared and may be replaced by
touchscreens anyway and i have a few
control schemes anyway so I don't feel
like the standard there is really high
in the first place but Samson doesn't
prove that you actually write that but
image quality is the thing that really
needed to be good to make this device
makes sense and that's where it falls
out so again December guys what was
gonna say well what drives me crazy is I
mean if you're gonna have a device that
we
we've seen point-and-shoots at a
reasonable price point that are good and
we've seen Android devices at a
reasonable price point that are good but
yeah you put them together and like they
chose not the youth they can't they
couldn't hit a reasonable price point
here uh if you're gonna have I mean
what's this thing retail for 50 us it's
like 500 yeah if you're gonna sell a
five-hundred-dollar device it's it's
gotta have fewer compromises it really
is the thing that I would say the nikon
coolpix s800c i believe it is it was the
first attempt you know it was the first
android-powered point shoot camera and
that adds so much more issues so many
more issues excuse me and it was slow
its display was an awesome it didn't
have the same processor it was just way
way behind so if we actually keep this
going and if another company steps up
and makes the same leap that we've seen
from the lick on attempt to the Samsung
attempt to the next and repair camera
and then we could be looking at a really
good device at that stage but it still
just kind of is exactly the leader says
like you take a reasonable price camera
you take a reasonable price phone you
throw away the phone part which is the
thing that kind of stinks and then you
put them together but also you put
together the price for both it's like
then you have a problem because nothing
comes free you pay for the extra foam
like functionality you pay for the extra
Android like function at ebay or from
the android perspective you pay for the
extra camera functionality but neither
one is good enough to justify and that's
basically where we are like there's a
lot of good things in it but as a sum of
all the parts together it's actually
less and so we wait for the next one
right I'm curious as a Samsung's
approach more feels like they went from
the ground for started with a smartphone
and then added a camera to it and I'm
curious as to if the opposite approach
might have might produce better results
if you had say a cannon that was already
an established good camera and then
yes 100 the candidates 100 is so obvious
yeah it's a great camera excellent Cara
we all of us on staff really love that
camera so if you just inserted you know
uh the Android operating system and
cellular radio on it and see where it
went from there and I think that's when
nikon was trying to do with the s800c as
you mentioned except that ran android
2.3 you had an underpowered processor
and a number of other problems with it
so right it's it's I think connected
cameras are definitely wear cameras are
going in the future there's definitely
going to be a point where you can't buy
a camera that isn't connected just like
you can't really it's really hard to buy
a TV that's not 3d these days but I
defined connected you mean you mean
Wi-Fi or cellular or both I think
eventually it's gonna be both but I mean
it'll start with Wi-Fi Wi-Fi have
actually been around for a long time
nikon had Wi-Fi cameras back in like
2003 or 2008 for an onerous or 2001
there you go so so Wi-Fi is no longer a
long time and it didn't really catch on
to every single camera model but you are
seeing more cameras with Wi-Fi now and
then we have these actual cellular
connected cameras that are running
smartphone operating systems and I think
that's definitely where they're going in
the future it's just unfortunate that
the galaxy camera is not quite the
answer to that question yet yeah i mean
my problem with these cameras it's a
very particular problem to me is that I
need the wireless either to the cloud or
directly to my laptop if at all possible
to be as reliable and fast as humanly
possible so that i could use it to live
blog and i know that there's like you
know a hundred people on the face of the
earth that care about this but i'm sorry
i do it would work yes movie moving to
google hangout so now you know if you if
you're watching this live now you know
why chris has been so quiet for the past
10 minutes is he acting is this face
overlay Wow uh no I'm just gonna say
like I would like to see the wireless
reliability be better um and I'm gonna
move on and let's talk about the other
thing that
that the notable review brief review
from this week and that is the tramp
stamped a galaxy note 2 Jennifer will do
that to pull do that I wanted to just
wrap up the galaxy camera okay do it
again and give Dan a chance to recover
because the man is in Madison tears nope
that was more than I could even a little
bit though hey so I just wanted to
rephrase myself from earlier to say
correctly which is that the galaxy
camera in totality is less than some of
its part parts galaxy camera in totality
is less than some of its parts like I
said it in a really karateka passed away
earlier on their side also I was just
thinking about the grip of how you
handle a camera which is all touch
screen on the back and the fact of the
matter is where your thumb wants to rest
is exactly you on the top right corner
of the touchscreen yeah yeah you have to
do this move particularly well
particularly if you have a camera shaped
hand grip as opposed to a phone which
has different economics so I mean it has
issues and the whole idea the whole
concept of Andrew power cameras still
has issues that need to be ironed out
but also today this point about Wi-Fi
connectivity I think we've all dreamt of
this awesome awesome concept of being
able to just shoot with our cameras and
having the pictures pop immediately onto
our devices but it's not just
reliability which is yes the number one
thing but it's also speed yeah right so
if you take a picture and then it takes
you 10 seconds it's reliable with six to
10 seconds for the pictures pop up on
your computer then you start thinking
about cables and others right like
that's the whole i phi card promise if
you're not familiar with what an eye-fi
card is it's an SD card with a Wi-Fi
chip built to do it that you can put it
to virtually any camera now what it is
what it is is pain and sorrow and
heartbreak and disappointment a crammed
together into a tiny little plastic
wedge that's what the eye-fi card is I
have gone through probably half a dozen
of these things yes my name is promises
it's time it's going to be good promises
to cut the cable so that you can just
shoot your pictures and they instantly
we are transferred over to your computer
but the problem as Vlad mentioned is
it's very bottlenecked and very slow and
as dieter would more than likely say
next is that it's very unreliable and
you lose connections and drop
connections all the time I know I know
too she go ahead something called the
flash a card which functions pretty much
the same way and it creates like a
server that you can access on any device
because it's web-based and pictures all
seem to pop up reliably I saw that an
ephah trouble is I didn't see it this
easy for a so it lost years Eva and then
you got delayed and I'm supposed to
learn some sometime early in this year
and I feel pretty much joke about it
since then so you know we're still stuck
one thing that I would point out about
the galaxy camera like I really want to
love the concept but i think that
Samsung made a major branding misstep
and i thought this ever since they
announced it i think they made a major
branding misstep by calling it the
galaxy camera because that implies the
name implies that it is it's it's like a
smartphone with a camera grafted on
which it kind of is it's a smart phone
with camera grafted on minus the the
calling part right I and that's and
that's not what they should have made
they should have done something more
along the lines of what nikon did which
is graphed android on to a genuine point
shoot which is the point is about nigga
it's a go damnit crystals busy five
minutes and making sure that he could
get the visual trickery ice the name of
the company nikon comes from the name of
japan in japanese which is nippon it is
not nikon he is nikon nikon it's not i
don't know like who told you this and
like if it is it does confirm they fun
why don't they just call the company
nippon yeah like why is wiser ago I i
I'm going to stop a few reasons why they
wouldn't call it Nippon but uh yeah
that's exactly the point I had earlier
is that you know if they had started
from a good camera base and added the
smartphone on top of that I think would
have been a better result of starting
with a smartphone base and adding camera
parts you know I
don't feel like anybody has really gone
right enough because frankly the other
thing is the sensor in the galaxy camera
is a joke it's actually smaller than the
one in the 808 POV the nokia 808 POV so
it's like it's a tiny tiny little sensor
and its standard fare for like a hundred
dollar point-and-shoot camera is going
to have a sensor of that that's sort of
it right but doesn't does the thing the
market for those things is disappearing
and people are those people are going to
buy a 500 okay so so really samsung is
trying to innovate its way into a space
that is being vacated just because
nobody was buying anything in that what
i want to see is something like sony's
next series cameras you know fool aps-c
sensors tagged android tag dropbox
integration tech technical those things
on top and then okay find the price is
gonna be kind of crazy but people might
be able to justify that more and the
notion and the notion of data share um
are you know the data plan sharing i
think makes that a little more palatable
i'm still not comfortable with the way
those plans were currently like i'm
really upset that i'm paying an extra
ten dollars a month just so that my my
tablet can use the same data bucket as
my phone but it's a step in the right
direction yeah and now let's talk about
verizon's tattooing of the galaxy note 2
yeah so I i was using this thing over
the weekend and let you know i will lean
heavily on your thoughts about this
since you did our original review but
this is actually the first time i'm a
low embarrassed to admit this this is
the first time that I've ever carried
around a note a galaxy note of any kind
as like my daily driver for any period
of time and that happened last weekend
and I really really disliked it a lot
more than I thought I would I thought
that I would like I thought that I would
pretty quickly adapt to the size and the
weight and just move on with my life but
the problem I was telling the David
about this david pierce the the problem
that i kept having is that the galaxy
note 2 is is big enough so that you
can't handle it like a phone you kind of
have to handle it like a tablet and what
I mean
by that is that if you if you just try
and pretend like it's a phone a you know
a regular phone then you are going to
drop it because unless you have truly
enormous hands you're you you have just
enough trouble getting a grip on it
especially since the note 2 is such
glossy plastic all over that it's going
to end up falling out of your hands and
I'm convinced that if I use this phone
for another week or two it would have
hit the floor David was telling me that
he dropped one of his review units so um
I don't that was public information or
not but yeah that was the biggest
problem I had as a phone and Vlad I
think you relay this in your review very
well as like if if you are in the market
for a 5.5 inch phone it's a it's a fine
device I just don't think I was
surprised at how unable I was to adapt
to that size yeah this is the thing that
I'll be stressing all the time with the
original galaxy with the second galaxy
note 2 it just isn't a phone like so
many people will make the argument it
fits in my pocket whoa fine let it fit
in your pocket but it isn't a phone you
can't operate it like a phone you can't
treat it like a phone and exactly to say
Chris the instinct is to treat it and to
work with it as a tablet I see as you
think that as a device it has a ton of
good things going for it but I just
wanted to take this opportunity to also
raise another point which is I've been
using the iphone 5 for a bit for a week
or two now and switching between it and
the 1x the windows phone 8x which I was
reading through G asked about I still
really like I just don't have one cuz HC
took it away and they've given Chris
like free or whatever fine that's fine
I'll live with that um very well be
switching between the oven 5 and 1 X and
the 1x is a 4.7 inch device it
significantly smaller than the galaxy
note 2 and every time I make an
immediate switch between the two between
the iphone and the 1x the latter just
feels like the former put over sides
like you still have icons but there's
just this massive spaces between the for
no good reason and then large for no
good reason and the keyboard is
one and a half two times the size for no
good reason everything just feels like
it's bigger without there being any
benefits to it and it just kind of
reminds me in reiterates the fact that
there is an ergonomic sweet spot and
he's 4.5 inches above phones aren't
eating it and anything that is five
inches in a bob season the phone that's
just it right yeah anyways it's a live
one just just get a 7-inch tablet yeah
right yeah yeah yeah um but listen we're
really in love with the S note in the
Snowden and the S Pen snow yeah I mean I
i will say that you know i was really
kind of blown away by the battery life
on it like the the thing that really
stuck out in my mind was that I didn't
connect it to the Wi-Fi in my house and
I have pretty crappy reception here was
able to connect to verizon's LTE network
and i and i charged it to one percent
and set it down I just in my living room
when I went to bed and I woke up the
next morning and just left that left it
sit there for look like probably another
two hours then looked at it it was still
indicating a hundred percent despite
being on LTE all night even though it
wasn't really doing anything and I
plugged it in and charge for daddy so
blatantly an American version of that
phone because you mean the berry can't
beat a hundred percent but is so like
Bozie and you know oh not a hundred
percent to just give you whatever you
gonna give me it's like our luck right I
got a hundred percent for you well it
does have that tacky tattooin lab yeah
Chris you have do you have any spell out
sand oh yeah yeah I don't have it right
here show us show us that awesome I
don't know if you can see that yeah I
can chant yeah yeah it's got the tramp
stamp on the home button and then turn
it turn around because I know the back
is also very branded yeah you could say
it says verizon 4g galaxy note 2 on the
back and i think i think risin I think
verizon was just like Verizon and
Samsung were both like whoa we have this
giant canvas
so they yeah they have three logos on
back and then both Samsung and verizon
are on the front so there's a total of
five logos on this on this phone um I'm
convinced that we're getting close to
the point where they're going to start
like carriers are gonna start selling
like ad spots on phone so it'll it'll be
like they'll just be like a random best
buy or target logo you know and yes I'll
just think I just thinking about that if
they actually had a flat edge on the
sides we would get phones that are like
no Scott cause hahaha yes absolutely we
just get the galaxy now I can epic 4g
touch sponsored by mcdonalds McNuggets I
can see I can see this sort of like like
dystopian future where like you that the
the level of your subsidy depends on how
many sponsorship stickers you're willing
to put on your on your phone I I can
totally believe that so last last week
Chris was talking about how subsidies
and whatnot the nexus 4 and everything
need to go away now we're getting to the
point where they're going to go away
bye-bye via sponsorships these little
etching machines in every carrier store
and then you hand your phone to them and
they will tattoo on all the logos and
right cheaper yeah which would reach not
going to beat this token but not
allegedly I would put a starbucks logo
online ah get your terrible dad I'm so
disappointed between this and beats
actually actually can we talk about the
the starbucks a date I think that's
there's a guy there's to negate your
starbucks up letting it comfortable that
happened yesterday uh one the iOS app
was finally updated for the iphone 5s
display which I've been complaining
about since I don't know when was the
iphone 5 much September yeah so so I've
been so that was finally rectified and
then last night starbucks finally
updated its android app for Android 4.2
so now I can finally install it on the
Nexus 4 now what makes it
when what makes it update really funny
is that and I seed eaters forever alone
now so what's funny about it by this
update is that oh god you guys are
killing me what's funny about you a
coincidence I was yawning physically un
what's what what's funny about this
update is that up until the point that
it was released if you contacted
starbucks and complain that the out was
crashing there were like oh there's
something screwed up with your phone you
should contact google you should contact
LG you should contact samsung should
contact AT&amp;amp;T and then all of a sudden
the update comes out and is and they you
know they're just suddenly works on 4.2
so so now I I now I no longer have to go
into Starbucks like a Buster with my
nexus 4 in one hand and an iphone 5 in
the other hand connect to their Wi-Fi to
pay for my coffee featuring you know
anyone I go into Starbucks I swiped my
credit card that's what I do or I give
them cash no rewards myth throw it away
all those rewards yeah you're living in
the 20th century you're living in the
20th century century dater like I just
want to know service board 1995 called a
way 975 called it wants its payment
method back I just want to make serious
part here which is that I think when we
are spending our money and when we're
making all of these consumer choices we
should aim to help the specialists and
by that I mean it's things like here in
the UK this is really terrible in my
opinion trend where supermarkets are
just broadening out and spreading their
tentacles into things that supermarkets
don't eat itself right so they started
off by selling clothing alongside
groceries now you can pretty much but
until you go into I'm gonna be fair with
supermarkets oh I see but the thing is
so they started off with those figs and
I can like buy lawn mowers if it's a big
enough supermarket but any start selling
insurance now Tesco Mobile have you know
there's the what was the MV na that was
the Emir now you should listen em oh
right yes and you know on on tues
network and you're selling insurance de
selling mobile contracts things were
easy doing the same thing and ultimately
you know they're trying to pitch you the
idea that if you stay loyal to one one
of those companies you're going to get a
synergy from all those products and you
know say some money whatever but the
only thing that's really happening is
that they're squeezing out again the
specialist the guys who only do
insurance and the guys who only do
banking and the guys won't do whatever
and we're just going to end up with
these massive massive corporations that
have way too much control over pricing
which is the thing that worries and
scares me so I mean Starbucks is it less
puffy if that bridge yes starbucks is ok
but if what you're I mean these giant
super corporations controlling our lives
and or taking the state as the dominant
form of control in society I mean we're
almost there and I think that's great
because oh yeah you guys they know it'll
it'll bring forward you know shadowrun
right i mean if if we've got you know
these giant corporations in charge
that's what this one step closer to me
being able to cast magic spells in a
cyberpunk future I don't know how to
note about my fans here nobody nobody
knows what I'm talking I don't know how
you're gonna get there but paying with
rib with cash for everything dieter but
also just just a quick extra point here
about the UK on the point of subsidies
actually because the times the local
will respect the newspaper which is
actually owned by News International
which in turn is owned by news corp
again making a point about massive
corporations they've started subsidizing
the Nexus 7 and they're subsidizing it
very much in the carrier model which is
to say you pay the upfront fee which is
now 50 pounds instead of 199 4 32gig
Nexus 7 and then you sign up for the ATM
of square
motto so it's basically you get a
subscription with them and that
subsidizes your hardware so they're
acting like one of the carriers and
they're trying to push their digital
subscription which to me is interesting
because and we've had commenters point
out that German and Czech publications
have done relatively similar scheme so
this isn't the very first paper to do
this it's interesting to me because now
you have something material that goes
along with digital subscription to a
newspaper and one of the barriers for a
lot of people to pay for digital
subscription or to accept any payroll is
that you're not getting anything
physical anything tangible were you
paying your money and any money over so
maybe this would be stimulus for people
what do you guys think how much is the
subscription do you know in total it
adds up to 360 pounds but for 18 months
plus a tablet including Sabbats price
yeah I mean if the papers I mean I pay
what is it 22 bucks a month or something
just for the digital wall street journal
so that seems like a pretty reasonable
do yeah it's 17 pounds a month in the UK
which is i mean frankly steep it's more
than the wall street journal and i mean
i'll say the times isn't the best
newspaper around anyway um but maybe the
pricing is more reasonable right maybe
it is like 10 pounds amount to something
yeah for sure I'm just wondering whether
the hardware aspect would warm you guys
to the idea more like okay I can get the
subscription I'm kind of iffy on it but
hey look I can get a tablet for the
cheap that swings me over the edge like
I can actually see that happening for me
if I wanted the publication well if
you're already sold on the publication
then I mean that's not a hard at this
point I'm so done a publication but
notice price and then he just kind of
sweets in to deal with so hard when I'm
like okay fine I'll pay the price I mean
IBM the only thing I guess is like I I'm
always nervous about I mean I'm nervous
about subsidies in in general and it's
in principle it's fine as long as you
know exactly what you're getting into at
the outset and I mean what what you're
describing me Vlad's it feels like a
like a we were talking about the 90s it
feels like Columbia House a little bit
oh god you know you sign up for the one
CD a month and then then you know if you
forget to cancel they just keep on
sending them and you get those 13 CDs to
start it's amazing your CDs are twenty
seven dollars a piece right so like it's
fine to sign up for you know a subsidy
either from carrier or from you know
random newspaper or from a grocery store
from starbucks or whoever as long as you
know you are thinking through who it is
that you're committing you know your
money to and I think that the whole
point of these things is that it sort of
short circuits that doing it with
publication makes a bit more sense but
I'm nervous to say that I think that's a
great solution for everybody hey guys
I'm i just want to point out that
Columbia House it turns out still exists
excite right now oh my god I'm signing
up right now yeah no no but like that
their slogan is the worst slogan ever
pay for the dvds you want without the
streaming you don't this streaming is
like this evil that needs to be banished
this is amazing so so they do DVDs now
yeah do they do CDs at all well I think
this DVDs well I just like to point out
that Columbia House is something I've
never heard of before I know exactly
what you guys describing just well there
was a there was a few of these in the
90s I think Columbia House is the
biggest one but there was also a BMG
which was yes a record label for some
reason but BMG which had the same exact
concept and then there was some others
that I just can't remember right now but
they were all the same thing we're like
they're like get 13 CDs for a penny sign
up for this contract and we're gonna
send you CDs every month and if you
don't want it you just tell us we don't
want it but then if you forget we're
going to charge you anyways yeah and it
yeah it preyed on like me and preyed on
teenagers who were like oh yeah sweet
and then forget to you know every time
you wouldn't you wouldn't think cancel
it until the next CD came and you'd be
like
why are they setting me Burl Ives
Christmas music this has to stop and he
doesn't read his digest working pretty
much the same business model I don't
know brendan are our producer says that
that Columbia House is what motivated
him to switch from cassettes to CDs oh
that's that's food for thought I haven't
thought of it that way maybe maybe
Columbia House had a major impact on the
transition disease yeah you know I'm
actually we're really lucky that
Columbia House didn't get into streaming
in a big way because it would be forever
tainted with people's history and memory
of being screwed over by them and
streaming would have never gotten off
the ground so thank you for Columbia
House for staying in the past sending
out dvds over the mail and this is
YouTube and cat videos popularized
raving you know what would be amazing as
if Columbia House offered to like send
you like a rotating assortment of cat
videos on DVD for like people who were
really internet averse but still wanted
to get in on the cat videos what we need
is for Columbia House to get into the
business of selling tablets and phones
right because we're you know we're
switching phones were complaining them
we don't have the perfect phone so they
just send us a batch of six phones right
away for a penny and then they just keep
us setting it out and they send you that
like $49 on contract Android photo
you're just like ahh dude what did they
partnered up which is this is like just
put I know you mean without me why did I
get this i forgot to cancel what are
they partnered up with like no you mean
calm i started selling grandparents a
meme a week or whatever i keep up with
the young ones yeah that would be
amazing they just said you like I nine
every month they could send you like a
different troll face every every month
that's like a poster you could wear it
would sure like so do you like in real
life you just be like
