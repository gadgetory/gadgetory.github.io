here at the launch of the Model X now of
course this isn't the first time we're
seeing the Model X it's been kicking
around for a number of years but only in
concept form tonight we're finally
seeing the production version of the car
and we're not just seeing it they're
actually handing the keys over to the
first customer so it's kind of a big
deal and we had a chance to drive it
earlier and I can tell you this kind of
an insane car this isn't an SUV I mean
it is it looks like an SUV right but you
realize that it's actually a Model S in
different clothes the the body is that
of an SUV but the heart the soul is of a
Model S and what that means is that it
is extremely high performance we we took
it down a straightaway with ludicrous
mode turned on a 0-60 in 3.2 seconds and
it has that same glue you to the back of
your seat feeling that the Model S gives
you it's pretty wild but that's not all
this car is about it also has the Falcon
wing doors that Elon Musk has been
talking about for a number of years they
are so named because they have served
this this hinge in the middle so that
they they open like a wing for lack of a
better description the idea being that
you can stand up inside the car which is
handy if you have to put a car seat in
the back this is a utilitarian car in
this utilitarian feature it just happens
to go as fast as of course your 911
turbo it has the largest windshield of
any production car which doesn't sound
like that big of a deal who cares and I
didn't really care either until I got in
the driver's seat and I look straight up
and realized that I was seeing nothing
but sky but when you have that effect
you feel all encompassed by the by the
outdoors you don't feel trapped by the
inside of the car it really is kind of
an amazing effect and there's no other
way to describe it but to try it out for
yourself
so this car isn't cheap it starts under
$100,000 but I can go as high as 100
$42,000 if you give the p90d
with ludicrous mode let me break down
what that means for you the P is for
performance mode it's the high
performance version of the car 90 is 490
kilowatt hour 90 kilowatt hour battery
pack which is the only battery pack
they're offering with this car right now
and that will give you a range of
around 250 to 260 miles somewhere in
there it's very slightly lower than the
Model S with the same powertrain but not
a lot less and then the D stands for
dual motor this is an all wheel drive
vehicle isn't offered in a rear-wheel
drive configurations all wheel drive
only so if you're looking for the
fastest SUV on the planet if you're
looking for arguably the most luxurious
SUV on the planet outside of something
like a Bentley
and if you're looking for the coolest
SUV on the planet I think you've found
