brand new kind of well the zune it
started this a little bit with zune HD
right but Windows Phone really you guys
had this very strong design it was a
very strong very different design
concept than write anything we'd seen
right from Microsoft and I think a lot
of people were kind of blown away I know
I was right I was not what I expected
right and you're now taking that and
it's really starting to propagate
through all of the other products are a
lot of the other products of Microsoft
right windows 8 you're seeing some this
metro or metro style the xbox dashboard
is right looking more and more like
Metro style so how important it is it is
it to bring all that stuff together and
and at what point did you realize that
you need to unify our you aren t you
know I think we as designers knew way
before we actually execute it that we
did have a very mixed messages to
consumers or let's call it end users
right and our brand as far as the
external community and end users we're
concerned look very fragmented because
our design languages were inconsistent
maybe more importantly I don't think
things worked as well as this supposed
to write and so we internally and we
somewhat externally like to joke and say
you know the expectation for our
products to work and feel like they're
part of a family have always been quite
high I like to think that right now is
finally when we're delivering on that
promise so one plus one could equal more
than two so we're introducing new math
and Microsoft scary thing scary thing is
a fuzzy very scary thing in a computer
science company right yeah but i like to
use it we say one plus one equals eleven
when we when we do what we do and that
is effectively a lining first in
principle we get that scales to
interaction design so interoperability
and cohesiveness same similar conceptual
models the way you use a phone
cognitively should use similar concepts
of what you're using in windows and or
xbox that's the priority then the look
and feel also then now sends a message
that you're within a certain family
right and your expectations are set so
we've always felt that it was important
I think to answer your question directly
it was about two years ago that I recall
an event
where we as many some of the design
directors in charge of the different
divisions doesn't least League of design
League of design so to speak we call it
an LTE leadership teams went off site
for day and a half and we actually step
back and for the first time put up all
the work using screenshots hard copies
not not digital shots right and we feel
the wall of 20 feet long top and bottom
and tried to parse that's called an
information worker from consumer but it
really took a look from server and tools
all the way with to what's going on in
some cases what's happening and MSR but
windows xbox at the time zoom and
started to look for commonality amongst
all this and you know saw an awful lot
of it but we're very disappointed in
what we're seeing as well right and what
a waste of development efficiency and
energy complain room from consumers as
well I think that and we I know as in in
the press we had been giving Microsoft a
hard time because there was a promise
that we're reading all of them have all
these pieces that they're all so
disparate right and then you've got no
common rills so we did we did as a
community and this wasn't anything we
needed permission to do it was always on
us right not just design but its program
management anyone's making decisions
shame on us for not bringing that
together as well as we could have it you
know and so we've just took it upon
ourselves to say you know what we're
making calls for the different divisions
it's important that we really start to
develop a more unified promise and
message to end users right right so at a
very grassroots level at 1-1 hand we
just start to create these small working
to use to actually start lining natural
user interface gesture right certainly
within our divisions even that was a
challenge but across divisions even more
of a challenge and then the look and
feel the Metro design style and language
became something where different teams
were now cross pollinating right we're
sharing designers we're talking about
icons we're sharing what palette of
colors people are using and this
continues today in a more formal state
but it then we're just doing our job
