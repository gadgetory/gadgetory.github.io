One of the best toys to come out of Star Wars:
the Force Awakens is Sphero's BB-8.
This is a fully functional droid and it's
a premium product but it's definitely been
a huge seller.
Now next
year Sphero is going to do something a little
bit crazy with this.
And they're actually going to add force
gestures is what they're calling it.
And this is actually the wearable.
It's going to be called
the force band.
It's coming out later this year but we are
going to try a technical demo.
I'm going to stress that this is just a technical
demo so some thing might not work, some things
will work.
Let's just give it a shot.
We recognize the basic gestures.
So if I tell him to come, he comes to me.
Okay.
And go away.
Alright.
And then that gets you into this
driving mode where you can kind of continuously
move.
Force pull.
There you go.
Come hither.
Stop.
Look around.
Cool.
Sphero says the force band, and that might
not even be it's final name, is coming out
sometime in the fall.
No price details, the design's not final,
these gestures might change.
Even the name again might change.
So right now it's just
kind of a sign of what's Sphero wants to do
with BB-8 and indeed maybe the entire
Sphero lineup itself.
Sphere this fall is also releaseing a new
version of the BB-8.
The only difference is really
just the aesthetic it's got the Jakku kind
of sand just kind of built in for that.
So that's
also coming this fall.
Sphere is hoping to have more details.
Some more final details at Toy Faire
this year sometime in February.
So until then for more Sphero news for more
