Apple sent out this morning very

a shadow rumor has it the iphone 5 will
have a taller screen smaller dock
connector and support for LTE and as for
the elusive iPad Mini that will be
announced at its separate events in
October and in more somber news more
than 1 million Apple device IDs were
leaked onto the Internet according to
known hack to this operation anti-sikh
over 12 million so-called UT IDs were
grabbed from an FBI laptop along with
full names addresses and cell numbers
though anti-sex seems to have no real

million Apple device IDs however later

name suggests bad piggies will let you
play the other side of this so far three
year long war of attrition developer
rovio has been hinting at a pork first
game ever since the beginning it's

shown bad piggies is due out on
September 27th for iOS Android and Mac

on the planet and that's it for today's
top stories has it been 90 seconds</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
