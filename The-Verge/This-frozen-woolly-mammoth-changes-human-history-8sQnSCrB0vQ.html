humans living alongside and even hunting woolly
mammoths.
But it really happened.
By examining the skeletons of woolly mammoths
buried underground in places like Michigan
and Siberia, scientists have been able to
build a timeline of when humans and mammoths
walked the Earth — together.
Now, researchers think they’ve added another
piece to this elephant-sized puzzle.
The frozen carcass of a young male wooly mammoth
discovered in 2012 in Russia shows signs that
it died from an attack by human hunters, according
to a study in Science.
But it’s the timing of that attack that’s
got the researchers excited: according to
them, this woolly mammoth died from its injuries
45,000 years ago in the Arctic.
That means that humans were present in the
Arctic much earlier than previously thought
— about 10,000 years earlier, to be precise.
There’s a lot of evidence that this mammoth
died from human-induced injuries.
One of the mammoth’s ribs, for instance,
displays butchery marks similar to ones found
on other mammoth carcasses killed by humans.
These marks were probably the result of a
blow aimed at the mammoth’s internal organs.
The researchers also found a deep lesion on
its skull beneath the cheekbone’s surface,
as well as marks on its right tusk and its
left shoulder blade.
Taken together, the mammoth’s many injuries
indicate that humans used sharp weapons, made
of stone or ivory, to bring the mammoth down,
says Vladimir Pitulko, an archeologist at
the Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg
and a co-author of the study.
“These damages [tell] me that the mammoth
was attacked by humans who used some projectiles,
like spears.
[Humans] probably either [threw projectiles]
into the mammoth or just hit it from a short
distance.”
And thanks to radiocarbon dating — a technique
that uses the properties of carbon to assign
a date to organic materials inside bone — scientists
were able to narrow down the timing of the
attack.
They concluded that the mammoth lived and
died about 45,000 years ago.
Given that the mammoth was found at a latitude
of 72 degrees North, that’s big news, Pitulko
says.
“I wouldn’t expect to find an evidence
for humans [that] far north at that time,
because all sites of this age are limited
[to] 55 degrees North.”
There isn’t much that we can tell about
how ancient humans lived in the Arctic based
on these findings.
But we can say that humans were capable of
killing mammoths even that far back.
And even though the researchers didn’t examine
human bones or a settlement, the mammoth does
show that people could be found in the region
over 40,000 years ago.
Improvements in our ability to kill mammoths
may have made humanity’s expansion northward
possible, Pitulko says.
And now that we have evidence of human activity
that far north, scientists might want to look
for archeological sites dating back to that
period in the Arctic.
The region probably has a lot more to tell
us about human history.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
