were checking out these samsung series
seven gamer now this thing is big it's
got a 17.3 inch display with a 1920 by
1080 resolution it's gonna be good for
your general gaming needs but it also
makes the Machine really heavy it's
about nine point six pounds and you're
gonna have to keep it tethered to
because the battery life is pretty poor
we got about three and a half hours on
the verge battery test so the series
seven gamer sports a full-sized keyboard
which is kind of expected on machine
this big and it's also really
appreciated the keys are traditional
scissor style laptop keys now there is
backlighting on this keyboard but the
options are kind of limited Samsung lets
you have blue and white some other
highlights on the hardware and are the
speakers which are pretty good there's a
symbol for underneath the machine so the
machine has a little more room for a
little more bass than we can expect from
a lot of laptops now the port selection
on the stereo seven gamer is pretty
standard you've got your power adapter
your Gigabit Ethernet port VGA port HDMI
and DisplayPort a pair of USB 3.0 ports
and there's the card reader up above
that and then your headphone and
microphone jacks on the opposite side
we've got another pair of USB 2.0 ports
there's a blu-ray drive and then there's
the mode switch there are four modes to
choose from right now we're in gaming
mode but we can switch down to balance
mode library mode and eco mode now these
are essentially glorified power plans in
Eco mode the screen is dimmed and the
poweris power on the CPU is throttled
down to give you the maximum possible
battery life library mode is designed
for when you're inside of a library in
addition to dimming the screen a bit it
actually cuts powers to the fans and
thaws the CPU so the machine doesn't
make too much noise balance mode is your
typical pcs balance mode it's kind of a
nice middle ground and then there's
gaming mode which I suspect most people
will keep the Machine locked to when you
fire up gaming mode a small widget
appears on the top right corner of the
screen and it lets you
choose between three different things
when the themes are kind of over the top
and ridiculous but they change the
wallpaper it add a nifty little
wallpaper theme screensaver to each mode
which it's it's kind of pointless but in
the best possible way samsung series 7
gamer is pretty fast under the hood is a
2.3 gigahertz core i7 3/6 nqm processor
16 gigs of ram and about one and a half
terabytes of hard drive space most of
the Ivy Bridge laptops we've seen
recently include a 32 gigabyte mSATA
solid state cache drive Samsung opted
instead to use an 8 gigabyte express
cache you're going to see a performance
into things like a faster application
run or the boot speed it also allows
symptom to stick about one and a half
terabytes of storage space in here in
the form of 2 750 gigabyte hard drives
the gaming performance is pretty good
the machines running an nvidia geforce
gtx 675 m it's not the fastest GPU on
the market right now but it's a pretty
strong contender we got a smooth 29
frames per second on battlefield 3 on
ultra if you dial the settings down to
high you'll see about 41 frame per
seconds but it feels pretty good
the action is smooth for the most part
when you get to some of the more intense
firefights in the game you might notice
a bit of slowdown you can fix that
pretty easily by you know dialing down
the anti-aliasing settings or even
switching to high in battlefield 3 which
is still makes the game look fairly
gorgeous if you're in the market for a
mid-range gaming machine the samsung
series 7 gamer will not disappoint it
makes some compromises in the
performance and the battery life and
there might be some qualms about the
particular harddrive arrangement but for
$1,900 it's a pretty solid deal if
you're willing to spend a little more
you're going to want to check out the
Alienware M 17 X it's gonna cost you an
extra $700 but you'll get much better
frame rates slightly better battery life
and a better performance overall
