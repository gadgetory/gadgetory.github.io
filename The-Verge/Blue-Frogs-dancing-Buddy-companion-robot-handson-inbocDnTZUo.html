buddy a singing dancing family assistant
robot it's kind of like if you took an
Alexa and put it in this vaguely creepy
vaguely adorable little robot who can
also sing and dance and walk around your
house it's been developed for a few
years it's coming out this year
hopefully for thirteen hundred euros
which is a lot of money for a robot even
one as soon as this I'm not entirely
convinced by the functionality as much
fun as it is to dance with this little
dude over here I'm not entirely sure or
convinced that the features it offers
over something like a Google home or an
echo is necessarily worth the 1,300
euros which is a lot on the other hand
either of those can sing and dance so if
you win some lose some
if design really is like a family device
you're kind of meant to like have it
wander around your house somewhere in
like a cross between a pet and a guard
dog and something that can interact with
your kids and also watch your house
there's a lot going on and I'm not
entirely sure it all works but you can
also do things like hey buddy can you
dance
and he'll dance the interface is all
running off an Android like an
integrated Android tablet it's a little
slow but it it works is dancing do dance
little dude you dance</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
