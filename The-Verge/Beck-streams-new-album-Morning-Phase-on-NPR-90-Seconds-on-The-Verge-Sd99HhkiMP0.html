Shane and I'm headed to the App Store
this is 90 seconds on the verge Beck's
first album in six years is now
available for streaming on NPR morning
phase is being described as a spiritual
sequel to see change his 2002 acoustic
album inspired by the breakup with his
longtime girlfriend Beck's last studio
album modern guilt came out in 2008
morning phase is due out via more
traditional channels later this month
now I don't really find time to play
games but the developers of rock band
just might change that for me Harmonix
today announced croma a music game that
also happens to be an arena based first
person shooter weapons emit musical
tones when they fire and both combat and
movement are tied to the game soundtrack
if it's anything like the dubstep gun
from saints row 4 sign me up croma is
still in very early development but is
slated to launch later this year as a
free-to-play game on steam come on and
finally I love back to the future part
two so you can only imagine how I
reacted to nike's announcement during an
appearance in new orleans nike designer
tinker hatfield suggested that marty
mcfly shoes from the second back to the
future film complete with Power laces
will be coming soon saying customers
will see them in 2015 in 2011 nike
produced fifteen hundred pairs of the
fictional nike air mag sneakers but they
didn't lace themselves automatically the
way they did in the movie now all we
need are hoverboards and jaws night team
damn it that's it for today's top
stories coming up tomorrow I finally
reached 90 this game</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
