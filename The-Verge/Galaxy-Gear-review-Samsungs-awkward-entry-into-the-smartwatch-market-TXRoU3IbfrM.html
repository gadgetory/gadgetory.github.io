the Samsung Galaxy gear there are two
things about the gear that you love its
built-in camera and the ability to send
and receive phone calls Dick Tracy style
the gears camera has at least past my
admittedly low expectations far from
being a gimmick it produces some very
decent images and works with reliability
and quickness the 1.9 megapixel square
pictures won't compete with a proper
camera but it's so much fun to take that
even a jaded scenic like me can't help
but smile you could also record 720p
video clips about the 15 seconds in
length which can be stored on the gears
4 kilobytes of storage or automatically
transferred to your Galaxy handset via
bluetooth other than Bluetooth the gear
has no external connectivity of its own
even the NFC chip is built into the
charging cradle so you'll be relying on
a connected galaxy device for much of
this watch's functionality phone calls
can be initiated or received on the gear
without ever touching the phone which
simply acts as a conduit as with a
camera the gears integrated microphones
and loudspeaker are surprisingly high
quality you can carry on a conversation
without needed to assume any weight
poses to be heard although as with any
speaker from our conversation using this
function is best reserved for quieter
area you won't be surprised to find that
it gives two best features also is most
readily accessible swipe down from the
home screen gets you into the camera a
swipe up from the same spot brings up
the phone dialer a sideswipe in either
direction will get you into the apps
menu where unfortunately things start to
fall apart navigation is quick once you
know what you're doing but terribly
unintuitive the same damn will swipe
that gets you into the camera from home
acts as a back button everywhere else
the preloaded apps on the gear a limited
both in number and functionality the
pedometer is inaccurate the tweet quick
view and pocket apps consistently failed
to even launch correctly and the music
controls only just volume interval
between tracks notifications a huge
important aspect of a companion device
like this are similarly limited where do
I had one or a dozen unread Gmail's the
number next to the red m icon on the
gear was always one and even then the
only thing you can do is tap a link on
the watch that unlocks your galaxy phone
it shows the emails there samsung's
boasts of 70 gear wraps at launch sounds
impressive at first but there are we the
two limited or dysfunctional to excite
any interest things that helped by the
fact that you have to use the galaxy
gear manager app honest am so
device to install anything to reveal or
to just such basic things is the color
of the default watch face the Samson's
credit the Bluetooth connection between
the gear and spared device is
consistently reliable and the automatic
transfers the photos and alerts in both
directions workflow because of its use
of the new bluetooth low energy standard
Samsung manages to get surprisingly
decent battery life out of the tiny cell
would has inside the gear it will last
for a full day almost 24 hours even if
you have vibration that's enabled and a
pretty active social life but be aware
that the camera stopped working wants to
drop a load fifteen percent to preserve
energy physically the gear is a tale of
design compromises steel screws and
chunky oversized metal parts clash with
gentle color schemes like rose gold and
oatmeal beige the gary is too big to
ever be considered elegant yet to
refined to be a proper oversized men's
watch as with the pebble the gear screen
is activated with rest gesture Sampson
tries to be more natural by reacting to
your raising the arm the watches on but
that's only if you're sitting or
standing up it's only useless when
you're trying to check the time in bed
the experience of using the galaxy gear
is running like that of biting into a
donut with two little filling there's
some fun to be had for sure but most of
it is bland a little frustrating this
could all be forgivable if the gears
price tag match that of an arrow used
phone accessory however to ninety nine
dollars Samsung's watch is in a whole
different stratosphere the galaxy game
marks the rough outlines of what could
be a very appealing device from Samsung
but as it stands today an intuitive
oversized overpriced and in constant
need of a galaxy guardian it have been
better off staying on the drawing board
