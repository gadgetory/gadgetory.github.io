Neil
deGrasse Tyson
sometimes I mean did the circuit moves
really yes so let me ask you something
you were voted People magazine's sexiest
astrophysicist alive in the year 2000
that was a few years ago well hold on
now that's what I want to know did they
that category you don't see a lot now
yeah did they retire the category or do
you just hold the title until the end of
time and when is the end of time okay
all right so first I don't get
big-headed about that distinction
because consider the category right I
mean it's I don't know what the
competition is dis the rest of the
astrophysics it was Stephen Hawking in
the I don't know
this is getting deeper and deeper I
don't know who's on the loo else
couldn't couldn't be the sexiest
astrophysicist
I don't know just dad or the category
sexiest action star sexiest news anchor
sexiest the sexiest model did you win
any of those no I just run sexiest a
stroke now the category did not exist
before me and it has not arisen
afterwards so you hold it permanently
yeah so far until you lose your you sexy
vibe but well I was you know a dozen
years ago and and so a student once came
up and said because I said that was 12
years ago he said no that means you're
the sexiest astrophysically will ever be
right right so I thought that was a way
to look at that fact so until the
universe comes to an end I it'll be a
while from now how how long do you think
I think the end of the universe should
be less of a concern for Earthlings than
the end of the Sun okay just so you want
to rank what you should be concerned
about it okay
just so you know we meet will give me a
timeline when do I need to start getting
worried about either one of it okay so
the sun all data show that the sun will
die in about five billion years mhmmm so
I'm waiting for an app that I can put
that in my calendars right yeah just you
know they don't go out five billion
years those do have a date do you know
the day there was a what's this movie
that had Ringo Starr in it and he was a
caveman that is not a movie
that is a I forgot it but it begins
it says like 3 million BC October 3rd
you know they're getting very specific
there's nothing wrong with that so talk
to me about I want to ask you a question
it might it might be a little sensitive
for you you're I don't know if you know
this you're kind of a meme on the
internet there are there are animated
gifs of you or gifs depending on who you
talk to there you become like a guy who
appears completely out of context how
does that make you feel
initially it was really weird and creepy
because my image would just be the
fodder for artists to distort at their
leisure mm-hmm the Internet yes and so
and so initially I was I was I was
creeped out by it and then I said well
this in total is a celebration so I
should not object celebration of the
sexiest asterisk
I mean I you know they do that with with
other people's images and so what it
meant was that my image became more than
just me it became something to play with
it'll live on it live on its so I okay
with it that's a little weird and creepy
but I'm okay with it
it's it's very likely that that even in
the moments just before the Sun burns
out someone will load up a page of
comments on the internet and there will
be a guy there they don't know who the
guy is probably because you're out of
context of law completely and you'll be
you'll be reacting to something there's
one we're excitedly there's just there's
a there's a cutout figure with me in
underwear and you put a different vest
of mine on top of it yeah that's Macbeth
so it's like you know the paper dolls
so can I can you just give me that you
are
I need to go to that right boxer shorts
and you just put on the clothing you
dress me in paper dolls I love the
sounds of that so you're cool with it
now you're now on our creep time by
being too mean well what's weird is the
one where if I don't if you know do it
there's one where I'm doing this and the
caption is please yes so yeah because
that was a that was like a frame from an
interview where I am praising Isaac
Newton listen right so I'm listing all
the great things he did he discovered
law of gravity universal law of gravity
and laws of optics and and and laws of
motion and and he had some trouble with
his gravity so he invented calculus to
figure out that problem and then he did
all of that by the time he turned 26 so
so I was saying he's my he's my man I
think the smartest guy that ever lived
and so I said so then I gesture and I
said the guy's good you know this like
you can't argue with Isaac Newton and
that becomes you got a badass over here
I gotta say I gotta say something what
you were just saying fascinating
informative gripping but all I could
think while you were saying it was every
frame of this is going to be turned into
a new year this is just you do now are
you what do you feel like there's extra
pressure because you know it's something
you're not just talking you're creating
new memes not knowingly and so all I can
do is just be myself and if that is meme
worthy content no it's never the
contents just of what it looks like that
it might if what my gestures are mean
worthy I can't know that in advance
they are I can only my body only moves
as the moment requires of it that's
gonna be a meme that's going to in fact
I'll be honest with you if somebody in
here doesn't create an animated gif
based on that by the end of this show
I'll be very upset alright so let's talk
about the meme stuff is great but you're
doing some other things that are also
important I mentioned in the intro I
know this is a real talk show yes is
your seat is one foot taller than - all
the other talk show your honor right you
know we've got a lot of problems with
the heights here I'm just saying I
wasn't I'm not trying to but you know I
did feel like you can't be on the same
level as me I've got then I got nothing
if you're here and we're on the Leveson
level I have no I can't perform okay you
just sit here I'll just take a break and
you talk but I want to talk about cosmos
kind of you're rebooting cause yes all
right would you call it a reboot yeah
exactly
Carl Sagan did the original yes the new
one is a generation ago 32 years ago
yeah and it's been that also has been
turned into a meme did you know that no
no you really need to do some I gotta
get out more do some googling but Seth
MacFarlane is producing he's an
executive producer different he's a
primary role was our intersection
between the what we're creating and
where we'll land and this new cosmos
will land on the Fox Network it's gonna
be on five yes 2013 yes well we had some
delays so maybe 2014 that far off yes
we'll we'll keep 13
stuff still be relevant in 2014 oh it is
we are choosing content well I mean hi
shel flies but it's not like it's gonna
be oh you know what
although you did my knockoff the plan in
there too before we get around to it
well we're gonna get to that we're gonna
get to that so so so about what happens
next
meme that's mean but I want to ask you
these I mean America is not at this
point known for being really into
science I mean and I think you know this
we're not a we're not at the present
moment we're not a country that is
talking about and thinking about science
a lot
are you sorry I'm more comfortable now
going I don't what is going on I know
science losing its meaning American
public yeah go ahead
I just feel like I want to be as
comfortable as you are right now okay
so tell me are we a country that's gonna
get back into science oh that's much
better yeah yeah we have to otherwise we
recede and we'll wake up one morning
back in the cave
once we started well there'll be some
stages before that no nobody got kind of
a crappy house back and one day we will
wake up we'll be in a cave and everyone
else will be in flying cars and we'll
wonder what'd happen ever even people
out in other countries other countries
yeah yeah
yeah they're gonna be us with a flying
car I bet metaphorical Florent car well
and they probably read all future that
we forgot how to dream about so but but
do you think that that I mean can we put
a show on Fox in primetime and get
people charged up about science again
will that do it if the content deserves
it I think it will grab the audience
that it deserves at least the audience
that the original garnered and the fact
that it's on Fox Fox has like the number
one shows on television it's got the
look at the whole Fox portfolio its 20th
Century Fox which brought avatar to the
screen it's it's Fox like pictures which
brought Slumdog Millionaire that's the
indie arm of Fox
it's the conservative commentary that's
rampant on Fox News you love right on
Fox News is that father got the the
left-wing commentary in The Simpsons and
in Family Guy it's it's not quite the
force of the Fox news network well I sue
few episodes I would say transcendent
because it not only recognized it it
actually pokes fun at it and so in a way
that everybody's got to laugh and
recognize it so so it is all American
demographics the crossroads intersect at
Fox if you look at what their portfolio
is so that's the place to put cosmos if
you want to maximize its impact to bring
science to the general public especially
the public that never knew that they
cared about science there are places you
could put it I call it like the science
ghetto where where I can use that word
okay can I not that's a problem okay so
so they're their channels where the
science geeks it's on the speed button
right you go right there and for other
folks we're their most important moment
of the day is wondering what Snooki is
doing they don't go to the science champ
you don't feel there's a scientific
element to what's Nucky's there is but
they don't know it and so if I'd be
happy to talk about there the melanin in
her skin or the the the the hormonal
forces that reveal themselves in their
conduct and behavior sure we could turn
that whole thing into a science show
let's do it
did you see your on Fox did you ever
think about is there gonna be any kind
of like American Idol element to it are
you gonna have people present theories
and then you guys will be you officer
we're gonna have we're gonna be pure you
know science we will be but the goal is
not just to teach science but to explore
how science matters to you assume
of the nation and of the world and of
the universe that's a lot of citizenry
yeah yeah but the nested in the Venn
diagram it's you just have to be the
citizen of the middle and you get the
other circles for free right like
universe yeah you don't really have a
choice there's no passport exactly yeah
tonight's burden of citizenship to be a
citizen of the universe so this ties
into your new book it's called space
chronicles facing the ultimate frontier
thanks for and and and everybody should
read it but but it's a and this is a
quote that's all again to read it but
well it's a manifesto this is a quote a
manifesto on the importance of space
exploration for America's economy
security and morale yeah I mean what how
does that work okay this quick what he
said let me set it up let me just said
that right we're in in at least in
America right we economy is in trouble
jobs are in trouble we have health care
issues we've got a presidential debate
you know a presidential race coming up
could change the way you know could go
to war with Iran all kinds of crazy
stuff happening I feel like and by the
way I agree with you I'm just playing
I'm playing the devil's advocate here
because I want to know and I think
everybody should hear you say what why
should people care about going to space
why should people care about space
travel or exploring when we have bigger
problems to tackle and I mean and you
see we haven't find it we haven't
invested in it right and there are
obvious reasons so so how how are we
gonna get people to care about you
worrying that you care about space that
that matters to me personally and
emotionally but not politically I you
should care about space not because
space is cool which it is you should
care about space because advances in a
space frontier reset what it is for a
nation to dream again and when you dream
about a future that you can enable with
science and technology then an
innovation culture takes root in your
nation and when you are part of an
innovation culture what you innovate
becomes tomorrow's economies and that's
what keeps the jobs here that's what
stimulates interest in science in the
schools that's what that's what that's
what
relaunches that you the economic
stability of your of your marketplace
and so you don't have to care that we're
discovering something on Mars the fact
of getting to Mars required that we
innovated and to because if you do
something tomorrow you've never done
today
you got to invent something new to make
that happen you have to and this is
about big innovations the NASA portfolio
today needs biologists because we're
looking for life on Mars chemists
aerospace engineers mechanical engineers
electrical engineers astrophysicists
geologists still be planetary geologist
all to all the frontier fields of the
STEM fields that science technology
engineering and math all all the all the
subjects that feed these four topics are
in the NASA portfolio and and NASA wins
every time you could say well I care
about the ocean and make your pitch to
the eighth graders oh we just still
don't know what's at the bottom of the
ocean there could be new fishes new
plants okay so I need someone a
biologist to help me look for life at
the bottom of the ocean you're done I
get up we're looking for alien life on
Mars
I need a biologist who's with me okay I
win I win that one okay okay we need to
be concerned about energy and this I'm
not arguing that but what's going to
inspire people you get up in front of
the 8th graders and say who wants to be
an aerospace engineer so that you can
design an airplane that's 20% more
fuel-efficient than the one your parents
flew that's your pitch I get up who
wants to be an aerospace engineer
because we need a new airfoil to
navigate the rarefied atmosphere of Mars
I win okay so so I win every time so so
so NASA is is proxy for all that
captures the dreams and and and and and
and trajectory r trajectories that we
want to re-instill in the educational
pipeline that's why I say just double
NASA's budget it's a half a penny on the
tax dollar right now and what is the
budget right now half a penny on a tax
dollar so that converts to like 18
billion all right now you say
for penny to NASA of every tax dollar I
don't think I can yeah I know so so
that's fine it took you so so I'm not
here to twist people's arms people after
I set all this because it's not the
first time I said this right I said this
and there's like hashtag penny for NASA
with the numeral four they're not
websites penny for NASA org penny for
NASA dotnet people is like grassroots
and I testified in Congress in front of
the Senate just ten days ago and and I
thought I'd you know there's like three
senators there from a committee of 25
and but there's a camera there and like
I get home it's on YouTube
okay Kara did you I mean it's been
people are and I'm looking at the
comment thread so people said they were
in tears and I'm because I think because
it moved them and I was happy to learn
that but I'm not trying to lead a
movement I'm just trying to alert people
of the causes and effects of action
versus inaction if you do not invest in
NASA you will think that you're so
solutions to society's problems oh we
need better science kids let's make a
better science teacher
there's trained teachers okay I fixed
that you saying send the teachers to
space the people who think that that's
that's a dyad that's gets solved just by
putting the money in it and then with
the jobs are going overseas well let's
change the tariffs regulation just adds
tax incentives to keep the factory oh
fix that that's another band-aid there
I'm stand-in the economy you want to
boost the economy so let's put some
money in innovation sectors okay and I'm
saying you can't legislate innovation
it's got to come out of the creative
juices of really smart motivated people
and how do you get smart motivated
people to want to do smart motivated
things you have motivational goals set
in front of them like we're going to
Mars but we're gonna set up a colony in
the back side of the Moon we're gonna
stop that asteroid that has our name on
it
there's a good one for you okay the
asteroid are we in trouble this is gonna
be like the movie 2012 starring John
Cusack but that wasn't an asteroid also
star serendipity I don't know I didn't
see it but yeah it wasn't an asteroid
that was well we don't knows from the
song are we going to be here but note
that the inside of the earth
horn game back on what your self just
thought I'd give some details on it
thanks for using you thanks you're
ruining 2012 don't mention Hoover it
lets you cut hang all right with the
geek factors of the moon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
