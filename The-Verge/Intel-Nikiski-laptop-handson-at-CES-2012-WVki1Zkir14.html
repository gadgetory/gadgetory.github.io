traveling when I'm working I get a
summary of the information there would
normally be numbers here but since we've
been opening and closing the lid last
few minutes nothing new has come in but
I could get my calendar items I could go
to a calendar item I can accept or
reject it simple io as well as a little
bit of detail so if i go to buy a car in
the garage let's see that one's pretty
long i can get a lot of email
information in and i can scroll it using
my fingers or I can go and I can bring
up a webpage I can scroll that too and
then when I open the lid whether it's
email or a web page the context is
maintained and I'm on the same web page
that i was looking at when the lid was
closed so that's important because we
want you to use the keyboard that's the
best way to interact and enter emails
that's where we think it is we're trying
to make it easier for you to do that
without having to do valet mode right so
this is windows 7 surgeon uses windows 7
not windows 8 and you're using this this
interface on the outside something Intel
Developer this is in that case we were
developed visit with this is adam this
was actually shown last year well before
the metro tiles came out okay so it's
just brilliant people think alike but
you know as you can see it's an
interface that it looks familiar looks
familiar but at the same rate work
slightly differently ok I got a limited
real estate can you just open it up
again and show me the touchpad working
with windows 7
so bring it up we've got a touchpad put
this here you can see that i'm moving
put it in that field so you can actually
see it however when I put my palm down
it doesn't affect it alright thank you
so much for closing down on us here but
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
