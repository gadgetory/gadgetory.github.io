since our last fudge bubble show you
might notice that i'm not actually
dieter bohn which might be a surprise
but we're still carrying on uh hopefully
we're gonna have quite a few surprises
in today's show particularly since we'd
actually know what we're doing but let's
see what happens stay tuned for the
verge mole show hey I'm Blatz hello i'm
chris sigler i'm ross miller oh hello
Rock hi sorry about that goodness you
know you think that a guy who is sort of
the consummate professional with 90
seconds on the verge notice that was a
nice pimp for your program by the way
you think that somebody who is such
professional of 90 seconds on the verge
would know when to come in on cue but
apparently not see where cavemen a
90-second the birds we don't have a mute
switch that I was rocking I tried to
open my mouth and technology prevented
it this is actually a technology podcast
that you know there's a good transition
to us talking about something more
important hi I'm rambling we're not
making this under an hour um well
actually this is 90 seconds on the verge
mobile show now we're combining both
programs so we're actually shortening it
from an hour and a half to 90 seconds
which is convenient for everybody by the
way for those of you who are watching
live I just want to apologize for my
video quality uh we were just having
this discussion right before we started
broadcasting here's what happened I'm
gonna start this show Vlad I know that
you're supposed to take it from here and
startop talking about actual mobile news
but I'm going to do a little aside here
what happens this I am recording on a
macbook air 2 2010 model MEK no 20 lot
early 2011 macbook air I don't know what
the is there thunder bolt there's no
Thunderbolt coats pre I have a
720p logitech webcam that I normally
to record myself when I'm doing this
show up until last week or the week
before I can't remember we were mostly
getting SD streams from my location to
the New York studio for whatever reason
skype decided to start broadcasting me
an HD in the last couple weeks it's kind
of like mysterious how that process
works you can't control it from skype it
happens automatically when that happened
the macbook air ground to a halt I just
now realized after playing with the
settings here between the the internal
webcam and the logitech that when I'm
broadcasting in HD the air just
completely I mean it can't handle it
skype consumes a hundred percent of the
CPU nothing works right i was having
terrible sync issues last week now i'm
on the internal camera which is why i
look a little fuzzier uh so hopefully
that's not going to be too big of a
problem for you hopefully won't be too
distracting you know that you like to
see me in full 720p quality 1080p if it
was an option fortunately it's not so
your complexion has never looked better
thank you thank you rob you're welcome /
lee i'm gonna be on an imac with a core
i7 in this won't be an issue anymore
anyway tomorrow the stories get a real
computer ouch hey you have a macbook air
do you not do I'm doing this on a
macbook air it's actually the generation
before yours and i still think is the
best computer ever but it has its
limitations and you just highlights it
one of the big ones yeah also sorry just
wanted to mention on a topic of
professionalism i do want to say that
that was basically the beta intro that i
just did because it kinda sucked scarlet
egg beater interning with the beep I
like it yeah um I think that would be a
bit of audience approbation but you know
the most professional intro producer on
our team is DITA who's done it many a
time he's a complete veteran Chris has
done a couple of times and I've done it
once i can say that was the beta soon
we'll have the Gamma Delta cetera
versions
eventually we'll get to stage where it's
all smooth and awesome and we actually
talked about mobile devices what intro
Omega will happen differ having trouble
mega the dieter is a stone-cold killer
with these opens um by the way you might
be wondering why heaters in here he is
on a very secret mission in our great
nation's heartland doing some reporting
and you'll be seeing that shortly you'll
also be seeing him on this program next
week I believe not to say we don't want
ross miller here every week because we
do an echo since you are since you are
in the studio for 90 seconds on the
verge anyway maybe we'll just you know
commandeer you every week I don't mind
um and to be honest I have backup in
case I do suffer a heart attack um right
now I want you gonna pull this guy into
frame right here we have Nathan uh
Nathan Ingram Lily everybody oh nothing
what's up guys he exists he's real yes
Nathan not only exists but he is a quite
frankly there would be no news on the
verge if it were not for for Nathan and
TC and Brian who are our dear news
managers and make the site tick so a
round of applause for nathan everybody
out there watching right now we can't
hear you but you know wherever you're
sitting if you're in a public library
watching this program on a computer to
start clapping make some noise in fact
it'd be great that clapping you're
screaming wow yeah we as in you know
libraries quiet please do okay it would
let i'm sorry for de railing this
program bled please continue I think
we're food a five-minute quota of number
will talk to make sure that anybody
who's later the show has joined in and
everybody's here because I'll talking
about phones finally um I think the
biggest at least from my perspective
piece of new / rumor from the past week
is this 5-inch smartphone from HTC and
what we're dealing with here is ok first
of all the primary source is didga x
which you know everybody
like well digits x is like 50 50 if
you're lucky but there's a lot of
circumstantial evidence that goes with
it but the rumor is that HTS preparing a
5 inch android smartphone with a full
1080p display which canna ties him with
Chris's proposition that he really needs
a 1080p webcam so people can see him on
their future HTC phones working so yeah
and and that phone is expected okay
september-october which makes sense
because that's about the time that HC
likes to refresh HDD likes to do two
major refreshes of its android flagship
one is around them that we see time
already been done and the other is
around the Woodson time
september-october it didn't do much with
that last year we had the sensation XL
and some really quite I mean that was it
really oh here in Europe and then you
had the the resound over in the u.s.
later the year but it looks like a
pretty major upgrade on the 1x 5-inch
1080p phone also there's a geo benchmark
result which indicates the same
resolution we've seen on that resolution
listing it also shows it's not exactly 9
20 x 1080 so 126 vertical lines are
taken up by what's presumed to be the
android on-screen buttons it all kind of
just meshes together and flows together
so it does seem like this thing is
legitimate like it's real and the other
thing is that vacuum a LG announced that
is built IPS display with 1080p
resolution at five inches so all of the
things like that all the pieces are
there for this phone to exist yeah it
sounds like it's great super phablet
phone lit thing phablet super Fab five
inches so I mean my question is why are
they doing refreshed so fast like you
said last year with sensation XL was not
a big update was more iterative than it
was substantial this seems more
substantial did something happen with
the 1-series that just did not mesh as
well
they hoped my theory is that they want
to create as large of a gap between them
and Samsung as they possibly can because
there's a lot of you know obviously all
the all the attention right now is the
battle between Samsung and Apple but in
the Android space there is this this
this less public battle going on between
Samsung and HTC for premier Android OEM
and you know HTC just got a very very
brief jump on samsung with the One X
versus the gs3 I think that they might
be looking to create a slightly larger
gap with their next device versus
Samsung's next device and of course
there will be some sort of battle
between the note 2 which is going to be
almost certainly announced it at Aoife
and whatever HTC is bringing to the
table but I consider this as if this is
5 inches exactly 5 inches I do think of
it as more of a an up-market 1x or you
know refresh the 1x tonight then I would
think of it as a galaxy no competitor
personally no I agree but that's also
kind of a funny thing to say enough
market 1x cuz the 1x was supposed to be
the top of the market right and I think
that's also the point that Ross is
getting at but to answer his question I
don't feel like HTC got too much wrong
with the 1-series aside from the Sun
software which chris that i bemoaned at
length so but again if you want to fix
sense that there's a very easy way to do
it that's a software thing you don't fix
sense by introducing a 1080p display and
just stretching it out over a larger
display I think Chris this point is
exactly accurate like HTC has had issues
with its financials which we'll discuss
in a little bit and it's not making the
property used to be making and it's
losing sales &amp;amp; like mike vs if HTC can
get out ahead of samsung and actually
hold onto the spec lead in android for
prolonged period of time you know that
might be the thing that fixes
thanks for for the company so that
that's my reasoning I guess for you know
going for this kind of aggressive thing
but then the other thing is if oh gee
has this 5-inch 1080p display why don't
you want to use it like why would you
let somebody else grab it well this here
here's my question though why and I've
mentioned this many times before on this
show and on the podcast before it why in
the world do you need a pixel density in
excess of 400 PPI on a mobile device or
any device in somebody else a date dude
this is this happened actually in in the
common thread on our news reports on
this 5 inch HD super phone you know like
the first couple of comments were like
it's overkill it's unnecessary is too
much and then write the responses to
those were well yeah but when but what
was the response specifically but the
point is that you you say it's too much
but if he if you you take that
perspective you never move forward you
know I'm do one of those guys who was
really quite content with monochrome
displays back in the day uh again I've
kind of mentioned this before the first
color display is really sucked but so
they weren't all that attractive but
then people were actually asking okay
you're only looking at text messages
snake and phone numbers why do you the
color display and the point is you can't
answer the question why do you need a
1080p display until you have one and
then people start putting it to use well
I mean I don't know who the answers of
my head other than 1080p movies so
here's my perspective I think that that
1080p in a mobile display is the most
clear-cut example of a specs pissing
contest that I can recall in recent
memory I mean there's been a problem for
a very long time in the Android space
but this there is no more clear
demonstration of that than with this
particular respect what I would like to
see component providers and OEMs do
instead is concentrate on taking these
four to five inch or
four point eight inch 720p displays and
start working on technologies for better
daylight viewability better viewing
angles better you know laminate display
technologies because that's the kind of
stuff that you notice every single
second that you're using the device and
it you know of course the the Sony
source component on the One X is already
absolutely fantastic it's i think i
rated it a 10 x remember correctly I
can't it's not possible to make a
display much better than that i think on
a mobile device but one area where they
they could improve where they can always
improve his daylight viewability so in
fact we were we were talking about this
on last week's show those old
transflective displays on the I packs
from the early 2000s like it actually
got better when you were viewing the
display and sunlight then it then it was
indoors and you know at some point
hopefully we'll get to that point again
where it's just as good and in direct
sunlight as it is anywhere else so I'd
like to see them work on that and then
then rather than resolution at this
point so why is that to say that we're
hitting this kind of Zenith point where
we don't need higher resolution if we're
gonna have a 4k televisions we don't
need a 1080p phone or a 2k phone at some
point I mean well here's there's my
question to you Chris her vlogs I don't
have an answer to this what is the
highest pixel density of a phone you've
seen or that's been out so far um
probably your the resound I guess 4.3
inch 720p ya think so that would be that
would be the most popular recent one I
mean yeah I a conflict of anything else
I'm you know obviously the i believe the
xperia s matches it with 720p at 4.3
inches but i don't think that's a better
display but in any case yeah i think
those are the densest once 4.3 inches
with 720p I i I'm with you Chris
actually like in practical terms when
you think about it even though this
display we're talking about is a 1080p
one it is actually five inches which
makes it even bigger whereas I've
already been on the record complaining
that 4.7 inches in itself is
too bulky for me so for whole point
right whole bunch of people you have the
HTC One X you have as you say the best
display technology seen on the phone yet
it looks superb but it's big and now
you're just making it bigger and you're
not going to have the same display to
them because LG isn't the company that
built the display in the 1x and it's IPS
display so generally not not always but
generally been that's like bit worse
than the IPS displays it being inside
the iphone you know so you might see
expect an expansionist size which for
most people isn't going to be benefit
and a decrease in quality so actually
this is really deflating everywhere I
was excited about this that's why I'm
here to do man I mean keep in mind going
back to the announcement of the iphone 4
and the whole concept of the retina
displays that it's that pixel density at
which individual pixels can no longer be
perceived and that's what's I'm around
275 PPI I think and yeah beyond that
it's it's unclear what I mean no one has
given me a logical answer when I asked
it will you know what is the the actual
material advantage of pushing a pixel
density beyond that I mean because you
know even if you're watching say a 1080p
movie or in the future down the road of
a 4k movie you're gonna end up you know
you're not going to be able to perceive
the pixels that are that small so you
would downscale it anyway to to 720p
nutwood look every bit as good at the
same screen size and its ass I don't
know what's your point it's the same
screen size at the same retinal
difference like I'm not going to hold a
phone up this close what I will hold up
that close so is maybe like a visor and
I can see this like the pixel density
argument continuing a new when we start
getting to the google glass era if
they're really can start pushing yet at
that point we'll start noticing pixel
density at that level of two inch
whatever i don't know how big glasses
are anymore I that's really bright for
me to say right now actually and what's
it suppose X be our thing
uh-oh the oculus VR goggles yes yes
which is like I think x 640 x 320 really
you can tell the pixels that wasn't yet
it's a good test case but it's
definitely far and away not ready for
prime time yeah I was going to ask about
those I think they were freed egos that
junk comic head that you tested Ross
whose resolution and oats uh I think
there's the oculus rift that's now in
kickstarter i believe it was like 40 x
320 960 x 320 something like that oh I'm
so off thank you Nathan my fact checker
right here 1280 by 800 but that's split
in half so it's essentially 640 or 720 /
I thank you yeah so it's uh you can tell
it's not good if you're you know if you
have a good prescription I did without
glasses so I can't see very well so it's
really nice and blurry great complexion
all that uh but anyway so yeah so the
point is like I think krista thank you
you might have convinced me in suede me
there is no point for a 1080p 5-inch
phone or at least nothing beyond that
but going forward i think the next pixel
density battle is going to be once we
get screens closer to us by necessity
virtual reality and augmented reality
headsets i think then this whole screen
war begins anew that's it i'm actually a
little a little sad to think that we're
hitting this kind of breaking point with
cellphone density that we just don't
need a higher resolution like we've hit
this kind of pinnacle where it becomes
kind of a moot point yeah i think if you
look at circus but if we look at apple's
history with pushing resolution and
pushing the retina branding one of the
notable things for me is that Apple
didn't just raise the resolution of his
displays it really raised the quality so
when it did it with the iphone 4 it was
up so much better display than he had in
the iphone 3gs when it when it called a
Retina display the really high
resolution one in the new ipad of this
year again everybody was fawning over it
they were like this is the best display
I've seen anywhere
ever and what I did it with the retina
MacBook Pro same situation so I do you
feel like in Apple's case there's a
disposal raised in resolution and a
raising quality which kind of meshes and
gives meaning to the whole retina
branding and it also gives value and and
something that people could actually you
know feel right where as opposed to if
you just double up the resolution or
quadruple the resolution whatever but
leave the quality the same or worse you
degrade equality in order to get more
pixels and ultimately people aren't I
going to appreciate it and liked it as
much so I think that's the difference
that they made it make maybe agencies
kind of falling into that pit full of
thinking also more phones if we can say
with the only 1080p phone on the market
which they wish they might very well do
right but it is exactly as chris says
turning into a bit of a pissing contest
thing and i'm not even sure I mean how
psyched the people about specs anymore I
can kind of see them catching on to like
branding messages like I said with
retina with Apple is like does he have
the rights in the display they know what
it means but it's so widespread you can
pick it up but if it's like a 1080p
versus 720p display then it becomes a
spec comparison as opposed to a big
branding message that you can you know
attach yourself to I think there's stop
ulation I think there's a certain
population of the market that is still
receptive to you know what number is
bigger and they may not even necessarily
know what that number means they just
say well this number is 1080 and this
number 7 20 I want the bigger number and
and and to be honest I think that that
sometimes is those kinds of silly things
that factor into how carriers price
devices um you know and of course your
point flight there are also certain
specs that are very prominent and very
well known or their there are certain
branded specs that people understand LTE
is big one right now that all the
carriers are pushing of course retina as
well so it we'll see we'll see it's
going to be I mean I
I think that people might be able to
equate 1080p to their TVs because you
know for the past decade you know the
six years to a decade HDTV really
saturated the television market and so
consumers are probably still used to
being sold on you know 720p and 1080p
there may be that number will you know
is still in their brain somewhere and
they when they see that on a phone it's
going to register for them so we'll see
sure and just wrap up this 5 inch phone
I do feel like the rest of the specs
very much in line with a HC has been
doing in such just pushing every single
thing the Geo benchmark result mentioned
Adreno 320 graphics which means
Snapdragon s4 chip and we haven't had
any that I recall at least any phones
that are released with the 320 the
upgraded graphics chip this year so
that's gonna make it one of the you know
hands-down best performing devices and
you know pairing that with 1080p display
and all of that stuff is just going to
make a spectacular recipe in terms of
specs right but I mean I also kind of
fear that you've already got plenty
plenty of specs and firepower with the
1s and the 1x so you know even if you
don't put it up I mean what is there to
use it but what are you gonna do are you
going to actually start encoding 1080p
video and you don't start editing and
doing all of that stuff how does
quainton feel about that obviously
recent you're not really gonna do that
right so well all of this processing
power kind of seems to be going the same
way as of the resolution well I have a
more important question to pose to you
guys regarding this device which is
what's a better name the HTC one two or
the HTC 2x uh one XL wait did it not as
already been done yeah shoot yeah
they're uh XXL I kind of like 12 I don't
see it ht2
so then they can do one two three and it
can be like a whole thing they'll be
there stick oh I'll keep adding numbers
Creighton is timing in 12 but comma t 00
the one also this is why Creighton does
not do branding for major self actress
is why I one of those of deep breath
come on yeah I mean I actually miss
those gressive adjective names the ones
here is just kind of feels the 20 steer
to me now maybe 80 g to get back I would
just like to make the same pay at the
same point that I make on every single
show which is that mega is an
underutilized term in cell phone names
so HTC one mega might be good or HTC
mega 1 i'm just gonna throw those better
I like that sticks some of the commoners
uh they'd said one mega we've got the
ACC XXL we've got the 2x we've got the
HTC One up actually I kind of like that
and of course the HTC fast cast thank
you crazy talky aficionado longtime
listeners of the verge mobile podcast
and even the engadget mobile podcast
will recall the HTC bacon which still
hasn't been used as far as I now so
maybe based on whatever your vicious
Chris no that was a commoner I believe
on an engadget mobile podcast several
years ago and I think Neil I was a
special guest on that show if I if
memory serves me correctly and somehow
the topic of HTC phone names came up but
we we should that we're not even done
talking about HTC we have a bunch of
different HTC thanks to talk about right
look at big news let's make a quick
mention of the menu button update /
upgrade which diese has been extremely
excited and happy about yeah yeah this
isn't a quick mention thing why this is
big news in the Android world this sent
shockwaves and it fixes one of census
many floors now this is I think you're
significantly under estimating being
poor
into this the fact that the fact that
HTC I never mind the specific change
right the fact that HTC is proactively
responding to a very common complaint
about like you ex can without upgrading
to a new version of Android and and
going out there and patching and
actually changing the functionality is
pretty crazy and I think it's it's more
or less without precedent so that's
that's an encouraging sign that they're
out there very very closely listening to
people they're out they've obviously
been trawling through threads on XDA and
probably some of our sites and this is I
think this is really a really positive
sign for the way they're going that's
not to say that I think that sense for
is where it needs to be and we've talked
about this at length but this is a this
very good sign by the way for those of
you who don't know have no clue what
we're talking about it the the problem
that HTC has with the One X and the one
asks is that there's no menu bar excuse
me no menu button on the fixed row of
buttons at the bottom of the device so
for legacy applications that haven't
been updated to move the menu up into
the action bar like you're supposed to
supposed to do with Google's holo design
guidelines you get this this extra soft
a button bar across the bottom of the
screen that takes up an additional what
is it hundred make hundred pixels or
something with just a single button on
it that Center aligned that is three
vertical dots which is the menu
indicator in android 4.2 it looks weird
it's it's bad and we call them out for
it in our review and they they went back
and and and patched it so that it you
you don't you can actually change the
functionality of the multitasking button
to be a menu button now yeah thanks
pretty cool you need to hold it down Oh
how's that what I yeah there's a Ivan
Ivan updated in mind so I've been played
with yet but this is where we need
dieter because dieter is like the
biggest 1x phonetic in the world and he
would be able to talk about this at
length but I think you need to hold it
down for a second or two but but the the
point is that that virtual bar is now
gone
which was one of the biggest annoyances
of not having not adopting the Galaxy
Nexus style virtual bar the way the
galaxy s3 does it where they have a hard
menu button alright well just just to
say that you said it's a unprecedented
for HTC to adjust the software response
to feedback which is true in terms of
like adjusting the like the fundamental
and the really basic interface and
interaction but let's not forget that
the company has always been very
attentive to feedback if you remember
back when the bootloaders book being
locked down and then they did the
unlocked bootloaders and when they
announced they would upgrade the galaxy
the AC not the galaxy won't talk about
the desire to Gingerbread and oh I mean
that all of these things have I mean
they're not hd's happiest moments in the
company's history but they have
Illustrated that when people have cried
out and complain about something the
company's really tried to make an effort
like the the point about the desire is
it announced it wouldn't get the upgrade
but everybody really complained the
sybaris lee and i think HD chopped out a
couple of features just to get that
upgrade in there which is good you know
i mean it's a it's how companies should
behave you know they should react yep
and and why should they act that way
because they're having trouble in in the
financial side of the business nice
transition that was i planned that one I
had that bat waiting for a while that
was I'm a little proud of myself right
now that was that was perfectly timed
perfectly executed but white I'm gonna
rely on you to talk about this because
I'm not good with numbers nice cover but
what's happened with HTC they reported
the second quarter revenues mean HTC
also funny thing with them is that their
financial reports that kind of all over
the map so they report an audited
numbers at the beginning of a given
then three or four weeks later to get
around to auditing them so we end up you
know usually writing two posts want to
say hcs quota for this year is
such-and-such the other one is yes
somebody rubber-stamped it etc and then
it was a third part to this this time
around we're HTC reported specific
numbers for the month of what much just
expired July now I'm so out of it today
and they also gave a forecast for
quota-free which actually is not a very
happy forecast like agency saying and
one of his roughest the first quarters
of the year this year it improved in the
second quarter but it's actually
forecasting that things are going to go
back to being a stuff as in the first
quarter um wish to be is kind of odd
because the first course you could say
well look at what HC had to present
people okay the Rose Island was a strong
phone but most of his lineup like was
saying was things like the sensation
Excel and just uninspiring kind of old
designs the one series came in every
refresh things it really came up with
good designs you know unique selling
points like the one X's display and the
one assistant pneus any image sense
camera sweet and all of these things she
then I thought well okay they've
corrected themselves in the second
quarter and now it's on the up and up
but then they're predicting that things
won't go on the apple app which honestly
kind of leaves me be followed I don't
really understand this like the galaxy
is free is a great phone but how its
managed to sell like well over 10
million units versus the HTC One X which
doesn't seem to be generating enough of
a pro for HTC just be follows me because
I see those phones have been much closer
than that I think there are a few
explanations I mean you you can't deny
the sheer force and momentum of
Samsung's scale right this is one of the
largest corporations in the world versus
you know going up against HTC and so
they can they
have they have the the manpower and the
resources to put the full court press on
literally every carrier of import around
the world simultaneously and you saw
that happen with with s3 and how well
coordinated that launch was and and I
think that Samsung you know of course
what you know we're seeing a lot of this
come out in the apple vs samsung trial
but i think that they're they're finally
learning how to get their ducks in a row
and become a very innovative force not
just in the android space but in the
smartphone space overall and that makes
them very dangerous considering how
profitable they are every quarter and of
course there's the the undeniable
advantage of making your own processors
and memory and flash and displays and
that's an advantage that HTC doesn't
have and we've seen all these
predictions from analysts over the past
year and I think this kind of heated up
or the past couple months in particular
saying that long-term there are only two
players capable of surviving this brutal
business Apple and Samsung everybody
else is just going to kind of peter out
and die which which is really sad
considering what great devices HTC makes
and what great devices Nokia makes and
you know obviously we be its to
everybody's benefit to see those
companies survive even if you don't own
their devices so yes it's just a brutal
business yeah but in a sense I've
actually if we're bringing back to HTC
then launch of the 1x here in the UK was
accompanied by a huge marketing saw you
know there's a few free papers floating
about London which had you know that
they're outside covers were plastered
with 1x promotional stuff on the front
in the back and then he had the paper
inside it every carrier in the UK was
only seem to be spending quite a bit of
money promoting that handset when HTC
introduced the one exit said that
carriers have never loved a phone or a
series of phones as much as they've
loved the one series so there was
already a whole bunch of carrier buying
the it wasn't like the phones were
launched without the commensurate amount
of hype and promotion
material round them and yet you just do
this you like gap between them and get
it a tree which I don't know as you can
explain to myself and also do you point
Chris about what people are predicting
about long-term the thing about
long-term predictions is that they all
suck right we actually had this
conversation in our chat channel today
we're we're like Samsung is today Sony
right and then somebody's well Samsung
is yesterday's Sony and then somebody in
Sony's yesterday Sega and you know you
go be pretty that is mean by the way
that is very mean it's like I think it's
kind of true though it's very true so
Vlad I want to cut in just for one
second um it's interesting you mentioned
like HTC's campaign Chris correct me if
you've seen differently but i will say
in the united states samsung has gone
crazy with the ad campaigns it's in
front of every single movie in front of
every single newspaper magazine flyer
yeah i was all over the olympics and
that's course global if HTC had a huge
campaign here it was very short-lived I
don't remember too much of it especially
in the video realm but Samsung has the
budget I guess arguably to just go all
out it just advertised everywhere I
ridiculous yet out yeah the entire city
of Chicago is plastered and galaxy s3
ads right now I mean complete saturation
if you think android I mean Samsung's
point is to come out there and say we're
the only choice for that and I think
they've done a great job I mean I don't
see a lot for LG HTC's maybe the one
other company besides Samsung that I'm
seeing any advertisements for and it's
been a long time and relative to
Samsung's like weight of advertising and
a huge campaign it's minimal at best ok
but I mean that's obviously good to know
but like the question I'm trying to get
to the bottom of is whether it's just a
matter of advertising saturation like
can you really I mean obviously you need
a strong product to start with to
promote but then can you really just
ensure success by just carpet bombing
everyone maybe you can if you can what
does blood let me ask you what when you
see HTC ads what
are the advertising with the 1x how are
they showing it off primarily over here
in the UK it was this uh it was this
video of skydivers skydivers and taking
photos with the 1x oh yeah sure I know
it right that it can it can take photos
really quickly etc and you know they so
edgy and sporty and fun and super quick
and stuff potentially yeah what we see
over here is the same time sharing we
will not stop talking about NFC bump
sharing which yes I don't think that's
not even unique to galaxy s3 is it I
mean that's a android feature I think
they enhanced it but they danced it in
the same way that that Android 4.1
enhances it like it you know it can it
can transfer more types of information
and larger chunks of information than
Android Beam could and point oh so yeah
it it it also uses Wi-Fi direct to in
the phones but unhelpfully it's not
Universal Wi-Fi direct connectivity is
only samsung phones of which the only
supporting devices galaxy is free but
yeah basically you can initiate a link
between two galaxy s fries by bumping
them with the NFC connection and then
from that you can establish a Wi-Fi
direct which means you don't need to
have them side by side then they just
kind of Bend is just working with their
wireless radios the Wi-Fi ready right so
apples or an apple sorry excuse me
Samsung's entire ad campaign for this is
like this is what we can do that no one
else can do as far as we want you to
know in America they're doing a pretty
good job of doing that I think taking a
page from Apple's playbook which is to
say let's show functionality let's not
say this is just a sexy device that has
these specs it could go this fast we're
just going to say you can do this with
our phone and the assumption is it's
only our phone and it's something no one
else can do and by the way we're
everywhere so you're going to think
about us anyway yeah I mean pretty much
that seems to be the case I would factor
a lot of it on their impressive ad
campaign name recognition in the fact
there's just one galaxy s3 it's not the
evo 4g LTE it's not the
yeah the XV are as with varying
qualities of varying tears Samsung has
come out One flagship phone it has made
their baby across all carriers I mean
Jamie Samson has come out with I think
half a dozen phone yeah well they're
only advertising the one though right
yes three right I mean I think I yes the
bus the mini the something did this is
actually 0 4g i faint as a galaxy is a
stew like how did you manage to get the
tune of a phone that nobody ever cared
or knew about stuff I most of those are
there but then maybe maybe Samsung is
such a massive company that it might
even be operating like two separate
businesses where one is the
old-fashioned you know Turner as many
phones as you can try and reach the low
price points sell it to you know
developing markets to emerging markets
for yada yada and then a separate
business which is like the beat Apple a
section of the office basically we're
digit but it's just saying okay app was
doing this we're gonna do it but just
differently enough so we don't get sued
into oblivion I don't think you're that
far off I think that that they
definitely are still producing a wide
variety of nameless you know practically
nameless devices with the sole goal of
placating there uh you know there's
they're sold in carrier base they you
know they know that they have all these
slots they need to fill and they're just
like I you know we have such scale we
can we can pump out you know a dozen
bespoke models for metropcs if we want
to and you know nobody cares and they'll
sell 5,000 and no you know it's it's
fine and then they have their their real
Samsung strategy which is that the s3
the note and and now the note 10.1 and
all that is built around the Samsung
ecosystem and things like like all share
and you know that ties into what they're
doing trying to do in the living room
and you know that's that's that's the
real Samsung as far as I'm concerned the
rest is just you know MIT you know make
a quick buck by selling into these
carriers that are expecting us to fill
these slots
yeah that's burner but um I was just
thinking on that point actually because
you're saying just a little earlier
Chris about the note too that he might
come out I think Samsung has already
made it official that is announcing the
note 2 yeah but I believe so so is that
it's definitely announcing the note 2 at
the end of August Eddie fur which you
know the rumor and speculation and the
expectation was that it would be a 5.5
inch device and be all sorts of amazing
whatever do you think Samsung would at
any point just kind of say we're
actually these are our top three selling
devices this is our range of devices say
galaxy it's free you know the flagship
break it a smartphone the note or note 2
or note whatever in the five inches
middle ground whatever like Ross was
saying a phablet range and then
something like the note 10.1 for the
full-size tablet you think Sam so we'll
ever get to the stage where say okay
we're just gonna work on these free
products and I'll be outraged I don't
think they're in there showing any signs
of that let's put it that way I mean I
the galaxy s I mean maybe they're trying
to set a precedent with the way they
handled the galaxy s3 launch but I I
don't think so I i'm not i'm not seeing
that if you look at some of the court
documents and look at the at the road
maps that they have for 2012 i mean
there's all sorts of weird garbage on
the mid-range and low end for for the US
market on all these carriers and it you
know i think that samsung has the design
and manufacture of these meaningless
devices down to such a science that
their development costs are as close to
zero as they could possibly be and so
it's it's almost to the point where
these things are just pure profit as
long as carriers are saying we want this
stupid phone with this keyboard and it's
got to have a a button to our web portal
on the keyboard and
junk like that as long as carriers keep
saying that and paying for them to range
them Samsung is going to be one of the
companies that that honors those
requests along with huawei and ZTE in
the long term I think that you're gonna
see I mean obviously apple doesn't play
that game nokia i don't think is going
to ever play that game and I don't think
Sony is either so under subject of
companies who pees carriers as a matter
of course and we've done a bit more
coverage on rims fortunes and faith
recently um and I'm hoping one of you
guys actually wanted to read this stuff
and slip by me well but so good yeah so
so so so let's just say that if you
haven't read Jesse's piece Jesse
actually lives in Metro Detroit which is
not far from from Waterloo which of
course is rim headquarters so he he
traveled up there and and and talked to
some of the people in Waterloo to see
how rims fortunes and misfortunes
actually affect people on the ground and
I and please take the time to read this
piece because it's a very interesting
piece of course Jesse had a rim piece
that went up was a 23 months ago as well
and you should read both of those those
articles because it's it's a really
fascinating look at the decline of the
company and what it means for the local
economy but um uh what what what
fascinated me about this piece is how uh
how these people are realists I mean I
guess that shouldn't be a surprise right
um they eat you you you wouldn't expect
I think these are smart people they're
they're good people and you wouldn't
expect them to be fleeced by rim
necessarily but they say I mean most of
the people that he talked to are
realists about rims fortunes and where
they stand in the market and what their
opportunities are and and it's it's uh
it's kind of it's it's
it's sad to read and it really makes you
hope that that RIM finds a way to uh to
make it in this market but it's safe I
don't know where they're going to go
from here torsten Hines has not shown me
anything that proves that he is able to
lead this company out of the nightmare
that it's in and that's not to say
anything about whether he's a good CEO
or not because I don't think I think
that that all the you know every single
possible set of odds was stacked against
him by the time he took the helm it sits
squarely on Jim Balsillie and Mike
Lazaridis who brought that Connie to
where it is today it's it's not not
Hines so I don't think we can really
make any ruling on what kind of guy he
is but yeah it's it's it's a good piece
please take the time to read it do your
do your pocket or how it is that you
read these sorts of things um but but
speaking of times we should we should
talk a little bit about this latest
thing that he's saying which kind of
goes along with what he's been saying
along with it's the strongest now he's
saying he's hinting very strongly that
they could license blackberry 10 because
rim itself is not able to achieve the
economies of scale that it needs to to
compete with who it needs to compete
with in the smartphone market and I
think the the perennial question then
that everyone has been asking since day
one is who would have licensed
blackberry 10 and why so I want to get
your guys take who do you think would
realistically license blackberry 10 and
what good would it do them um i would
need blackberry tend to exist first of
all but the sauce um i don't have much
better answer i was gonna say Samsung
because why not they have everything
else they make windows phones that are
by the way really bad you can definitely
tell where Samsung actually cares to put
in some design and I don't know I mean I
feel like those you know people if if
rim can leverage any carrier and I don't
know if it can't anymore but if it can
it could maybe talk to the people who do
make those orders for cares to Samsung's
of Huawei is eet EEZ
I don't see anyone going like really
jumping at this saying this is the way
I'm going to differentiate I'm going to
get a blackberry 10 device out there I
want a manufacturer one I don't see
anyone really wanting to do that
anything I've seen from blackberry 10
doesn't impress me enough beyond windows
phone or android which have become more
the de facto choice yeah i agree i think
the only opportunity that that they have
here is for an oem to get fed up with
google shenanigans or Microsoft
shenanigans enough to say you know we
the the only way we can do this only way
we can continue to make phones the way
we want to make them is to go a
different direction that has a chance of
surviving and they might be led to
believe that the only way to do that is
to license something that has a name
brand and is already built and exists
and it kind of does everything that
needs to do is an operating system and
of course that would be blackberry 10
the other hand the other option would be
open webOS I guess but it's not not
showing any signs of doing anything
interesting in all about the time is
cute yes right Tizen which is what the
fourth or fifth transformation of that
platform skirted as Moblin right moblin
and then me go and my mo and all this
jazz so yeah I mean that's the only
thing that I could I can think I don't
know who that would I don't know if that
would be a ZTE or a huawei or what I
don't know it would be nobody Chris and
it is there's so much so much wishful
thinking / conditional circumstances
that you need in order for somebody to
even give a damn about licensing
blackberry 10 it's it's silly yeah when
you're saying that the people Waterloo
arraylists my interpretation of that is
basically that they're leaving town
because that that's the only thing a
realist can do in the circumstances that
room is in and when you said we can't
judge thorsten heins the CEO I
completely agree and I think we'll ever
be able to judge him because as far as
I'm concerned he's stuck in this sea
Quinn's like it if you think of the CEOs
job as a game of chess he's stuck in the
sequence where he's basically being
repeatedly and very slowly very
methodically being taken apart and he's
trying to do the right move but there's
only one right move which is always the
wrong way so the best he can do is you
know make the least wrong move in these
circumstances I don't even know what
that is anymore I don't end yeah okay
there's only two circumstances in which
blackberry 10 licensing would ever be a
significant thing in the mobile market
one is if blackberry 10 is amazing and
actually compels people to go and use it
which would be such as such a high
standard because everybody who's taken
up windows phone has clashed with the
fact it doesn't have an app ecosystem
and it is the reason why people are
sticking with Android as long and as
much as they are because it has a
built-in ecosystem and you know people
will dance to Google's tuned because so
much is kind of given to them and so
much is there already in the software so
I mean even if your profit margin is a
huge would Android at least the things
that your consumers seek are there
blackberry 10 you are extremely likely
to have the full set of basic always
functionality to start with if we use
the blackberry playbook as an example I
think it's a very instructive example
but even if you did the apple ecosystem
will never be there from day one so the
idea that bb10 will be so compelling
that guy's exits you be thinking yes we
license this we get ahead of the curve
get ahead of everybody else i I just
find I Xtreme Ian like yeah asleep let
me let me just play real quick let me
play devil's advocate with you here
because I think that's exactly what
black or what room is trying to do this
year with the blackberry jam events and
by delaying the platform into q1 2013 is
they're trying to make sure that they
don't have another playbook on their
hands they want to come out of the gate
a with with excited and ready developers
and be with a functionally complete
platform
okay but excited and ready developers
I'm not an ecosystem there um you know
to put it bluntly they're like the sperm
before the ecosystem they had the seeds
of one right but then I write an
ecosystem in existence so nobody's going
to license bb10 in q1 2013 if that was
licensing it then how long is this game
that pulls the high since playing
because I I mean his plans seem to
actually extend beyond the point at
which rim needs to essentially sell out
or go bankrupt like that's that's kind
of the way that it seems to be you know
going back to the old joke that somebody
made in our comments it was rumors
postpone the release a blackberry 10
until afterwards shut down and go
bankrupt and gone out of business yeah
which is a really neat way of summing it
up but yet the second scenario that I
think you alluded to chris is this idea
that people feel I guess oppressed by
google in the Android ecosystem
oppressed by the fact they can't
generate profits which you know LG can't
but then LG has its other issues that
are not just relates to Android and then
maybe people don't feel like Windows
Phone is competitive enough and then out
of the spiration they go and jump to
branded alternative I just don't see
that desperation happening within the
next how many months until q1 2013 what
seven eight months I just don't see that
happening that quickly yeah yeah thnkx
arias just free there in the proverbial
her locker you know what they really
need there's there's a lot of money to
be made here in inventing some sort of
supercomputer the scale of which has
never before been seen in the super
computing industry where torsten hines
can sit down at a terminal and simulate
in in their entirety every possible
scenario um we're like you know if we
sell then here's what happens if we if
we don't sell here's what happens right
down to like simulating individual
consumers everywhere around the
world and what they buy and why they buy
it someone's got to come up with this up
or maybe it already exists and I just
don't know anything about it because I'm
not a businessman but someone needs to
do that software we are being told uh
dear listeners by our by our production
team that our window to broadcast is
closing rapidly so we we are going to
have to pick and choose from our
remaining topics and it's probably just
as well because it's kind of slim
pickins this week should we talk very
very quickly in like one minute about
the tmobile mytouch because David Pierce
who has been a guest on this program
before reviewed these devices and they
are from Huawei and Vlad I know that
you're a huge Huawei fan and and rocks I
think you are normal actually oh yeah
yeah Ross actually little-known fact
about Ross Ross if you go into his home
he has a collection of every Huawei
device ever released in the US plus a
selection of a few European and Asian
Huawei devices this is a so little known
that i didn't even know myself Wow like
uh okay self-realization here so here's
the thing it we don't need to talk too
much about these because I already
played with them before we talked about
him on the show that they're they're
very mid-range low-end mid-range and I
feel like t-mobile has been pushing the
mytouch line lower and lower and lower
with each subsequent generation of
device they are very heavily carrier
branded because t-mobile is the owner of
the mytouch brand this isn't like a
global range for them this is a bespoke
device or set of devices from Huawei
that they made specifically for t-mobile
and I think that David sums it up very
nicely these could have been say six and
a half to seven scoring devices on one
condition if they ran Android 4 4.1 out
of the gate the fact that they are
launching in August of 2012 with android
2.3 is it's not even ridiculous anymore
it's just that they're there isn't a
word in the English language to describe
this travesty I don't want to bad-mouth
David but I think we did score these a
little too high like at 6.6 for a phone
that I can't possibly recommend to
anybody and
any given moment is a little a little
tune nice is too forgiving it's
definitely Huawei fanboyism at its
finest so with linux boy recording time
and we're discussing gingerbread phones
I new outrage okay Vlad you you lead the
way tell me what you want to talk about
yeah what's next on the like it was it
sister talking about my outrage um Aaron
from our European see from our UK team
wrote he wrote this is my next article
which you know on our website is an
homage for a device which we or well one
particular member of our staff it was
particularly passionate about and tends
to purchase as his or her next gadget
device machine a significant dollar they
do talk about this the the latest deep
dark desire from the world technology is
this my next description Aaron took deep
and dark way way too serious yes that's
yeah that's a good way putting it uh I
mean Neil I put it as this is the
craziest thing we have ever published
and he's probably accurate in that
respect and the subject of errands
desires and passions was actually the
nokia 808 you which suffered i Ross
mentioned before the photo show today
was does iron actually know that his
fingers the phone as opposed to camera
well that's the thing right like we've
said before that if Nokia had stripped
this of its gsm radio and positioned it
as a novelty like you know really cool
point-and-shoot camera with like a giant
touchscreen display on the back they
probably could have could have sold it
in a completely different way for less
money and it may have been moderately
successful I don't know but now because
it's a it's there you know it's a
symbian phone that completely changes
the the landscape of how you sell this
device and the kinds of people who are
gonna buy it which is nobody hey come on
now all right Aaron yes there's an
excuse me I mean if you have spent as
much money on a cutting-edge camera why
not get the lytro I mean it just
if is he if he's using this as a phone I
haven't I haven't stomached to get
through pass like graph five flower tea
doing over there across the pond even
you train this man yeah this is an
extension of you I hope you realize and
and I'm also the guy who introduced into
the 808 PureView so this is really just
the my influence playing havoc on to the
world but I think to defend arrows point
which I yeah but to defend this point is
a local colleague he does make the point
that being on the cutting edge of
technology is rarely a comfortable
experience right so so he's as far as
he's concerned the compromises of
symbian and the compromises of losing
essentially losing smart phone
functionality were using the 808
PureView okay stop laughing Ross come on
now and you know he's never said that he
wants this to be his only phone right to
him this is the perfect secondary phone
which you might um but you might you
might be able to sympathize with because
if your secondary phone is just
something you many phone calls with and
in this particular case is something
that you specifically for photos it can
work I mean the thing that I know for a
fact is that it pretty kind of blows to
have this with a purple foam because
it's bulky and heavy and carry two
phones around is a pain in every side um
so personally I just I just feel he's
wrong but I mean he has a point he's
wrong but he has a point to some degree
I mean I can see you know it's empathy
right where you don't agree but you can
kind of see where persons coming from
well I mean we can we can revisit this
once per voi peer review actually comes
to a windows phone ya voy there you go
this is what we called the DHD phone I
would love to own a phone call p oh boy
pure boy your boy your boy yeah it
sounds classy k it sounds kind of like
savoy or something
but in an ozone word you just can't eat
it you know how people make things sound
frenched make me sound classy well
that's it ah i see everyone first I at
first a walk drove wha at first I
superiors Boyd a voi d pure void and and
there are many different ways that you
could take that i was thinking like you
know and this is this is going to be a
little disgusting but you know like when
you drink way too much water that's like
a pure void you know I'm talking about
like it's just you know I do Chris Agee
I think everybody got it we should just
move on okay uh we should we should talk
about exactly one more topic before
Creighton kills us and I think that
should be your dead trigger interview
personally okay okay Oh before was he
before with you I wanna repeat the
shoutout formerly run for Brian because
he's killing it with the Apple window
yes I'm covered he really is I i know i
work at the verge which makes me
inherently biased and I oh I'm sorry not
inherently biased apparently bias I
should not be trusted but seriously like
I come to the side and I see how much
firsthand reporting we have from the
Apple and Samsung lawsuit and I am just
in priced bike and it is most of it is
done by Brian who's killing it and but
but that's not to say that he's my
favorite news manager nathan which mike
asleep i actually want to say not just
Brian I say Brian sigh great support
support staff neil has been helping out
a ton madakari is our another resident
legal expert we have who can't be there
at the trial person he's actually very
depressed about that cries himself to
sleep at night thinking about reports
and all that but matt is helping from a
distance as much as he can Neil eyes
chiming in a bunch of you know a dozen
other writers on staff have done
everything they can to help Brian it's
been a huge collaborative effort
obviously brian has been killing it in
every single way possible I interests a
fascinating it's a fascinating case to
watch and clearly the judge hates both
sides so so I love
this is part that I love that the judges
just so finds the whole thing so
repugnant like Apple and Samsung gettin
into nitty gritty and trying to argue
this really woolly you know well it
looks like this therefore such and such
such and such and the judge is just like
ah you guys disgust me go away yeah I
love those reactions I love this little
ablas it's a it's a wild case and like
literally every single day that the case
has been progressing there have been a
really insane revelations that have come
out of it or really insane rulings from
the judge and I a feeling thats can
continue for the entire duration of the
trial so we have um we have one of our
very special story streams may have
heard of them devoted to this case and
all of the news it's coming out of that
case is getting attached the story
stream will post link to on the site
attached to the podcast post that you
can get right to that stream and stay
tuned last week I'm sure on the verge
cast Brian will make another cameos
we're hoping he will every week and then
some to talk about row yes we need we
need some more West Coast buddies in
west coast accents uh to you know
diversify a video this this brian i'm
trying to think I don't think Brian or
Scott or certainly not dieter since he's
not from the west coast but those guys
don't really have quote-unquote west
coast accents do they do they maybe they
do I don't know um we're talking about
this a little early on when when we're
saying about mispronouncing things
because you never actually hear people
say them you just read things you just
respect me engaged in rhythm yeah I
don't actually know many people from the
verge I just see text from them sir
brave new world man did use the world
but yeah okay let's let's discuss dead
trigger and this whole hype /
controversy / whatever is developed
around it so mething games the guys who
make dead trigger shadowgun and some
samurai to some of the more popular by
war games I spoke with their CEO Mara
grab-ass and we just discussed the whole
thing we're dead forget I should go in
to free to pay free to pay yeah like
that friends play monetization model he
used to be a paid app it used to be 99
cents both on iOS and Android is
switched to a free-to-play model and one
is switched on Android the word from
matt finger was that there's an
unbelievably high rates of piracy on
android when it made the same switch on
iOS there wasn't the same outburst which
I think struck a lot of people as kind
of disingenuous because they didn't you
know you know they didn't have the same
outpost by iOS but but in any case what
I did was exchanged a few emails with
him what a conversation about that and
he provided me with some stats behind
what were they were saying so on Android
the piracy rate is apparently eighty
percent so eighty percent of players of
dead trigger were playing unlicensed
copies and their basic apparently sales
data versus analytics data which might
not be perfect but it gives you kind of
a rough idea and on iOS is sixty percent
and in general the point from him is
that it's it's an unsatisfactory
situation for people and they kind of
forced into the hole let's make it free
to play let's make that's essentially
nickel and dime people and just try and
make make our money by selling tiny
little things in the game which to me is
kind of annoying i am much preferred to
pay for the game up front and then just
enjoy it and use it and not have to pay
real money again for small parts in it I
know how you feel Chris no I totally
agree and I also want to point out that
I was shocked when when he came out with
the thigh OS piracy rate I you know I
assumed it would be like single digits
or something but it's it's nearly as
outrageous as then
right number it's like what are these
people like I you know I I get that that
people don't like to pay for stuff I get
it but he lose sight of the fact there
are real people doing real work to bring
these games to the market and it's very
easy to obscure that when you're looking
at the at the android market google play
market so is a little just disheartening
but he did kind of he he was
surprisingly upbeat i would say once you
I mean I he's generated a lot of press
from this I'm sure it's helping his
download rates and yeah yeah he's
free-to-play model quite a bit to have
it in the news yeah yeah just just to
clarify the CEOs name is Merrick rabbits
grab-ass 8r a bass crab basket oh okay
go I got it okay listen dude is late I
am tired and I haven't had a drink in a
while okay I drink of water obviously a
water yes so my lip service parched all
right um well actually I asked him about
that about whether this was essentially
a ploy for publicity and the thing that
he said was that um enemy again you
kinda have to take him at his word here
is that the company wasn't actually so
happy about all the hype that came out
of it they were asked why you reducing
the price to free they said what will
you know they gave a blunt response they
said wow it's really high Paris away and
honestly I have to agree with that if
eighty percent if that figure is the jit
summer of players of a 99-cent game are
playing unlicensed copies then something
is really wrong there let's just but
beyond their sorry go ahead gross no no
cuz I mean I'll get off at tanger I
finish your thought I'm sorry okay but
beyond that what I'm what a girl from
him was that they actually had to spend
a whole bunch of time answering
questions from guys such as myself and
they had to dedicate a whole bunch of
time repeating the same houses over and
over again talking to people as opposed
to you know using that time to produce
plan etc do whatever game studios do so
you know for them it was a
it was a big time sink even if it
increased you know publicity a little is
temporarily um so I kind of see that
perspective but you're going to launch
it on Tangier us that's how much
attention I you know I I'm happy that he
actually got back to you and kind of
explain the kind of methodology of
coming to that figure still sixty
percent seems really high I was trying
to find I couldn't find a good number
for Lee cyanogenmod downloads even get a
feel for how big that is versus the
entire iOS field it's interesting too is
shadowgun and you know samurai to and
dead trigger is that market just so tied
and connected to the jailbreak audience
I find it surprising however to disagree
with both you on the business model
section I'm actually really happy about
free to play I think it's actually quite
an interesting model and I'm curious to
see kind of how it goes you're offering
something for free getting people into
it giving you some free experience it's
actually really high quality and then
kind of adding on to of course the
question is what you do beyond that
we've seen this kind of happen for a
long time Xbox Live has mandated demos
for all its big releases so you have a
somewhat free-to-play model there where
you're getting a demo experience and you
play you pay for the full game and
you're seeing lot of people experiment
with obviously more disingenuous
sometimes even more genuine ideas
depending on how it affects the gameplay
specifically single versus multiplayer I
am off I'm all honestly for trying out
this new business model that helps them
great for them what is your specific
concern with a free-to-play business
model in this case let me give you a
very specific example this has nothing
to do with dead trigger but I want to
give you a very specific example of
where free to play is uh is super
annoying for freemium I guess would be
the correct term here Triple Town Triple
Town is the most annoying freemium model
in history the and you know I mean like
you're gonna end up paying because like
they you know they it's brilliant it's
both brilliant and extremely annoying
because you get a certain number of like
moves and then you run out of moves and
you can't make any more moves unless you
pay or you can wait summer
Achilles amount of time to get a new
move and actually I think a lot of those
turn based games work the same way but
it's it's super annoying in electric
because you terrible you want to make
you want to make like 10,000 moves every
time you play and you can only make like
50 and then you have to pay like you
know a dollar 400 moves or something
right now that's that is insane and
unfair I don't there's I like that model
at all but there are other things you
can do like you can value I think team
fortress 2 valve is of course an
exception because they've made millions
and billions of dollars you know pretty
much just kind of doing what the one
they have a loyal fan base there are
ways of making it work I think they're
still experimenting that is a great
example of a terrible way of making
something free to play yeah I would with
done with you I'd much rather just pay
ten dollars and just have unlimited
moods for a game that I played Triple
Town I'm with you on this is a big waste
of time but I can't stop playing yeah
well just to make that distinction as
well because Merrick was really keen to
make it between the idea freemium where
you do have to pay to continue and
free-to-play like as far as he's
concerned there are two very distinct
things because free-to-play game is one
that you can complete without ever need
to make any extra purchases plus a
freemium one where you fundamentally
can't get to the end of the game without
making extra purchases now a lot of
people will say this and a lot of people
in comments have said this dead trigger
is more a freemium game than its
free-to-play you basically have to go
into the store spend some real money in
order to get a gun which will get you
through the game in some reasonable
amount of time as opposed to commit in
your entire life to grind it through it
just you know why that's separate point
but the other thing and then the thing
that actually bothers me more is that ok
if you pirate the 99 cent game which
relies on in-game purchases to begin
with you're not really going to disturb
the equilibrium too much it I mean we
know where the money's coming for for
that game but if you're doing that two
games which cost five dollars eight
dollars ten dollars right things like
shadowgun every lease
then you're kind of undermining the
entire market for games of that cause
right because in order to I mean this
isn't just games this is applications as
well I mean the reason apps of riding as
much as they are on Mac on the desktop
is because people are buying them right
and and small kind of tailor-made apps
the exactly the apps that you lack on
windows I mean if you get one of those
apps on windows it gets pirated so
quickly everybody knows is pirated and
available so quickly that nobody bothers
to pay for it nobody but us to go and
invest have a much cash in it whereas on
Mac most people have him pay for and
then you kind of get this culture and
you also get you know you also get the
history of people making their money
back when they invest in developing you
know more sophisticated high quality
applications and games which again
encourages further investment in the
same thing and that's not going to
happen if we're going to you know pirate
the crap out of these games right breast
thing that bothers me I think the ideas
that you can't stop piracy but you can
incentivize purchasing in some way
however I guess to you know to the point
of mad fingers now that if you're going
to pirate the game you can only get so
far you have to pay for them at some
point of course someone will find a
workaround for that too but it's another
level of a annoyance to the point of
users say screw it i'm going to give you
a dollar because it's really not a big
deal yeah i mean doesn't doesn't thing
we would just we started off this
podcast last show talking about the HD
super folk and we started off with me
excited because it has so much potential
by given when he comes out that's what
we'll be talking about we're talking
about the potential of at 8p display and
a crazy processor and LTE and all of
those things and we'll be like well
actually were the games where are the
things that make use of the Audrina 320
graphics and they won't be there and it
exists my right and my feeling and it
is guilty feeling for my perspective as
well because I don't make much of a
habit of spending in app stores I don't
make much of a habit of pirating but I
does I just don't like spending a nap so
is precisely because when you spend the
two amounts you never realize how much
you're spending our to you end up
spending tons so I tried to refrain from
that but the guilty sense that I get is
because I'm not doing that i'm not
encouraging the things that i want to
see well I think there's also a more
fundamental problem with the Android
Marketplace google play and i'm not
trying to hate on too much i could just
be snarky and say well you can always
get infinity blade to for your HTC
device because there's a bootleg version
of that now available there is oh there
was I don't they don't really took it
down it was a breaking news rustled the
hell no it's ice never i work with vlad
for a long time i've never heard him get
that spontaneously excited about
anything I know it's actually quite a
thing of beauty i knows that there's
that fake thing what the point is um I
don't trust the google play store i have
an inherent distrust of a store that's
not vetted properly wear a fake infinity
blade to can just be put on there for
many many hours oh the fake one right
yeah the fake one sorry it's not not
actually real but that's my point that
was like there is so much I don't know
if you see malware I'm sure there's a
lot of malware in the google play store
it's just not vetted that much there's a
level just trust among the consumer I
don't want to give money to these people
unless they're very very trusted and
sifting through that it's still a pain
the you know so still painful thing to
do even when there's editors choice and
there's trusted developers or whatever
you want to do to differentiate I hate
to give Apple credit for this but the
closed gate system of the marketplace
really does stand out and if Google Play
if Google wanted to marketplaces one I
can trust and one that's just everything
I think I might learn to trust it a
little more in that sense for now that
extra freedom has led to a level oh I'm
not sure if I want to pay it's been i'm
going to download it just means you're
not going to get as much of my money and
I'm not gonna have as much of a trust
level with paying for anything much to
vlad's point one thing that really
helped was when they used to have the
24-hour a return period which yeah
I think that they they came to the
conclusion that that was inhibiting like
developers really hated that because it
made it too easy to develop buyer's
remorse over the course of a day and
return the app so they reduce that
window to 15 minutes which is barely
long enough to download and install the
app much less test it out and decide
whether it actually is any good so even
if that were like an hour or two that
would I think make a big difference and
kind of instill some confidence well is
that it really teach people that's an
option on how to do it it would even
when it was a 24 hour period it wasn't
always the most obvious way of getting
that and what you know getting to the
right turn right no I I do feel like
demo versions of any sort of software I
just kind of inherently necessary and
useful and helpful and anybody who's you
know pissing and moaning about they're
not paying the upfront price because
they think is too high but then you're
not offering a demo version you're kind
of on the money you're on argument
because I always feel if I'm a software
developer right I can give people with
demonstration I can give them an idea of
my software and then hope that they
would find it useful enough to use long
term and pay the full price for okay I
always kind of prefer I mean this is a
personal preference but I prefer to just
pay how much things cost I personally
hate the the American thing with tipping
because it's such a precise science and
you're supposed to pause the subjective
judgments about people's performance and
the other guy the other whereas I'd much
rather say okay just charge me however
much you cost you to produce this food
host these facilities hire these people
etc etc and that would be there why do I
have to tip why do I always have to get
so granular with the payments and the
money and all of this mess it's
beautiful dream beautiful dream he's
dreaming by Davis Rio is called Europe
hahaha the American Dream is real it's
called Europe that's a notable right
there tanishaa we we should we should
wrap this thing seriously it's retired
it's for every time it's uh we're on the
hour we precise and now I'm rambling so
break it up the decision but whatever
okay so good i just want to mention a
couple of quick news tidbits before we
do run away microsoft was renamed the
windows phone marketplace windows phone
store so be excited uh fewer syllables
