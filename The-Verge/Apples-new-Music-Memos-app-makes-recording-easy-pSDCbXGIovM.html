verge and today we're taking a look at a
brand new app from Apple it's called
music memos and the best way to think
about it is it slots in between voice
memos and GarageBand so voice memos is
that app that you open up just to get an
idea down just to record something
whereas GarageBand is what you use to
polish a song and finish it this one
kind of is to go between those and it's
free and it's for your iPhone or iPad
and you can download it starting today
so let's take a look so this is music
memos right here and as you can see it's
got a dead simple interface you push
record and that starts recording and so
you start playing the melody or a song
idea or anything like that and you'll
see the waveform down beneath so once
you're done your song is going to show
up here at the bottom and so the app is
going to break up your recording into
measures and it's also going to show you
the chords that you play that's all done
automatically by Apple and so if you
want to add bass or drums to your
recording you can just do both of those
with that app and the app chooses the
beat and how they sound you have some
control over that kind of thing but the
goal here is really ease of use so you
just record something tap those buttons
and you get a pretty usable drum beat so
there's not a lot to the app here
besides this main screen but if you tap
up in the top right over here there's a
built-in tuner so if you have no other
tuner besid or nearby the app has one
built-in so you just open it right up
start playing so the tuner is pretty
accurate but I still prefer some of the
ones you can download from the app store
but if you have nothing else no other
options this is a pretty convenient tool
so once you're finished with a song you
can send it to GarageBand for a bit more
polish or you can upload it to
SoundCloud so the choice is yours and so
that's pretty much all there is to see
about music memos it's very simple so if
you don't want garage bands power if
it's too complicated for you then this
is a nice step down it's not quite as
dead simple as voice memos but it's got
a few nice things for musicians like a
tuner chord recognition and things like
that there are a ton of apps like this
in the app store but this one is free
and it's made by Apple so you can assume
a lot of people are going to be using it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
