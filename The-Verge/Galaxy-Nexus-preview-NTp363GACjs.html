the Samsung Galaxy Nexus this is the
first Android Ice Cream Sandwich device
and we're just going to give you a quick
tool run device firstly ups up here at
the top bunch of sensors from facing
camera power button on the side of dock
connector 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
microphone micro USB port quite
interesting for placement for the three
and a half minutes headphone jack there
you go
volume rocker here on the side clean on
the top as you can see from the side
it's a very thin device it has this
contour screen I think Samsung calls it
it's very slightly concave it's very
good at economics in terms of the way
that it fits in the hands but those fits
very nicely around your face because of
that curvature coming around to the back
you have this very thin and very
lightweight cover and a textured finish
it's very soft and also pretty good to
grip yeah they tell us it's very durable
as well yes sir you can actually fit it
too well in this particular device and
there's a little bump here and that'll
speaker the bottom five minutes of
camera LED flash underneath it and just
come back to the front you can see these
are the new Android menu keys they're no
longer passive as you would with most as
you would see with most Android phones
back home and recent apps the recent
apps is an overview of literally of
reason absence of multitasking launcher
essentially you can dismiss apps like so
and this is consistent across a bunch of
the applications for for example if we
go into the apps list here going to jump
to Gmail so you're looking at one in you
know if you're on and look at the
previous email you just swipe to the
side or to receipt for Android Market
etc etc so this is how you navigate
between Evo's now in Gmail you know it's
a really nice new feature you have the
notifications also updated
but in here there's also an LED status
light up down here is hidden but turns
on it's right here if you want to
dismiss the notification you swap it off
to the side have five home screens over
here you can add widgets in a fashion
not dissimilar to the weather they added
a honeycomb Israeli myself you can
resize them long press to relocate let's
reset so the Canon the results of an
interesting new application there's a
meeting here but you can pinch to zoom
so essentially this affects how many
lines of text you see on each meeting
right so you've got a ton of meetings
you can put them out on one page yeah
pretty nice very nice I have a lot of
meetings yeah why don't we go to the
show the same show the camera as well
just quick snaps yeah so coming into the
camera application Samsung Google
describes is a zero shutter lag device
it's pretty pretty true actually
superfast
some of them come out blurry because
you're taking them really quickly but I
was playing around with it before and
like one out of five or we're really
good shots yeah and this is the new
quick sharing feature so any application
that can tap into the Google API can do
this so you got the castle here Google+
Gmail etc you can tweet immediately
services with the Casa so they count
their you upload happen we just upload
that to that guys again oh that's fine
he won't mind and while you're actually
in this application interestingly the
menu keys are gone but then you have
these little grey hints where you find
the Menu key so you just tap and it show
up yeah you can take the panorama from
there as well
yeah panorama feature is up so there you
go this is our first look it's a Samsung
Galaxy Nexus</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
