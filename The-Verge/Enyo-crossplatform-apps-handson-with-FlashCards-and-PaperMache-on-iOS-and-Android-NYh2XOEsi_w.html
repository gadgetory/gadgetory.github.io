HP has just announced that its enyo or
webos apps will now work on other
platforms and the first example of that
is this paper mache app i just
downloaded it from the market so clearly
they were prepared for this announcement
and as you can see here it looks a lot
like a touch pad or a pre app you get
these pains here which were classic
webOS styling and you'll just notice
that performance is pretty sluggish
though it is a really nice app and one
of the nights are apps have actually
seen running on Android so a lot of
potential here but just clearly a lot of
work that needs to be done on the
optimization on the platform so the
other app that came out today there is
one for the iPad but this one is called
flash cards to go and it's actually
running in Safari they also came out
with a chrome web app so lots of
different options for this one and the
performance here is actually a little
bit better but this one is basically you
create these flash cards or you can
actually jump into flash cards that were
already made and swipe through them so
performance here is definitely a lot
better than the paper mache one and let
me also jump back and show you that you
also get those pain stylings here so
overall some nice beginnings of bringing
webOS apps to other platforms clearly
seeing some of the performance issues
but definitely step in the right
direction</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
