the processors in our laptops whether
we're playing games running Photoshop or
just browsing the web and a dozen
different sites while listening to music
and chatting with their friends we want
to do everything we want to do it all at
once and we don't want to do it we're
looking for power that's why a lot of
people have turned to tablets and
smartphones lately the ARM chips and
those devices last forever they let us
do a lot of things but Intel is catching
up with a new breed of processors and
latest laptops that offer all-day
battery life with the same kind of
performance you can expect from the last
generation and a fruity finish I think
you'll find a light phone the new
version of Intel's chips the core i5s
and i7 so probably fund inside your
laptop are called as well the name
doesn't mean anything but the
implications are huge Intel's promising
major performance increases better
graphics performance for gaming and
watching movies and most of all better
battery life much much better battery
life there's a lot of complex
engineering behind it but the short
version is that the power system the
chip is now better integrated which lets
Haswell chips ramp up and cool down much
more quickly there are many different
Haswell chips each with a different
flavor profile and character that
enhances different activities in
different ways
there's the ultra low power y series
chip and then there's a high-end
graphics chips the Irish card sort of
let you play games on an ultrabook
that's never even been close to possible
before but here's that all means
manufacturers can now build thinner
laptops and tablets than ever before
because they don't need to put in as
much battery to get four hours of
battery life they can also build much
more powerful machines than ever before
because the graphics performance is so
much better or they can do what we're
already seeing a lot of drop the new
chips into existing models and just
watch battery life shoot through the
roof which brings us to the new 13-inch
MacBook Air
last year's model was already the best
all-around laptop on the market thanks
to good hardware a great keyboard and
trackpad in solid performance this
year's model changes almost nothing at
least on the outside there are stereo
mics on the side instead of just a
single mono mic that's literally it
on the inside though this has well we
tested a 1.3 gigahertz core i5 one which
came with a very slight performance
decrease over last year's 1.8 gigahertz
model but I didn't really notice the
difference the story here is the battery
life the new air lasted 13 hours and 29
minutes in our tests more than double
last year's model and well above what
intel says has well should offer 13
hours and 29 minutes is enough battery
life to completely change things this is
the first laptop we've ever seen that
can legitimately claim the last you all
day the new air is cheaper than last
year's models starting at just 1099 and
it's still the best all-around laptop on
the market but it's also the first to
the dramatically new breed of computer
and it means that Intel can finally
offer the ability for us to do anything
we want on our laptops and do it all day
long sometimes the best does get better
with age
