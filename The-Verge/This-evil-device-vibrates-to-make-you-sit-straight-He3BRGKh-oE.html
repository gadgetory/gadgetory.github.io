verge today we are talking about the
LUMO left the LUMO left is a device that
corrects your posture it comes with a
magnet that you can use to clip it under
your shirt and it comes with a silver
magnet and a black magnet and also a bra
clasp if you want to use that the way it
works is you clip the LUMO lift under
your shirt right underneath your
collarbone you clip it with the with the
magnet and basically then you have to
tap it twice to that the preferred
posture that you want to have while you
sit at your computer basically if you
change your posture or you slouch the
LUMO lift is going to vibrate and you
can control how long you slouch before
the device vibrates and the LUMO left
are suggest that you set it with a
two-minute delay unfortunately you can
change how intense the vibration is so
it can get annoying if you set it at 15
seconds like I did to control of this
you can use the LUMO lift app which
basically allows you to set goals keep
track of your good posture hours and
also count your steps unfortunately
there's not much that you can do with
the LUMO lift app other than setting up
the device or keeping track of your good
posture now after using the new lift for
a few days I didn't enjoy my experience
with it that much and the reason is that
I never said at the computer in one
position I fold my legs on my chair I go
to the bathroom and the LUMO lift things
that slouching and keeps vibrating so it
got a bit intense but even if I didn't
like it
it did make me more aware of my posture
so it could be good for correcting your
posture if you sit in front of
computer all day for your work the LUMO
lift has been around for a couple of
years and it's available online for $80
