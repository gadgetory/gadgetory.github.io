checking out mailbox the highly
anticipated new Gmail app for iPhone
launching for free on the App Store
today
when you first open mailbox you'll
immediately see your inbox you have
message previews subjects in bold the
first thing you're gonna want to look at
is an actual conversation and all
conversations all messages you've
previously read are going to be grayed
out and minimized into just little
snippets which makes it super easy to go
through all your messages if you want to
blow on up and see the whole thing you
can tap on it if you want to see the
complete email which includes all this
garbage that mailbox strips out you can
tap it one more time what you can do
from here is you can star an email right
here you can add this email to one of
your labels you can set this for later
go back to your inbox archive it or
delete it so let's respond to this email
really quick and you can kind of see the
interface it's really small minimalist
and nice it's kind of like a text
message you can change who you want to
send me send the message to it's really
easy to add a photo just like an you
kind of do on Twitter for iPhone you
just pop something right in there and it
works really nicely so let's back back
up to the inbox and have a look at how
you address messages so you have a few
options for addressing a message the
first thing you can do is archive
something by dragging it this way if you
keep dragging you can delete it if you
swipe this way you can set something for
later and if you keep going further you
can mark it as a label so it's a really
easy way to address something on the fly
so let's go to the bread-and-butter this
app which is marked something for later
so you can mark this as later today this
evening tomorrow this weekend next week
in a month someday and you can even pick
a date and the cool thing is with these
snoozes mailbox handle these on their
servers so if you're using a desktop
email client or desktop Gmail those
messages will pop back into that account
at the same time if you look at the top
of the screen you have the things you've
marked to do later so let's say we mark
this for this weekend and you hop up
there you can actually see
chronologically when these things are
going to pop back in your inbox let's
have this one be for a month and this
one for some day
you hop back in there and boom it's
chronologically organized which is
really nice and if you go to archived up
here you can bounce something right back
in your inbox if you want to just by
doing that so let's open the drawer and
see what's going on over there
this is your mailbox error you can
choose your separate inboxes for
different accounts if you want to look
at them independently you can also see
once again your later menu your labels
archive and trash and scent which are
consolidated among all your accounts
which some people won't like but I
personally don't mind and then you also
have the Settings menu where you can
happen add email account so you can add
up to 5 Gmail accounts right now you can
pick a default account you can add a
signature you can alter your labels
which are called lists here and snoozes
is the real cool thing here so if you
tap snoozes here you can actually modify
when emails are popped back into your
inbox so let's say you mark something to
pop back this weekend you can say well
when do I want my weekend to start or
when do I want my workday to start you
could even have later today or some day
which you can modify if you go even
further down you'll be happy to note
that there are push notifications unlike
Sparrow for both new messages and force
news messages if you want to treat
mailbox like a to-do list it also helps
if you want to use the to-do list kind
of paradigm for using this app you can
also have a badge represent how many new
things you have in your inbox there's a
lot to love about mailbox but Gmail
power users will miss a few things like
the ability to mark a few emails at the
same time the ability to mute something
which is a great Gmail feature and we
also miss the ability to look at one
main starred menu of items and also
there's no mark as spam or consolidated
spam area inside mailbox but we'd expect
that to come sometime soon well I can
download mailbox today the company has a
wait list you can see inside the app
that shows what place you hold in line
it's annoying but guarantees the launch
goes smoothly for company servers after
testing mailbox for the last two months
I can honestly say it's helped increase
my productivity even without Mac iPad
and Android app which the company says
are in the works mailbox for iPhone
really turns email into a more
conversational and more useful
experience
