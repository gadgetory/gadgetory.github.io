quite some time and now they officially
have one make that to Apple today
revealed two new larger iPhones the 4.7
inch iPhone 6 and the massive 5.5 inch
iPhone 6 plus the iPhone 6 measures six
point nine millimeters thick making it
the thinnest device Apple has ever made
and the iPhone 6 plus clocks in at 7.1
millimeters thick that's still thinner
than last year's iPhone 5s both phones
featured a newly designed glass front
that curves around the sides an apple
says the new screen has retina HD
resolution under the hood the phones

faster graphics compared to the original
iPhone the new processor in the iPhone 6
and 6 plus is 84 times faster the phones

built-in barometer which allows the
phone to tell the difference between
running and cycling as well as
accurately measures distance traveled in
elevation the company also made major
improvements to its cameras the iPhone 6
has an 8 megapixel camera like the last
model but Apple added a quote next
generation eyesight sensor which is said
to make the autofocus twice as fast as
the 5s the iPhone 6 plus has an even
greater camera though featuring
significantly improved optical image
stabilization this means that the lens
can physically move to compensate for
the movement of your hands the iPhone 6
plus won't be the first smartphone to
feature optical image stabilization but

phones the smart phones can shoot 1080p
video in 30 or 60 frames per second and
