I'm at pebbles offices taking a look at
the company's first non SmartWatch
product this is called the core and it's
aimed at runners let's take a look so
here's the pebble core and the idea
behind it is that it has GPS so that
runners don't have to take their phones
with them or wear a GPS enabled
wristwatch in order to have GPS when
they're running originally pebble had
toyed with the idea of doing smart
straps things that would have GPS in
them that you would add to your existing
wristwatch but that added a lot of bulk
to the experience they found out so they
decided to make a completely separate
product that you would clip onto you and
would give you all the things you could
possibly need while you're running so in
addition to GPS it also has a 3G modem
so if you had to make an emergency phone
call or send a text you would press this
button and it would be programmed to
call whoever you wanted to call it also
has Wi-Fi it has Bluetooth so you can
either plug your headphones in or you
can use bluetooth headphones
it also has Spotify built into it so
Pebbles does it work directly with
Spotify so that you can go into the
pebble app you can choose your Spotify
playlist for running it would catch on
this device and you'd have it with you
when you go running kind of reminds me
of a bigger iPod shuffle of one with
this magnetic clip here another
interesting thing worth noting about the
core is that it's actually running on
Google Android so pebble says it's not
only meant for runners who want a GPS
device but also for hackers and they
imagine that some hackers will have a
little bit of fun with this little
keychain computer if you want to call it
that the core also works with a wireless
charging pod we don't have the pod with
us right now but idea being that you
would just come home throw it on the
wireless charging pod and it start to
charge and it's expected to get about
nine hours of battery life with
continuous use the core goes on sale on
Kickstarter today for $69 Hevel says it
expects it to ship sometime later this
year possibly early 2017</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
