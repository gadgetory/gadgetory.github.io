we're doing right now is getting a demo
of hololens and a new way of making
video with hololens let me back up a
little bit
Microsoft's mixed reality headset
hololens first started shipping last
spring now unlike virtual reality
headsets which put you in a completely
virtual environment hololens layers
digital elements over the real world
around you but unless you're the person
who's actually wearing the headset it's
hard to describe what it is you're
seeing in front of you until now
Microsoft has just put out a kind of
toolkit that makes it easier to share
your hololens video the set up still has
a lot of requirements but it's at least
one way to make a hololens app visible
to people who don't have headsets with
hololens you can run Windows 10 apps you
can browse the web you can play games
just to name a few one of the demos that
Microsoft has shown consistently is how
you can use Skype to give someone a
tutorial on home improvement projects or
just chat with your coworkers but let's
say you're like most people and you
don't have this headset this is where
spectator view comes in spectator view
is the name for the rig that Microsoft
has come up with what you're supposed to
do is use this mount to attach the
hololens on top of the DSLR you're only
doing this for positioning data though
you don't actually want to cover the
camera with the hololens
that positioning data is sent over Wi-Fi
to a PC that's running unity software
then you output video from the DSLR to
the PC using an HDMI cable once all that
video capture and positioning data is in
unity you can create a composite of all
the data which makes your hololens video
file for you I mean theoretically you
can also do this with something like a
GoPro it doesn't have to be a DSLR for
the sake of this video we're kind of
simplifying it I mean in reality you
still need a lot of equipment but seeing
it in person was pretty interesting in a
meta kind of way the hololens has always
had a built-in mechanism for capturing
video which Microsoft calls mixed
reality capture but it would only show
you the first-person point of view also
it came out as slightly lower quality
video there's also another way Microsoft
has been capturing hololens video and it
requires using a multi-thousand dollar
read drag
camera with a hololens attached so it's
not exactly accessible so to be clear
this is a cool hack or workaround but
there aren't a ton of hololens users out
there something in the thousands as far
as we know and also most of the people
that are using hololens right now are
developers or commercial clients not
consumers in fact a lot of the apps we
saw here on Microsoft's campus or apps
for commercial clients but if Microsoft
or any other headset maker is ever going
to be able to take these things from
niche to mainstream people are going to
have to get a sense of what their actual
value could be which is hard to do when
the overwhelming majority of the
population has never tried this type of
computing device before the hope here is
that video sharing can help with this so
is it a small step in the relatively
small world of hololens yes but it's a
step in the right direction
welcome to the hologram universe mm-hmm
welcome to my holographic world</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
