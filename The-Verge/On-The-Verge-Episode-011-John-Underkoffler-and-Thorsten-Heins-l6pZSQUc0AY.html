just keep it going as loud as possible
it's fine you don't have to stop there's
no need to stop no need to stop clapping
why did you stop clapping hi welcome to
on the verge I'm Josh Topolsky
editor-in-chief of the verge and we're
very happy to have you guys here very
excited for you to be here you guys
don't know that my parents are in the
audience tonight they're right over

they they literally made me out of
nothing I think it's impressive they
didn't really work that hard though did
they so really happy to be here you guys
may know that this is our last show of
the season which is exciting but I'm
happy to be here because i recently had
heart surgery and i'm alive it was minor
heart surgery though they didn't
actually open my chest they did shave my
chest i'll be talking about this later
in graphic sexy detail but if I collapse
or something just call 911 and tell them
that I've recently had heart surgery
that won't actually happen you know I
saw that wasn't going to do the 911 joke
and I did it anyhow why what's wrong
with me anyhow we have a big show we
have a big exciting show John
undercuffler from oblong industries is
here we're going to talk about crazy
yeah we're going to talk about crazy
minority report style computer we're
actually going to talk about minority
report a lot which I know you guys want
to hear about and that's exciting we
also have a video we went to oblong Ross
Miller took a trip out there which is
cool dieter bohn one of our West Coast
editors he's also a human but he's in
editor mainly he interviewed the CEO of
research in motion torsten Heinz so he's
kind of like talking about their new
devices which I know you guys are all
going out to buy like ASAP so like
you're nervous laughter like how do I
tell them I'm not doing that and uh no
you might you never know come on give it
a chance and of course Paul and I are
here they have all kinds of funky
shenanigans to talk about I think
they're actually called value
shenanigans that's their new Act and i
want to say our sponsor tonight is for
word they've been an awesome sponsor
this is our last show of the year
they're kind of taking us home and we
actually have a video that Paul is in
he's driving around a Ford car later
which is kind of fun and funny and weird
and uncomfortable but only because of
Paul not because forth so why am I
wasting your time I think we should just
start things so let's get the show
underway
it's good you're supposed to clap until
the music ends and very disappointed in
all of you especially by parents so we
have a lot of news talk about we have a
lot of stuff happening tonight we've got
it and this shows actually it's gonna be
a lot of fun and it's not fun it was
free so you can't really argue with that
I've used that joke a lot it still works
i'm happy we should get underway so
please welcome Paul Miller in nilay
patel Esquire yes yes I guess right over
get in here let me just read you over
into this am going yeah really good this
right there right that's your seat right
there okay great good great great job
walking out hey I like I mean when it
comes to people who can walk out yeah
you guys are the best in the industry
well you know we've been practicing cuz
we're about to take our show funky
shenanigans on a road yeah funky
shenanigans is touring the us all
through the winter yeah and into the
spring sorry I would do a lot of walking
on and off the stage during the show
that's actually our main funky
shenanigan yeah walkie-talkie down it's
a highlight of shows really short it's
like a walkout wave and walk back anyhow
enough of these shenanigans so we have a
lot of a lot of news has happened
recently yeah you guys may not may or
may not know this but we run a website
called the verge calm we do it's online
actually before we get into news let me
talk about my heart thing I think it's
cool and we're doing with this before
and I was like you know when I was
actually going in for the surgery I was
thinking like we should do a feature on
this which is a sick problem that I have
they're like starting to cut me over and
I'm like this would be great if we shot
a video but but so I have I had this
thing they say they got it though I
don't actually believe them like the
doctors tell me they fixed it but I had
this heart defect called super
ventricular tachycardia and what happens
is the nerve in your heart that gets
this electrical signal to beat it has
like an extra note on it and the
electrical signal gets caught in a
feedback loop which is a cool like tech
problems what happen I it's like a DDoS
on your heart and redox and your heart
so it's like freaking out it's really
comfortable and you feel like you're
going to
you call an ambulance so what they do is
they put these catheters in like your
groin groin Illaria your crotchal area
and they like snake them up into your
heart and they burn out the offending
node with radio frequencies yeah as I
just and they shave your chest just cuz
they want they shady we do shave your
chest because if they screw it up or
something goes wrong they have to give
you a pacemaker which is like my biggest
fear yeah like being an 80 year old guy
at my age like I have a pacemaker but
they have to shave your chest just in
case I got to go in they didn't go in
but man my chest is really you cut
through the water in case divis yes now
have a great swimmer anyhow um so so
it's actually kind of a cool like as far
as problems with your heart go yeah it's
sort of and a half it's that a cool tech
problem to have like I got a weird
feedback with your overclocked I'm
overclocked yeah yeah that's right
anyhow but I'm but I'm I'm good man I'm
excited about it and are you ready are
ready to love yeah I'm ready to love
again let's go function it at almost
full capacity oh um oh thank you look at
it just wanted to see whether they love
you in the middle of a conversation you
like managed you see that game less I
love you what I don't want that now
anyhow but we do have a big a big list
of things to talk about it last week I
don't know if you guys saw this on the
side we did this war for TV series and
we talked about how like the the
ecosystem battle is coming to the living
room and everybody wants to get in on
the television every trying to do smart
tvs or buddies trying to do like their
second screen experience and and neil i
wrote a bunch of stuff everybody did we
did interviews and we're actually
tomorrow i think we're gonna have a big
roundup post of all the stuff she's
check it out but this is the next
frontier I feel like mobile is kind of
starting to level out tablets are
starting to level out a little bit tvs
that stuff is changing yeah and and and
who's going to win this like who's going
to win is it verizon is it apple paul
i'm gonna put this to you yeah google is
it is it amazon what objects obviously
necessary because everything sucks right
now and i think everything is the worst
everything is the worst and and I think
the model the aisle I
the best is netflix i just don't think
netflix as a company is very smart so i
think it's probably like Amazon or Apple
taking maybe Netflix's model and doing
it well I just feel like how does
netflix compete with like a monolith
like Zach amazon or get absorbs yeah as
they get absorbed that's how they
compete well yeah it's not really you
know merge I don't you ever read the
definition of competition but but when
you're absorbed by the thing you're
competing against it's usually like a
bad thing have you seen the blog
postings if you like please i hate the
blog it just absorbed me you'd be like
he's getting on his private jet he's
like that was a great competition like i
would play hard yeah but so who do you
thinks gonna win you're not really
interesting we've been talking people
throughout the industry and it's
everybody knows that everything sucks
mm-hmm and it's weird because everybody
so you know the smartphone kind of looks
like now but it's a screen and you know
what PCs are starting to look like
tablets and there's going to be that's
going to shake itself out but we have an
idea how that markets going to go nobody
knows how to get from from where we are
now to what we want television tonight
and it's just like terrible rock I'm
sure rain do we want television I feel
like television doesn't need to change
that much I think it one major thing
needs to happen right you need to put TV
and all these other boxes no wrong
what's that I just need to be able to
watch whatever I want to watch what I
want to watch it and like the next
season of Downton Abbey should be
finished already and I should be able to
watch that right now like that all the
seasons of every should like six feet
under was six seasons you shoulda just
done this in one shot yeah and then i go
to call a cart watch that we should i
want it TV shows me 13 our movies that
you can watch does you what I mean
that's like that's what they are flicks
model yeah what that looks absolutely
right but everybody knows that's where
you want to go and I think it's if you
look at what happened in music it took
steve jobs like controlling five huge
companies to like participate they
offset no market they hazard be brought
to their knees by theft and that's
what's happening to me nobody is it like
it's an order to steal like a gig now
show if you're a college student you're
on coffee near a college student but
they don't have you noticed because
she's don't run the world hey so the the
CEO time see the metrics as if oh damn
what a table Beyonce song who runs the
world it's girls
yeah girl college students no but
they're real cooz really say somebody
got a good song it's like it's like a C+
be but it's true this women a plus furry
buddy there in charge are they not guys
yeah well no it's a you know the problem
is not us cutting the cord its people
never buying cable and that's like a
real problem with Ari Emanuel doesn't
that gets a problem mmm people are by
Canada well who your ass cable it's
everybody it's every quarter of our
audit everybody here has cable by what
all doesn't have cable you know what's
great about cable there's these two
music channels that are in SD and
they're so bad yeah they're in fused by
the way it's like a music channel that
doesn't show me canada it shows like it
shows like 15 seconds of a song it's
like you got the idea yeah I understand
that it is like literally got top 40
countdown like okay cool and it's an
hour long and everything is 15 tacit and
it's like here's a little bit of the
part before Sir Horace search for this
on you don't you know what this is gonna
do right moving on here's the new
Christina Aguilera song yeah anyhow so
we don't actually know the winner we
don't know who's gonna be the way we
don't it's gonna take a giant of the
industry to like make some real changes
verizon yeah comcast it's gonna be we're
gonna end up with the same people yeah
all right anyhow uh so another news as
we really ended that like don't holler
it was just it's rough yes well you're
not consumers not to get consumer losses
no matter who wins we well you know
who's gonna say aliens vs predator yeah
yeah I have I mentioned a predator as I
mentioned the predator on every show
this year I think I have so the other
thing that just happened other piece of
news that just happen is the wii u
launched yeah if you oh cuz nintendo
comes out with a new console all the
time yeah we're cool if you follow me on
twitter the social network yeah the
real-time social media network you'll
know that i was up till five in the
morning last night playing zombie you
have you guys seen zombie you do you
know what it is does anybody know what
the wii u is here in this audience
Kathy plays that's wonderful tepid
applause and I really enjoyed that
zombiu i turn the lights out and had
this happened and I was playing it late
and it scared that it scared the
out of me I mean I actually jumped dad
looks very serif I is very upset my
father by the way like reads the
comments it is like they're right you
talk over people you know like you guys
think you're like you the commenters are
trollish they have nothing on my parents
there's like the meanest people but
they're all so wonderful that's a
thought this is not anyway it's not
going anyhow but yes my father could
just go my father's very upset about my
profanity but it is scary yeah and I
think it's kind of amazing i thought
that we use like in whatever and then i
read the polygons review of zombie you
and I was like I gotta get one right now
luckily Sam sheffer who runs our social
stuff was like oh y'all have a couple
extra systems just laying around free
off of fell off the back of a truck yeah
yeah or whatever um Paul you gotta wii u
yeah i bought it off Sam too did you
really yeah if you like it well I
haven't opened up the box yet Wow
everybody the office wit equated
Christmas morning that everybody was
like there's a mandatory a verb like
patch like when you open turn on the
right is it downloads away from the
internet so I don't know what's gonna
happen I'd you your hip six months for
dad you'll be able to play the wii u
it's really really gonna have it just
around it's good it looks cool yeah well
as long as that is enough for you hobby
you use the yeah so what's cool I don't
you guys understand the Wii U has a like
a tablet controller and a console and so
again zombie you when you're doing
things on the screen on your TV screen
you get a map on your on your tablet
controller and and if you want to get
into your backpack to get stuff out like
a like a board to hit the zombies with
or a carbine rifle to shoot them in the
face with or and gun or like a mole talk
tail all things that I've used on da
music video but but you like you go into
the backpack on the screen and the
person on the screen like is unprotected
like going through their back you see is
I feel like get into your backpack and
pull something out it is terrifying know
like so here's what's really weird
zombiu and then we should move on but
what's really weird about zombie you is
that you only play as one character and
then you die and you start over in that
character that you played as is dead in
the game and is now a zombie so like
there's periods in the game where you're
you get something you're like should I
stash this somewhere and leave it
because I know I'm gonna die and then
like when my new person is like born
into this world I can go get the thing
off of them like I've actually killed
myself in the game to get a gun from
them which is really weird like it's
just a really weird way to think about
so I have never seen you so sincerely
passionate about something well I
accepted like maybe day one of the verge
but downhill after you order kind of
excited about the launch of our site but
um it's just look I haven't been scared
by a zombie game since like the original
original resident evil you do remember
the original resident evil when there's
always a birth through the window yeah
well have scary I just love to be scared
buzz on I'm very bug just go get one I'm
not by the way I'm not hiding for today
to Sam's back I thought I wouldn't like
this thing and I'm like surprised that I
like it alright moving on I'm not
surprised moving on Steven Sinofsky have
you heard of him he's a zombie he's a
character it is off you he attacks you
he's like check out this easy-to-use
touch interface Steven Sinofsky is since
Tina Sadowski was at Microsoft he ran
windows he recently resigned there's
been a lot of oil in turmoil yeah well
we don't know what his State was you
know what's going on with him but we we
it seemed a little weird and and and
Scott Forstall recently resigned from
Apple who was like you know was running
iOS he's the guy who made iOS what it is
the last few years so you've got these
big software guys who've recently
resigned with big big products they just
put out and we think it's kind of you
think it's kind of a trend I think it's
it's it's the end of jerks the end of
jerks the end of jerks what Nilay Patel
has dubbed it yeah I think I think
people don't want to work for jerks and
I think that's like a problem at these
big companies where they they these
leaders who are perceived as not nice
people hmm interesting yeah i'll change
my management style but you went out
Neal I went out onto the street yep and
it costed regular humans to talk about
jerk jerk bosses yeah what I want to
work for jerks are pushovers yeah so
take a look at this video
we will be right back it's highly
entertaining past couple weeks to very
high profile jerks have been fired Scott
four stalls out at Apple Steven stops
he's out at Microsoft the thing is you
kind of need a jerk if you're going to
make something in this world you need a
leader you need somebody vision
somebody's going to get angry when they
don't get what they want so we're out
here in New York City to ask people what
kind of boss they want to work for a
jerk or pushover since you're either
work for a jerk or a pushover ah pajama
I think I'd rather work for the jerk
yeah I would rather work for the jerk so
as you're either work for a jerk or for
a pushover push over push over why I'd
rather work with each other because you
can push a warmer yeah well anything a
better Boston forever in Siberia because
then I have a little bit more control in
the situation I don't have to deal with
negative residue what is negative
restaurant where you just have to
confront someone it's a real thing
little negative residue what I mean I
have a number of residue related
questions asked you yeah let it go would
you rather work for Joe perpetrators um
shuffled over oh I guess I'd rather work
for a pushover would you rather work for
a jerk or a pushover it sir I'd rather
work for a jerk jerk yeah what's the
challenge would you rather work for a
jerk i push up push over the jerk I
don't want to be sexist but if they
don't like you they can make your life
miserable that's why are that be sexist
female you're not gonna get a job uh
where's boss I've ever have is probably
working for like can't say the name I'm
not gonna name names or anything the
worst boss I've ever had Ray Brown shame
and Bray Brown you are a jerk if you had
a characterize yourself as a boss which
one of you push off yeah I'm push our
more than a jerky your friends laughing
at you man we're just doing some
interviews about I like the workplace
and like the coyote it's so good hey I'm
dumb we broke Oh baby
I'm sorry I'm well Kitty cake yeah me
too fans leave have to work this hard
this is just like the worst like it's
like friday afternoon everyone's going
home it's super cold and I have to be
out here doing my little song and dance
my jerk boss
this is great I wonder if Josh knows I'm
here
so what have we learned today we're
going to although it's no fun most
people know they need to work for a
shirt they need somebody with vision
leadership somebody's going to get the
job done get the project off the ground
but just as inevitably the jerks get
replaced there's somebody younger
somebody more handsome somebody who's
frankly more well-liked so here's to you
Steven Sinofsky here's to you Scott
Forstall and here see you Josh the balls
today suggests to me knee levers what I
think Neil I was trying to say yes what
was he trying to say do you really want
to do you really want a hitch your wagon
to this train how are you doing wagons I
think yeah to this horse I've never
heard of it the servant leader wow you
really killed everybody without as it
that is a vibe killers yep there that's
not a jerk but not a push up anyhow uh
so it stupid what do you leave your
mutiny Paul I would I don't like I don't
like I don't like the sounds of anything
you're talking about and so I'm just
going to segue out of whatever that is
into the next thing as if nothing
happened and then we'll fix this in post
and you guys won't tell anybody so you
know here's the thing we were thinking
about Stephenson oskins not forestall
both geniuses in their own right you
know maybe not well liked most geniuses
aren't because they're so smart and
handsome and talented but we thought
maybe this whole thing is a ruse you
know they both quit right around the
same time which seemed weird and we
started you know thinking maybe these
guys are going to start something new
together yeah maybe they're going to
start their own new company to compete
with windows and an apple Kenny with
Microsoft and Apple and so we got some
we did some digging and we we got some
some pictures what we believe is yeah
photos of their new operating systems
they're working on together to compete
with the big guys shocking and and we're
going to show do for the first time ever
you're the first people see them so so
quickly before we get into that I want
to show you this is steven sinofsky is
work this is the windows 8 home screen
you can see here it's you know very
stark it's very iconic you've got these
you know big bold text big bullet icons
and you know easy to navigate for most
people if you have a touch screen and
then we have a photo of scott forestalls
work that's a little bit different you
know but you get the stitch
either kind of controversial yeah but
you know OS 10 and iOS largely
considered to be some of the most usable
operating system but you know what this
is you know what this is your carrier
I've ripped off a page i'm in november
you know this is you have a leather
calendar i love the guy but stack of
leather calendars so we found some we
found some pictures of what we believe
is that their their their project oh
here's I books yeah this is your the
page turn you know it's skeuomorphism
but at its best yeah I think so here's
what we've uncovered and we're pretty
excited to show you guys this is what we
believe is the the new home screen of
the operating system that very odd
Morris tall and Steven Sinofsky are
working on now you can see there the
influences of both of them here you've
got this great tiled you've got all your
apps right there you know there's mail
calendar and the nice thing about this
is unlike windows 8 you know what they
are just by looking at that that's a
calendar yeah okay there's a notebook
everybody knows what I have faded out
speaker means of course I mean that's
that's audio probably never really tell
a couple of jerks maybe I look at it
look at the on/off switch here like
you're not gonna wonder how do I turn
this thing off yeah you click the on off
switch like you would on the back of a
386 yeah and you know you internet
obviously it's like sitting down at your
beautiful linen desk yeah this is what
work is like in the real world mixed
with the functionality and the fluidity
of Windows 8 yeah I think it's quite
brilliant let's take another we have
another look here at the another app
here's the browser and I think when you
think about where am i working where am
I looking at my content it's on a table
maybe you've got a notepad where you're
making notes yeah the tables made of a
nice now this to me is recycled which is
guessing a faded birch table blending
its blending the best of both worlds
yeah really and I think we have one more
shot they're also doing mobile stuff do
we have the mobile I know we skype oh
here's their version of skype which by
the way i think is an improvement on the
skype interface actually you know I fish
you know what you're getting you know
you want to make a call just just click
on the rotary phone down there you know
you need to mute your mic just click on
this generation thinks of video they
think of giant they think of a
you know you got puts on uhf to tune in
Sinofsky is calling let me put it on to
the UHF channel and then finally we have
the mobile version which they took a
little bit of a different direction
started I think here you can see more of
the the windows 8 influence on on what
they were doing with iOS I like the
folders especially the folders are great
it's like you to know what's in those
yeah just just open them up that's what
you do with the real folder right anyhow
there's the real pictures from the new
project that Scott Forstall and steve is
an Oscar working on and we're glad we
could share them with you guys um yeah
you know we had we had people working
tens of minutes on so they really are
gonna when they hear that applause it
really lap it up anyhow so we have we've
into the video for you Ross Miller went
to oblong industries and these are the
guys who invented the Minority Report
computer they did the computers for iron
man and they basically are pushing
computing forward in a big big weird
crazy way Russ took a trip there and
we're going to take a look at that when
we come back we'll have John
undercuffler here who is there who is
one of the big guys are one of the main
Peter scientists chief scientist leading
this thing so take a look this will be
right back I think that cinema is one of
the great art forms and one of the great
languages of obviously the 20th century
and it's still serving as well here in
the 21st century I think it's actually
important to study cinema for anyone
who's building you is anyone who's
building anything anyone who's
interested in communication
it's been 10 years since the film
minority report came out it is still the
hallmark of the future of interface
these people at oblong industries in Los
Angeles they are the minds behind it
they may the interface and they're
building it and making your reality
let's check out what they're doing as
much as oblong is about products and
technology it's about ideas and it's
important to be expressing those in
every form that it's possible to think
of my name is John undercuffler I am
co-founder and chief scientist of oblong
when I first saw John's work it
completely blew my mind and changed my
view of what what you could do with a
computer and take the user interface and
put it all over the room and you know
make make the the interactive experience
sort of part of people's real world not
part of people's you know beige box is
starting in the kind of early 90s so
barely a decade into modern UI based
compute computing it seemed foolishly
and naively to me that it was time for
the next one right why why aren't we
building the next you I ten years seems
like long enough and it seemed important
to me that the the UI was the focus of
attention right because the UI at the
end of the day is all we have do you
speak as minority report made flesh this
is a kind of typical installation of the
sort that we've been providing to our
early-adopter customers like bowling in
GE for for many many years now and it's
a kind of development system inside
which you can solve problems that you
can solve any other way gee speak the
platform is fundamentally input and
output agnostic but in this case we're
using motion capture of sensors that are
specifically configured to look for
these little tags each tag has a unique
constellation of retro reflective dots
it's basically 3m scotchlite material
and allows the system to recover the
identity and the three-dimensional
position and orientation of each finger
it was an early revelation that the
combination of incredibly detailed
position and orientation information
with harshly quantized posed information
makes a really really robust system
that's what makes it so that it's User
independent anyone can put on these
gloves and immediately be using the
system we don't have to train it
user nobody has here and going in and
out yes there we go yeah we went from
commandline computing to graphical
computing and that was a big wholesale
shift in and how you think about what it
is to use a computer we are making that
same shift happen for today from just
graphical computing on one screen to
computing that is multi-user
multi-screen and multi-device so this is
mezzanine this is a conference room
collaboration product that we make air
it oblong so what you're looking at is a
shared workspace where we've got a
collection of sequence content which is
a slideshow that's what you're seeing in
the the middle of the screen here a
collection of assets that can be
manipulated and added to the slideshow
like this one where we've manufactured a
set of three sided wand input devices
which are used spatially to control our
special operating environment so you use
these things as handheld products to
drag something in space from one screen
to another or to manipulate an interface
on one screen there's two ways to build
out new technologies you can build kind
of top down the most capable possible
version of the technology and starts out
expensive or you can build bottom up
with inexpensive consumer class devices
they're probably not that capable but
get better and better every year we made
a decision early on with oblong that we
would build further for a while at least
we would build top down so we would
build the most capable systems we could
imagine and we would rely on moore's law
and good engineering to sort of push
those prices down year-over-year what we
what we knew we would see is the cost
curve and the capability curves
intersecting I think we're right on the
edge of that point and you can see that
that intersection between the cost and
the capability curves our goal now is to
kind of push through that barrier and
get our version are fully capable
version of these spatial gestural multi
user interface
to everybody so this is sismo and it's
an earthquake visualization in sandbox
there is no gloves involving this one
right so this is USGS data and it's
about 120,000 data points so as you're
noticing you can you can sit here and
just grab and interact with the data and
there's a couple different ways that
that we can interact with it so one is
to just kind of grab it if we flip
around we can set it back to kind of an
equi rectangular normal world map do
usually what was that I'm actually white
so it's okay a reverse L yeah okay and I
can just hold my fist and kind of move
around correct alright this come forward
this is going back the operating
environment thinks of roll pixels so you
can put screens in your environment and
basically use them as windows into a 3d
virtual space as opposed to just kind of
a continuation of a 2d space it's been
interesting for us to watch the
evolution of interfaces around tablets
and phones because there's been a lot of
interesting work from Microsoft and
Apple and and the Android vendors for us
what all that works so far is missing is
the idea that it's an anachronism to
look at one screen at a time and view
that as your computing experience the
next version of all of our computing
experience is going to be multi screen
and multi-device we have all these
powerful screens and all these pixels
all around us all the time we need to
use them more effectively so in the next
year or so I think we're going to see a
huge kind of efflorescence of gestural
and spatial input and more and more
understanding among lots of different
folks building computing experiences
that multi-screen is really interesting
oblong is dedicated to the idea that
technology alone is no longer enough
technology and design have to be
conjoined have to be inseparable and
have to be part of the same development
process otherwise we're not going to get
anywhere valuable at all
yeah very very cool very weird stuff so
please welcome the chief scientist for
oblong John undercuffler oh you're
coming off from over there I was like
doctors opposed ya know why I don't know
why you'd be coming out from the other
side originally was going to be there
now is that the important thing is you
made it over this barrier that we've I
don't know I was hoping the interview
right state are you gonna get time I've
are you getting fully nude here should I
be do you want me to get fully nude
right well I've lid I mean it's a fun
all righty right now I'm not doing that
oh so close so close um thank you for
coming my pleasure entirely I mean the
stuff you guys are doing is fascinating
Q and I want to know so everybody I mean
Minority Report is the thing that
everybody talks about in they talk about
whether it's about you guys or just
talking about the future of computing
yeah I think Minority Report is the
thing any people I was like oh someday
we're gonna get that ball and we're
going to be able to solve crimes before
they happen and yeah okay that's not you
but what what what came first like how
did this happen like did did did Steven
Spielberg come to you and say hey I want
this kind of thing can you make it then
you really hit that's a great idea we
should make a computer like that or I
don't want to tell the story for you you
tell me how did it how did this all come
about was which came first chicken
chicken or egg which one is the chicken
that's what I want to know which one is
the chicken you tell me good so I mean
it was in direct sense that Spielberg
wanted to put a real a believable future
of HMI of computation into this movie
that was going to be said in a putative
2054 Washington DC and it just so
happened that a lot of the stuff that I
and other folks had been building at the
MIT Media Lab in the in the mid to late
90s was what he was looking for so he'd
sent an emissary the amazing production
designer Alex McDowell to go on a kind
of shopping spree and import technology
directly into the film and what we were
building at the Media Lab at the time
seemed to be just the ticket says Bieber
was like I need a cool computer yeah he
said I don't want to see a mouse he was
quite emphatic about it and they thank
you for that Stephen right I mean that
what what made him think he didn't want
to see him out so he just think like
obviously the mouse is going to be
obsolete by the year twenty where's the
2054 yeah that was
his premise and you know he wanted to
know what was next I mean he's deeply
interested in technology he was building
this movie which incidentally he said is
his film noir it's not a sci-fi film in
his mind which is great so it's setting
that well here maybe it slightly wrong
because there's a lot of science fiction
like straight up literally science
admittedly and it's not much we can do
about well except celebrated man's
living in a fantasy world the idea was
that you know it was a film or set only
incidentally in 20 54 and he wanted it
to be a completely believable 2054
extrapolated from you know new
technology trends that we can all
recognize today but discarding old old
old stuff like the beige mouse right so
so so you had had so how far along was
whatever whatever they went shopping for
and finally purchased how far along was
it compared to well obviously it wasn't
what you see in the movie but it wasn't
exactly that we had fully working
prototypes at MIT though oh you bet you
beat Spielberg to this I mean this isn't
like he can't be was like I was wish I
could do this all the time will I get in
trouble if I agree I I don't know what
Spielberg's like is even bigger than I
like helicopters now no really I oh yeah
no we don't working red light on un and
and so uh did the movie help advance
what you were doing when you when you
had the the opportunity to kind of
visualize the stuff in it yeah okay I
was itchin and in two ways so you know
we built the stuff in the real world in
an academic setting and it was real code
in real systems and and real physical
objects that worked preparing it for the
film was an amazing exercise because it
we had to render the stuff legible we
had to simplify we had to make it
absolutely smooth so that the audience
could understand the kind of causal this
is how it works right and that is you
know exactly the same exercise you
should undertake if you're preparing a
technological product or any product so
the best thing to do if you're trying to
build something new is to have Steven
Spielberg make a movie or what I mean
just slip it into 100 million dollar
film it's like what I could really use
is a budget that's protist envisions
thing yeah so you also you also did that
the Iron Man computers yes and and
there's a similar some similar stuff
there yeah what's great is that Robert
Downey jr. who's really that you know
the driving force behind all that is
incredibly smart and funny and profane
guy as well hiki want to go handed they
do if you're Robert that he wants to up
the ante each time
show a little bit something new and he
wanted to up the ante from from minority
report which is you know clearly a
forebear for those kinds of science
fiction interfaces right so okay so let
me ask you there's a scene in Iron Man
where aunt I remember which movie it is
but the scene I remember he grabs
something he like throws it in the trash
he has to be like physically and then
dumps it right like just like you would
in the real world now in my experience
what it's a lot easier just to just a
drag a mouse a little bit and then put
it in the trash and then it's done like
you're done you might even have to use
any muscles so what if you don't have
them else but I'm saying well this is
what i'm getting at like why in why in
that situation or why in many situations
where I'm computing like a folder for
instance like it's real easy to put
stuff in a photo take stuff out of a
photo requires very little movement from
me which I like because I'm extremely
weak and and what we would a minority
report interface or Iron Man interface
improve upon things like that or will it
or do you not even want to use it for
stuff like that well no I think you do I
think you want to use it for everything
that those those films themselves aren't
full prototypes in any sense and that's
what makes it a real world product is
when all of those motions all of those
interactions have been refined and
simplified and boiled down to their
absolute essence and there's you know
there's an extent to which it's a
cinematic exercise and so you want Tom
Cruise and Colin Farrell doing this all
day long which has led to allegations
that we've spent the better part of a
decade trying to quash which is that
it's tiring to use these interfaces and
it probably is if you do it that way but
the fact is that that we track hands to
such incredible precision that when you
use our systems they're they're very
fine motions and it's actually kind of
freeing compared to doing this which is
a keyboard so so what is the impulse I
mean just at the core like what is the
impulse here that you want to what do
you want to change and why like why does
the Minority Report computer need to
exist and i'm sorry if i'm calling it
that and like I know you guys have no
such things that are not Minority Report
computer unless that's what you're
working with which is fine like why why
do I want to change why do I not want to
eat them in keyboards very very
efficient way to enter data right do I
want to get rid of the keyboard do I
want to get rid of the mouse I don't
think you want to get rid of the
keyboard but I do think you want to get
rid of the mouse keyboard has to stay
well how you gonna type a letter to
Grandma can I just say it out loud you
could you could how's the voice
recognition stuff doing I know you're
working on
Chalmers eight percent is that enough
you're not doing a voice recognition you
know is that part of your system we do
integrate with with that kind of stuff
in it and its really really useful as a
kind of ancillary data input but but
back to your question I mean the we need
to take that big step it's been 30 years
and we're still stuck essentially with
the same interface it's the Macintosh
interface and and here we are nearly 30
years later we're hampered by it frankly
it doesn't feel like it because there's
a lot of you know shiny pixels flying
around what we really are the machines
are capable of all sorts of incredible
feats we're still kind of grunting and
squeaking and clicking as it were so so
I wake up let's say your computer exists
I don't have a I don't have a Mac
anymore yeah I've got the oblong amor
architect mr more you've got your room i
got i wake up in my bedroom now i want
to check my email what's the experience
like in in a in an oblong world it
probably depends what you have near you
I mean I think part of part of what
we're saying is that and this is really
interesting we're at the beginning of a
massive change that we're too close to
to even understand as the change it's
the transition from an obsession with
devices like which device you have do
you have the little ones you have the
big ones you have the tablet you have
the laptop to an era of pixels all that
will matter is the pixels because the
the central premise is that you should
be able to use any pixels you see
anywhere and point at them or pointed
them with a phone or something else and
by pointing at them get through them to
your stuff your filly great job dodging
the question how do i check my email how
do you check your email how am I gonna
check my email when I'm doing this stuff
which pixels do you have near well I
don't know I my walls a computer you
okay yeah well you've got a my bed is my
puter my duvet as a computer even and I
fold it down that's a 300 thread count
computer exactly it's extremely high
resolution and also very soft on a nude
body so okay so I don't know you tell me
what would I would I wake up to I think
you might well you know drag you pull a
physical tablet off the bed stand or
whatever so you I'm still doing this and
Psyche its own right okay so you're not
really now in your world no i mean i
think i think our answer at all blowing
to all of this is plurality these are a
better way to check email look I
basically I'm just try to get my inbox
20 so you need to tell me is there a
better way no but I mean that you're
going to be chained to this your inbox
for the rest of us there is considering
this but you can tell
is there a better way in your opinion so
for something as mundane is checking
email which everybody does every day
does this computer solve that or does
this solve different problems I guess
that's my real question I think it
principally solves different problems it
enables new kinds of interactions that
we can't even really dream up yet right
but you've dreamed some up that dream
song give me one give you an interac me
a new interaction that these computers
will allow us to do yeah well what would
it mean for let's say you know a bunch
of smart grid management experts people
with a real world problem to solve a
hurricane comes in smashes the city
there's electrical failures all over the
place what would it mean for all of
those people to use a single application
at the same time bringing their
expertise into the same room using a
whole panoply of monitors and displays
and portable devices and tablets and
projected wall screens to fix a problem
them to be in the problem to be in the
problem yeah yeah okay that's that's a
good example I you got me there I'll be
honest with you I didn't think you would
have anything have you been working on
it for like it 20 years right I mean how
long has it been how long you been
working on this um better part of three
decades I would have to say so so how do
you feel about the connect I mean are
you do you see the connectors as this is
the future like I'm you know I kind of
set the stage for this and now the
kinect exists and that's the first step
the cages yeah I mean just because it's
it's a motion-controlled it's the first
motion controlled thing that really has
made any kind of impact in our lives yes
that's true it but it's an input device
and I say bring it bring it all bring
the connects bring the leap bring
everything oblongs operating system
which we call G speak is designed
specifically to take input from a
heterogeneous bunch of devices like that
depth sensing devices pointing devices
spatial ones these old guys tablets
phones all of it that's how you get work
done you bring everything to the problem
and that's what's going to be new the
idea that work play communication isn't
stuck in one of these devices that the
stuff you're doing doesn't stop at the
boundary of the device right there's not
like the edges of the window it's like
everything is the window yeah so how do
we get how do we how do we get there and
when do we get there I mean I went to
Microsoft Research and oh I should
actually have a Tom Cruise story I mean
you obviously work with Tom Cruise on my
order right so I met him I went to a
taping of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon
and he was there and we
we act he's very nice and I started
talking and he was like what's next
thing cuz you know I'm a tech guy he's
like what's next what's coming and I was
talking about microsoft research because
I just been there and I talking about
all this gesture interface stuff and
he's like oh you know we made a movie
about that make very nonchalantly so you
know we made a movie about that called
Minority Report but you worked with him
closely you know did he like how did he
take to I mean here's a guy that's
obviously not like a tech dude right um
was it natural where do people respond
to it actually yeah it was I mean he's
incredibly professional and driven and
and and and dedicated and you know it
wasn't just him we also worked with neal
mcdonough and in colin farrell because
the early scenes that we'd shot with tom
were starting to look so good that lets
people are commissioned extra scenes to
be written so that more people could use
the technique you want people using the
computer wanted people to use that
computer but but what we did is we train
the actors in every way we could because
you know when you're shooting the stuff
isn't actually on the screens the actors
have to use their imagination but these
actors actually were the first users of
G speak the actual thing in as well in a
virtual yeah Sokka we made dictionaries
and and training videos and so forth and
I spent days with all of them you know
training them to use this during oh
maybe their stuff that's right so when
it came time to shoot they knew what
they were doing that's interesting so
now they could big a walk into your labs
and just go for it ready to go have any
of them come to your labs then you
haven't yet I think it's probably time I
think you should invite them yeah it's
okay so when when when can i when when
will this be a thing that I can use in
my real life like when will a human
being who is not Tom Cruise who's not
just imagining it you could be either
one of those things well Ross Miller's a
human being right well not really um
these parts of him he do it I'm saying
like when will I be able to say in my
life like every day day to day i'm using
this thing like do you have a do you
have an event horizon here I don't even
know that's the right term I like it's
great yeah I think so yeah if you're if
you're working in a series of sort of
fortune 500 disciplines and domains you
may well be using it today so we've got
a bunch of customers who use G speak who
use our products which is using it
companies like Boeing and
saudi aramco so they're literally that
there's a room somewhere at Boeing where
yes guys are doing this stuff a bunch of
rooms yeah really I gotta go to GE why
am I doing this welcome to la come I
would love to come to LA and I'm going
to come to LA okay and I'm never gonna
I'm gonna come to the lab in Neverland
we can change you to the desk out there
that's great i can finally deal with my
inbox yeah III so be you don't have a
date where it's like available to
consumers like you don't have an idea
when this will be over technology we're
inching and stepping and then sort of
traveling our way there bit by bit so
earlier this year we launched a broad
market product called mezzanine which
brings those same capabilities to a kind
of problem that everyone has which is
meeting rooms and conference rooms and
how do you take the stock out of
meetings so that's something that yeah
if you could figure out a way to do that
it's a magic spray you should see it
it's called you back yeah well thank you
for the peak adpkd breathy oh well I try
so the mezzanine is going to end up in
hundreds and thousands and eventually
tens of thousands of meeting rooms and
those aren't fortune 500 type problems
that's that's like every other that's
like a verge problem it's a virgin we're
like go when we hear like go they would
get a gotomeeting dial and we get very
depressed so like is this going to
improve my go to mediate yes well it's
very excited listen I wish we had more
time to talk but unfortunately we have
to wrap up unreal on ahead so much talk
to you is there is there is there
anything that we didn't get to that you
want to get to you brother brought a
computer in a giant and a note I brought
a note is there any particular reason
that you brought the stuff out well I
want to talk about science fiction in
movies also puffs and they get ways
using the cuffs cuffs yeah my wife said
you can you're pointing to your oh
you're pointing to your leg we were
wearing cuffs I can't want America to
know I was up I do have my jeans cuffed
that is true yeah do you want to just
check her email really quick you know
it's not the email you know you were you
were talking about shaving earlier and
I'm in big trouble today because today
November 20th is oblongs pencil-thin
mustache day what and I'm not
participating yes by the way is this
unplanned I don't know what's happening
is there's a few of our designers and
engineers though they have mustaches
pencil-thin must include you know what
appears to be a woman yeah
hey that's unusual where there were
their hormones involved in that mustache
grow I think perhaps just so do are you
gonna shave I will if you will uh you
want me to shave my mustache to a
pension because what could be weirder do
you have a sense razor yeah well we can
share is this actually happening right
now sure I mean I got dry I just keep I
keep the beautiful this okay you go
first controller go on tell me if I can
trust this man I'll wait go ahead shave
what you want me to shave just out of
the blue yes my mother just you've
audibly said no by the way um look I'll
tell you what let's meet in LA let's do
have a camera crew and we're gonna have
razors two of them ok I will I will hold
you to that we will do pencil-thin
mustaches in LA look I need to shaving
cream and also I'm scared to death of
having a pencil mustache so John thank
you so much for coming really awesome
really appreciate you sir and uh sticker
that was weird and I didn't know that
was coming I wish I didn't either but I
dig around we've got a word from our
sponsor featuring Paul Miller and we
will be right back with torsen Hines
interview I'm Paul Miller and I'm
spending a year without using the
internet so to stay in touch with people
I've got a p.o box and they send me
letters I send the letters back it's a
Paul Miller to Paul Miller Paul Miller
Paul Miller got key home
Paul Miller what's got me thinking is
this key i actually don't normally
receive keys and I I don't think it's to
another p.o box as it says Ford on it so
oh would you look at that big-ass pores
new fusion or the key works so what all
great things about receiving mail is
that people typically put their return
address write on the envelope then you
can drive to that address and you know
it extend extend your friendship with
that person one of my best awful I'm
friends is the sky named Mike and he
lives way up on the Upper East Side I am
a downtown guy to put a track on my bike
so you know now I've got this Ford
Fusion i think i'm gonna pay me this
call mike calling my gone south oh hey
hey Mike yeah what up hey this is your
pen pal Paul i'm outside of your house
right now yar yeah yeah do we have the
right place so we decided to go see a
movie but a little snacks a little
overpriced so we go we're gonna stock up
now see the light bulb it's a huge
happens like a little salad all right
we're ready for the ultimate movie
experience we've got carrots we got
onion we got donuts they got our coffee
I just got to get there already put this
as a favorite I will said that is my
destination
so this is active Park Assist yeah I

the audience and where could we get a
hand raised we're right there hey look
it's like so wonderful when people get
together and hang out and then come to a
show and stare uh-huh anyhow we have a
really interesting interview a few
months ago I sat down with whoreson
Heinz and I wrote a little story about
when when research in motion was just
starting to talk about their new devices
and blackberry 10 and you know they had
recently delayed the stuff and they
pushed it back there now getting set to
release this whole new operating system
all these new products and dieter bohn
are one of our West Coast editors sat
down with torsten the CEO of the company
in San Francisco and it's pretty
interesting interviews to take a look at
this and we will be right back with some
very very very special stuff everybody
knows it's been a bad for years to rim
but the company is coming up on the
defining moment with the launch of
blackberry 10 and all new modern
smartphones we sat down here in San
Francisco with CEO thorsten heins to
find out a little bit but what's coming
on launch
and see what he thinks it'll take
program to get its mojo back those are
signs thanks so much for speaking with
us it's a real pleasure we still give
you a few times now and the the big news
most recently is you guys announced that
you're launching blackberry 10 on
january thirtieth correct that is the
announcement you made the decision to
push back the launch and after q4 into
q1 of 2013 and so you'll be missing the
the holiday season can you talk a little
bit about what made you decide to push
back the launch into 2013 the major
argument really was we not just building
a next update of a smartphone OS right
windows moving from blackberry 7 to
blackberry aid we've built a whole new
platform nothing that's in blackberry 10
on a sufferer side has anything to do
with what's in blackberry 7 so is a huge
undertaking to blow the new platform I'm
really really looking at this as a
platform taking us something the next
decade you need time to get it right you
need time to polish it when it when it's
out there I wanted to be a WoW
experience in the user sense that was
the first argument the second one was
that q4 is going to be pretty crowded
with launches its a typical holiday
season and the question we had then with
our carriers when we discussed that was
you know is it is it too much noise
right if you know all these products
launched at the same time can I said you
know what q1 why don't you go for it
they want the quality so they supported
us in that decision and we can give you
full attention in q1 what's the 10
second pitch for blackberry 10 as
opposed to iPhone Android or even
windows phone okay you're you're a user
hyper-connected always on multitasking
and you need to get things done how do
we do this the best typing experience on
a keypad we have the full integrated hub
so your brain is not occupied with any
in and out or which application do I
have to open and if you're connecting
your device to an enterprise we have
blackberry balance that makes your
personal part of the device full private
and allows the CIO to have a fully
secure corporate part on the same device
windows phone has a very concise patch
we have the start screen live tiles and
you feel like you can get in get out get
out there today remember they call it do
you think that you've got that's
compelling enough reason for someone to
choose blackberry over another platform
I think it's it's the user experience
that will finally make that decision
and with the hub and all the integration
of all your communication channels all
your notifications into one central hub
which is not an application right it
always runs on that it was it's always
at your fingertips and it's always just
one one swipe away wherever you are on
this device you just do this one gesture
and you're in your activity center right
and you take activities on all your
channels beat facebook twitter email BBM
whatever you have right notifications
out of the hub so there's no need to say
back facebook all bank back linked and
back PBM right and I think that is so
compelling because right now people are
really getting overwhelmed by all the
different channels they have to deal
with right they're hyper connected and
we just make this so easy and
comfortable them I I think that's going
to just speak for itself the big
question of course is apps and recently
said that you're aiming for a hundred
thousand apps at launch how are you
going to get to that number that's a
pretty big number oh we have pretty good
line of sight to get there you had about
the 30 jam conferences that we did
globally and the way we look at this is
and we learned this from our presence in
asia pac and middle east and south
africa applications are also local so
the first attempt is in every of our
major countries get to the 200 to 600
most important local app so really work
with the local app developer community
this is why we did this in 30 countries
and then the generic applications like
in our games content video music books
we are deeply integrated with Twitter
Facebook and LinkedIn it's not just an
application is really deeply integrated
into the device that's one thing second
is we have built a blackberry 10
platform with various software developer
tool kiss on it flash air html5 C C++
native and then we have an Android
player with Android apps the way that
you execute that on the playbook OS is
relatively interesting the developers
still need to submit them directly to
the blackberry store yeah because we
want this to be part of the blackberry
appworld blackberry would but they don't
have to do a lot of coding or anything
they submitted it gets converted into
the BlackBerry App World a file format
they need to be on the commercials and
sign up for that we tested for quality
for sure right so we take a look at that
and then it's there I think
back talk about the competition a little
bit microsoft it seems is really gone
after you guys with Windows Phone 8
they've got the whole new kernel and
platform that's tightly integrated with
a whole bunch of their their windows
services and especially their their
enterprise services for device
management how are you guys going to
counter Microsoft to ensure that Windows
Phone kind of doesn't eat your lunch I
have a lot of respect for all companies
working in this space because they all
have good engineers they all have
creative people right so I think it's
about the smartphone market in the u.s.
is a very mature market sixty percent
penetration by now right whereas in
other regions we sit at twenty so if you
are in a mature market you need to
segment you need to find your
bull's-eyes segment we have identified
this for the blackberry user with those
three criteria and it's not us you know
putting this on paper academically we
did in intense user study about this for
four weeks and month which is your hyper
connector your multitasking and you need
to get things done so you're probably
not using the device to game or to watch
TV shows now we got to be good at that
because that's a consumer decision
element right but the hub the flow the
peak the balance that is all geared
towards this segment that roughly is
kind of about fifty percent of the
smartphone users and that's what we're
aiming it and that's where we compete
second thing is I truly believe in
mobile computing I predict that over
time laptops really will disappear go
into a meeting today and see what people
carry into a meeting right so sometimes
when you have discussions with your
financial teams in a company you know
they they are the excess spreadsheet
gurus and they come with big laptop
right but in general I think we were up
to mobilize the the enterprise and in my
view is smartphone and or a tablet is
going to be good enough for fifty sixty
percent of all mobile workers of all
employees in a corporate enterprise and
that's also what we're shooting it what
is your metric of success for blackberry
10 if you know if we talk again in six
months what will be the thing that says
you know yes we're doing we're on the
right path this is going well or no this
isn't going well i think it is clearly
make
mark in the market so you know being
being attractive to consumers and to
enterprises selling the device in
certain quantities is a measure of
success no doubt right successful global
launch is a good sound marketing
campaign Iran it that attracts consumers
and then we will ramp it up right so
that to me is the next six month and
then bb10 will proliferate into the
portfolio so there will be new products
we probably can talk about it if you
meant for them now that black pretend
will be and it is again it is also from
me the exploration of the mobile
computing domain so i have several
projects innovation projects running
right now in the company where we want
to you know start building this this
mobile computing experience well thank
you very much good luck with the launch
oh thank you dear and I've been great
talking with you yeah thank you
tourists in hinds he really knows how to
bring it home he does well that's it
we've come to just about the end of our
