they've found direct evidence that water
is flowing on the Martian surface we've
known for a while that water exists in
ice form on Mars but this is the first
time we can confirm that it exists in a
liquid state the findings strengthen the
odds that extraterrestrial life could be
on the red planet liquid water is
essential for life to thrive here on
earth so it's way better chances that
will find little green men on Mars now
or at least small microorganisms the
findings are based off of data taken
from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter a
spacecraft that orbits the Red Planet
back in 2010 the orbiter captured these
pictures of strange dark streaks on the
Martian surface they seemed to get
bigger during the summertime and smaller
during the wintertime the idea is that
liquid water filled with salts also
known as perchlorates flows down the
Martian surface depositing these salts
along the way it turns out we were right
spectral data from the orbiter shows
that molecular water is indeed inside
these dark streaks where this water is
coming from we're not really sure
the salts could be pulling it out of the
atmosphere or it could be coming from a
subsurface reservoir either way we'll
have to go there to make sure and this
news is definitely going to fuel the
fire behind NASA's journey to Mars</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
