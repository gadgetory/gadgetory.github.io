is knowing where to stand you can take
the most horrific ly awful pictures with
the best of cameras and you can take
great pictures with just about any
camera you can find on the street so we
went out and bought the Canon sx260
right now the vessel and camera on
amazon.com and we're going to give you a
few tips to show you how to take
drastically better images even with a
point-and-shoot like most things in
photography composition can be pretty
subjective but there are a few basic
ideas that will be helpful when you're
getting started always try to be aware
of the geometry in your photo especially
horizons keep your horizon relatively
straight as a starting point you really
should have a good reason for tilting
your camera also be mindful of the
so-called rule of thirds the center of
the frame is generally a zone of despair
and disappointment
zooming can help you achieve a soft
blurry background with a point-and-shoot
but if your subject isn't actually far
away from you just use your feet
zooming also makes it harder to keep a
steady shot so if you don't have a
tripod become a tripod walls railings
trees that crazy position from yoga last
night do whatever you have to to steady
your hand then there's the light when
you press the shutter button half way
the camera measures the light in the
scene and chews it to settings for the
photo this is called metering but you
can force the camera to meter different
parts of a scene just by pointing it
somewhere other than your subjects do
what you can to put light sources behind
you including and especially the Sun if
you want a bit more control leave the
plush prison of auto mode behind and try
aperture priority the aperture is the
size of the opening through which light
enters the lens and it also affects your
depth of field at a basic level depth of
field is what determines how blurry or
sharp your background is if auto mode
wants f/8 for example with that results
in a shutter speed that's too slow
switch to aperture priority mode and
open up your aperture to a lower number
you'll have a faster shutter speed that
might be better suited to your needs
okay so let's talk about flash as a
general rule just just turn it off
except for the darkest of circumstances
most cameras today will do all right
without the retina burning
assault-weapon that the manufacturer
decided you couldn't live without
seriously is this how you want to
remember your night it's like a PSA for
bad decisions don't be afraid to move or
to ask your subject to move look four
lamps can
street lights LED keychains road flares
pretty much any light source around you
will be better than the flash on your
point you shoot camera alright it's time
to let loose a little bit take
everything I just said and forget about
it then jump into the point-and-shoots
menu system and try manual mode with
wild abandon
experimentation and failure are how
photographers grow assuming you have a
patient subject you'd be surprised what
some simple adjustments can get you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
