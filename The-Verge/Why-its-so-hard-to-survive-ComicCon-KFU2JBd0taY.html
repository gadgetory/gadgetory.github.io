last week and this is my bed it's not
the most comfortable bed in the world
but it saved my life after 34 days in
the convention hall I kind of needed it
I'm gonna tell you about surviving
comic-con the first thing you need to
know is that comic-con is a hundred
thirty thousand people going to the same
place the convention center in san diego
and it's just not equipped to handle
those people this is from one of the big
panels and that's Robert Downey jr.
himself you know you're in Hall H you're
doing cool things you're seeing cool
 but the fact is you're tired you've
been online all day so at the end of it
it smells and you just want to go back
to bed this is a ninja turtle pizza
cannon sponsored by pizza hut which
sounds about as ridiculous as you can
imagine so what they were doing behind
the convention center was they had
people fire phone pizzas at these
cardboard cutouts as shredder and it was
truly truly depressing the line for the
pizza actual pizza was longer than for
this thing the red hood and arrow from
the show arrow cosplaying is a big deal
at the convention but if it's happening
you're not going to get anywhere and
these are two guys cosplay it's a female
character it's over ya know Deltora
drinking a coke so what the studio's
love to do is go really big anywhere in
the hall or anywhere around the
convention center so what legendary did
is they have ye amo del Toro come down
and because of the crowds I could only
talk to you for two seconds and then he
went to drink a coke everything is
 expensive it does like I get it
where have you in this room and we're
gonna make you spend five dollars for
bad hot dogs when I go back I'd have to
take a long vacation maybe yeah yeah
I'll go back out the back
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
