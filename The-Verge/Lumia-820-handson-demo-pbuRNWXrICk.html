we're looking at the Nokia Lumia 820 at
the rear device you've always got the
camera look that has actually told us
exactly how many mega thesis one's got
at the top we've got the headphone jack
and then see down the side and got the
regular power on the volume rocker and
the usual camera button that's usually
win this week we power this on they're
only letting us see the actual home
screen at the mounts we can't like go
around the interfaces stuff musi got the
capacitive buttons stand on the bottom
here very standard and you've got a
centralized USB port on the bottom here
which is something that we're hearing
that microsoft made of state of
standardized across all of their windows
phone 8 devices okay we once you got
removable covers here so they just pop
off and
reveal this looks like it may be the
charging the wireless charging one will
have to confirm that you will see other
battery in the back here and you got the
microSD Andy's sim slot here and it's
using NFC chip on this particular device
as well it's just sort of snaps straight
back in quite neatly as well there's no
like creepy anything okay so we're
looking at the Lumia 820 on the left
here versus the standard Lumia 900 if we
put them side-by-side see that screens
obviously very very similar it's the
same side screen but if we face them
together and see that the 8 20 s
actually not quiet still it's a little
bit slimmer than the than the 900 year
as well on the on the back of your skill
there the standard camera on him you
know hon were there and the new one on
the top of the 820 in terms of how they
fit in a hand I'd say the 820 you can
you could cover a lot a lot better you
can cover the interface a lot a lot
better with a single single fun which is
slight issue with the 900s it's quite
hard to reach especially when you want
actually changed options that are up in
the top left or top right okay one final
thing about the Lumia 820 and the Lumia
920 it's the ability to use the screen
with your finger also in cold weather
when you want to wear a glove and we'll
put this on this tiny little glove
somehow
you can you can touch the screen with
the glove and it'll still react that's
kind of that's kind of unique for a
smartphone a somewhat different for the
Lumia 820 so that was a closer look at
the Lumia 820 and stay tuned for more
information of the verge</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
