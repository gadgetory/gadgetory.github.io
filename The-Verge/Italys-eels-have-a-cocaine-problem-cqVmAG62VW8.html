it's pretty well known that money is
riddled with cocaine some 90% of all
bills circulating in the state's carry
traces of it it's safe to say that the
stuff can spread around pretty easily
but here's the thing all those fish in
the sea well they're getting a whiff of
that caviar too you see we're throwing a
lot of our into the water about
five trillion pieces of it and we know
what usually happens to sea animals when
they eat too much garbage they die case
in point
in 2012 Spanish scientists dissected a
beach sperm whale and found 37 pounds of
garbage blocking its stomach not exactly
a great way to go out and a lot of
chemicals like cocaine are getting into
the water system too it's become a
particular problem in Italy's rivers
specifically the Sarno River some 15
grams of cocaine flow through the Sarno
River each day that's $1,800 of the
stuff flowing downstream on a daily
basis but with powder chemicals like
cocaine the effects on sea organisms
aren't immediately apparent so a bunch
of scientists from their region
conducted experiments in which they
exposed fish to cocaine specifically to
the most cracked out looking thing in
the sea the European eel no not that one
yeah this one anyway after giving 20
nanograms of the stuff to the eels they
found some expectedly negative results
on top of exhibiting hyperactive
behavior the coked-out eels experienced
changes in the intestine and skin at the
microscopic level for instance light
micrograph showed a strong decrease in
the number of mucous cells lining their
skin which is pretty bad for eels
considering that the mucus aids in the
defense against pathogens and helps them
recognize sexual partners sucks mucus so
yeah the idea of a coked-out
eel is pretty funny but the consequences
of a chemically imbalanced ocean isn't
the fact is we are pouring much more
harmful into the ocean than cocaine
and while experiments like these might
seem silly what they show is a peek into
the future filled with toxic oceans and
coked-out eels so before we throw
god-knows-what down the toilets let's
pause and reflect let's dare to keep the
oceans clean and the eels drugged
free</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
