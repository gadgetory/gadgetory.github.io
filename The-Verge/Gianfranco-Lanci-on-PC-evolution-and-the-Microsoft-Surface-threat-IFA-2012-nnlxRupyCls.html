sitting here with John Franco lunchy
president of emea region for lenovo
you've introduced a selection of new
products they can you give us an
overview of what they are we produced
quite a quite a good number of a new
product yeah first of all I think we
introduced a new king panda ultrabook i
think is probably the thinnest and light
travelling in the world also the lighter
what is a really different is that is a
carbon carbon fibers of material is a
new material we we are dealing with the
carbon fiber material since 92 so it's
not not completely new the real
difference that is this is a new
material in terms of confinement much
more stronger than what we were used to
or what industry were used to to get to
get before okay here's an interesting
question you say there were carbon
fibers and I had to but who is the we in
this part is it lenovo the company or
IBM who's think that brand and business
you guys took over who has been dealing
with for that amount of time in 92 for
sure it was IBM acting right I don't
think it was great was early no no no I
mean it just kept me from it is coming
from IBM experience but even remember
other notebook during the history of
using carbon fiber I think the real
difference that the carbon fiber you get
today camber fiber is a very strong
material as sometimes it's too much
flexible what you get today is a strong
material and not not not as flexible as
before so you really you really can
generate a stronger strong notebook in
terms of reliability yeah and rigidity
and much more much more richer than and
in terms of waiter of course it's only
the under pound or so but very very
light I just wanted to pick up on the
thinkpad branding and the take home from
IBM etc that brand did that name is
really the
and I gave them over foothold into the
region that you're in charge of now
you're primarily it's big market what
does the think pad and think pc branding
mean today well how do you want people
to react to it as consumers because
you've diversified it isn't just the
thinkpad profession business laptops as
you say you not have carbon fiber bodies
you never had that before laptops you're
introducing new designs like the chiclet
keyboard design your kind of evolving it
so what would you say the brand means
people nowadays I I think that when you
look at the team part that the meaning
of the brand is still is still the same
it's it means you know first of all
professional brenda is still you know
the brand we use to address big
enterprise and global account it means
and reliability manage media t strong a
very strong strong product very
professional like that of course even
when you think about professional
product design become important so how
is much more nicer than maybe I think
but one or two two years ago in terms of
design but when you think about the
meaning of the of the thinkpad brand i
think is still still the same it's a
recognized probably number one brand
when you think about professional or
commercial commercial application and we
want to keep thinkpad with this kind of
brand reputation and brand definition so
okay so you're sticking with the
professional aspect but do you not want
to have the thinkpad brand do you not
want to push it more and into the
consumer market or do you still want to
see to be for it to be seen as a
professional product and everything's
like your idea line to fill the consumer
space i I think we will continue to
manage thinkpad for commercial for the
professional space and 12 idea Brenda
for
or for consumer we also introduce some
new product on on the idea brand which
is an ultrabook like kind of product is
not really a new trouble because it's a
little bit thicker than oh don't worry
don't worry did they put all triple
labels and everything updates yeah but
the dread standard definition is 21
millimeter this is a little bit more
than 21 millimeter but it's in terms of
look and feel really looks like a new
trabucco and it's a very very affordable
product because we start from 499 when
you if you think an ultrabook today is 7
9 999 999 fair enough i mean the reason
i keep asking about the ping pad is
because i myself consider myself more or
less a consumer and by interesting or
less though is the consumer but at the
same time I look at these professional
devices such a thing bad and kind of
think of them as aspirational devices so
yes they were expensive but the things
that appeal to professionals are also
the things that appeal to myself as well
so when you say professionals like
carbon fiber because it gives you a
rigid body and reliability well
consumers like that too so what I was
really hoping I think a lot of people
might be hoping is for the noble to take
the thing branding and that same
standard of quality and then bring it
down to you know more affordable prices
maybe would you look to do that you know
if you develop product with the certain
specs and certain features in terms of
material and so on of course then you
need to look at certain price point
amigos very spring break it down the
price point the 9th cir you need the
tube to cut a certain team so it's not
that it's possible to bring down the
hand the price of the product
independently from from the
manufacturing costs and from the
material material costs that's
understandable and also i wanted to ask
you about something you said that your
primary business your core business is
still pc and during your presentation
today and while i was happening I really
wanted to ask you what does that mean
anymore because particularly windows 8
Microsoft is changing what we
easy and the way that you described is
that the pc is changing as well i think
when we say that our core business is
tpc because we believe that the pc is
evolving pcs evolving in you know
different for fact or different display
size it's not not not anymore a
tradition or not book or deck so as it
was in perceived until yesterday I would
say but is still a pc that is through
Microsoft with windows 8 introduction is
bringing a lot of new fun factor from
tablet to set a lot of different
convertible or the touchable or any kind
of a different idea you can you can
think about but is still a pc in the
sense that still running within the
ecosystem of pc ecosystem that its own
which is windows it's also becoming
touch which is of course different user
experience is what we call a pc plus
definitions pc with the evolution of
with the evolution of pc we see in the
future but is still a when when i look
at technology from technology point of
view and in terms of how you handle this
kind of product how you manage in terms
of us are indeed this kind of product
still I would say a PC remember easy
plus what we mean for PC plus a is all
the other devices you can think about
coming together with pc in in the next
in the next camming the quarters over
here related to from one side windows 8
introduction can be tablet or even other
products like android the tablet we also
announced today to three different
android tablet from seven inches to nine
inches to 10 inches at least it's
another portion of what we call pc plus
so it's a would say multiple devices
with the different screen sizes maybe
even four different up
asian from user point of view but still
in the PC in the PC world i speaking of
the pc world that's actually great lead
we have to ask you about this how do you
feel about microsoft surface tablets how
do you feel about their presence now in
the market in the hardware market what
we feel i think it's very good that
microsoft came with with the with the
tablet showing that they are very
confident in from one side windows 8 and
also tablet tablet application with with
with the windows 8 we are not negative
in the sense that it's another layer in
the adware space fine but I link on the
other side it's a clear indication to
consumer they strongly believe and I
think it cannot the industry to
establish windows 8 not only for
traditional PC but also for new for new
from facto we are not negative at olin
on windows microsoft com ingens another
competitor and what people think is a
very strong comparison because it looks
like a promising cell lysis surface a
for sure is a very good device and i
think it will push the entire industry
to develop good devices and to be more
competitive you know too if i look at
the invite today when when you look at
this industry there are more or less
three different ecosystem and windows is
one of the ecosystem I think we have
been working and we have with Microsoft
for a long period of time is very good
partner of us we really don't see the
problem Michaels of coming introducing a
tablet and showing to the world what you
can do with windows 8 see your solution
is just make a better tablet it will
pusher the industry to make a better
tablet yes which is good for the
industry and for consumer absolutely and
I'm not topic actually there is they're
having this sort of trend particularly
wonders identified by analysts of the
industry to us to say that innovation is
kind of moving toward the software side
of things rather than hardware do you
feel that's the case that you kind of
read we're all kind of reaching the
maximum that we can achieve with
hardware innovation and now it's a
matter of innovating on the software
side of things I think we will continue
to see innovation on the other side you
also will continue to see innovation on
the software side work is really
different in my opinion that today
probably you also need to think about
how you integrate are going softer
together and you need also in innovation
from integration point of view but I
think we will continue to the
integration on outdoors way in
innovation or not do as well and this is
something now who is actively looking
into it and this is something where we
are we are looking at this portion we
are looking at the other portion as well
so I'll to integrate argue and software
when you think about tablet or even
smartphone that the integration part is
bigger but if you think from our point
of view I don't think innovation is we
are at the end of innovation you you you
we will see a lot of things coming in
the next couple of years talking about
innovation that
you know today this place do you eejit
22 years from now display would be one
hundred percent flexible affordable and
flexible because it's already possible
but it's a little bit of space so you
can think about the lies that are
totally different than the current from
photo trendy these are very no in fact
looking forward yes it's not done and
I'm not topic actually I just want to
bring it back to the carbon fiber years
because one thing that also really
excites me is can we see a carbon fiber
think phone have you considered that but
I think carbon fiber is good when you
think about the big surface it's not a
case that has been used for the Boeing
787 I and there was not almost
availability of carbon fiber in the
world for a certain period of time
because a plane industry was almost
taking one hundred percent of the
capacity carbon fiber makes sense when
you think about certain certain size if
you go to small size in terms of you
know it types of waiter we were almost
done great anything because it's too
small and even in terms of
material and rigidity of material and
it's not really making a big differences
oh ok so the benefit just isn't
worthless and the expense although I
must say again speaking from a consumer
point of view there there are many many
people out there who would love just to
buy it just to be able to say they have
a carbon fiber phone particularly one
branded as a thing phone I mean
seriously think people think about and
just just to quickly wrap up I want to
ask you about into an arm because you've
done two things which are novel with
both companies so on the inter side you
did the cake hundred phone over in China
which is one of the very first intermed
few phones into moving into the
smartphone arena so first it was because
that being a success for you how's the
reaction being we're question in China
digo smartphone we are really very
successful we became not to get the K
it's running well it's okay yes say well
any chance you can see that going global
on smartphone our strategy i think is
very very clear today i think we want to
continue to grow in China we want to
continue to build up our know-how and
scale in China where we have a stone
Brenda strong presence it's a good
combination of what you need in order to
be successful on a smartphone in the
meantime we will look outside the China
and when
the right dimension in terms of market
share and also the right brand the
reputation or we build up the strong
brand outside the China in some in some
region in some country we will also
introduce a smartphone in the future but
for the time being it in focus is on
China and to make sure that we are doing
well in China and we build up their I
knowledge and the right capability in in
China that's fair enough and turn to the
outside arm is now coming into the
windows / pc arena and you've done a
Windows RT tablet well tablet / laptop
because everybody seems to be doing this
convertible hybrid device nowadays you
have the yoga and it has Tegra 3 it's
running take a free so which say you're
making a big bet on arm and arm based
pcs or is that more of an experiment for
you I think in the in the future we will
see a good combination of was a
different operating system and
indifferent cpu to be successful I think
you know Intel is good for certain
application I'm can be good for other
application it depends on which kind of
a solution that you want to bring to the
user but I Linda is a space for for both
and just finally I know you've been
asked this question a whole heap of
times but I'm curious and I have to know
you used to be CEO of ASA you now want
to want to live I think everybody knows
that about you you know one of the
leading figures at lenovo i just hoping
you might be able to compare the two
companies for us in a very general sense
terms of their culture and ambition and
I guess where each company wants to be
would you say they're very different Oh
what similarities my baby between them
and a company for sure are different i
think lenovo is also do probably to that
position of IBM how they build up by the
business during the last few years i
think it's a three global company you
don't find the too many pc company that
idea
our company today and when I say global
I mean not a company with the 200
offices around the world because this is
a really simple you go you open
different offices around the world and
you have 200 offices when I say global I
mean company that is run by people
executive coming from a different region
of the world with different culture with
different experience so a good
integration of people understanding also
different different market situation and
so on and this is I think it's almost
unique in this industry if I look at the
picture today the other important thing
or the other big difference if i compare
with the with the other companies that I
think Leno has a very strong commercial
business and those strong consumer
business at least in China consumer
business but we want also to develop
consumer business outside the China so
it's a very good balance between
commercial and consumer and again that
are probably not too many company with
the good balance between commercial and
consumer when when i look at the pc
arena today I probably only one not ugly
frankly speaking so I think did and the
other which company referring to my HP
that's not so difficult because all the
other are either focus on consumer or
focus on on kamesha but it's very diff
you to find the people there was
actually some speculation by HP pending
its consumer PC business o our back but
if I look at what the side until
yesterday I don't think so that I don't
know what you actually know something
more but I don't think so well it's an
interesting perspective and the other
thing in my way that well he's very very
different again if i look at lenovo we
have a very strong base in china and
china is by far the largest market for
pc and if you look at the pc story
usually company that has been very
successful in pc it is because they
build up the business of the starter
coming from strong home base and then
they have been able to
the outside so I think these are the
three major difference I think global
stronger base in China so strong base in
the largest market in the world and good
balance between commercial and goes you
one so in summary what you're saying is
first you take China then you take the
world yeah like oh let's say first till
you grow in China or certain things and
then you can go outside but because this
business is a matter of scale so you if
you have a good strong home food well
you can develop scale he said if you
look at history OPC most of the company
were coming from us not because they
were better than other companies in
because they had a big market home
market where they could start and they
could build up knowledge and scale all
right thanks very much Rita thank you
thank you pretty appreciative</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
