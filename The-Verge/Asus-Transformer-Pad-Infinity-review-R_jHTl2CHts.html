the Asus Transformer Pad Infinity it's
the top of the line asu's tablet the
update to the transformer prime which is
actually still one of the best android
tablets we've seen yet this is a really
good looking device it has a metallic
build in the same concentric circle
design on the back which kind of looks
like rings on a tree trunk ways one
point three pounds and it's just about a
third of an inch thick which is right in
line with the iPad but with the metallic
and kind of solid build it definitely
feels like it would win in a fight with
apple's tablet the best advantage that a
Seuss's tablets have always had
including the Infinity is its keyboard
dock which adds a full qwerty keyboard
and a trackpad and really makes the
whole thing feel like a laptop it works
pretty well you get two finger scrolling
typing is much faster than using the
on-screen keyboard but it makes the
whole tablet kind of cumbersome and
heavy plus it's clunky to get in and out
you really have to jam the tablet into
the keyboard on the tablet itself you
get a surprisingly decent 8 megapixel
camera microSD card slot and micro HDMI
out but the best hardware feature by far
is the display it's a 1920 x 1200 screen
and looks really good it's the biggest
update over a Seuss's other tablets
which have been lower res and this is a
huge reason to get the Infinity it's
insanely bright has really good viewing
angles and everything is sharp though as
you've seen with some tablets colors can
be a tiny bit over contrasted and
saturated the one speaker on the device
is really nothing special it's just a
single mono speaker and it sounds good
but it never really gets very loud
starting this week the transformer
infinity comes with Android 4.1 jelly
bean it's now the only tablet other than
the nexus 7 to have Google's latest
operating system and it really is a nice
upgrade you get features like Google now
and the expandable notifications and
everything is faster and smoother from
scrolling to launching and closing apps
but unfortunately it's not quite as good
as the nexus 7 oddly there are still
lags and stutters when you're scrolling
through web pages are pinching and
zooming that just don't exist on the
pure jelly bean on the Nexus 7 and
unfortunately the big problem that still
hasn't been solved on Android is the
tablet app problem there just aren't
very many apps designed for the bigger
screen it's also hard to find 1080p
streaming content so the screen is just
really not as useful as it could be if
you have your own local content it looks
great but finding things that really
take advantage of this screen is tough
in general performance is pretty solid
the Tegra 3 processor is really good for
gaming and as we've seen with a lot of
other tablets is perfectly useful
overall and with jelly bean upgrade you
definitely do get a smoother overall
experience even though it's not the game
changer we'd hoped the Tegra 3 is
clocked at 1.6 gigahertz but you can use
different power modes to move the clock
speed up or down to trying it more
battery life or better performance
better life incidentally is really good
you only need to charge it about every
three days with normal use though a lot
of high def movie streaming or gaming
kills it faster there's also a huge
battery inside the dock which nearly
doubles the capacity which is pretty
great overall the transformer pad
infinity is kind of a hard product to
review it's great for watching movies or
anything else that takes advantage of
the 1920 x 1200 screen and Google now is
great but the rest of the jelly bean
upgrade isn't quite as impressive as I
had hoped it's also a 499 dollar tablet
at which point it's competing with the
iPad and basically every other tablet on
the market and even if you want the best
Android experience that's still the
nexus 7 you'll have to get a smaller
lower res screen but it really seems to
take better advantage of what jelly bean
is doing but if you want a big HD
android tablet you really can't beat the
transformer pad infinity</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
