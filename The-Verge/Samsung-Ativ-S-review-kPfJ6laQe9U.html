verge and we're looking at samsung's
ative s windows phone which at first
glance looks very similar to the
company's s 3 and s 2 android phones
looking more closely at devices
obviously running Microsoft's latest
Windows Phone 8 operating system and
Samsung has opted for capacitive back
and search buttons the company is also
included a physical windows button when
it's triggered it will wait the device
looking at the front of this handset is
a 1.9 megapixel camera there's part of a
gray color scheme that wraps around the
four point eight inch display size of
devices a camera button at the bottom
and a power one at the top and there's
no volume rock on the right hand side
you return to the very left of the
device you can see the volume rocker the
side they're moving to the bottom of the
atty vests there's a microUSB port that
sits at the very center the device this
appears to be a common placement area
for windows phone 8 at the top is a
headphone jack which sits above a
brushed aluminium back which at first
glance looks like it's metallic but when
you pry a little bit closer it's clear
it's plastic once you remove the rear
cover of the atty vest then you met with
the familiar bendy plastic of a samsung
battery killer the battery itself is
removal and there's also micro-sim and
microSD slots this is particularly
useful if you want still photos music or
movies on your device if you look more
closely at the activist it becomes very
clear this is a standard windows phone
samsung has done very little to
differentiate from the competition
familiar features like the People Hub
with Twitter and Facebook integration
and Microsoft's new Xbox music service
are a core part of the active s biol
active scene Samsung really extend my
cloths operating system here there's a
pre-installed now app that features
weather news and stocks information and
a chat app for cross-platform messaging
but most of the apps replicate
functionality that's already baked in or
is available from other popular services
like evernote one note or whatsapp it
just really feels like Samsung's got
hardware right here but they could do a
whole lot more on the software side for
Windows Phone 8 moving over to the
camera on the atty VES it needs to be
the same 8-megapixel one that's
available in the galaxy s free despite
much new lenses feature sam sam hasn't
opted to create its own software here
and the options for shooting photos are
fairly basic there's no panorama there's
no burst mode or any other similar
options that could be found on rival
windows phones thankfully Samsung has
opted for 1080p is default video
resolution I found that results in
daylight were fairly standard for a
smartphone the pictures aren't too
blurry and although it copes well in low
light it's no match for Nokia's Lumia
920 the atty VES is a lot better looking
and functional than I expected it might
have a four point eight inch display but
it's easy to use in one hand and the
slimline design helps you ensure it
remains that way it includes a large
battery that will easily see you through
a day's worth of push email calls and
other moderate smartphone use competitor
competition from HTC ax and Nokia's
Lumia 920 there's a lot of choice and
some difficult decisions to make if
you're opting for a windows phone it's
hard to pick between all three but
colorful handsets and better software
support my lure shoppers to HTC or Nokia
however Samsung has a solid device here
that you won't be disappointed with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
