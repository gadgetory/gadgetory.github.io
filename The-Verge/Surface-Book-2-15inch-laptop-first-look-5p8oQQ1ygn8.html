surface book it's a laptop that
Microsoft makes with a detachable screen
that turns into a little tablet now
there's a new version of out this is the
surface book - it's a 13.5 inch but new
this year is this big guy the surface
book - 15 inch let's take a closer look
so the surface book is Microsoft line of
high-end professional laptops that means
I have super fast processors graphics
that put smaller laptops to shame and
they just have a very nice design which
is basically the same from what you've
seen from the four so when you close it
there is a little bit of a gap here but
that's because this fancy hinge is
designed so that when you open it up
even though the top isn't a whole tablet
it stays balanced the other thing that's
new this year you hit this button to
eject the screen you can pop it off the
little mechanism for attaching it is way
stronger now they have these new metal
fangs that fit into the slot so the
whole thing is a little bit more rigid
and as long as I'm holding this this is
the 15 inch version of the tablet and it
is kind of shocking how light the design
is way lighter than you would expect it
to be honestly and it looks really
really good it's a very high resolution
really good color and of course you know
it's a touchscreen and even when you
dock it the 15 inch is still remarkably
light it's just over four pounds so you
know for a laptop of this class
that's about appropriate you might
expect it to be way heavier with you lot
of power in here but they've done a
pretty good job now Microsoft put a lot
of work into the keyboard but the funny
thing is is that it kind of doesn't show
because it's just really good without
pointing out that it's really really
good it's got a good key travel good
click eNOS it's a solid keyboard some
other really nice new design features
here this 13 inch version doesn't have
any fans in the top of the laptop here
in the screen there might be some in the
bottom if you're running the graphics
card or whatever and here you'll notice
that the keyboard if you look closely it
doesn't have a little divot or under it
anymore it's just a smooth big line on
it so that looks way better oh and if
you go into you know tablet mode each of
the tablets and these things should last
about 5 hours on there
Microsoft is also claiming 17 hours of
battery life on these things but you
should know that Microsoft measures
battery life a little bit differently
than other companies they measure the
video watching time so you might not get
that much in actual real use but either
way it is a remarkably long time for a
laptop of this class to last all right
all right I know you want to know what
specs you wanted a lot of power so let's
get into it
both of these laptops come with the
eighth generation of Intel's Core i5 or
i7 processors and what that eighth
generation means is that their quad core
processors instead of dual core like you
might have seen before on the 13-inch
you have an NVIDIA GeForce 1050 graphics
card and over here on the 15 inch it's a
1060 that means that it should be more
than enough power to run Virtual Reality
run mixed reality run all sorts of CAD
and other sorts of high-end things and
also game at a pretty high frame rate if
you want to okay ports everybody loves
ports I love ports you love ports
whatever we're talking about ports
Microsoft is keeping plain old standard
traditional USB a on the sides next to a
big ol SD card slot so they are not
keeping any of that away from you but
praise be they have added USB C which
you can use for a USB see stuff or you
know a display there's also of course
the traditional surface connector which
is a little magnetic wing that fits on
the side and I know we got to point it
out it's 3.5 jack on the tablet side of
it too so if you are looking for a pro
laptop that actually has the ports that
you want and don't want to have to live
that dongle life surface book pulls that
off now the thing you should know is
that getting a laptop with good graphics
processor or the attachable screen that
you can put it on the other side and the
really really powerful Intel processor
and the touchscreen pen and all that it
doesn't come cheap
so the 13.5 starts at $14.99 and the
15-inch starts at $24.99 and they'll
both be available starting November 16th
oh no doesn't poop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
