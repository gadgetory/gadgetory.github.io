Congress 2014 in Barcelona and Sony had
just concluded its press event here and
is shown up its new generation of Xperia
devices for 2014 this is the Xperia z2
and success to the said one and it's
also Xperia z2 tablet there isn't much
new about them in terms of industrial
design experience that you very much
looks like the originals at one however
the screen is now 5.2 inches
it keeps the same footprint but the
screen is larger and the pretty big
upgrade with the display is a new live
color LED IPS screen so the viewing
angles are much much improved and Sony
actually claims that this is the widest
color palette of any mobile devices this
applies for both the Xperia tablet Z 2
and the experience that some smartphone
it is very impressive I've lost so many
they said that it's a it's an even wider
color gamut than Apple's iPad and iPhone
so that's a quite cool impressive the
camera is still the same twenties 2.7
megapixel sensor as we've seen in the
set one quite powerful camera the sony
has added 4k video recording to it is
saying its borrowing technology from its
handycam range and it says
more mented reality tweaks and such
things to video now which you could have
had previously with just photos also
there's a new 120 frames a second slow
motion video recording at 720p
resolution that's a very nice and
impressive feature the somebody
demonstrated to me and quite happy to
have it but that's the Xperia z2 it's a
pretty decent upgrade and however
relative to the said one it's really all
about the display issue a quad-core
Snapdragon now it's 801 processor but
really isn't that much of a big leap and
it ships with Android 4.4 in March now
moving on to the Xperia z2 tablet again
it's very impressive in terms of the
display it's full HD 1920 by 1200 I
believe but it's those light color LEDs
and the IPS has played a very mark the
difference between this and the original
is that tablet from Sony and also the
thinnest this is a six point four
millimeters of thin tablets which makes
it one of the thinnest is certainly the
thinnest that is waterproof the Xperia
z2 smartphone is waterproof as well
naturally
unlike the Xperia z2 this is goes on the
front but doesn't have glass on the back
it's actually quite a grippy mat surface
you can have it in black or in white if
it was very good to the touch and it
extremely thin and light this is thinner
than the iPad air even though it's
pretty much the same size of 10.1 inches
and it's physically it's a very
impressive device it also has juice from
firing stereo speakers that is something
Sony calls S for surround sound and it
has new digital noise canceling
technology which works with bundled
headset which comes with both to square
two and it's worth it to charity
that this also ships with Android 4.4 it
also has a Snapdragon 801 processor your
on difference really between this and
smartphone is that it has an 8 megapixel
camera rather than 20 megapixel one and
you have a very set to so many scale on
here it's almost entirely stock Android
it's just little tweaks such as the
quick settings brightness etc that are
customized by Sony it's still very
familiar but really it's all about the
new industrial design with new spirit to
tablets and the new displays with Xperia
z2 and as a first look at them here at
Mobile World Congress in Barcelona</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
