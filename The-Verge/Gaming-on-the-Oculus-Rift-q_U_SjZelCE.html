here at GDC 2013 I'm about to try the
oculus rift development kit for my first
time we're also about to check out
Hawkin which hasn't been shown off
before today let's jump in this is
insane oh man this is incredible this is
like this is the most bizarre thing I've
ever done I've never played anything
like this before why are you guys here
what do you guys doing at GDC this year
what we're doing right now is shipping
developer kits and we're trying to get
these two people who want to develop
games in virtual reality so GDC is
filled with developers lots of indie
developers and we think that showing
these people what VR is like is that is
a really critical part of being
successful what types of developers do
you really want on board for this what
kind of experiences are you trying to
create out of the game you know to be
honest we don't know at this point we're
making these developer kits because we
don't know what kind of experiences are
the best experiences out there what's
happening is we're getting interest from
developers who are saying hey I think
that what I have could be a good VR
experience i really want to give this a
shot and so we want to make sure those
people are getting the developer kids
they need so maybe next year this you
know the same time of year maybe i'll
have a better answer as to you know what
kind of experiences should do we want to
be seeing more of on the rift oh my god
i feel like i'm actually in the air
right now see this is the kind of game I
want to play I just want to fly to be
great for a flight simulator I think
this would be unbelievable for
exploration games you know something
like I don't even a journey or you know
games that haven't really even been
conceived of yet imagine playing missed
on this thing
you know actually having to look around
at your environment definitely some
exciting prospects for you know non
violent games exploration games puzzle
games what about non games I mean
there's virtual reality is using a lot
of different applications PTSD therapy
for instance I used to work in a
military lab and I was one of the
projects that we work on yep there's
posttraumatic stress disorder treatment
for soldiers that's that's something
that's been an ongoing view our research
field for years there's people who want
to use it for education people want to
use it for police and fire training so
that you can train for certain
situations and how to react to them
without actually putting people in
harm's way there's people who want to
use this for telepresence tell a robotic
so they can operate machines at a
distance but feel like they're present
at the scene there's all kinds of
applications for virtual reality beyond
gaming but gaming is certainly the
single biggest one all right so this is
a bare-bones racing game demo it's
really weird that i can feel feel the
steering wheel but not see my hands on
the steering on the game it also feels
like I'm in a little balsa wood car but
that's okay should go fast oh god this
is this is sickening oh I'm definitely
yeah this is a this is way different
from Hawking you're going a lot faster I
could see this being insane an actual
game like Forza or need to speed or
something but I'm definitely I can feel
my stomach just turning oh god I feel
like my body wants to move but I can't
whoa oh my god I just spun the car out
have we've been talking developers I
mean it seems like there's a challenge
in like for instance team fortress 2
when you have a character like the Scout
that runs 40 miles an hour that's going
to make people sick potentially how do
you grapple with getting VR players and
non VR players in the same game together
is that something you've you have
concern about is that something
developers have been trying to figure
out you know tf2 it's a tf2 zone is a is
a title that Valve used so they could
collect these kinds of metrics they want
to see how people perform against each
other you know NVR a bait on bit as
opposed to out of ER they want to see
much kind of what kind of classes people
choose in VR what maps do they like how
long do they play what tends to make
them stop playing it's too early to say
you know what to try to solve problems
about how to have you know basically
competitive parity between normal
players and dr players because one of
the problems is that traditional
interfaces like a keyboard and mouse
they're super human you can do things
you can instantly accelerate
full-forward you can spin 360 degrees
and tenth of a second those are things
you can't possibly do in real life you
know you're using your natural body to
move so that I think there's always
going to be a disconnect I don't think
you're ever going to have the same
performance between a VR player and
keyboard mouse monitor player you might
have different advantages and different
disadvantages but balancing those is
going to take a lot of really long time
so I don't think we're close to that it
could just be for me but it seems like
racing games
are going to be sickening for sure and I
could see this you know any game where
you're really going fast will be nuts
all right I can't oh oh</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
