Samsung has released a galaxy note and
every year I think that I want one but
then I realized that the software is
annoying the hardware is kind of bulky
and the S Pen Stylus just isn't as
useful as I'd hoped
but now the note 5 is here and it's
happening again
I really like this phone but can this
love really laughs
if you somehow never heard of the note
here's the basics Samsung makes a huge
powerful big screen phone it throws in a
stylus with a bunch of software features
to support it but most important of all
is the specs
they've always been just off the charts
powerful the note is big its bulky and
it's beastly it's always been a phone
that gives you everything and the only
compromise is that it's huge but with a
note 5 things are a little different
because Samsung has taught itself a new
trick really good design the new note is
flat out beautiful it has a glass front
and back and metal edges and every
corner and edge has been softened and
curved and create a device that feels
incredibly well considered one thing
Samsung apparently decided not to worry
about fingerprints the phone doesn't
take long at all they look a little bit
scummy but luckily it's easy to wipe
down the left and right edge of the back
of the phone curved in and the bezels
are tiny too so the result is a phone
with a 5.7 inch screen that feels way
smaller than it actually is there's a
decently loud speaker on the bottom and
sensors all over the place including a
heart rate monitor on the back the 16
megapixel camera is great actually it's
stupendous it launches quickly with a
double click of the home button and it
takes pictures super fast too it handles
low-light really well and can even
broadcast live on YouTube it's the exact
same camera and software that you'll
find on the galaxy s6 and that means
there's very little to complain about
actually in a lot of ways the note 5 is
basically a blown-up galaxy s6 and
that's mostly a good thing but the
trade-off for this design is that the
note isn't quite the power user
Wonderland it used to be you get a
powerful processor and a massive 4
gigabytes of RAM but you can't upgrade
the storage with a micro SD card and you
can't remove the battery either more
troubling than that is that it's not a
gigantic one at only 3,000 milliamps so
it's smaller than it was before so I was
a little worried but I've been using the
note 5 for a little less than a week and
so far my experience is that it's good
enough to get you through a day but it's
a little too inconsistent to really
trust it to go for two days Samsung is
touting the multiple wired and wireless
fast charging options it's crammed in
here which helps if you only have a few
minutes to top
the real reason to get a note instead of
some other big phone even another
Samsung phone is the s-pen it's been
upgraded here with a little clicker on
the top you use to extricate it from the
phone and you also use it to fiddle with
when you're bored you can write on the
screen right away even when the phone is
off and you can grab entire web pages in
a screenshot to mark up another new
trick the phone will alert you if you've
walked away and left the pen at your
desk I really like the stylus and after
years of thinking it was a cheap gimmick
without enough software support the note
5 has kind of turned me around
the more I use it the more convinced I
am that Samsung has figured out the
software side of things for the pen
handwriting recognition in particular is
really impressive I can't read my own
handwriting but Samsung can speaking of
turning the software around Samsung has
finally found the right balance of
adding features without confusing the
hell out of its users the bloops and
water sounds are gone the extra weird
motion features are helpful without
being intrusive best of all the basic
look of Samsung's software is more
refined and elegant and there's a theme
store that's finally getting some
options that feel a lot more like good
old Android the unit we tested was the
international version so it's possible
that US carriers will spoil the software
but I'm hopeful it won't be too
overbearing at least Samsung has learned
the meaning of restraint and mostly
learn how to teach people how to use its
wild features like multitasking I did
have to dig through some S Pen settings
understand how it all works but for the
most part everything here is intuitive
the story of the note 5 is the story of
what Samsung can do when it holds itself
back instead of tacking on endless
features and juicing up every spec to
the max Samsung is refining the ones
that it's already created that all works
make a really good device but it's just
a little bit less note like than it was
before the note used to be something
like a computer mainframe in your pocket
but now it's just a really great phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
