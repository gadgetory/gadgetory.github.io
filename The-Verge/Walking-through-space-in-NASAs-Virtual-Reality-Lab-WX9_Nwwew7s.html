tumbling through space throughout my
career I've met a few astronauts but I
never really got to see how they train
for missions today I've convinced NASA
to show me how astronauts learn to do
their jobs before going to space and
that means doing a lot of simulations to
learn the basics and also to prepare for
the worst-case scenarios we're here at
the systems engineering simulator
facility
it's basically fancy talk for we're
gonna drive some spaceships NASA wants
to go into deep space and potentially to
Mars and astronauts are going to need a
way to get around fast when they're on
the surface of another planet best way
to do that a monster Rover I'm in a
rover right now or at least part of a
rover it's a simulation used so that
crewmembers can test out what it'll be
like to ride around on surfaces of
different planets since NASA wants to go
to Mars we are in jezero crater on Mars
right now which they think was a lake
bed at one time so of course it's
somewhere we're interested in exploring
further in the future and so you have
your hand controller there that is going
to control driving so that's both
acceleration and steering for the rover
now this isn't like your normal car we
have way more wheels right it's very
pretty wheel three you have 12 wheels
total so six sets of two the 12 wheels
can move in 360 degrees that means the
rover is capable of basically moving in
any direction forward back sideways even
spin around in a circle it takes a while
for the wheels to adjust though so it
felt kind of slow and you also have to
keep in mind that we have a third of
Earth's gravity here so it's gonna it's
gonna drive a little squirrely sometimes
a little more bouncy and you know if I
want to move forward I guess right
I've run into vehicle we can't leave
we're stuck on Mars forever driving in a
nice comfy Rover is fun and all but it's
not that immersive of an experience
you're kind of just sitting still moving
a joystick plus it's not really
practical right now since astronauts
won't be going to Mars for many years
but something that is a big part of
astronaut training these days is
spacewalks this is the neutral buoyancy
lab being underwater is the closest
thing we have on earth to recreating the
sensation of zero-g that giant structure
you see inside is an actual replica of
the International Space Station for
testing astronauts have to suit up
outside the pool with a lot of help and
then get slowly lowered in unfortunately
I won't be going in the pool today but
we have some tech that might supplement
for the time being I'm headed to Johnson
Space Center's virtual reality lab it's
where NASA trains astronauts to learn
how to do their spacewalks first up
learning how to maneuver outside the
station I have to replace a battery one
of the things you can do here with this
model since you're in VR you can
actually figure out what it's gonna take
to get from the airlock or from your
current worksite out to a new worksite
what you're going to do is we're going
to start you out here on the truss
you're right around s0 which is one two
trust segments it turns out replacing a
battery in space is way harder than
changing out the batteries in your
remote it's a two-person job with one
astronaut pulling out the old battery
and the other handing over a new unit
sounds easy right Pizza cake VR is great
at showing you exactly where everything
is going to be out there and whether you
have a good enough wingspan got it now
you can see you are climbing on the
handrail Wow okay so I want to go
there's my destination yeah I look off
to your right right yellow yeah you're
good at this I think they're testing for
a new astronaut
class coming out you know what you
should just go ahead and I'm clearly the
front-runner now all right I'm here is
that it that's it for now but what would
happen if your spacewalk didn't go
smoothly
astronauts are always tethered to the
ISS during spacewalks but NASA always
plans for the remote possibility of
someone getting disconnected well I was
going to experience that terrifying
scenario by getting knocked off the
station and then I had to get back
before you know I burned up in the
atmosphere when you go outside in case
they ever become separated from the
space station so they don't float off
right it's gonna be bad they come up
with a safety device that's basically a
jet backpack it's called safer it's
actually named NASA thinks of safer as a
life jacket in space it's more like a
backpack with jet thrusters that are
steered by hand controller so far safer
has never been needed for an actual
emergency and that's good because this
is a pretty dangerous scenario and you
don't have a lot of time to get back and
what about how much fuel do you have
before you run out approximately five to
ten minutes with a fuel depending on how
aggressive you are this is if you're
racing against the clock kind of thing
yes yes you can't just take your time
out there you need to get back out there
for more than say 15 minutes it gets
very unlikely you're gonna rescue so
there I am that tiny astronaut hanging
out at the Quest joint airlock and there
I am getting farther and farther away
from safety okay we're gonna make you
wait just a little bit now before power
up the unit they leave you spinning for
a little bit because you wouldn't be
able to get your bearings right away
you've got to slow yourself down and get
yourself under control
I may not also be screaming now you
would have come out and you would power
it on am I suppose it's gonna bring you
to a it's gonna cancel out your
rotations okay you'll see yourself
coming to a stop all right so now I need
to around in fine station
the station definitely to my left okay
so y'all to your left okay you'll want
to pitch down just a little bit you see
that round like the horseshoe shape
thing that is ear lock so you want to
point right back at that spot now that
I'm facing the station it's time to
switch modes you want to go over to
translation mode that means I can move
forward and back or left and right in a
straight line and now I'll start moving
towards it okay here we go I think we
might have changed the game definitely
get it it's a slow process again you
don't want to go fast am I going to you
guys know you're not going to in space a
little bit of thrust goes a long way all
you need is just a slight push to send
you going in the right direction again
the translations are very slow okay but
George Clooney moved was so much faster
just reach out if you can grab structure
you're saying and that was the easiest
case scenario other simulations have
astronauts moving away from the station
four times faster than that and at night
yes right at night well how long did it
take me to get back what I have actually
made it okay you're good
yeah clearly I'm a space walk master but
there's still a whole ton of things
astronauts have to do that I haven't
trained for like working the robotic arm
or doing lab experiments in zero-gravity
in fact it's a two-year training process
before you can even be assigned to a
mission these simulations are just the
tip of the iceberg
I would have had you climb further but
we weren't expecting you to do it very
well at it we didn't want to give you
too much people have a lot of problems
with that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
