I'm wishing i was a student today
because apple just released the new
ibooks to which is basically centered
around textbooks and they've come up
with some really interesting ways to
present text books to students so let's
dive in here so this is life on Earth
one of the textbooks that Apple demo
today and I'll turn down the volume here
but so it starts off with this really
nice video of the author sort of intro
in the book and so you've got the video
over here and then you can swipe right
into the textbook you've got a bunch of
chapters here and when you want to get
into the chapter you just select one of
the pages and you've got a pretty nice
textbook experience and so when you
rotate it this way you go up and down
but i prefer the landscape orientation
for going through some of these books
even though you get less text on the
page so you have interactive features
throughout this book which is pretty
cool select different things and can
zoom in on this and pop up you've got
some videos throughout see if this one
works and then it's going to tell you
what's going on in each of these videos
so that's pretty neat in terms of actual
text there's some neat tricks there you
can see here before I was underlining
let's try and do that at another page
with some more text so let's say come in
here i can highlight this whole
paragraph there we go can change the
color can also make a note right here
very important or very important and so
I'm in there and so you can do that
throughout the book and then when you
actually jump out jump back you can
always pinch in to go to the general
menu when you jump out and go to your
notes up here you'll see that the parts
you've clipped I'll come up here with
the notes right under it so that's a
pretty handy tool you can also go in
here to your study cards and that put
some of those notes on the study cards
but they also give you where are those
here they are so the glossary term
so you flip this over and you've got
definitions and whatnot so pretty nice
tools there one other thing I wanted to
show in the books see if I can go back
is that at the end of some chapters
there are some QA and questions test
taking stuff let's see if i can find
that here there we go yep here we go so
which one of these is a Savannah I'm
going to go with this one looks like I
was right as always so that is the
science textbook here and I'll take you
back out to an algebra textbook which
isn't as interesting doesn't have as
many videos or interactive features and
kind of tell that here they just layered
some stuff on top so you got basic
equations and practice samples and what
you really get here as you can click
here and there are some test taking tips
that's kind of neat other than that not
much else you can do in terms of
interaction in the algebra app so
overall that's a look here at ibooks to
hoping to see more of these sort of
interactive textbooks and there are tons
to look at but these are just some of
the samples</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
