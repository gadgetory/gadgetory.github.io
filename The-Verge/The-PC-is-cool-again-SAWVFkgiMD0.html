word PC chances are you might think of a
beige box that sits under an equally
beige monitor or if you're a gamer you
might think of a crazy contraption
that's got neon lights and liquid
cooling but as we've seen with laptops
recently the PC doesn't have to be ugly
boring or without any design at all like
laptops the all in one has gone through
a renaissance with new designs that are
both attractive and functional and offer
new ways to use the machine now more or
less started with Microsoft Surface
studio last year it's a 28 inch
all-in-one computer that can convert
into a drafting table for digital
artists it's stunning to look at and it
really changes your perceptions of what
both a PC can look like and what it can
do when Microsoft isn't the only company
rolling out these new head-turning
all-in-one designs and if you are in a
digital artist the three thousand dollar
plus surface studio probably doesn't
make a whole lot of sense for you even
if it does look beautiful both HP and
Dell have announced new computers this
year that have designs that would make
even the most die-hard Apple fans take
notice they also have unique hardware
features whether it's an ultra wide
display or crazy multi speaker sound
system this is Dells new XPS 27
all-in-one it packs a sharp vibrant 4k
display that also covers 100% of Adobe's
RGB color space which if you're a
designer you know is important to have
for accurate colors the XPS 27 is a lot
like an iMac and that all of its
computer parts are crammed behind the
display now below the screen is Dells
unique Hardware feature a 10 speaker
sound bar that's powered by 250 watt
amplifiers our unit has a 6th generation
Core i7 processor 16 gigabytes of RAM
512 gigabyte SSD and AMD sr9 and 470 X
graphics card it sells for about $2,800
but even if you get the entry-level
model that costs $1500 you still get a
4k display and the 10 speaker sound
system and most of the specs you need
for everyday stuff the 34 inch curved HP
Envy all-in-one is a completely
different beast it's got a massive 34
inch curved display that virtually
floats above its base now it's not 4k
it's got 38 40 by 1440 pixels the rest
and it's not a touchscreen but it's got
a matte finish and it's really pleasant
to look at and the curved design just
envelops you with Windows games videos
or whatever
now curved televisions kind of suck a
curb monitor is awesome because you're
always sitting in the sweet spot
HP put all the computer parts in the
Envy's base this model costs about two
thousand dollars and it has a seventh
generation Core i7 processor sixteen
gigabytes of RAM a 256 gigabyte SSD and
a one terabyte hard drive and an AMD
Radeon rx 460 graphics card
the base also has is four speakers that
fire up at you and on top of it is a
touch control for volume and play and
pause on the back and the sides are
loads of ports including HDMI in and out
there's even a spot to wirelessly charge
your smartphone now one of the coolest
things of the HP is the windows hello
webcam which you can hide from the NSA
when you're not using it both of these
machines are fine for everyday tasks and
computing they boot up quickly and
responsive to use they also have a
powerful desktop processor so they're
good for photo editing and multitasking
but neither of them are really great for
gaming if you do want a game
occasionally I would go with the HP it's
lower resolution screen a more capable
graphics card worked better in our tests
and despite both HP and Dell boasting
about the sound systems on these neither
of them sound all that great and they
really lack bass I'd add a subwoofer to
either of them also amusing despite the
fact that these machines cost fifteen
hundred dollars and sometimes a lot more
they come with some of the worst mice
and keyboards I've ever used
seriously Dell and HP stop putting this
garbage in with your computers it sucks
but despite those flaws these new
computers from Dell HP and Microsoft
prove that the PC doesn't have to be
boring or ugly or doesn't have any
design and in fact it can look really
cool on your desk and I kind of want
this one because it looks awesome which
if you're a designer you know is
important to have for accurate colors
it's also a touchscreen so you can
interact with your fingers on it
interact why don't you give that second
line up
right you the whole thing over again
that's it yeah boom boy good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
