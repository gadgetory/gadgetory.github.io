2013 and this device in front of me
you'll be familiar with is the Droid DNA
for Verizon it's a 5-inch 1080p phone
came out at the end of last year and it
is one of the highest spec phones we've
had and this thing right alongside it
today is the immediate Phoenix now the
Phoenix is essentially Nvidia's answer
to Detroit in a because it's 5-inch
1080p phone also quad-core book powered
by the Tegra 4 I the brand-new chip the
table 4i is kind of a lower power
version of this egg before it isn't
cortex a15 but it does come with an
integrated LTE modem
so essentially what Nvidia is trying to
show us here this is a reference device
it's one that OMS can essentially pick
up and build themselves it's a blueprint
that you can take and videos trying to
take these specs that we saw with the
Droid DNA which was really high-end when
it first came out and turn the
mainstream what CEO is told us Jensen
Guan is that he expects this kind of
thing to be a mainstream device than a
year's time we wanted to do we spend a
bit of time playing a couple of games in
this just to see also form a second
deliver all right so really and truly I
have no idea which one of these guys I'm
supposed to be but that's not really the
point of this demonstration we're trying
to get an ideas for the graphical
quality and it doesn't look like a an
attractive game do a lot of blood
splatters and because sweat dripping off
both boxes and things like that and
believe on the guy on the right because
it tapped to try and survive I've been
locked out so this game is Riptide gp2
which has been optimized for Tegra 4 it
comes with high textures and the
buildings more in the way of visual
effects the framerate isn't perfectly
smooth
then again this is first silicon is in
video tells us so you can't expect it to
be perfect all around but it should give
us an idea for sort of thing we can
expect to see in the future okay so
that's a quick first look at Nvidia's
phoenix development device this is still
just a blueprint essentially it's a
prototype
to give my factories an idea for what
they can do with the new Tegra 4 ID chip
and where they can take things in the
future</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
