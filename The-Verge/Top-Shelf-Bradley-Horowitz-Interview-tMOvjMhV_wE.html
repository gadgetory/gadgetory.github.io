things that Google launched this week is
Bradley Horowitz the vp of product for
Google+ Bradley thank you for taking the
time to talk to my pleasure so what I
want to know about is really the the two
big pillars of what happened with
Google+ this week were messaging and
photos why why those two things well I
think there's opportunity to do
something really significant and special
in both those categories for messaging
is you heard Vic say there's been lots
of point solutions over 50 years right
and the landscape is there such that we
all have devices we carry around whether
that's phones in our pocket or maybe
glass eventually but there's an
opportunity now that you could literally
reach another human on the planet with
very little impediment but we've gotten
in our own way protocols operating
systems you know media types photos
video it just doesn't work right there's
little pockets of success and you've
seen some of these that have just nailed
a single use case have taken off
dramatically it recently perhaps like
exactly yeah like there's incredible
viral potential for things that actually
execute on this and do well but there's
no product that works across media types
that's good for everything from text to
photos to video to emoji people love
emoji people of emoji we've got 850 in
hangouts I mean anything you can think
of and then some we have an opportunity
to distribute this widely between you
know things like Android and Chrome and
gmail we can actually put this in the
pocket or in the hand of every user on
the planet and so we saw an opportunity
with messaging to really get this right
we've seen tremendous uptake and love
for hangouts it's sort of the breakout
success of Google+ we we saw that we
could take what was special about that
really connecting people and make it
ubiquitous to give it to everybody and
give it for free that's another
important part of this if you're really
going to be successful you literally
have to give it to people
is the advantage there just the scale
that you have you said you're able to
bring it to everyone on the planet is
that just because it just by nature of
being Google you have this reach that
none of these other apps I think that
that's not necessarily new like we've
always had an opportunity to help users
get our products but what we haven't had
was the product that delivered on this
promise of across media types one-to-one
one-to-many cross operating systems now
we have that product we've got something
worth sharing with the world and that's
really exciting and so all of these
features are designed to in some way
keep me in Plus which is you know
obvious that's sort of your goal um but
so how does Google Plus is also it seems
like it's two different things it's the
spine as you've called it of all of the
other Google products and it's also its
own thing so where does with all this
new stuff how does Google Plus sort of
continue to influence the rest of
Google's products well one of the things
I loved about the epic three and a half
plus our keynote was sitting under the
good word for it and sort of counting
the number of times that the other non
google plus parts of the the keynote
mentioned Google+ and Google Plus
identity if you look at how tightly it's
woven into the Android story you know
that's one example music you know
everywhere you can see Google Plus as
the foundational layer that the company
is betting on to understand people their
relationships their interests and serve
them better so what about things like on
one of the things we like about services
like spotify and rdio is is that they
have this social layer where i can say
you know here's what my friends are
listening to and here's playlist my
friends made that i might want to listen
to do you imagine google+ being the
backbone of something like that as well
even for you know music and there's lots
of other opportunities for what Google
is trying to do with events and all yeah
sorts of stuff like my friends gonna be
a bigger part of my google experience
absolutely absolutely and that is our
stated intention with Google+ is that
every product that Google can be better
by by dint of you using your own data in
your own service and so whether it's
ride-sharing for maps or the ability to
see your friends on a map
and you know there's been lots of again
lots of point solutions that have sort
of taken off in as various domains but
we really feel we have an opportunity to
get this right and return a tremendous
amount of value to users and music is a
great example media in general is
something that is very social in nature
and there's huge value to be had there
and so I have to have to ask we've had
one sort of issue as we've used hangouts
and I'm curious about this so we have
everyone at the verge has you at least
two gmail accounts and often many and we
know that's a fairly common problem
among people so there's now this sort of
odd identity issue within Google+ what
it's like how do you find me and you
know if I search for Billy's on the
camera over here i got like it like six
different answer so how do you how do
you sort of manage people's identity a
little blah um we're not doing this well
and we feel it acutely at Google all of
us has to at least two accounts right we
have our personal gmail we have our
Google corporate account and we need to
do a better job I mean that's the short
answer is it's not you it's us and we're
working on it actively we feel your pain
turns out to be a relatively complicated
and subtle problem anytime you're
dealing with issues of identity and
authentication and accounts and account
ownership in some cases a organizing
entity owns the account and it gets very
complicated not as simple as just
meshing to as simple as washing things
together we'd have done it you know a
long time ago if it were that simple it
actually turns out to be pretty subtle
and nuanced but rest assured we're
working on it and again I think it is a
pain point we feel acutely and
we're working on it as hard and fast as
we can and so I guess what about Google+
as opposed to something like Twitter or
Facebook where people use these they
have huge numbers of users and you offer
on hand something different but on the
other hand something sort of competitive
with both of those how do you do see
those as playing together or are you
competing tangentially in a way that
they can all work together like how do
you oh you competing with as Google I
think the real opportunities are not
about competitors Larry had a great line
yesterday I think paraphrasing he said
something like we need to build products
that don't yet exist I think that's what
we're doing with something like hangouts
there is no product that does all that
hangouts does there's point solutions
that do this or that something like
photos the opportunity to take advantage
of the Google scale infrastructure to do
something great for people is something
that does not exist and is a relatively
valuable feature that's hard to
replicate so we're focused on bringing
these things that are not me to features
that clone existing products or other
networks those networks may be great and
they may have use cases that carry on
but that's not where our focus is and
it's not the kinds of things we shipped
yesterday and will continue chef you're
looking at the the bigger picture and
sort of how everything plays together we
really are you listen to Larry talk and
I really recommend if you've only got
you know 20 minutes to digest the
keynote spend them all on Larry's
comments at the end our products you'll
see in the market and you'll get to know
them that way but it's worth you know
listening to Larry he's got a vision for
what we can do with Google that will
change the world change people's lives
improve people's lives and it's a
powerful vision it's a long-term vision
you know it's not about a quick fix it's
about what can we do that's really
providing lasting durable value to
people that really gives them and
improve quality of life and so that's
the way he thinks about it that's the
way we think about it it's really much
less about competition it's about these
products that don't yet exist
and haven't even been imagined that's
where the real opportunity is Bradley
