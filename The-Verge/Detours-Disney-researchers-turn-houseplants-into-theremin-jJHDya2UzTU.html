University renowned worldwide as a
robotics and technology hub there's a
building on CMU's campus where they rent
out space to some of the largest and
most influential technology companies in
the world Intel has based their
applehead space there and so does Disney
Disney research Pittsburgh is where they
experiment with technology that can be
used in movies and in exhibits and at
theme parks most of what they do at
Disney research in Pittsburgh is
top-secret but they've been pretty open
about something called Botanica
interact-as's which is a plant embedded
with sensors that can make music we were
curious about the tanyka Center
activists so we invited our friends from
the band Cloud Nothings to see if they
could turn this experiment into an
actual viable instrument
so this research piece book research
laboratory and we are part of the Walt
Disney Company we invent technologies
so the foundation of the botanicals
Antarctica's project is what swept
frequency capacitive sensing that we
invented here in this research which
allows to make almost everything humans
plants objects water are in our tables
anything interactive touch sensitive
touching gesture interactive with a
single wire all you do is to plug wire
to something and this becomes
interactive right so the Batangas
Instructables is part of the longer
project which we're doing which is
creating technologies which allow us to
add interactivity to the world the
physical environment on a very large
scale right we all used to using mobile
phones and tablets and computers but
it's always you know it's in your hand
or it's either in the table or in the
lab how can we make the entire world
touched and safe how can we turn the
entire world into the computer right
that's kind of long-term vision where
that I've been working on for a few
years we have to use existing
infrastructure existing world and add
interactivity ad hoc
I see my goal was providing ingredients
by creating the basic ingredients which
are not available before and then I
giving these ingredients to creators
like this one I think felt like
different because this one like as you
go down this one or that one is you get
closer from the like flamingo guitar
I would try to like control it and play
one note but I think like sometimes even
just by moving a little bit closer to it
it would change the notes even if your
hand is in the same place so it has less
to do with where you're touching it and
more where you are in relation to it
as you touch it like just kind of like
keeps changing
I am an experimental electronic musician
and I spend most of my time playing
keyboards and synthesizers and working
with computers
when you use a computer a synthesizer or
something like that
you usually have more control over the
parameters and the way that things turn
out and the plants sort of give you a
bit of unpredictability being that it's
controlling the sound which is a lot
more unusual but also really kind of a
unique and sort of special compared to
other things that I've played before and
it's definitely different wasn't like
playing the drums if there were ways to
evolve some of the parameters in which
you control the plant so you have more
control over the notes that are being
played how fast they're being played and
at which rate they're being played and
stuff like that I think it'd be easier
to use as an instrument but right now it
seems that it's still like a prototype
do be a little more accurate with it
yeah it's actually kind of similar to a
the way a theremin works which is an old
electronic instrument the tracks pitch
depending on where your hand is when the
theremin first came out it was more of
just like a novelty thing and then their
musicians like Clara Rockmore who got
really good at playing the theremin and
ended up playing classical pieces on
them and sort of turning it into a
really unique thing so depends on what
somebody does with it I guess I mean
they could remain how it is and be very
primitive but then you never know if
somebody's going to come along and
master it and become the master plant
conductor I would take a lot of practice
maybe I got the plan
I think there are two kind of approaches
to research in Germany one approach is
we have a problem when you're trying to
solve another way of research is
technology opportunistic research when
you invent something right and then you
you know that by inventing that it's
very powerful and it's good
very very useful and and open a lot of
opportunities but you don't know what
this page is yet so we with this
technology we are in the process of
discovery where it can be used
interactive musical plants is one
opportunity smart door map is another
opportunity on what are you trying to
fill opportunity but the opportunities
are endless</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
