Michael Shane and I was originally cast
as short round in indiana jones and the
temple of doom this is 90 seconds on the
verge the rumors were true microsoft
announced massive company-wide
restructuring today CEO steve ballmer
wrote in a memo that the vision is for
quote one microsoft practically speaking
that means distilling the company down
to four different engineering groups in
the memo Ballmer says quote one strategy
united together with great communication
decisiveness and positive energy is the
only way to fly that or delta and
speaking of windows phone the nokia
lumia 1020 is here the new flagship
phone has a four and a half inch AMOLED
display and many of the same specs as
the Lumia 920 what's different however
is the camera the phone takes the sensor
from nokia's pureview 808 resulting in a
smartphone with a 41 megapixel camera
just remember that 41 megapixels isn't
worth much when the camera sensor is
about the size of a fingernail and
finally the next James Bond film has a
director and it's the guy that directed
the last Sam Mendes Wilhelm the 24th
Bond film scheduled to hit the US in
November of 2015 and yes Daniel Craig
will also be back as double 07 it
shouldn't be long before we find out
what crazy car James Bond will be
driving in the next film but I think we
all know that what everyone really cares
about is whether he'll be using iOS or
Android that's it for today's top
stories coming up tomorrow NASA
discovers a planet that rains glass
sideways at 4,500 miles per hour because
space is awesome</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
