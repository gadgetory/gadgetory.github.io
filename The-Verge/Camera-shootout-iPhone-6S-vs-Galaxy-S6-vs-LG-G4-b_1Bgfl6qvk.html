had the smartphone camera to beat if you
wanted a phone that took reliable and
consistent photos your best bet was to
go with whatever the latest iPhone was
available in the past year things have
changed the competition has really
stepped up its game and other smartphone
makers now have cameras worthy of
consideration both Samsung and LG have
released phones this year with really
impressive cameras that give the iPhone
some solid competition now we just saw
the iPhone 6s get released and Apple's
touting that we've got more resolution
this time around better performance in
low-light all with that same reliable
container of taking pictures on an
iPhone that we were always we're all
familiar with so we decided to take it
and sack it up against the best from
Samsung and LG so we've got Samsung's
best the galaxy s6 edge+ we've got
LG's best the LG g4 and we put them up
against Apple's best the iPhone 6s plus
yeah I brought these out and I put them
in a bunch of different situations
low-light macro portrait landscape you
know basically everything that you'd
want these cameras to succeed in so
first we've got a macro image here this
is a beautiful flower and this image is
really bright and vibrant but there's
some real issues here and namely you
don't really see them until you look
closely but it's actually out of focus
and we found this to be a pretty common
situation with the iPhone right focusing
up close to the iPhone is not
necessarily the easiest thing to do you
have to give yourself more space than I
think most people would expect and even
tapping the focus here didn't really
help and then on top of that you take
another look at some of the colors here
these flowers is we're actually going to
see our white around the edges but the
iPhone really kind of bled that color
throughout and you lose a lot of depth
of the color so let's take a look at
LG's version of this obviously a totally
different photo it's a totally different
photo much more in focus but it's also a
lot duller we don't get as much of the
pink here in the center of the flower as
we did with the iPhone and then we take
a look at Samsung's and Samsung's
basically splits the difference between
those two it's it's sharp we can see all
the way down into this flower over here
but it's also still very separated from
the background so you get this really
awesome depth
and there's a lot of color I mean we're
seeing dark pinks in here that we
weren't seeing in the iPhone and we're
seeing white really really light pink
out here at the edges that we weren't
seeing the iPhone so I mean color depth
actual depth clarity this one definitely
beat out all the others yeah I agree
there's some weirdness going on around
the edges here it looks like it may be a
little over sharpened but it doesn't
take away from the photo at all I think
that by far Samsung one this one
hands-down
so next photo we're going to look at is
one just right from the corner of
Central Park we got some flowers and
trees and stuff in the front nice
landscape with some buildings in the
background a lot of different competing
light highlights and shadows what do you
think we got the first thing I'm
noticing here is that where we saw the
sharpening wasn't really a problem on
Samsung the image of the flower here
it's kind of a mess you lose a lot of
detail in the center here and a lot of
detail around the edges because Samsung
is kind of over sharpening and you know
that's kind of counterintuitive to what
most people want or think you want a
really sharp image but when you apply it
artificially it can look really bad if
we flip over to what the iPhone did you
know you can see everything is just more
pleasant to the eye there's yeah it's
not as harsh to look at there's more
detail preserved in this area it's not
blown out and the image doesn't look as
as overly crisp to my eyes this is way
less aggressive of an image just right
from the highlights to the shadows to
that sharpening detail and that's what
Samsung's phone's seemed to do this when
there's a lot going on in a photo that's
when they're sharpening is kind of
exposed if it's a nice simpler shot like
that flower it's it's nice to sharpen it
up a little bit it doesn't have a lot of
stuff to play with but in a really busy
photo like this we can see that
Samsung's phone's kind of overdo it a
little bit but yeah this is probably
this is really Pleasant all the way to
the shadows in this building - you can
see these leaves in the dark up here but
without blowing out these flowers this
is just like exactly what you'd want to
take away from that setting you haven't
did a really impressive job here over
here on LG I can't say the same you got
blown out highlights here the image just
kind of looks just harsh to my eyes it's
it's kind of got a lot of the similar
sharpening issues as the Samsung and the
busy details here just make it
unpleasant to look at unfortunately so
here we've got a pretty standard
forward portraits head and shoulders
very common shot we are outdoors in
daylight here this particular image is
from the iPhone and for the most part
it's pretty good there's plenty of
detail here you got detail in your eyes
or eyelashes down to our hair the color
is a little weird though it's kind of
got this green cast which we saw a lot
with the iPhone photos and it becomes
really dramatic when we check out the
other photos from LG and Samsung colors
way more natural here yeah you can
really see it in her skin and then
definitely in the hair over here it's
kind of borrowing some of the blue from
the background here but the green cast
when you really pull back and look at
some of the other pictures is what
stands out here and we saw that in a
couple of the other iPhone photos that
we were taking it tended to if it got
the colors wrong it got them wrong green
and that's not really a great color to
let bleed into pictures that shouldn't
have green in this question it wasn't
portrait yeah it's just going to make it
makes the face look you know a little
sickly or so otherwise it's not bad
we've got some great detail here not too
much compression or anything but one
thing we did notice is that there's it
sounds like there's not a big difference
in the apertures between the iPhone and
the other phones right iPhone has a 2.2
aperture and the Samsung has f 1.9 and
the LG has an F 1.8 lens and that that
sounds really close but it actually
makes a pretty big difference he or she
looks compressed against the wall almost
everything's in detail or in focus but
you look at LG and the Samsung image and
there's some separation there between
her and the wall there's some depth in
this image and that little change in
aperture actually makes a really big
difference in a picture like this at
least when I'm close to the subject I
think I think the Samsung did the best
job here as far as balancing the color
the sharpness and the saturation what's
interesting though is is the LG is
really kind of almost a d saturated or
flat image which isn't great for
directly out of camera image but if you
want to edit your photos or something
like that after the fact this gives you
a good base to work with yeah I look at
a photo like this and I think about like
all the different directions I could
take it when I'm editing a picture
whereas I look at something like the one
that we got out of the s6 edge+
and I say you know this one's probably
already good enough to post somewhere I
don't really need to do too much to it
so that's really kind of a matter of
choice so I think most people are going
to want to do
less out of the camera and would like
something like this so we just took a
look at a portrait image taken in
daylight let's take a look at something
on the far end of the spectrum taking at
nighttime lit by phone screen and we can
see here this is the iPhone image we can
see that green cast again a lot of green
color in his face especially where it
falls off from light to shadow and then
we also see that the iPhone didn't
really handle the exposure too well it's
really blowing out some highlights here
around his nose and this forehead up
here so not really the best thing but
you got a usable image this is a really
challenging moment to get a picture it
was really dark out even though you can
still see a little bit of blue in this
guy it's not bad it kind of reminds me
of when you had a disposable camera and
you took a picture of the flash it's a
little harsh yeah and it's got that
green tint where as you can see if we
flip over to what Samsung did it's kind
of like the exact opposite all the green
has been replaced with this orange a
yellow which is way too extreme in this
case and I really dislike this image a
lot the other problems that I have in
this image is it's way oversaturated the
green is super green the red is super
red and even though it looks like
there's more detail in some of the areas
where the iPhone blew it out you can
tell it's just smeared and there's no
actual detail there so it's really
interesting how the two cameras handled
this similar situation differently and
really the winner I think here is the LG
you've got all the detail in his face as
best as you can preserve it it sure is
not too oversaturated and it's not
overexposed or green this is like the
perfect blend of enough sharpening to
get some detail out of the image enough
noise reductions that doesn't look
completely awful and I think a lot of
this is also due to the optical image
stabilization on the LG g4 all of these
phones have optical image stabilization
which is great and helps in especially
in low-light situations where you need a
longer exposure but LG's is definitely
in a different class from the other two
phones I mean you can hold this phone
and kind of rock it around a little bit
up and down and the image won't move on
the screen it's almost disorienting
so for a picture like this where you
need to be holding the phone there for
the shutter to open a little bit longer
to capture the image the optelec optical
image stabilization on the LG really
helped make this the best picture of the
three
yeah I agree so we just took a look at a
nighttime portrait now we've got kind of
like a nighttime landscape scene here
this is a highway and so all three
cameras use their optical stabilization
to the best they all are going to drag
the shutter quite a bit here so the cars
are going to hit some blur but the rest
of the detail should be sharp now this
here is the iPhone the image and it's
kind of cool there's not a lot of warm
tones in here it didn't pick up the
headlights as being warm and change its
white balance to that whereas if you
look at the LG here it's the exact
opposite it's that's a really warm in
comparison right it's kind of yellow
it's really kind of unnatural
I don't think this is a better image the
other thing that you can notice here
between the LG and the iPhone is in the
sky the LG is doing a ton of noise
reduction and blurring up there whereas
the iPhone kind of just holds the green
yeah it's a grainy but more neutral
duller photo but you might the detail is
at least not been touched and messed
around with too much whereas this has
definitely had some processing done
already but this is a sharper image and
I think it's again thanks to the optical
image stabilization you look at you just
follow the lines all the way down to the
center of the image and you can just see
a sharpness that isn't there in the
iPhone and especially when you look at
the sign that's way back here this green
sign you can pick up way more detail
than you can on the iPhone and I found
it almost even looks farther away I
think probably because it's a wider
field of view but you can actually read
it here on the LG and then I think even
better we get to the Samsung image we
have basically the happy medium you know
it's not the walls aren't completely
yellow with all that ambient light you
still get some of that natural daylight
that's barely still left up in the sky
balancing it all out you've got this
really kind of good movement from like
blue to warm and then you also have a
lot of really great detail you can see
the trash all along the highway all the
way down and you know you go back to the
iPhone image and that's a lot harder to
see here yeah but you still have some of
the problems that the LG one has like
you said you know you can see a bunch of
splotchiness up here in the sky which is
where it's doing some noise reduction
for you but otherwise this is probably
the best is the same deal we can see a
ton of detail back here as well you can
see the sign that where we couldn't see
it in the iPhone
but this is another case of like not one
of these three is too much better than
the other one they're all really kind of
a matter of taste where I phone is going
a little more natural a little less
processing but the LG and the Samsung
especially are going to give you
something better out of camera and ready
to post without doing any more work to
it yep
totally so I went into this expecting
that I was going to love one phone more
than the others but I and this really
wasn't the most scientific test it was a
very situational I was you know finding
things that I wanted to take pictures of
and just pulling these phones out of my
pocket and one by one thing those
pictures which i think is how most
people shoot and i think we got results
that reflect what most people shoot
right and we reviewing them on this
high-resolution large screen which
really isn't how most people review
their phone photos right they're looking
at them on their smartphone they're
sharing them to Instagram that they're
viewing on the smartphone or Facebook or
wherever it might be and the reality is
that any one of those photos that you
took earlier are going to look great on
any one of these screens it's really
hard to find those differences if we
looked at these same photos on a phone
screen it would be a lot harder to parse
those differences on exactly and so well
there's no real winner here there's no
real loser either right all of these
phones take great photos in a lot of
different situations and they're all
pretty reliable no matter what you want
to do with it afterwards and that hasn't
always been the case that's quite a bit
different than it was a couple years ago
yeah if we did this test if you like
even a year or two ago we would see much
different results and it would probably
be the iPhone that was the winner and it
you know it's it's these two other
companies Samsung and LG that stepped up
their game we were able to catch up to
where the iPhone was at and really give
people cameras that are just as good if
not better in some situations then the
iPhone has always been and so now really
any one of these cameras on these phones
is going to get you the image that you
want to get right so now it's just up to
us to take good photos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
