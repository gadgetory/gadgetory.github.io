is my first time riding a hoverboard
this is the new model from swagway one
of the biggest companies that makes of
the hood and it is called the swag frog
things that are different about this one
is in response to a lot of the
controversy you hear about Tom avoids
being dangerous and catching fire this
one has a fire retardant plastic shell
and rubber footprints the lithium-ion
battery inside is also contained in an
aluminium shell basically the design is
intended to be a lot safer even in the
event of a battery explosion I have
never ridden hoverboard before so I
can't really compare how easy it is to
ride two other models but what I will
say is that I I'd fall off things like
this all the time every time I try them
and I think I'm doing ok with this one I
have not really fallen off apart from
the last time I tried doing this her
stand-up pork and beer and my video
editor caught me forming on so more new
features in the swag tour and include an
app that works over Bluetooth so you can
track things like battery life and the
speed though I probably wouldn't
recommend checking it while you're
actually riding the thing also on the
under side there are Bluetooth speakers
so you can pump out some tunes while
riding your hoverboard and there's also
a carrying handle on the bottom so even
though it's pretty heavy you can lift it
up easily I did also get the chance to
try out the original swagway hoverboard
the matter of comparison and this one
because it's still a prototype the
software isn't quite finalized so it
doesn't feel quite as smooth to write as
the original just yet and it's a little
bit slower to but I'm assured by swagway
that that will be
that by design necrotic ships so stay
tuned to the Bergeron this week for all
the coverage of rideable and hoverboards
right out of CES and of course subscribe
