phones with gimmicks of varying success
there's the iPhone success and it's
pressure sensitive screen Samsung's
Galaxy edge phones with their curved
screens and VR headsets and then LG's
transformer like g5 but this phone
doesn't have any gimmicks it doesn't
have any special unique features it
doesn't even really have a
groundbreaking design it's just a smart
phone it's a good smart phone but it's
just a phone
it's HTC's new 10 the 10 looks exactly
like you might expect an HTC phone to
look it's got lots of aluminum with
these large chamfered sides and rounded
corners feels really solid it's really
well made it's just not really an
inspiring design it's kind of just an
evolution of what HTC has been doing
since 2013's one m7 I don't think that's
really a bad thing
but it's definitely not going to turn
any heads obviously the 10 has a display
it's a 5.2 inch screen it's Super LCD
version 5 now quad HD resolution it's
really sharp and bright and vibrant it's
probably not quite as saturated as a
samsung galaxy phone below the screen
you of course have a fingerprint scanner
because it's 2016 and of course it has a
fingerprint scanner and then it's got
two capacitive buttons decide that the
one thing that you won't find on this
HTC are two front-facing speakers
this one has a base speaker in the
bottom and a treble speaker in top and
they're each powered by different amps
they get pretty loud and they sound
really good but they're not really that
much different than in the other smart
phone HTC's flagship phones have
struggled with their cameras for years
for the 10 HTC said it's fixed most of
those problems it's got a 12 megapixel
camera with an F 1.8 aperture lens
optical image stabilization laser
autofocus dual LED flash it's a much
better camera than any other HTC phone
before it but it's not really the best
on the market it's slow to launch it can
be slow to capture and the image quality
isn't as good as Samsung's are in
low-light the other thing that HTC
missed on is with the launching from the
lockscreen
it has a double swipe gesture to launch
the camera which is bit slow and kind of
clumsy took me a lot of practice to get
this right HTC hasn't forgotten about
the 10s front camera either it's 5
megapixels and has optical image
stabilization which is a first for a
smartphone that means that your images
in low light or at the bar are going to
be sharper in your videos for snapchat
are going to look a lot better with this
camera than with other selfie cameras as
you might expect the 10 has
the performance stuff that you'd want in
a high-end phone it's got a snapdragon
820 processor 4 gigabytes of RAM 32
gigabytes of storage you can expand the
storage with microSD card slot
as a result the phone is really fast
apps open really quickly the touch
response is great compared it to a s7
and a g5 and frankly I didn't really
notice it that much faster than those
but it's safe to say the performance
here is not really an issue also not a
concern here is battery life it's got a
3000 milliamp hour battery that was able
to get through a pretty heavy day of use
for me that's a lot of reading on my
commute looking at Twitter email social
networking taking pictures shooting
video all kinds of stuff like that you
might want to do with your phone the 10
was able to last through is it going to
last two days like HACC claims certainly
not for me probably not for you unless
you're a really light user but
fortunately it charges really quickly
through the USB C port at the bottom now
my favorite part about the HTC 10 might
be the software HTC worked with Google
to remove duplicate of apps so it only
has HTC's email app that's got google's
calendar Google's Photos app supposed to
having multiple apps that do the same
thing the other thing that HTC did was
it scaled way back on its customization
of the interface the interface here
looks a lot like a Google Nexus phone
really isn't too much different from
that I've been using an unlock model
which means that it doesn't have any of
the carrier garbage on here if you do
buy the phone from a carrier a lot of
this software magic it's probably going
to be lost so that's the HTC 10 it's a
well performing well made reliable
smartphone that lasts all day it's got a
good if not great camera and it's got
clean software that's pleasant to use
and easy to look at if that's all you're
looking for in a smart phone it works
really well but here's the problem for
HTC the iPhone 6s is a great phone the
Samsung Galaxy s7 is a great phone the
Nexus 6p is guess what a great phone
even LG's g5 with all its oddball
accessories still does all of the smart
phone things just as well as the 10 all
of those phones also offer more than HTC
here whether that's a lower price or
accessories to expand your smartphone
experience or just a whole new way to
interact with your phone the 10 is just
a smart phone and frankly that might not
be enough thanks for watching for more
