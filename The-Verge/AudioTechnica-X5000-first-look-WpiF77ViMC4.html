2017 in Berlin and I am sitting next to
something pretty special this is a carry
case containing audio Technica's new
flagship headphones open back they cost
$2000 Soho through cam in this fancy
hair case I haven't touched him yet I
haven't heard him yet I just wanted to
open them up for the first time we don't
usually do unboxing videos from the
verge but this is an unboxing this is
opening case it's kind of like pulp
fiction just with headphones
first of all the case itself it's really
nice and fancy I point the case okay go
inside of it as it's kind of standard
for Japanese companies you get this 70
finish on the inside so many does this
kind of sorting through this I wish more
companies would do this American
companies as well like packaging matters
if you buy analogic product something
across $2,000 you wanted to feel special
and I think this part of it so far
achieve that and then the headphones
themselves they're really lights and
actually wow did more ok I have heard a
lot of headphones in the one thousand
two thousand four thousand six thousand
dollar price range and these are
surprisingly small for the size and
surprisingly light most of these are
super huge and enormous you know you put
them on your head and you look like
Princess Leia you know we have massive
things on the side of the head but they
feel super lights they seem compact
compact which I've mentioned their
product name by this point this these
are the audio technica ath x-5000
they're part of the air dynamic range
which previously the flagship there was
the 2000 X I don't know why the flip DX
from the back to the front but that
doesn't matter okay so what matters is
it has made out of a Quintero
like Microsoft's new keyboard sure has
awesome tandem with headphones in
previous times also have been made of
Alcantara
the drivers onions
side the diaphragm is coated in tungsten
it measures fifty eight millimeters in
diameter and there's a single driver
assembly here so the baffle the magnet
the diaphragm the voice coil all of them
put together in one single movement
which essentially reduces unwanted
vibrations resonances and distortions
will the technicals promise as I say
these are open-back headphones honeycomb
mesh design on the outside and that
actually means that it's a kind of a
noisy environment here at Aoife I'm not
going to get the best experience of them
they're kind of designed for listening
to you at home but I'm still going to
give them a try I have my trusty Estelle
and current cam with me I'm going to
hook them up they have a quarter-inch
jack but I have an adapter always travel
with adapters don't go live some Goods
move them up and I'm going to give you
my first impressions oh yeah
all right so I've just given to my first
listen as I say the environment here at
Aoife is quite noisy don't hold me to
what I'm about to say to you
but I do have a first impression to
share so kind of classic for Japanese
audio companies when they go high end
with the audiophile gear they like to
emphasize the high end so that means a
lot of trouble a lot of detail a lot of
airiness in the music the classic
clich√© of I've heard little details
that I don't hear before it is
absolutely apparent with these
headphones being open back they don't
have a whole ton of bass students I mean
just in terms of like frequency response
and balance they're more favoring the
trouble I'm more of a basehead myself so
you don't see me grinning you know into
it just yet
but in terms of detail you know there's
tons of it also I should mention I'm so
proud of the Esteban khon kaen because
these are high impedance headphones and
this crazy little video player is
actually able to power them it's close
to max power but Illinois's environment
is powering open back I'm Peters
headphones so 10 hours 10 foot assam
khon kaen in complete mark for the audio
technica x-5000 because like i said just
in student for a couple of minutes what
I will say the fit of these headphones
is just it just better light like if
you're gonna do flagship headphones you
have to nail the comfort and I think I
think I can give all the things a lot of
praise on that front I think the design
I mean it's Japanese design come on it's
this precision made it's so beautiful
Alcantara is a great material it
breathes really nicely it's not like
leather which might get really sweaty
and stuffy after a while so I love the
design I love how light and compact it
is for audiophile headphones I'm just
going to need to get a reviewing it for
more technical you know spend a couple
of months with them and then how you
want to feel about it
so yeah these are the audio technica ath
x-5000 flagship headphones because
$1,999 they come in is gorgeous fancy
case I think every pair of headphones
should come in a case like this and
they'll be available in November
worldwide actually
I'm whipping up the bad people want to
