notification still such a pain to deal
with I mean if you've been paying
attention there have been lots of
stories about how phones are hacking our
brains and distracting us and keeping us
from focusing on what we're supposed to
be doing we're not getting too deep into
it
I think bad notifications are the result
of bad economic incentives that have
been created by bad software design they
pop up on your lock screen they make
your phone make noise they literally
cover what you're looking at when they
come in when you're using your phone all
of that stuff demands your attention and
all of that attention equals real money
for app makers who don't necessarily
have your best interests at heart and so
well I think we can fix how we all set
our notifications I also think we have
to push companies like Apple and Google
to fix their software design but before
we can make demands of those companies
we should actually try to identify
what's wrong with that software design I
want to start with Apple you might know
all this stuff already but take a look
at how these notifications work with a
different I look at them and think do
any of these notification options
actually help you if you scroll through
this thing it's just a giant unsorted
list reverse chronological of all of
your notifications with no sense of
what's more important than the other
thing and then if you get beyond that
what do you do in one of these
notifications pop up you swipe a little
bit well that does one thing if you
swipe too hard it jumps to a whole other
screen or you can force press it and
that pops up other options you can tap
it and that might open it or maybe not
who knows it's all just super confusing
UI and it's not intuitive at all what
you're supposed to do with it okay so
let's take a look at some of these
notifications here so the first one is
just allow notifications you can turn
that off that's like the nuclear option
and I actually recommend you use that a
bunch but say you need notifications
then you've got sounds badge app icon
show unlock screen show in history and
then shows banners and that's a lot of
options in fact how many options is that
we should do some math here okay math
times on the screen right here you can
turn notifications on or off so that's
two and then these are also on or off so
there's two more options here here here
and here so
it's one two three four of those and
then this one it's actually three
because you can choose between these
different things here so I thought this
is going to be a factorial thing but
since the order doesn't matter it's
actually just a multiplication problem
so this is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2
that's 2 to the fourth times 3 2 to the
fourth is 16 times 3
it's 48 let's not forget about this guy
up here because it toggles on everything
else add that down plus 2 and up with 50
there are 50 different ways to set up
notifications for any given app on your
iPhone last but not least on top of all
that there's this other whole mode
called Do Not Disturb which turns
everything off but not quite everything
so you got to figure that out too I call
all this confusion the mystery of the
check boxes I mean the joke isn't that
funny can we just turn the lights back
on and go back to the video I mean it is
a mystery but it's not not that big a
mystery I guess is what I'm saying
anyway Apple's philosophy is you should
just let notifications flow by don't try
and read everyone and don't try and
organize your entire phone life through
them but I think that's kind of dumb
some notifications are super important
so then the question is does anybody do
it better so this is a part where I'm
supposed to go really deep into the
history of smart phones and show you how
Symbian phones palm phones and
blackberries and webOS phones and
windows phones all handled notifications
differently and where each innovation
came from and I would love to do that
but we don't have the time and also all
of those phones are dead our IP all
those phones instead we can just focus
on how Android does things and I'm not
going to go through all of it in as much
detail as I did with the iPhone I just
want to point out a few places where
Android is smarter and I do have a
caveat because this is Android and
Android manufacturers are god-awful at
sending out updates to their phones and
being on the most recent version so
we're just going to use the pixel two as
an example got it
cool
let's start with the notification shade
the first thing you're gonna notice is
that it's ordered by priority so musics
at the top and then there's messages and
then there's all the other garbage so
you know it's important right away the
next thing is grouping and this is the
most important thing that I love in
Android is I have 50 notifications from
Twitter they all get stacked up into
this tiny little one-line thing and then
I can expand it if I want to see it or
dismiss all of it altogether all at once
another thing that I love is if you're
using the phone some notifications
instead of putting a shade down and
covering the top of your screen they can
just be non interruptive they just pop a
little icon of the notification tray and
you can deal with it later which is
great and then there's this new thing
called channels which is a really
complicated thing where all of an app's
notification settings get put into a
single screen where you can choose
different notification options for all
the different kinds of notifications app
wants to send to you so you can choose
whether it's high priority and makes
your phone make noise or low priority
and it's silent or it doesn't get
notifications at all and you can do that
not just for the whole app but for all
the little things that an app wants to
tell you I call these channel settings
the Android version of the mystery of
the check boxes no we're not
no no yes we're doing it okay we're
doing it great ah the check boxes are
just as bad on Android in fact they're
worse there's so many more check boxes
on Android than there are on iOS so it's
weird for me to praise it the difference
that the end States of those check boxes
for notifications are actually way more
humane they're more in my control and
they're less annoying than what happens
to you on the iPhone the other reason
I'm less than out of the Android
notifications is that you can get to all
those check boxes directly from the
notification itself I'm not saying that
Android notifications are perfect they
do need work also in fact I would love
to see some of that fancy machine
learning that Google's always talking
about applied more to the problem
notifications look here's the truth
notifications they're the new email
they're just as important but email has
all these tools for managing these
messages it's got folders for sorting
and stars and archiving and snoozing and
all kinds of other crap we need to be
empowered to manage our notifications
just like we're empowered to manage our
email or we need a whole different
approach to solving this problem
entirely I don't know earlier this year
there were a lot of stories about how
everyone's real mad at notifications
they were in the New York Times so
Farhad Manjoo said Apple should design a
less addictive phone Nelly bulls did a
really interesting story and people gray
screening their phones so that all the
color doesn't hack their lizard brains
although lizards maybe don't see color I
don't know look that up later anyway a
bunch of this stuff comes from this
movement called time well-spent that
started with a guy named Tristan Harris
who was a design at the cyst at Google
and I don't disagree with any of it it
is possible for your phone to put you in
a permanent state of distraction the
metaphor everybody uses is that it's
like a slot machine you pulled out on
the notification shade just like you
pull on a lever on a slot machine I
don't really like that metaphor because
I think it takes away too much power
from you the person who I don't know
owns the slot machine the phone you
should only give them that power if they
deliver something really valuable to you
and too often they don't but Apple I'm
sorry you need to help us out here
there's only so much that we as users
can do given all of the options you've
given us because notifications they're
not going away and just treating them as
little puffy clouds floating by and our
lock screens that isn't going to work
I've got a few people I need to thank
for this video I want to thank Vlad
Sabah for coming up with a metaphor of
iPhone notifications being puffy clouds
floating away
patrocle Pato thank you for fixing my
math I had it super wrong and you saved
me also thanks to former verge reporter
Jeff Blagdon who in a completely
different context came up with the
phrase the mystery of two check boxes
which I just deeply loved and of course
