officially extending the New Horizons
mission that means the New Horizons
spacecraft which flew by Pluto in July
2015 will be doing another flyby of an
object in the Kuiper belt that's the
large cloud of icy bodies found at the
edge of the solar system we are on our
way to another flyby which will take
place on a very easy date to remember on
January 1st 2019 and it won't be a flyby
with a planet like Pluto it'll be with a
small body one of the building blocks of
planets like Pluto which is a very high
scientific priority to try to understand
the pieces that went into small planets
like Pluto the object that New Horizons
will be visiting is an icy body called
2014 mu 69 it's about 20 to 30 miles in
diameter and orbits the Sun 1 billion
miles beyond Pluto the rock was selected
in August 2015 as the probes next target
and then in October and November the
mission team adjusted the course of New
Horizons to make sure the spacecraft
would reach mu 69 in time for the 2019
flyby those course corrections were made
even though the team didn't know if the
new horizons extended mission would
receive funding that was dictated a
little bit by orbital mechanics and a
little bit by there's only a certain
amount of fuel left in the tank and the
longer you wait to fire the engines the
more fuel it takes because there's less
time for the result of the burn to take
effect so we calculated that what made
the most sense was to do the targeting
maneuvers in the fall of 2015
even though we wouldn't know about if we
got funding till the summer of 2016
because if we'd waited to the summer of
2016 to start planning the burn it would
have been a lot more expensive in terms
of fuel and would have almost run the
tank dry and left no margin for error
during the flyby New Horizons will
gather photos and data of MU 69 just
like it did of Pluto but that's not the
only object the spacecraft will be
studying during the extended mission so
this mission which is called the Kuiper
belt extended mission or we nicknamed it
Kim is all about using new horizons in
every way possible to study the Kuiper
belt so it's got one flyby really close
even closer than
we flew by Pluto on January 1st 2019 but
it also studies about two dozen other
Kuiper belt objects that it passes close
enough to that it can do better than
Hubble or anything from Earth
all across 20 16 17 18 and 19 New
Horizons is pointing in different
directions or looking at different quick
but belt objects that includes sending
the dwarf planet Eris the second largest
object in the Kuiper belt
New Horizons will also be passing
through the densest part of the belt
coming within ten million miles of other
nearby objects that may seem pretty far
but that's close enough for New Horizons
to study the researchers will be looking
for small moons or even rings of
material surrounding these Kuiper belt
objects hopefully gathering data about
them could tell us a lot more about how
the various planets formed in our solar
system 4.5 billion years ago good ok
let's do it wait</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
