we're taking a look at the new iPad Mini
which is a smaller iPad the new version
has a 7.9 inch display versus the nine
point seven inch display of the iPad 2
third generation and now fourth
generation iPad the display is also
lower in resolution
it's 1024 by 768 which is the same
resolution as the original iPad in the
iPad 2 it's got two colors there's a
black version which looks kind of like
the black of the iPhone 5 and then a
white silver version the black coating
is actually has this weird reflective
quality that sometimes it looks a little
bit blue it's very cool the device feels
really good in your hands it's extremely
well made it feels really solid but it's
super thin and super light because it's
as thin and light as it is it can be a
little bit hard to hold sometimes it
doesn't have a very thick bezel on the
sides so it's a little bit awkward
holding it with one hand with your thumb
over the front of the screen and it is
extremely wide for a single hand to hold
in fact most of the time I use the Smart
Cover that Apple makes for it because it
makes it a little bit thicker and a
little bit easier to hold with a single
hand the screen itself looks really nice
the the display looks very close to the
surface of the glass and the black
levels and colors are really rich I will
say that after using it for a while and
reading on it you do start to notice
that the pixel density here is lower
than competing devices it is not a
deal-breaker but some people who are
very sensitive about how many pixels
they see on screen may be distracted by
it as I mentioned the bezel along the
sides is smaller and apparently the
software on the iPad Mini does a better
job of rejecting unwanted touches I
think it worked fine most of the time
though I did feel like some app may have
experienced a little bit of miss
touching otherwise the software is as
you would expect exactly like an iPad
there's nothing really different about
the software at all here it's running
iOS 6 the one thing you will notice is
that because the screen is smaller
things are smaller on it but it does
take some getting used to the keyboard
feels a bit smaller for instance in
portrait it seems like it should be a
little bit taller in landscape it's
actually a bit easier to use because of
the way you can grip the tab
of course because it is just an iPad it
runs all of the iPad software and I
would say that's the biggest strength of
this device in comparison to anything
else on the market there's just an
enormous selection of apps and they run
really well on it inside the device
there is an a5 CPU which is actually an
older generation processor but
performance seemed pretty decent games
worked well and almost everything
started up quickly there were a few
graphically intensive games that were
larger that took a little bit longer to
start up and I would have liked but in
comparison to an iPad 2 they were
certainly on par the device I tested had
Wi-Fi but Apple's going to be making LTE
versions as well and of course like
every other iPad there's a variety of
storage sizes you can get 16 all the way
up to 64 gigs the iPad Mini starts at a
not super cheap $329 and you can get it
Specht up all the way to six hundred and
fifty nine dollars that's a 64 gig
version with LTE I think the price is
actually really telling about how Apple
thinks about this kind of tablet I don't
know if they're looking at it as a super
cheap version of the iPad I think that
they are looking at it as a different
version of the iPad in fact when I
talked to Phil Schiller at the event for
the announcement of the iPad Mini he
said as much to me this is not a product
that Apple thinks is cheap they just
wanted to offer an alternative version
of the iPad the Nexus 7 retails for $200
at the low end and for most consumers
$129 gap is actually a pretty big golf
so I think the question when considering
the iPad Mini isn't do you want the iPad
Mini or the Nexus 7 or some other
cheaper tablet it's do you want the iPad
Mini or a bigger iPad</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
