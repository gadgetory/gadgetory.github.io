one afternoon in late spring I traveled
to a Girl Scout camp in rural New Jersey
to see the Apocalypse
coming from an office in Manhattan the
200 acres of field and forest I felt
like I had stepped into some empty dream
world but what I was about to get into
was more like Mad Max this is dystopia
rising a live-action role-playing game
set generations after a disaster that
wiped out civilization as we know it
so you're the verge ma'am are not sure
if you want to play out here
oh no I'm totally playing play do you
have anything else to wear I mean I have
another t-shirt and another pair of
jeans okay we can put something together
with a lot of help from veteran players
I made up a fighter whose race sorry
strain had been horribly disfigured by
radiation I was covered in hideous
boozing open sores and gigantic body
armor it's probably the closest I'll
ever get to being able to scare someone
in a dark alley I might have looked
tough but I still had no idea a sight
when you're doing combat mm-hmm I'm
going to show you what a strike feels
like first and I'm gonna catch you by
surprise when I do it so that you don't
tense up you don't freak out and you
don't think all right
that is as hard as it's ever going to
hit and then when you strike we do
what's called a three-strike flurry
system which means you can only hit
someone three times before you have to
pause for something okay this is a
prevent someone from just yeah wiggling
their blade and doing silly shit so what
I'm gonna do is I'm going to try and hit
you mmm and I want you to block the
first strike and then strike back at me
as it turns out fighting and dystopia
rising is sort of like fencing while
doing math in your head you hit someone
with a stick you yell a stat you get hit
you calculate how much more damage you
can take
I would do plenty of fighting but it's a
small part of the overall experience you
spend a lot of time trading making
friends or just listening to someone
play acoustic Daft Punk covers at a bar
it feels like 24/7 Improv Theater
sometimes the role-playing was fantastic
but other times it was absolutely
terrifying my character was supposed to
be tough but because I really had no
idea what I was doing she ended up as a
socially awkward Wallflower I kept
feeling like I had to break out of
character to think about what she should
be doing and I kept wondering was i
holding up my end of a conversation
should I be more creative was I being
too forward it was like a cotillion at
the end of the world then I died we're
going to be leading a lovely raid on
that horrid into town there is going to
be another player waiting for us we're
going to hook her and we're going to
kill her right so let's go right
perfectly before it happened my
character was supposed to be running on
a broken leg coincidentally I'd twisted
my ankle that morning and decided to
walk it off it was an incredibly stupid
idea but it was also the thing that
would bring us together when she limped
I was limping when she got knocked down
by a giant zombie
I couldn't stand back up for something
that made us both yearn for death
it was great
welcome
can you speak
yes
do you want to live yes I want to live
remember always that you are one of
deaths chosen I'm done with you so yeah
take a minute if anyone but you'll be in
character once you come out of here
sort salt can someone down there pick up
the weapons from the floor and bring
them back up
Thanks
when I came back I learned someone had
looted my weapons and armor and I was
genuinely afraid I built a character who
could barely do anything but fight and
now she was basically useless that was
strangely the moment something seemed to
click my character had gone crazy from
dying and I was in pain everything I did
somehow seemed natural for both of us
we studied a religion that worships TV
signals join the gang and finally got
back on our feet oh oh yeah I got I mean
hurt bit earlier yeah that's the part um
it was like the stupidest greater injury
ever I fell into you know they ran into
my leg oh yeah well kind of funny but it
was very realistic I still never quite
figured out what I wanted to be
LARPing can be about leaving yourself
behind and some of the people I met
before the game seemed totally different
during it sometimes it seemed like I was
just amplifying a few things about
myself sometimes the best thing is
sometimes the worst and adding swords
then again the swords were fantastic and
I'm pretty sure the more I had known
about the world before going in the
better prepared I would have felt to
create something new but I'm probably
overthinking it most people I met were
there for one reason to have some fun at
the end of the world
