answer the door
the friendly robotic Butler is a staple
of sci-fi films but it's still far from
a mainstream reality although today a
French startup keikar is unveiling its
vision for the ideal at-home bot the
unit has a built-in projector that aims
to make any wall in your home the best
screen in the house for a film a game or
digital art it also has a six speaker
array with a subwoofer underneath to
provide music wherever needed without
clutter
it started off mainly with entertainment
you know TVs music you know web content
games and we added like security
features where you can remotely access
the camera and move the device inside
your home in real time with data like
temperature co2 level etc and I guess
the final aspect that is really kind of
key now is decoration digital art and
trying to turn any surface into a screen
which makes a home a lot more
interactive and that's really exciting
to me it's more like a computer a robot
is big narrow and it's more like trying
to bring computing to a different level
and giving it mobility that could make
it in the definition of a robot but it's
definitely not what we you know how I
see this product I think it's more an
evolution of the computer as opposed to
yeah robots so the first thing your
dad's when you buy it and you turn it on
it's like a little cat it will just go
around your house and it will create its
own app and it'll actually you know
understand what walls are or what is
furniture and how each particular room
is connected to each other you'll know
your house so you'll tell it to go to
the bedroom to the bathroom and wherever
it is it will go to that particular
location just pressing you know goods in
the bedroom you'll just go and you don't
have to do it yourself you know you
could be something that wakes you up in
the morning
it can be a device that can play with a
cat and look at it during the day and
give you reports of what it's doing it
can be about home decoration for example
the camera will definitely could think
of like working with oculars types of
devices where you could see you know
inside the screen your 360 camera and
make it move at the same time and being
able to check everything that goes
around you know the the possibilities
are really exciting and we also hoped
for developers to you know participate
leveraging the fact that it's device
that moves a device that has projected
image and a 360 camera and we hope
they'll make amazingly cool new apps
the initial twenty first units will be
at 1990 dollars so just you know under
$2,000 eventually the retail price is
going to be a little higher probably
around four or five thousand dollars and
the idea is that it would replace a
big-screen TV a projector and maybe some
speakers if it's gonna cost me four to
five thousand dollars yeah I think you
know instead of having everything you
know fixed devices everywhere this could
give you the ability to have one device
that creates the same atmosphere in any
room without having to have tons of
fixed devices everywhere so I think
financially it's actually quite
interesting
every new type of device has had its
interaction revolution the phone with a
touch interface the computer with a
mouse and this I think you'll be even
something else</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
