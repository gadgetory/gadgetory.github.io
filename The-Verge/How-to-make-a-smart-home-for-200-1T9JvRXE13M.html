were not a thing or they were but you
had to be a total nerd or super rich to
have one now everything's different if
you have an Amazon echo you at the
beginning of a smart home if you have
any appliance you can turn on or off
from your phone you have part of a smart
home it turns out that smart homes are
really easy to start building nowadays
and you can do some pretty cool things
with them like control your lights your
heating your TV your often more limited
by what would be dumb and excessive than
what you actually want to do so how do
you get started
we're gonna go to my apartment and I'm
gonna show you what you can do for under
two hundred dollars to make your home a
little bit smarter all right so the
first place to start is a voice
assistant
I'll admit these would be kind of creepy
but let's sort of get used to them they
actually turned into a fun and pretty
convenient way to control your stuff I
chose the Google home Mini it's $49 but
they're on sale all the time so don't
pay that much obviously you can use this
to look stuff up or play music or
podcasts but I mostly use mine to turn
my lights and air conditioner on and off
I could just use a button or do it in my
phone because I see a lot more
convenient a lot of times especially if
I'm on my way out the door or going to
bed now we're gonna get into those smart
lights and how I turned a dumb air
conditioner into a smart one but before
I do that I want to talk about how all
these devices are talking to each other
because there's a lot going on and it
can get pretty confusing you're probably
familiar with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
Bluetooth is great for things like
fitness trackers headphones mice and
keyboards and Wi-Fi is great for while
bringing in that to your laptop
smartphone smart TV and so on but
they're using different gadgets for a
reason they're designed to do different
things
Bluetooth is pretty slow at transferring
data and it can't travel very far but it
doesn't use a ton of power Wi-Fi is
really fast and can travel farther but
it does use a ton of power there's
really only one distinction that you
have to remember Bluetooth gadgets
usually aren't connected to the Internet
so unless you connect them to some kind
of hub you can't control them while
you're out of the home where things get
more complicated is when you get deeper
into smart home tech it turns out
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi just don't fit the
bill for everything now there are great
for things like light bulbs that need to
be reached at the way far end
the house for that there are other
wireless technologies like ZigBee and
z-wave these is really tiny amounts of
energy so you can have sensor sitting
around on battery power for months but
that means they're super slow at
transmitting data they're also built to
travel much farther because the messages
can't jump around so one light bulb can
transmit and off man to the next one and
the next one and so on what this means
is that if you're buying something
you'll have to make sure it actually
works with your stuff one of the things
that you're gonna need a hub for is
smart lights I think the best smart
lights are from philips hue and you'll
want to start with their starter kit
because it comes with that hub we're
just gonna hook up to your router set
everything can talk together the starter
kit cost $64 it comes with a bunch of
bulbs and while Phillips has a bunch of
like color-changing stuff to don't worry
about that it's just more than you need
so our lights are great for just a bunch
of little conveniences you can have them
automatically turn on when you come home
or when the Sun Goes Down I bet you have
at least one speaker in your house that
isn't smart or could be smart for $35
you can plug a chromecast Audio into it
and make it able to do a lot more so I
have this - speaker system here it's old
it's from like 2004 or something but if
i hook the chromecast Audio up by
plugging is the aux port I can have
control it for my phone or do this I can
say hey Google Play childish gambino on
both speakers all right Donald Glover
from Spotify and are you playing on both
speakers
all right so the last thing is a smart
plug it's basically just an individual
outlet but you can plug something into
and then turn it on and off
I got TP links Casa you can get a 2-pack
of them for 45 bucks so these things are
really cool because they're all at once
really versatile but also really limited
because they've literally just turn
things on and off so I connected my two
air conditioners to them so that I can
control them and turn them on when I'm
coming home from work
now some caveats they are literally just
chilling power to these things and
turning them back on they can't control
anything at all so my air conditioner it
turns out will automatically resume its
prior state when it turns back on so
because of that this works out really
well because I can just flip it on and
it's gonna start making things cool
again you can use this for things like
fans and lamps too that are just gonna
automatically resume their same state so
that's it that's just about $200 but
there's a lot more you can do with the
stuff you already have if you want to
get a little bit more complicated using
apps on your phone you can hook things
together to do even more there's a
service called ifttt if this then that
that's really good for this so for
instance I set up a rule saying that if
it's over 80 degrees in Brooklyn my air
conditioner will automatically turn on
and you can do that for all kinds of
stuff with your lights with your
speakers now I really think the best way
to get your smart home is to do it piece
by piece like this by one thing see how
it works for you and then get whatever
else makes sense next now I went with
the Google home mini but it might make
more sense for you to go with Alexa or
if you use tons of Apple devices to go
with a home kit system just start with
whatever works for you and then add on
bit by bit and before you know it you're
gonna have a much smarter home hey
thanks for watching if you like what
you're doing you might like what our
friends at life noggin are doing they
make a bunch of animations explaining
stuff like who is winning the global
tech race</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
