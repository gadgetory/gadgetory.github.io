the verge mobile show this is episode 44
for the week of april twenty second 2013
I am dieter bohn i'm dan seifert and
assuming i'm not muted i'm chris sigler
yeah we are we are sadly without glad
sava of today and the the feature that
chris is referring to as google hangouts
will now mute you when you start typing
which i guess is great only we never
stop typing ever ever ever so yeah I
lift my fingers up from the keyboard and
they're just moving see like I just
can't stop so you just need to move to
an elk our system or we were tapping on
glass like on Star Trek by the way Dan
that's why we call you to Dan magic
fingers Seaford not to be confused with
Dan jazz hands see four totally
different dance jazz hands are the you
know but magic fingers right a totally
different ball game I I really apologize
to people that are only listening to the
audio broadcast of this it was like the
amazing magic fingers and jazz hands
could you do magic fingers at the end of
jazz hands so let's let's let's see here
got jazz hands I think I can transition
them there we go that's a pretty smooth
transition wow I used to do the the hex
thing you know 11 i had one way back i
think i look on that from a faith no
more video Oh Mike pen oh how nice
connell so anyway this is a virgin
mobile show where we talk about mobile
things and if you're watching and you're
listening you're surely aware of that
right now because I just told you and
it's been a relatively quiet weekend
news and I am still recovering from an
illness whose name I cannot I'd I don't
know what it is I'm thinking it's just
the worst allergies ever but like
allergies of not I don't know anyway it
sucks but we're here and we're going to
talk about things and I guess the big
thing going on right now is
its earnings week so every single
company ever is announcing its earnings
for the quarter we've heard a few we
were verizon we're hearing 18t any
minute now actually Apple is also going
to happen today and we also heard from
Nokia who posted a loss which you know
as anybody shocked at all by Nokia
posting a loss can't get it I am oh
thanks ah I guess I owe you a coke but
yeah I mean it's it's not surprising to
many people who have been following the
industry if you've been following
Nokia's earnings for the past few
quarters and even a few years at this
point a loss is kind of par for the
course yeah but they actually they sold
more lumia windows phones are up to 5.6
million for the quarter which is the
most i've ever sold but i gotta say 5.6
million in a quarter sounds pretty
lackluster to me like if you're gonna be
a big player you need to do ten times
that well i mean it is black luster if
you're looking at a single US carrier
cells that many iphones in a corner so
you know for a whole company worldwide
under 10 million in sales in a quarter
is really you know not competitive at
all and the really bad news for them is
the sales of their quote unquote smart
devices so non Lumia phones smartphones
Indian phones basically just plummeted
they went from eighty six point three
260 1.9 um that's a huge drop and that I
mean that's been you know Nokia's
moneymaker for years and years and of
course you know we knew that that was
going away but that that's pretty fast
in my opinion did we know it was going
away I don't know if I necessarily
eventually maybe um here Chris gotta
know if I'm with your connection I
didn't know those just a or what you
please looks like amorphous blob it
looks like the kids on the train from
the wall if you don't I'm talking about
no oh yes I know when they go by and
their heads are shaken or what yes yeah
it's what you just look like that is
really upsetting and disturbing I'm
sorry that you need to put up with that
so actually I think what it is this time
normally I blame my connection but this
is one of those situations where I think
actually blame my process or the M being
just being the mere act of being in a
google hangout causes the the poor
processor on this this macbook air to
peg and cause my fam to go on high and I
think it's just it's struggling pushing
my the bits of my face out onto the
interwebs is really really there any
other time I would let that comment or
that excuse slide but I've done every
single virtual will show with macbook
air so yeah but I'm also rendering toy
story for this macbook air right now so
good point yeah hang on way to be is
there gonna be a toy story fast and
furious crossover no but there is going
to be wouldn't it I proposed on Twitter
this week and I got some pretty positive
responses I proposed a crossover of only
God forgives and fast and furious so
it'd be called only God forgives the
fast and furious that's starring Ryan
Gosling the rock you know all the usual
players I'm pretty sure my heads explode
let's just say that Ryan Gosling would
have no problems beating the crap out of
Paul Walker it wouldn't even be a
contest yeah I think that's a given I
tenth well eat Ryan Gosling from drive I
agree um I don't know I Gosling from the
notebook pretty tough I was about saying
right now something notebook I'm not so
sure but what I am however what wait
we're not done talking fast no just
curious all right uh I wasn't around
last week when the news broke the fast
fast &amp;amp; furious 7 did you listen show no
oh he really should we told you pretty
good oh man now I'm depressed it was so
good that I don't even remember what the
troll was so I can't reenact yeah it was
it was something about how fast the
furious movie will do
almost as well the box office as
Michigan in the finals of the NCAA so
extremely well is it what I'm hearing
extremely low but the faltering at the
end better than sixty two other teams in
the Indian market final game not the
whole tournament just the file that's a
pretty harsh troll anyway that's talking
out yet even though nokia is uh you know
they made they had a loss they did sell
handful more Lumia phones but apparently
you know they're not stopping the Lumia
train because the CEO Stephen Elop
hinted that new Lumia devices are going
to be happening later this quarter and
we've had a couple of leaks of a couple
of them the bloomberg is reporting that
that Lumia 928 which we've seen or heard
a couple of times I think we've actually
seen renders or alleged pictures of it
already is going to be coming next month
in many which is like right around the
corner right so and I kind of wish you
yeah I mean how do you guys feel about
the 928 because I the more I think about
it the angrier I get it's just a 920
with the Xenon flash right right and
okay that's cool it's aluminum right no
it's not it's all the original rumors
that it was aluminum apparently they
either had some trouble with the
manufacturing or like they didn't like
the feel of it or something happened and
they switched to like this brushed
plastic I think boo so I want to know
what's verizon stelio go like there's
rumors that the one is coming now
finally to the carrier but why can't
they just released phones that everybody
else does like why is why are they still
in 2013 hanging on to this like
exceptionalism like like verizon has
manifest destiny to own the entire
wireless market and they'll release
phones on their schedule when they feel
like it and it doesn't matter what the
manufacturers one it doesn't even matter
what consumers want they just you know
it's all about verizon and i just like
this is coming super late relative to
the 920's release and i don't get why
Verizon can't just you know except like
give us the same thing that the other
guys are getting well it could be with
the case of the 920 it might be that 80
secured an exclusive yeah yeah I guess
that's possible probable yeah because it
verizon did release the other one they'd
and i was i was going to work into a
really big full-throated rant their age
you know what i think it I mean there's
also the these the exclusive a component
of it but also you know Verizon's the
biggest carrier in the US it's making
bank does it really have to change what
it's doing yeah I don't even did we even
do the story about their quarterly
results horizons I think we didn't like
it was like yeah other verizon they do
what prize and does they make money at
it you know customers yeah yeah that's
exactly it right like when your verizon
when you're that big and you have this
hangover of creating the droid brand so
you know you have a very very large head
or a a Dan meet size mustache it's
difficult to sort of put that aside and
why frankly from a business perspective
why would they I mean it's it's a very
pragmatic and kind of upsetting thing to
say but at the end of the day why would
you you know change courses when you're
doing extremely well you're the largest
carrier everything is going your way
you're making money yeah all right fine
whatever okay so but there is another
Lumia that I'm a little bit more excited
about this catwalk right or is this the
same thing as 9 28 no they can't 101
this is this is new and we see some
pictures that we weren't sure about but
um tom was labeled the verge tom was
able to verify the images um this looks
I don't know it looks fine it doesn't
look like the hottest thing ever but
like these early images are always kind
of ugly looking I was going to say fugly
and they are um but did that cameras
pompon it looks huge right well I think
it's all relative we're not seeing it
next to like say the 920 I mean if this
device is actually thinner than the 920
but it's got a st. similar camera module
then there has to be a hump for it right
so well at this point I mean I I hate to
say this about nokia maybe I don't hate
to say it but
at this point I don't think it's about
their hardware or their roadmap the ball
is back in Microsoft's court yet again
they need to iterate on Windows Phone 8
is getting along the tooth and it's got
issues some of which are their fault
some of which aren't google so they they
they need to to push a new version that
kind of gets Windows Phone back in front
of people but forces it back into the
pub of the public conscience and right
now they're not there and I don't think
that iterating on the hardware and
releasing other windows phone 8 device
is going to do any good imagine if I
mean obviously this kind of a messed-up
analogy but just imagine for a moment if
Apple released a bigger or smaller
iPhone right now running iOS 6 people
would be like what the heck the iOS iOS
6 is old it's lame we've been saying it
for a year now they need to really do
something different so we're expecting
of course that the next iPhone will have
iOS 7 and and nokia is kind of in that
position now I think so I mean okay we
talked at length about you know why we
as power users can't use Windows Phone
um but you know is it why can't it catch
on at all like is it just that I can't
doesn't have the apps is that the is
that the long and the short of it still
like for me it's it's I can I can
specifically site free things off of top
my head that are major issues for me one
is that the animations are really cute
for for half an hour to an hour and then
you start to realize quickly that
they're slowing you down with literally
everything you do to UM apps are still
an issue I'm not going to lie I mean
they added tumbler today which is great
but like the uber app for example which
i used a goalie in Chicago is a rapper
of their they're awful mobile site wait
uber daily yeah all the time NASA not
oberon oh no not not uber black in
Chicago we have taxi over so you know
just calls you a taxi
and yeah actually no I take that back i
am actually calling black cars every day
and glassy and the third thing is oh the
email at the email app is a sick joke so
those three things are ever together a
big problem insult to injury there's no
Starbucks app yeah well yes thank you
Dan okay like two of those three issues
sound like powers like power user issues
to me like two of those three issues is
like yeah well you know you're crazy
glar but i can't imagine an average
consumer cares about those things is he
apps thing that that I think kills it
for them and what can I just say as long
as we're on the subject that the two
insta with love thing that is is it
nokia that's driving it or yeah that's a
no project oh I'm so tired of it i
tweeted last week that like I want an
Instagram to come to Windows Phone just
so I can stop hearing about how this one
doesn't have Instagram yeah you know I
mean at some point you just you're
making yourself look sad bye yeah
putting that kind of like trying to get
that kind of Republican soon approach oh
you really are yeah it's you know big
it's our jobs as futile as it might be
it's still your job as as nokia or as
microsoft to explain to users what their
alternatives are and why they don't need
Instagram instead of publicly pleading
for Instagram becomes the black woman
well how badly do you think those
negotiations went that they decided this
is the right tactic you know well i
guess was nokia involved in those
discussions or negotiations you'd think
it would be microsoft and Instagram that
would be talking microsoft a facebook
now that would be talking and maybe
maybe nokia was just totally left out of
off the table and left out of the
conversation so they said we're gonna
we're going to do a hashtag that's
that's our strategy I mean look when
that when the next round of Windows
Phones is released I will try one for a
few days i will get upset i will throw
it against the wall then i'll wait for
Windows Phone 8.5 or nine well I guess
it'll be Windows Phone blue release code
name I guarantee you what everything is
we're going to say is when it comes out
we're going to be like this hardware is
phenom
I wish it ran stock Android haha I've
been saying that since Thea n9 which i
still i mean i still have a cyan and
nine that I pull out once in a while
because it's just such a pretty phone
that was kinda I think that was the
ultimate execute we said I'm sorry I've
said this a dozen times but it really it
really is the ultimate execution of that
of that design language yeah I just I
want to live in a world where we can
have you know three or four viable
platforms right right what about include
blackberry 10 in your mind right now
yeah i mean the the blackberry 10 you
know they're they there a problem is a
problem of execution that android apps
just our kind of yeah yeah which is yeah
a nice way of putting it oh I mean like
there's strategy for like solving the
number of app problems and getting you
know apps on their going with Android
isn't the worst idea ever if they could
make it run well alright you know I I
have issues with the the structure of
the OS as a whole and I have huge issues
blackberry hub as a messaging client I
completely agree with you there dieter
and then the other issue on saying like
the hardware or the sales side of things
like you know their pricing this the
blood z10 at pretty much every carrier
in the US is two hundred dollars on
contract and it's going up against
things like the HTC One soon this galaxy
x for the iphone 5 and when you're you
know looking at these devices and you
put them side by side I mean I hate to
say this but the z10 just does not live
up as far as hardware quality or you
know feel or you know just general of
what you'd expect from what is now a
two-hundred-dollar levels of a man the
q10 is coming q10 is around the corner I
am waiting for the slider man there was
a there was a patent that they filed in
2011 for a blackberry 10 slider and I I
would do that man thong funny way to my
given the history the torch I we had
this discussion last week given the
history of the torch you were much
braver man than I yeah so okay dan
mentioned that the z10 is going up
against the samsung galaxy s4 we are
coming up on that thing just being out
we've got pre-orders
starting on sprint already they're
starting on tmobile tomorrow etts had
pre-orders for a while apparently
they're going to start shipping them
like tomorrow and they're going to be an
AT&amp;amp;T stores on april twenty seventh and
it's uh this this s4 train it's coming
man and like hopefully i'll have for
them anyway a big big launch weekend i
guess at that point we'll call it a
launch weekend um but i don't know that
it's a slam dunk that it's going to be
as insanely popular as the s3 but then
again I haven't seen their giant
marketing campaign for yet either right
i mean you know the the if from what
we've seen so far from our hands on with
the device it doesn't seem like a huge
step up from the s3 we've mentioned this
numerous times but we think we've also
mentioned that it's probably not going
to be an issue for samsung to sell them
hand over fist between the huge
marketing campaign the support of every
single carrier every carrier knows that
you know selling samsung devices is
pretty easy at this point so it's very
easy for them to get their weight behind
it and push them so it's going to be
interesting to see how this plays this
year but i'm gonna say it's probably
gonna be very similar to last year with
samsung selling tons of them but like i
said before it's not it's probably not
going by and large it's not going to be
gs3 owners who are buying gs4 is it will
be people who weren't caught up in the
upgrade cycle for a gs3 and maybe
they're looking at a phone this year you
know if you bought a gs3 last year and
you take it into the store and you put
it side-by-side with the gs4 you like
and you know yeah i mean it's it's you
know the people whose friends all have
gs threes now they are going to be going
into the stores and you know their
upgrade cycle is up or whatever and
their their time to upgrade and there
you know if your upgrade is say you
bought a what would be coming up into
you an 18-month 20 month cycle i guess
would be an iphone 4s the 20 month cycle
is coming up soon for that so if you had
an iphone 4s the next iPhones not
anticipated for another few months and
you know you're in the store with that
upgrade on your account 21 cycle out of
your head down its it is a 24 cross
aboard now isn't it is now but if you
bought it if you want a phone in 2011
you're on a 20 month cycle okay but yes
you are correct up that at least verizon
has switched to a 24 month cycle and
drugs by the way i don't mean to change
the subject but i do want to point out
that that moved from 20 to 24 months is
the seventh sign like this and now that
now that that has happened oh all three
all three carriers that aren't named
t-mobile are are like a hair-trigger
away from going to the tmobile model
yeah that's my belief i well you know i
mean the big the big difference between
you know the other carriers in the
t-mobile model is that when you're
you've paid off that phone from tmobile
your bill goes down in price whereas
verizon and AT&amp;amp;T and whoever do not go
down in price and right that's the whole
thing with this verizon move from 20 to
24 months because you know they spun it
so that be that you know most people's
upgrade after two years not 20 months so
we're just doing most people do anyways
and and there they have this new payment
plan that if you're not eligible for an
upgrade you can spread your the cost of
a device over 12 months so now you've
got your spreading the cost of a device
over 12 months in addition to paying a
subsidy on top of your uh your monthly
rate plan so it's like you're just I
mean verizon stands still just rake keep
continue breaking it in as far as
profits and such yes so we posted this
this change.org petition that it was
gaining momentum it was actually getting
them it was super fast a few days ago
but it looks like it slowed down and
this is a petition for a verizon to you
know get rid of wireless contracts move
to a tmobile model basically it's got
123,000 out of you know they say they
need 150 although it seems like an
arbitrary like what happens at 150 right
okay okay it's not like it's not like
when you petition the white house and
the white house that has singsong it's
verizon's a private company they you
know and when you think about it from a
business perspective Verizon's in first
place they're huge they continue
to grow each quarter they just added
subscribers in the 1st quarter of 2013
uh and you know they're not in
t-mobile's position where they need to
stop this like bleeding subscribers and
they need to you know scramble and
scrape to get people to like their
network and go to their network because
they don't really have an LTE deployment
yet i mean Vern people have I think the
customer base has shown that they have
no trouble playing by verizon rules be
because they're still with verizon and
there you know using verizon's LTE
network which is available in like every
tiny little town in America now I think
they're over 480 cities are close to 480
cities and towns across the u.s. with
LTE coverage so I mean and Verizon is
just continuing to make money there's no
reason for them to switch away from
their contract model right uh so on
saturday i went into a verizon store and
I said give me a micro sim card i will
pay you for it I don't want to sign it
to your contract I don't have the device
that I want to put it in with me right
now I just I want to micro sim cards so
that I can set it up on like a prepaid
no tablet plan or Chromebook plan which
is what I was going to use it in um this
straight up said no like literally like
no we're not going to sell you we cannot
sell you a card you need to buy a device
in a contract like at a verizon
corporate store you have to buy a device
well they were like sketchy like if you
buy a phone sure if you buy a tablet
yeah if you have the device on you maybe
but probably not we can actually can't
just do a sim card for an existing
device like that like I went round it
around for like 10 minutes until i was
like goodbye I'm done see this is a
problem like if you go to go into an
eighteen t we go into an 18 tier of
course a tmobile store they tend to be
very good about understanding why you
just want to sim and then you can leave
and and I think that Verizon and Sprint
really still haven't gotten over the
reality that you know esns are going
away and sims are the future and they
haven't like really embrace that yet so
that they they were probably just really
confused the the pixel is LTE only right
it doesn't even support you I think
that's right yeah yeah so yeah I'd like
like holding my card up like I want to
use this here right now
can we do that can we make that happen
no it's such a stark difference from
like you know we were in Barcelona for
mobile world congress back in February
and when our team arrived there we
pretty much all needed sim cards local
SIM card so that we could communicate
and myself and Jordan one of our video
producers we went down to the Vodafone
store we said we have this many cards we
need and we want prepaid service for you
know however much and we're gonna use it
for the week and they just rang us up
and we took the sims and we're on our
way and you know it's it's such a stark
difference from what you would
experience in a US carrier store yeah
the only restriction was you needed to
have you know identification you know so
they could I don't know if you're using
it as a burner for your secret Barcelona
drug deals they be able to track it down
or something I imagine that's why they
require a passport but yeah not like why
can't i okay i we know the answer but
it's it's ridiculous to me that in this
day and age i can't just walk into a
store in the US and say I want the
zipcard and be done anyway sorry back to
the galaxy s4 the other thing that's
going to help is you know there are no
major carriers they've got big
distribution and apparently they are
setting up micro stores and Best Buy's
Chris you you've talked about this yeah
Oh Sam's last week yeah yeah I christine
has to talk about it last time I was on
the show but but I went down to Dallas
which is where Samsung's mobile
headquarters is and they've been
operating since I think februari this
pilot bestbuy nearby where they've been
trying this format where they they
literally take over a surprising amount
of floor space and devote it to not just
Samsung but specifically samsung galaxy
so they have they have you know the s3
they'll have this force during this week
the note to a selection of tablets and
then they'll have like a couple windows
8 laptops just thrown in for good
measure and then they have the galaxy
camera and that in itself doesn't sound
particularly revolutionary until you
consider the fact that you know when a
customer walks into a Best Buy literally
the first thing they see is the shining
giant monolith that says samsung galaxy
and it's clean it kind of has I dare I
say an apple store appeal because they
have these like simple rows of tables
that are spaced well apart so you can
get in really play with the devices they
have literally every every accessory
that Samsung cells every color of cover
for like the s3 in the note 2 and and
even the tablets and get this even if
you go over to the the mobile section of
Best Buy which is a different distinct
section they still sell the galaxy there
so they got you either way whereas say
with the HTC One or any other product
you have your only in the mobile section
and it's mixed in with a billion other
phones so that they can you know they
can ring you up in the galaxy section
they have samsung employees not just
best buy but also Samsung employees
there that you know know everything
about all the products it's a it's a
total qu and it's um I think it's it
spells huge huge trouble for anyone not
named Samsung this year okay I've got a
question for you Chris so say I buy a
galaxy s4 and you know I've had it for
37 days so I'm outside of my return
policy for ya you know anybody uh and I
you know I drop it and I break it can I
take it to the Samsung place in best buy
and they can help me out nope that's
their Achilles heel they they don't
they're not doing a genius for our kind
of thing yet the the executives I spoke
with its Samsung hinted that they're
gonna be trialing some things later in
the year that might be moving in that
direction but right now it's still like
you know if you have a geek squad
protection plan on your phone they can
take care of you there otherwise they
can like you can help you mail it in
from that store and do like a two or
three-day exchange i think but you're
gonna be paying us are we at worst ya
know it is it's it's the same as if you
went to bestbuy under any other
circumstance without the samsa
experience shop so i was at my local
best buy i want to say but a we can have
those where were two weekends
and they had installed this Samsung
experience in in that particular store
and it's uh in that particular store
it's like they have the Apple set up
with the imax and the macbook airs next
to that the iPads they had their own
little space but like right across the
aisle was where the Samsung setup was
and it was really big in roomies maybe
three to four times the size of app the
Apple set up inside the store I had
samsung employees just like he said had
a laptop set up in the galaxy camera and
the tablets the phones etc but it was
missing people oh really so I looked
like the the iPads and the macbooks and
the macbook airs and the the imax or
whatever those generally always have
people playing with them and oh yeah on
them but like I I I actually I had my my
my wife and my daughter with me and we
had my daughter my stroller and so I
just kind of push the stroller right
through the sams experience I want to
get to the other side of this door and
you know I just kind of walked right
through it and had no trouble there was
nobody in my way you're great oh man I
don't know what might be awareness issue
or what or yes just because it's new it
could have very well been the first
weekend that they were in there but it
was kind of surprising so maybe that'll
change once for launches ATT's q1 just
came out we've got it up on the site
they added 296,000 postpaid customers
and a quarter so a slightly less than
half of what Verizon added and I don't
have breakouts on what their smartphone
sales different types were but they are
touting that they got seventy-two
percent of their own contract customers
are using smartphones now so they've
they had their calling with their
best-ever first quarter of smartphone
sales so I don't know I don't know the
percentages on verizon of users on
smartphones I seems like seventy two
percent is pretty high so I mean
eighteenth he's got that going for it I
think they've got the iphone to thank
for that but the quarterly financial
call is about to start and so if there's
any news out of that obviously and me in
while Apple just beat estimate than sold
30-34 point seven million iPhones in the
quarter so
reports of apples demise may have been
pretty much sure how wait how many
shocker 30 4.7 million iPhones or a be
beat estimates by about a billion yeah
yeah and they increase their their
payout by 50 billion so the dena mommy's
30 stock is just gonna drop plummet he
just yeah tank give up on it I know I
why anybody would hold on to apple stock
these days because clearly you know it's
going in the gutter right yea ye are not
find yeah I do i do feel as you should
not listen to us I you know stock I do
feel kind of bad I do feel kind of bad
for the people who used to be
zillionaires and are now only
billionaires because their apple shares
have dropped by several hundred dollars
I feel kind of bad about that but uh no
I don't anyway let's move on let's talk
about something besides financials man I
don't know man a 9.5 billion in profit
on 46 billion in revenue like I suppose
that's a tiny dip in their margin but
those margins are still just bonkers so
the thing is they're the biggest margins
in all of consumer electronics right I
mean the next biggest company is Samsung
uh and the oh I don't know what we had
the most recent numbers for Samsung's
profits are but generally they're on a
high court or heavy quarter likes a
holiday their profits are in the 5 to 7
million dollar or billion dollar rage
and you know Apple here is on q1 which
is admittedly a slow quarter its
post-holiday you don't have the sales of
the traffic that you get the previous
quarter and they're still pulling in
almost 10 billion dollars in profit
speaking of profit HTC has none but
they're trying that was the worst
transition ever one is a pivotal product
one is a very close and the first maybe
will be too well we'll see about the
first yeah I bet they're not make
ton of money on that but yeah we've got
like Peter Chou say that if the one
doesn't do well he's he's out we've got
that and it's on sale now basically but
the reason I'm bringing it up is one
they've got supply issues because the
Nokia is yelling at them about the
microphone that they're using okay fine
and then two and this is the interesting
thing of course you put up a article
today about the fact that they are
selling a unlocked uncarrier destroyed
ruined lte-enabled HTC One for less than
what AT&amp;amp;T sells it off contract it's the
holy grail man it like finally we can
all retire we can we can we can go to
our country homes and retire with our
our LTE HTC one's running on AT&amp;amp;T the
dream of turning eighteen t into a dumb
pipe has been realized we can all
celebrate while your champagne flutes
this is a great phone at frankly a great
price considering what you're getting
and and I I tried not to be too preachy
in my editorial that went up to today
but I have to say buying this device
this specific skew of the HTC One is one
of the most powerful things you can do
as a human being to encourage HTC and
other players in the Indus the industry
into believing that this is what this is
the drought the direction the industry
needs to go and it's something that
consumers want oh and and not only
should you be happy to buy it and be
happy with it but you know I run it in
an ironic twist 18t should be really
happy if you buy this phone because your
plan or your service costs with ATT
every month is still the same whether
you buy this phone or take a subsidized
phone so that's right II can get you to
buy a new phone without having them to
pay a subsidy on it they're just going
to be making more money each each well
once that you may talk to me it talks to
me about the bands that this will that
this will work on its LTE 700 850 AWS
1900 so what does that mean for normals
it means that you are completely covered
whether you're on t-mobile
or 18 US or in Canada on any carrier I
think that that offers LTE I've heard I
haven't confirmed personally but I've
heard that it doesn't support hspa+ for
t-mobile customers um but I mean frankly
the HSPA discussions kind of secondary
to me is the most important thing is
very generous PK plus is pretty awesome
when it's what it was awesome it's
really awesome but it is for sure
coverage issues yeah no no doubt no
doubt and and I mean frankly I feel much
better about buying a branded t mobile
device and I feel about buying a branded
18t device anyway so just I would like
if I were if I were on tmobile which
have been strongly considering doing for
weeks now but if I were on tmobile I
think I would probably just walk into a
carrier extraordin one no but t-mobile
has some pretty heavy bloatware on their
devices on its devices too well they
have Wi-Fi calling which is young really
nice but that's just to make up for you
know the holes in the network right kind
of or if you live in a Faraday cage like
I do it helps too I'm kind of getting to
the point with I use a micro spittle on
AT&amp;amp;T which i'm sure i said before
because it's the only way i can get a
signal and it's been deteriorating in
recent months to the point where i can't
hold a call for more than 60 or 90
seconds before i start breaking up for
the other person and i thought that by
resetting your know the microcell is
still screwed up and I've done some
searches on 18 tease forums and it seems
like this is becoming a widely known
issue for the 40 people across the
country that have a micro cell is 18 G
doesn't advertise it at all facebook
offers a Wi-Fi calling now voy para
android in the US yelp ego promise I
okay can i transfer my phone number to
it no just call your facebook friends
man I so so I should never speak to
anyone that I'm not Facebook friends
with his lawyers I don't know why you
would say that video else that's a fit
that's a fair point but anyway so like
this this one if you're in the market
for an android phone right now you're
not up for a an upgrade you're on AT&amp;amp;T a
like bar none
the one is the way to go as someone
pointed out to me and I've since updated
the poem what if what if what what about
like a galaxy s4 developer edition does
that exist for AT&amp;amp;T well assume it does
and a month yeah well then the story
might change but I Samsung has never
made a developer edition for eighteen t
as far as i know uh i if think you're
right yeah if they did then yeah we'd
have to revisit the conversation and
will you know we'll see when we have a
chance to review the gs4 you know what
the how the score at stacks up against
the one anyway but um yeah that's food
for thought but so the thing that I that
has me all hot and bothered about this
is HTC managed to do this why couldn't
you will have done this with the nexus 4
I mean seriously just I know that they
were trying to make a cheap they're
trying to keep the guys down and that's
awesome and adding LTE is a whole you
know it would raise the development
costs for the phone not just for the LTE
version but also the HSPA version and
like I get all that and EC already
dropped that money to develop the
version with LTE so they may as well do
it but it's like Google's short on cash
you know that the whole the when the
Nexus launched they had their own store
and we're taking on the carriers and
we're doing it again with the nexus 4
cuz it's so cheap um the I don't get why
they didn't do this because ATT is happy
to take an unlocked LTE device I also
don't particularly buy that theory
because as we all know the nexus 4 does
support LTE on an AWS they just chose to
disable it for well yeah but it supports
it but it's pretty janky and like
there's like well the heart I think the
point is the hardware is capable of
supporting it I mean that's all we noted
the optimus G right limits yeah yeah so
it's it's it's disabled and soft
whatever right and it could be it could
be something as simple as a battery look
like the day
antenna or something to I can't remember
there was something else that was
twitchy with AWS support I definitely
believe that LTE on the Nexus 4 is not
great I mean I totally buy it and and
you know there's a battery life concern
because LTE is a higher power draw and
it already sucks on HSPA so the last
thing you want abuse from or the latest
rumors for for Google i/o is that Google
is going to introduce an LTE version of
the nexus 4 and in white I bet remember
those pictures of the white Nexus works
right you know and and if if Google
actually does do that unless they
magically found a way to stuff a much
higher capacity battery in there or
they'd like double the thickness like I
have no interested it yeah so that's so
unhappy we'd rather have HTC's happily
unlocked LTE one or nexus 4 with stock
Android that's actually up to date uh
the one yeah I'm gonna have to say the
one is well I've been using the one for
a couple of weeks as I did the review on
the US model and you know stock Android
is great and all on the Nexus 4 but the
ones hardware is just so nice and you
know having the LTE is pretty sweet to
hear what's funny to me is that after
the piece went up a couple commoners
pointed out that Sonia started selling
the Xperia ZL in the US which never even
crossed my mind which I think speaks
volumes about Sony's position the US
market right now but but I don't think
that that is actually a fair comparison
because if you look at that Sony site
they're selling the CL for seven hundred
and sixty dollars which is completely
asinine versus 575 for the for the one
and as we saw in our review and Vlad
review the Xperia Z the zeal is very
similar busy is just not on the same
plane as the one in terms of hardware
and software design so I don't actually
think that's a fair comparison yeah so
back when Google was saying hey guys
we're gonna make a new Nexus pitches
picture stuff uh you've gotta like LG
came in and there's a G we're gonna you
wanna make a nexus out of this do you
think that HTC didn't have the one ready
to go and be like here is the one you
want to make the Nexus out of this it
didn't I'm if I'm google and I have an
opportunity to Bay
Nexus device off of the one or off of
the optimus G yeah well I mean if a
contest if you look at the developments
Isles if Google wanted to release the
nexus 4 by october i think yeah you know
the one isn't hitting shelves it's now
the end of april that is a huge lapse in
development in time' development we're
talking six to seven months difference
right um you know so i could very well
be that you know HTC did not have the
one nearly ready to go by October and
since October HTC's released the droid
DNA or the j butterfly which was like
its high-end pinnacle device until the
one came out so you know i would have
been very shocked if uh HTC could have
gotten it ready in time for that that
launch period i'm sure that they told
google they were working on it and that
they might really like it it'd be great
to work together but i would have been
very surprised if they could meet
google's demands for the launch launch
window and i will bet you a dollar that
google will not work with LG again any
time soon not an exercise yeah those
supply issues were so bad yeah because
they were airing their dirty laundry in
public for a while there and i'm sure
that that neither google nor LG is very
happy about it yeah i would be happy if
google would just work with somebody
that knows how to actually build a
retail store on the internet that would
be cool you know yes I'd be cool with
that and you know with with the back end
support and support when you know you
get one with a busted pixel and you need
to exchange it and return it all that
fun stuff yeah so as long as we're
talking about you know free unlock
phones we put up the story actually went
up pretty late in the day so I don't
think it got a ton of attention but the
ACLU is doing this crazy thing where
they are petitioning i forgot are not
suing are they but they're basically
going to the FCC and saying carriers
need to do better with with android
phones they need to offer updates its
security issue there there's now we're
and carriers are keeping you from having
the most recent version of android raise
a crazy weird thing for the aclu to do
but it's actually all about them trying
to draw attention to
you stuff like sista and like cyber
problems in general and issues of
privacy and you know rights in you know
with digital things so I mean I don't
know it's going to go anywhere but i
think it's it's really interesting and I
don't know has it didn't seem like it
got picked up sort of outside of you
know people noticing that they're doing
it and then it kind of just went away
the guy do you think this is going
anywhere well it's say you know the ACLU
is is half I'm you know I think a lot of
what the ACLU does look a lot of these
organizations is a hesitate to use the
word stunt but I can't think of a better
one right now that is designed to bring
attention to a problem more than it is a
serious attempt to actually get
something done because this is a very
difficult complaint to push through
Congress but you know I'm sure that
they're gonna be able to find friends
who are in support of this this petition
Franken comes immediately to mind but
what was really interesting to me about
it is that one of the things they see Lu
wants is some sort of warning label on
phones sold by carriers it says you know
warning this phone doesn't get security
updates in a timely fashion basically
yeah and I just picture like I think of
like a box of cigarettes with like he's
moving pillows label like I want
something that looks exactly like that
I'm like every phone sold by carrier
that would be amazing uh you know as far
as I feel I I really hope it gets
traction gets attention if only for the
sole reason that carriers might be more
inclined to or be forced to issue
updates faster I found it you know the
position of taking the whole making a
security issue its kind of kind of
interesting and unique it was a the ACLU
tends to be a bit hyperbolic with with
the way its wording and stuff like that
but you know it'd be interesting to see
if it does a takeoff and and if it does
then you know it's it's good for the
consumers that's really all the matters
in the end
I got nothing you try this on the
diner's dinner do want to talk about goo
I mean Google had their earnings and it
was whatever google earnings and then
Larry Page got on the call and he did
the thing that he always does where he
talks about when you drop your phone it
should shatter when you spill coffee on
it it shouldn't you know stop working
and so that there's a direction that you
know motor oil is probably going to have
you no more durable rugged phones for
the next thing and like we're spinning
up to something out of them we talked
about this a bunch last week so I don't
know if I got it still sad Larry Page
has been saying this numerous times
right he said this this I mean I think
verbatim the same thing he said a
numerous times but if you look at what
Motorola's produced for the past couple
of years uh the phones that it has kind
of fit that that mold I ready the razor
series are all nano-coated for you know
water resistance they're all Kevlar they
all have like gorilla glass or something
of that sort to help protect against
shattering actually I can't think of a
smartphone on the market these days that
doesn't have either branded gorilla
glass or something that says it is just
like a real a glass for you know
resisting shattering when you drop it so
so uh you know it it's a nice thing to
think about with doesn't really mean
that the next motorola devices are gonna
be revolutionary with these features I'm
not so sold to be honest with you I
don't accept anything less than gorilla
glass 3 with native damage resistance by
the way I if they'll fuels itself yeah
if my phone doesn't have a native damage
resistance I forget it i'm putting that
right back on the shelf and leaving the
store you drop it it shatters and you
look at it and it just it just heals
itself and you know i mean i will say
that i am looking forward to the next
display technology probably based on
flexible displays so that instead of
shattering or just being stronger
against shattering it'll actually be
able to flex internally so just you know
when you when it tastes and in package
it sort of absorbs it right you know
well i mean it's not the display that
breaks usually the ninety percent of the
time it's the glass above it that
displays that that breaks right and then
you have to get the classroom
play store you know if your displays
laminated the glass like it's very
common today you have to get the whole
thing replaced but it's really the glass
that's broken right yeah just just out
in public every day it amazes me how
many people I see using iphone 4 and 4s
is that are just complete they look like
they've been through a war zone and like
be you know people don't want you know
that they're not up for an upgrade and
they don't have a damaged plan on their
account so they just deal with it and
calm assume you saw a sheep there's yes
there's a whole cottage industry if you
go to any you know a suburban mall in
America there are kiosks that will
replace your screen or your glass for 90
bucks or something like that yeah I know
they're they're always busy doing this
is because people are constantly
dropping these things and breaking them
I know I mentioned Jordan earlier when I
was talking about mwc he owned a nexus
for that unfortunately meta demise
recently and it shattered screen and his
phone is unusable a couple weeks ago
poor guy I know yeah what are these
differences with some phones you can
work through that shatter glass like it
happens we with the iphone if you've got
spider cracks all over it you can still
type on it and the screen is still
responsive but it seems to be from the
people have spoken to who have dropped
say a nexus 4 on shatter the glass the
screen becomes unusable afterwards it
doesn't respond to touches or anything
like that so yeah it's an issue it's
definitely you know and and if someone's
able to figure it out whether it's
through flexible displays or stronger
glass or self-healing glass in the
future that'd be good also there's
there's a rumor going around this week
and I don't think we reported on it
because it's you know it's just a rumor
at this point but there there is a word
going around that the note 3 is going to
have a flexible display which I believe
um you know it could be wrong but I I
think that we finally Samsung is finally
nearing the point where the technology
is ready and the product is ready so
they're going to be able to integrate it
they didn't get there with the gs4 but
it's no secret that samsung wants to get
there they've been working on this
technology for years now and I think
that the note 3 might be where it debuts
and it makes sense because on a screen
that big you know the bigger the screen
the higher the risk so I could totally
see it
uh I guess that's that's about
everything I want to talk about Oh
unless you guys want to talk about
Yahoo's a weather app it's pretty I
actually asked and an eye I'm back on
the iphone I need a weather app you get
one answer you can say one app I need
one weather app tell me which one to get
I don't care I'll buy whatever give me
one app he lasted about 30 seconds
before he gave me a second okay I
believe that I gave you the best
answering hood for a free option and if
you're going to spend money option and
what we're recommending or what were
they handle it so for the free one I
actually told them to go get the yahoo
on the Yahoo app is gorgeous it's got
everything about the Yahoo app is
amazing except for the icon which is
that sorta rendus looking awful and and
I think I tweeted this the other day
when Yahoo's other new app came out they
revamped the actual yahoo news app uh
and you know I said yahoo is making
these beautiful gorgeous well-designed
apps and they're stuffing these
god-awful in 2001 era Yahoo purple icons
on them and they looked so terrible mean
it just like such a dichotomy clear day
you can I can't get i predict i
predict then in the next 12 months yahoo
will actually rebrand I mean it'll still
be called Yahoo but I'm sure they're
gonna roll out new branding are they
gonna keep you ! yeah yeah but they'll
probably do something like really
stylistic with it was like it's one of
the lighters or something that they like
integrated into the logo so I know how
many pokin again with the till have that
logo where the letters are like shifted
in different heights like eBay was the
other big one that had that right and
ebay got rid of it i think in 2011 or
last year or something so ebay he's got
a much more modern clean look and now
you look at yahoo's and it just looks so
1999 yeah yeah but i'm telling you like
like if yahoo tries to go with like a
like straight clean Helvetica bring you
know lettering for their learn logo
that's just not gonna work they need to
keep it a little because it's called
Yahoo it's not called eBay eBay can
sound corporate you don't really never
sound anything but you can i think in
google and google google sounds like the
most ridiculous word ever and it's got a
way cleaner
presentation and Google we've done lots
of reports on Google's design
unification in the design focus that
they're having now and Google doesn't
mean anything Google I mean I mean net
what is yeah i mean uh well if I'm
allowed to have an answer on this on
this weather app debate may I just say
that I have settled on an iOS I've
settled on the new accuweather app I
choose looking on Android a lot odia got
a weather app on Android a lot and it
sits on the the one with Sense 5 the the
stock weather app that comes with or
whatever is powered by a key weather and
it's it's very similar to the
accuweather app you might buy or
download from the Play Store hmm can we
talk about apps that actually matter I
don't know what apps twitterrific and
tweet bot both just got updates
twitterrific finally added push
notifications uh and it's a beautiful
app and I'm really excited for and then
tweetbot added this new feature that's
like kind of like Instagram where you
can set your timeline to look like just
like a bunch of big pictures it looks
like Google+ to me if you look at the
Google+ app for iOS or Android it's got
the same kind of timeline with the
pictures are big and the media's so how
do you toggle the new timeline I forget
you scroll all the way to the top and
then when you like reveal the search box
you should have a button Molly I am at
the top there yeah yeah see that's just
this just looks really good this is this
is a great way to scroll through
pictures on Twitter way better than
cards like and so now I'm I'm confused
about what my twitter app on the iPhone
should be nothing else except for the
actual twitter app does a good job of
giving you replies only from people you
follow which no Tweetbot does they had
blood those it yeah maybe they had a bug
with it for a little while and it was
really frustrating so showing mentions
from everybody but it seems to be I
think it's been resolved where you know
you can choose only your followers and
as far as I know and I could be very
mistaken as but as the Twitter apps that
I've used for any platform tweetbot is
the only third party one that I'm aware
of that gives you that option
like on Twitter even on Android the ones
that I've used um let's have my
experience that if they have some sort
of notifications hey they're not push
the the Twitter app on android is the
only one that offers you push
notifications right be they are like
mentions from everybody instead of just
the people you follow another thing that
one of the difference between twitter
african tweetbot for me yeah i like to
see on the main twitter app I'd like to
see my retweets and my follows in the
connect tab that's fun makes me feel
good and then are there any Twitter apps
third-party Twitter apps that will give
you those Twitter notifications like if
I want to get every single tweet from
so-and-so notified to me used to be able
to do it over SMS now you you know you
can still can I guess but you get it you
get it pushed out to you as a you know
Twitter notification such-and-such
tweeted something I don't think only the
main twitter app does that and hopefully
somebody on twitter is going to correct
me I i wanna say I'm bounced between
three twitter us right now that's not
cool I want to say that a Falcon pro on
Android gives you this option I'm just
getting a giving a little warm up here
I'm a coffee so wow thank you thank you
jordan that's amazing that is this is
the kind of service you get in the verge
students copy is is way better than
verge West coffee if it serves you in
the podcast verge coffee in person
that's me ah but yeah I want to say
Falcon pro gives you those kind of
options but pros been updated
like a billion times ah and even though
he ran the developer ran into some
issues with the hitting the the token
limit he's still been yeah he recently
names like he just said everybody has to
relog in because then get a new tokens
that way or you know clear up my tip the
tokens that I already have so yeah I'm a
big fan of Falcon pro but yeah an
Android I'd still usually go back to me
to our client because push so right um
that is a virtual show everybody unless
I'm almost interrupt me and say we're
not done yet the Vlad's not here so
maybe that will happen okay that's all I
God ah wait wait I could I could I'll
just very briefly talk about expend a
couple days at I've
yeah I know we should definitely hear
about this how was it it was um it was
not uh I mean there was nothing
groundbreaking that really happened
except for the release of the new
facebook apps which dieter I know you
were involved pretty heavily in covering
and I I you know I have mixed feelings
on chad's uh I I feel like like
everybody in the world is like super
gung-ho for them I'm not so sure now
that I had had a chance to use them on
the iphone but it is what it is and I
think they're rolled out to everybody
now is that right at first they were
rolled out to every like yeah even
though you're updating to the latest
client ya and ya know a server yeah I
don't know check on the iphone it's very
different the chat heads on Android just
because it's locked within the the
facebook app so it's unless you
jailbreak unless you do unless you yeah
you jailbreak great but that job doesn't
cover SMS alright iphone right right
yeah I just don't like I don't want
these little circles all over the border
of my screen it's weird um let me get
the satisfaction of dragging them to the
bottom and get rid of like that's so
much fun I got absolute Ted and be like
no I don't respond to union i will give
Facebook a lot of credit for creating a
a genuinely unique a UX four for their
messaging product that I haven't seen
before I'll say that much and again that
people are super gung-ho about it so
that's cool but the reason I bring that
up is because when the last sessions of
the conference was with Michael sippy
who is head of engineering head of
products and a product I think for for
Twitter head of mobile product he's
something he does something at twitter
has that's the guy that um that whenever
whenever Twitter needs to have post bad
news for developers of Twitter clients
he's the guy that posts the news up
saying we're changing our API and it's
as great news and turns out it's
actually the worst news ever he gets to
be the bad guy he always has to be the
bad guy so yeah they sit down with with
tippy and and you know the the the talk
was was interesting he talked about some
of the stats in the wake of the the
Boston bombings and he talked
a little bit about well he didn't talk
about Twitter music it hadn't been
announced at that point he kind of
deflected that question but I actually
the most interesting thing about it to
me was that Steven Levy the world famous
reporter for for for Wired asked a
question of sippy afterwards which is
which was you know Facebook home is a
thing now could you ever see Twitter uh
you know being promoted to that level of
direct engagement with the user on on
the homescreen and lockscreen and he
didn't I'm he obviously didn't say yes
but he certainly didn't say no he's like
we're playing with different things on
Android you know I I would love to have
I can't remember his exact phrasing but
he's basically like I would love to have
that same level of exposure that
Facebook is getting a facebook help and
we're playing with things on Android so
uh that the story about the UX for
Twitter on Android certainly is not over
the last chapter has not been written
but whether that means that they're
going to roll out of skin or do
something else I don't know but I
thought it was an interesting talk that
was probably the most interesting
session of the show who's pretty there
were a lot of there wasn't a lot of news
there besides the Facebook thing but I
did think that was a pretty interesting
little chat with with sippy so we'll see
I'm curious as to how Twitter would
actually do that I suppose it would be
something could be something similar to
what Facebook did with home but
Facebook's we've written quite a bit
about Facebook's big pushes into private
messaging now and they want to be a
central hub for all your messaging
services and private messaging and you
know in recent times in the past year or
so Twitter's kind of pushed away from
that if you use the stock twitter app in
time though yeah they've done everything
possible to make direct messaging a pain
right it's insane right so and also it's
still like insanely easy to DM fail and
accidentally published a.m. to your
timeline so yeah it's definitely not as
developed as Facebook's story is and
also they don't have the same level of
curation of content it's just kind of
like a it's a constant floodgate of pic
runs and via so so Facebook does a thing
where they you can get access to the
fire hose finally now again that they've
added these filters
and they've added them on the iOS app
and i think on ipad but not yet on
android and its of course on the web
where you can you can go to the firehose
i think it's called latest or whatever
but the default is the newsfeed that
just gives you stuff that they expect
you're going to like the most and
twitter has nothing like that and i wish
that they would take this completely
useless and pointless discover tab and
do a better job of creating something
like the newsfeed because right now like
every time I go they're like oh maybe
this will be good then like well no this
I well I have some bad news for you
about the discover tempest that didn't
actually come up in the sippy
conversation and and he was basically
like you know look new users love it
like they go straight to the discover
tab they find some cool crap in there to
follow they love it like power users you
know people have been using Twitter for
any like the time never go there but
they seem really intent on pushing like
if you're just literally now signing up
for Twitter if you're that far behind
the curve ladies and gentlemen hopefully
none of our listeners are or or if if
you're like some verge staffers and
you're signing up your 40th parody
Twitter account then apparently they get
a lot of engagement that discovered that
and maybe it's just because they push I
don't know like it maybe they like
that's the default if you're a new user
I don't know but he says that like
people are really into it if they're on
Twitter for the first time hmm fine what
I've as wife there I'm sorry um whatever
dude whatever that's a virginal so if
you want to follow us on Twitter in your
discover tab or sure any any other tab
