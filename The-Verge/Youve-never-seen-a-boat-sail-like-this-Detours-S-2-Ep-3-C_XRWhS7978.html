sailing is a 7,000 year old technology
that has been almost completely replaced
in the modern world commercial ships are
run by fuel hungry engines which become
less economically and environmentally
feasible by the moment to San
francisco-based
entrepreneurs have developed a
technology to revive sailing and do
their part to save the world
the ferry system in San Francisco Bay is
very popular the people that use the
ferry system either on a normal commute
or when we have the emergencies that
happen on a periodic basis when the
earthquake hit an 89 the Bay Bridge went
on an operation the ferry systems took
over the problem with the ferry systems
our way they're currently instituted is
they are horrendously inefficient in
terms of diesel use they're also
creating a lot of greenhouse gas and
it's just not sustainable you can drive
your cadillac escalade across the Golden
Gate Bridge and get 19 miles per gallon
and you'd be far more environmentally
correct than you would be to take the
ferry system the way it's currently
operated some of these vessels burn 300
gallons an hour there is certainly an
overwhelming desire to make ferries
greener cleaner more fuel efficient and
after all the frozen barrier our
government subsidized so if we can save
costs to save taxpayers so it's kind of
a win across the board I met Jay I guess
two years ago and his juices his wedding
project from that moment I guess there
was six months of design iterations a
lot of different tests to optimize the
size of the wing for this test platform
and then the actual build took maybe six
months
everybody knows what normal sales are
like they're just fabric and they're
essentially one side of a wing the
benefit from the wing is that you have
two sides and it's a very precise shape
so an equal sized soft sail and a wing
the wing is going to be about twice as
effective twice as powerful the wing is
45 feet tall from the back is 10 feet
it weighs roughly 600 pounds so it's a
very very light structure sort of been
significant to the way the ferry and its
potential e very powerful these ferries
are traveling along 30 and 40 knots
sometimes and I feel the exact number I
certainly can produce something six or
seven tons of force at full speed if
required
so the wing also has inside of it a
brain it has a GPS system it has a
satellite tracking system it has a
vessel data recording system it knows
where it is
it knows where you're going all we have
to do is turn the wing on and off the
people that drive big ships are not
sailors so there's kind of a
discontinuity between wind power systems
and the people on the boat or just not
going to use those systems what this
wing does is completely autonomous the
crew doesn't need to know anything about
the wing or how it works is literally an
on/off system we do that by having a
feathering tale system very much like a
tail on an aeroplane controls the pitch
and hence the lift we have a vertical
tail that controls the wing and hence
the power the wing producers if it can
make power for the boat it will do they
can't it does feathers and is kind of a
benign thing on the ship in a way you
can say that the wing is a hybrid system
it's not intended to completely replace
the motors it is intended to make them
as efficient as possible and use the
wind to drive the vessel as much as
possible the ferries Newbery I think
they use certainly over a million
dollars worth of fuel per year you know
25 ferries we've demonstrated we could
save now 30 to 40 percent of the fuel
costs
we have proven technology works and is
valid and says fuel and emissions it's
really handed over to them - I guess
then also the lawmakers were certainly
the policy makers we've demonstrated the
technology is available are they going
to insist that technology is included in
the next generation of ferries I think
it's going to become a requirement
pretty soon that the energy standards
and greenhouse gas emissions are going
to be you're going to have to show that
you're reducing if you can't show that
you reduced from what has been done in
the past I don't think they're going to
allow the technology to some it might be
a threat I mean you're going to use less
fuel you're probably going to have
smaller motors you're going to do things
differently basically a choice you
either go that the dirty diesel route or
you can go for a clean tech route the
winds got a tremendous amount of power
in it with 17 quadrillion kilowatt hours
of power in the wind in the course of a
year it's a number that's unimaginable
if there's only a 1% chance that we're
going to seriously damage the conditions
of life on earth that 1% chance is
enough for me to say okay we've got to
do something here the rest of the
universe is 20 miles this way 20 miles
up is what the rest of the universe
looks like we absolutely have got to
stop pumping carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere and everything that we can do
to change that is what we've got to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
