they are looking at the toshiba 7.7 it
is a seven point seven inch tablet
that's probably going to be the
successor to the 8200 distinguish
codenamed 8270 we actually saw a
prototype of this at CES last month but
now it's here at the tegra booth at
Mobile World Congress and that means of
course is running a Tegra 3 processor
clocked I believe at 1.5 gigahertz but
we're not totally sure I might be specs
aren't there it's you know it's just
here at the blue ones and I know she
been officially announcing it and
there's also a new game on here called
golden era from went over your software
and it's you know something to achieve
it likes to do a tech demo of the kind
of graphics they can thrive on the
device it's going to be available in the
TegraZone actually believe it's
available now and so we'll just load it
up and show you the game here to zoom
again due to obviously LG and that's
about all we know it's a type of three
tablet seven point seven inches it is
remarkably thin actually for a seven
point seven inch tablet most tablets of
this size are a bit thicker we've got
stereo speakers on the bottom a very
very large port connector and the plug
is actually even bigger it's actually
kind of amazing there's a microSD slot
and a micro USB port and then we've got
volume and a switch which i believe is
used for keeping if you rotate but again
we don't have full details on the device
so this is a toshiba 7.7 running a Tegra
3 processor</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
