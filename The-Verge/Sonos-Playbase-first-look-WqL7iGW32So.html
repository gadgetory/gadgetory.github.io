Boston at the Sonos office we've been
touring their space all day checking out
the first new speaker in a long time
it's called the play Bates
now you might know the Sonos playbar
that's a sound bar if you're leaving the
room the play base also goes in your
living room but instead of a sound bar
it's a speaker vacant flat that sits
underneath your TV son√≠s isn't working
on this for a year so you've spent the
day touring all their chambers and test
labs and talking to all the engineers
who obsess over every detail about
disappear we've seen the style speaker
before from other companies but Sonos
wants you to know just how much work
went into this one like the 43,000
individually drilled holes around the
sides or the S port inside or airflow
travels through now that's all well and
good but for you this is still just a
speaker that's going to sit under your
TV the play bass is equal parts TD
speaker and music speaker so it works
all the same popular streaming services
for multi-room audio there are only
three plugs in the play bass optical
audio Ethernet and power inside are 10
amplified speakers 6 mid-range three
tweeters and one woofer all of them
custom designed by Sonos you can buy a
subwoofer for deeper rumbling bass or
add a pair of Sonos play:1 speakers for
a surround sound set up if you add a sub
we have engineer engineer it so it it it
outperforms with a sub because the sub
can takes a lot of the strain away from
some of the transitions as far as the
low-frequency go so it performs
differently with the sub and is a better
experience
that's Giles Martin who was someone
else's sound expert I asked him whether
someone already has a play bar should
actually upgrade to the play bass and he
said no you know what I would say if
someone had a someone had to play bar
never they weren't to spend them and I
wouldn't say get rid your play by their
flat plates me personally I'd say you
know because the speakers are in your
home
granular but in truth the plate they
send it pretty terrific without those
things the demos I saw unfortunately not
all is perfect play base doesn't have
some features important home theater
fans like DTS decoding for the best
quality surround sound and the play base
doesn't support HDMI Arc so you can't
use one remote to control all of your
home theater gear but ultimately that's
not what so most cares about Sonos wants
this to be the do everything speak over
people who can spend a little bit of
money on something that looks pretty
good and sounds pretty fantastic in
their living rooms the play base is
going to ship in April for $700 that's
the same price as the play bar and we're
going to have much more on it soon but
for now make sure to subscribe to the
