of legislative efforts called kill
switch build their basic goal is to turn
off your phone remotely and that's not
just turn it off like the power that's
like disable it from being able to
connect to ATT or Verizon or even be
able to install apps so the big piece of
legislation that's coming up is this
bill from California it's basically
passed the Senate it's gone through
committee and now it's on the Assembly
floor which means it's just a couple
steps away from being signed into law by
the governor if it gets approved and
it's basically going to require cell
phone companies starting next July to
provide a way to remotely wipe with a
way to disable it completely and way to
revert everything when you're done the
other side of this is that cell phone
companies do cell phone manufacturers
have already kind of agreed to do this
they're a part of a consortium called a
ctia and they all signed something a
couple months ago that basically said we
are going to provide all these features
anyways because it's something we need
to do and so that goes into effect next
July as well so you kind of have the
situation now where you have these laws
bumping against the self-regulation of
these companies the main reason to have
this kind of legislation out there is
the people's phones are being stolen
faster than ever millions of phones are
being stolen every year a lot of not
really violently people are just kind of
leaving them in restaurants or bars or
taxicabs and it's very easy to flip them
and sell them on one side is really
about consumer protection but it's also
about kind of making it really simple to
make these things less worthwhile to
steal I think the downside right now
especially within this legislation and
this is something that the Electronic
Frontier Foundation is kind of arguing
is that if you make all these companies
do something maybe a better version
comes out later but they still have to
comply with this law that you could
theoretically have a situation where
they still have to provide this and it's
hindering them from really innovating as
quickly also you run it as some sort of
issues where maybe it costs it brings up
the expense to make these devices or it
kind of creates this blow in software I
don't think these fears are really well
founded but they're legitimate issue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
