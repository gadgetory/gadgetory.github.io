seems like all I'm hearing about lately
is artificial intelligence artificial
intelligence artificial intelligence
it's all about artificial intelligence I
think it's time we talk about AI okay I
love my google assistant and I even say
good night to it which is mildly
embarrassing but I'm here for it because
then it tells me the weather for
tomorrow and it like plays cricket
sounds which I think are actually
helping me sleep better and it's also
getting to know me right so it tells me
when the trains gonna leave in the
morning and it's even recommending songs
I might like and for a long time
companies have been pushing this off as
artificial intelligence which I always
thought it was a marketing term like I
don't think we think that Siri is
intelligent but then Google showed us
this I'm looking for something on May
3rd that's the voice of Google assistant
making calls for you this made me think
that maybe artificial intelligence is
closer to replicating human intelligence
than I thought so I called James Anson
and he's the reporter here at the verge
that covers all things AI I wanted to
know where AI is right now and where
it's going so AI as a field as a term is
it's an umbrella and it includes lots it
if in types of AI that kind of come into
fashion over the years and then they
test them they gets the limitations and
they move on to the next one and the
thing that's you know very much dominant
in the field of moment is machine
learning which is all about giving a
system a lot of data and then it goes
through that data and it learns the
patterns within it and then a flavor of
machine learning is what's put deep
learning deep learning is basically you
know basically machine learning but it
uses a lot of data and it uses a lot of
computing power which we now have access
to thanks to the internet and thanks to
achieve chips okay James real talk
though
have you seen terminator I mean how
close are we to the Skynet's of rural
like I is that coming it's not really I
mean so what you get in films popular
culture that is what's you know usually
called artificial general intelligence
which is a huge step forward from what
we've got at the present moment and so
any I as a field was kind of founded on
this belief that you could build you
know computers that were just humans
essentially that just kind of thought
like humans acting reacted like humans
and as it's gone on we've kind of
realized that I'll wait no no this is a
really difficult task and we're not near
it basically so while Google duplex
sounds very human it's actually what we
call narrow AI now at the moment
everything that's being sold to you as
AI is narrow AI and it was built under a
limited predetermined set of functions
it pops up on your phone your Google
home or your echo and it's how Facebook
recognizes your face and automatically
takes photos of you this form of AI is
designed to complete very specific tasks
and it's incapable of doing anything
else now that doesn't mean it can't do
impressive things
take for example deep minds alphago
which is an AI program trained to play
the game go now go is like a strategy
game sort of like chess except it has
way more possible outcomes and in 2016
the AI system battle against legendary
go player Lisa doe defeating him four to
one and in 2017 deep minor tired the
alphago AI after defeated the world's
best go player three to zero I like to
point out that this program alphago
would continue playing go even if the
building it was in was on fire even if
the room was on fire that's dr. Oren
Etzioni CEO of Allen Institute of
artificial intelligence and professor at
the University of Washington in Seattle
it's an excellent symbol because it
shows that in these very narrow very
well structured tasks like a board game
we can achieve superhuman performance
but on things that are more nuanced
things that have to do with language we
are actually very far from even the
abilities of a child so common sense
could be thought of as the missing link
between AI and AGI and when we're
referring to come and sense we're
referring to the whole range of
capability
that humans have and computers just
don't doctor etzioni is one of many
researchers that are working on programs
to teach computers common sense but
within the community there's a large
debate over whether these smarter
computers could be dangerous
today narrow AI is being used to solve
very real very serious problems like
helping doctors diagnose cancer or
predicting future weather disasters but
it's also being used for things that
people find worrying and that's
understandable I mean these are things
like facial recognition from mass
surveillance or augmenting weapons
which raises the question how if at all
is AI going to be regulated this world
evolves so rapidly that it's very hard
to put these policies in place what I
would suggest instead is that we
identify applications of AI for example
AI cards or AI weapons and that we
define very careful regulations around
those specific applications so yeah I
was creeped out by Google duplex but
it's nowhere near the AI we have in the
movies this is very specific pointed AI
and when that's applied to security or
weapons it can be scary but all we can
do is educate ourselves and be in the
know about what AI we have right now and
maybe where it's going these are still
early days and we should assess the
exuberance people have and be some of
the fears that they have with with a
note of caution and skepticism if you
want to know what AI can really do and
what it can't just have a chat with Siri
and Alexa and you'll quickly see where
reality stops and the hype begins
hey thanks for watching let us know in
the comments below your favorite uses of
AI so far what's helping you in your
day-to-day and thanks for 2 million
subscribers that's hella cool and see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
