Z force there are two new Android
smartphones coming to Verizon this month
as the latest droids one of them is
crazy then the other one is shatterproof
neither phone has a headphone jack
they've got the same design though metal
and glass they look really nice and
they're fast they have all the latest
specs you'd want there are some
differences but the most important thing
the coolest thing is what they share in
common these snap-on accessory is called
moto mods that make these phones more
than they are out of the box we're
seeing more and more of this module or
idea lately from LG g5 and eventually
Google's Project ara but the Moto Z is
here now so it's a big test of whether
there's something behind this whole idea
or if it's just a stupid gimmick the
Moto Z is the thinnest premium
smartphone ever made according to Lenovo
it's the sort of thing that you do
notice as soon as you pick it up the
Moto Z force is thicker and heavier
because it's got a big battery inside
and a screen that won't crack or break
no matter how many times you drop it but
let's start with the two big new things
first is that missing headphone jack so
you've got two choices use wireless
bluetooth headphones or attach this long
adaptors any wired headphones you've
already got and it gets pretty annoying
to be honest I wish the thicker Moto Z
force at the headphone jack at least but
it doesn't but then we get to the modem
odds
on the back of each phone or strong
magnets and these little connectors that
talk to the various add-ons you can buy
simple style covers to change the look
of your phone but the real draw so says
Lenovo are these other ones there's a
speaker that attaches to the back and
puts out louder better sound than any
smart phone could ever hope to there's a
projector that can turn any wall into a
Netflix movie screen and you can also
buy a battery pack for a charge on the
go no matter which mode of zphone you
buy modem odds work the same way and
they're guaranteed to work on future
Moto Z phones as well they're fun and
different from your everyday smartphone
accessory they're going to blow some
minds when you show people how they work
but the question is are they worth the
edit cost on top of the phone itself
right now not really but this approach
to a modular phone feels right whether
it's one of the style covers or the much
larger speaker modem odds snap on and
never feel like they're going to come
loose the JBL speaker and projector
charge when attached the Moto Z and
plugged into a charger of course
and you can also juice them up
separately from the phone because each
has its own USB see jack
you'll see battery indicators for the Z
itself and any attached modem odds on
screen so you'll know when something is
getting low on power but I don't know
why you would need these style covers
sure there are only 15 bucks and give
the Moto Z a more personalized feel with
different textures and colors and they
look nicer than a case would JBL sound
boost speaker though that's $80 which is
what you pay for a decent Bluetooth
speaker that works with a lot of devices
not just a single phone and the
projector let's talk about that
projector it's $300 that's half the
price of these phones it is easy to use
there's a focus dial power button and
that's about it and the pictures big ole
stretch up to 70 inches but it's only
480p and looks kind of washed out I
think that price ultimately is going to
rule this out for just about everybody
it's just too expensive the battery
cases are a bit more useful day-to-day
but they won't charge up either phone to
100% and they're not cheap but they
range in price from sixty to eighty
dollars and the thing is both of these
phones charge really fast with the
included charger so I'm not sure why you
would need this
maybe if you'll be away from the outlet
all day long then I can see it otherwise
you're probably better off pass so more
motor mods are coming but these first
few are less than essential but the
phones themselves are pretty awesome
just look at these specs 5.5 inch
screens Snapdragon 820 processors 4 gigs
of RAM plenty of storage plus micro sd
but for sound there is just one speaker
in the earpiece
sounds pretty lousy and it's a big
downgrade from last year's Moto X the
moto Z Force has Gorilla Glass 4 on top
just like any other smartphone these
days but the force is version 2 of moto
shadder shield acknowledged II there are
five layers with a durable plastic hard
coat on top it'll scratch way easier
than glass but if it gets too bad you
can have verizon replace it what it
won't do is break or shatter no matter
how many drops you put it through this
is guaranteed for four years we're just
going to be longer then you're going to
have this phone to begin with then
there's the camera moto C is the 13
megapixel camera the four says 21
megapixels both have bright F 1.8 lenses
with optical image stabilization and
laser autofocus
and the force taxon phase detector
autofocus as well neither really seem
like the obvious choice to me though the
force does capture more detail of course
both get you good results but they
really know better than any other 2016
Android flagship the last key difference
comes with the battery the moto C is a
2600 milliamp hour battery and the force
has a much larger 3500 milliamp hour
battery the plain old moto Z already
lasts through a standard day for me and
charges fast enough to where I never
really missed the forces bigger battery
now this being a droid Verizon shoves a
bunch of terrible apps under the motor Z
but you can turn most of them off and
what you're left with is super fast
performance with Motorola's popular
improvements to android on top this is
still the best notifications experience
around and moto voice is always there
listening for your spoken commands and
questions but right now it's not a great
time to buy a smart phone
you've got the galaxy note 7 coming new
Nexus phones a new iPhone there's
nothing wrong with the Moto Z or the
motor Z course they're fast and fun to
use but they're really no better than
the galaxy s7 that came out several
months ago these aren't really the
game-changing modular phones that some
of us hope for they show the concept has
potential but for now the Moto Z is a
great Android phone with some fun but
overpriced attachments
