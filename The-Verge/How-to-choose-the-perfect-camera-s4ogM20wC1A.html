many but that's because it took me a
really long time to figure out the style
I wanted and then figure out a way to
achieve that style which it's 35
millimeter Kodak film I should have just
known anywho people are always asking me
Bekka what camera should I buy guys
that's a loaded question there are a lot
of fish in the sea
aka cameras and they all have their
strengths and weaknesses and this is
workflow it's all about what we
personally use so keep in mind this is
my personal arsenal and what you use is
probably different and if we could all
have Leica's come on we'd all buy a
Leica first and foremost have some
self-awareness what are you using this
camera for in my eyes there are three
types of amateur photographers you have
your instagramers you have your
instagramers with nice cameras and then
you have your I take nice photos at
family events and maybe I make a couple
of bucks on the weekend shooting
headshots or weddings but let's start
with our in statics for you you probably
don't want to be taking extra gear
around you probably don't really know
what an f-stop is that's not a bad thing
you just don't know what it is and you
want something that's portable easy and
can take with you anywhere just use your
phone by a pixel 3 get an iPhone 10 R or
10s or you one of the newest iPhones the
photos are honestly bangin and if you
don't believe me check out one of our
reviews especially the pixel three of
you we put him a head-to-head and I was
like kind of shocked moving on we have
our there's no way that was Shanda phone
instagramers or the novice travel
photographer you want something light
and portable maybe gives you a little
depth of field and most importantly
doesn't have you looking at a phone
every time you want to take a photo for
that I use a Sony rx100 Mark 4 but I
would say that canons g7 X mark 2 or
lumix lx7 or two are great options as
well these are a step above your phones
can
and for around $1,000 they have really
nice specs I mean they can shoot raw so
if you're doing any post-processing
you'll have a lot of latitude in your
photos they have 4k really sharp video
better than what your phone could do
they just have like a bigger sensor so
everything's a little bit cleaner I
really like about these cameras is the
EVF or electronic viewfinder it shows
you exactly what your photos gonna look
like when you hit the shutter button now
there's no fancy attachments you only
get the lens that comes on it but if
you're not looking to like really get to
know photography this could be a great
gateway to just dabble or dip your toes
Becca come on I know what an f-stop is
awesome so let's talk about the big guys
here those are the mirrorless and the
DSLRs they're definitely a step above
what we've talked about previously I
mean you're talking about lenses and
batteries and bigger bodies and a price
tag of at least $2,000 for just the body
of the camera alone and then a good lens
is gonna be a thousand dollars there's
just a lot more stuff including the
knowledge that you'll have to have to
use it but let's talk for that I use the
5d Mark 3 and at night I use an a7 s
mark 2 here's why the 5d is incredible
like I just really like its texture of
its photos I'm really used to the Canon
eco system including the menus and the
buttons I just don't think it performs
well at night I don't feel comfortable
pushing its ISO now the a7 s mark ii
does really well in low light also the
a7 s has an e VF and that bright
viewfinder makes all the difference for
shooting at night for me your camera is
something very personal it's something
that you're gonna hold in your hand more
than hopefully your phone or anything
else so go to the store test them out
feel it for yourself and get what it
feels best to you because you're the one
shooting with it and hopefully it's
something that makes you want to shoot
more all of these cameras are great but
they have their flaws so if I could have
one camera that does everything I need
it would look a little bit like
the most important thing for me is a
small camera body it's the main reason I
love my rs.100 so much not to mention
the single action electronic viewfinder
and crazy moveable screen
I do wish it came with a grip though
it's like super slippery so let's grab
the small grip from the Fuji x70 and put
it on the body of the rx100 mark 6 now
with my eye to the viewfinder I really
like having my shutter speed and f-stop
on my left hand before digital controls
these options were built into the lenses
and in using a lot of film cameras I've
totally become accustomed to this Nikon
f-mount hasn't changed since 1959 and is
still compatible with their camera
buddies today I appreciate that
and I have a lot of f-mount lenses and
I'm gonna put an F mount lens system on
this camera alright moving to the top I
super dig the dials on top of Fuji
cameras in general I've really
appreciated how Fuji has kept their
controls on the outside of their cameras
instead of menus or via buttons so let's
grab that dial on top but I'm gonna make
it an ISO dial that I can program to be
different increments also I'm gonna grab
that hot shoe mount for a micro flat
alright it's that time let's talk about
a sensor I'm gonna take the sensor from
the sony a7r Mark 3 that low light range
has me sold and it's 42 megapixels I
mean come on
and since this is my dream camera on the
side we're putting a headphone jack
we're putting in XLR input USB C micro
HDMI and internally there's definitely
built-in Indies
anywho you got the camera you got
literally the sickest shot you've ever
taken in your life and you want to make
some tight at it and then post it
somewhere if I'm on my phone or using my
arch 100 I usually just use instagrams
in-house editing tools I'm typically
only like muddying the blacks with some
blue and upping the contrast and that
does everything I need but if I wanted
to take it a step further Lightroom is
incredible on mobile and better yet it's
free so if you don't have this
downloaded and you make edits to photos
on your phone go go right now if I'm on
my desktop that usually means that I
shot on an a7 s or a Canon and I have a
raw file and for that Lightroom all the
way it is expensive but it has all the
tools and I'm really used to it now some
people complain about its workflow it
can be like confusing like where did all
my photos go but as long as you keep
your folders organized and you're
starring things and then deleting things
you don't need it's really not that hard
my room she expensive so if you don't
quite have the money for that there's
this awesome program called raw therapy
it can open raw and TIFF and JPEG files
and it has a lot of tools that light
room has but it's free and they're
constantly making updates to it via
their blog so check them out this series
want to be possible without our sponsor
Capital One they're reimagining banking
by offering accounts that have no fees
or minimums and can be open from
anywhere in five minutes
Capital One what's in your wallet
I know I didn't mention a single Fuji
camera and I'm so sorry because they
have a cult following and I know you're
out there including one of our directors
here Viren he loves his I just had never
got into it but soon enough I'll get my
hands on one and I'll be hashtag Fuji
frames too so hold tight for that all
right and for now let's make bad
decisions and fly drones inside</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
