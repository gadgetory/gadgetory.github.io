materials of the future instead of the
materials of today and that future is
right around the corner
google has a new design language it's
going to be use across all its products
going forward starting with Android but
it's more than just a new idea about how
software should look it's a new idea of
what software actually is it's called
material design
what if pixels didn't just have color
but also depth what if there was an
intelligent material that was as simple
as paper but could transform and change
shape in response to touch
and this led us to a way of thinking
that we call material design material
design started with Google's designers
thinking and debating what the look and
feel that software what they asked would
happen if you treated the bits on the
screen as more than just a cons and show
information what if they are real things
that's where it started the idea
actually came from a discussion that
John Wiley and Nicolas jitka were having
when they were really asking themselves
in one of their explorations what
happens when you slide this surface out
of the way what's underneath and they're
like well what is underneath well I
don't know what's it made of and it
sounds like an innocent question and yet
it was such a powerful spark we didn't
realize its power until we kind of
started using it leaned into it but the
metaphor helped bring everybody together
it starts with these pretty high-minded
ideas creating a metaphorical substance
that defines the rules for how software
looks and acts but in practical terms it
doesn't seem like that radical of a
change we're seeing it first on Android
L and Android wear and it amounts to
clean white cards that you can move
around like paper bright colors
animations that give you a sense of
location in space and yes consistent
drop shadows it will come to all of
googles products and even third-party
apps but it's going to take a while in
the meantime Google's design team is
trying to spread the word of what these
design principles are so that everybody
can learn how to design with material
the metaphor was not just useful for
unifying ourselves and how we thought
about doing stuff we could say hey wait
a minute that doesn't feel right not
because it violates paragraph C sub
clause a of our design philosophy but
because it just doesn't feel right it
also means that we use that metaphor to
connect with our audience a human mind
is built to build models that's what
makes us capable of being in the world
and learning and doing things and
putting people on the moon building
smart phones and so we're constantly
building models of the world and
predicting how that world will work when
you have a digital world that has no
rules where every time you do something
it behaves in a new and different way
it's surprising it's also really
stressful your mind can't build any
models makes makes it hard right
everything is a an adventure but when
you're just trying to get something done
you don't want an adventure right you
want things to behave in a predictable
way be like sometimes I put something on
the table instead of sitting there it
flies up to the ceiling
you know what material design is more
than just a set of physics for software
elements this paper is able to morph
itself into different sizes with
animations designed to help you
understand how software transitions from
one thing to the next and back again
we're not hurtling you through space you
know at high speeds we're not puncturing
your hand with you know invisible
impossible surfaces we're trying to
limit animation to kind of a depth that
is appropriate to the thing that you
would hold in your hand we're trying to
make the motion be just enough to help
you understand where things have gone
and where they're coming from beyond
animation this metaphorical material has
other abilities it's smart based on
google mouths ability to know what you
want to see and when you want to see it
it means you have to trust Google with
all of your data and hope that it turns
into something you want it's all done in
the name of simplicity instead of making
you hunt for information it just gives
it to you well I think we're approaching
it and that we want to have the the
system as intelligent as possible in
terms of ranking information so if
things you know seem to be out of out of
order that's you know mistake of the
system that we need to rank it better as
opposed to approaching that the problem
is we're going to solve it by just
requiring the users reorder things we
did it in order to come up with the most
simple solution one of the design
practices that we like to follow is try
to design the simplest possible thing
for the user first see if you can get
away with that prove that you need more
complexity before you just add it
material design is all about algorithms
doing the work finding and presenting
the information you need instead of
making you look for it you know we could
have said we want to unlock this by
giving you control over how you're going
to rank things but instead we've said it
let's enable rancors to exist let's
create an ecosystem where rancors can
get to know you learn
you and help you not have to put in that
effort elevate the things that you
should care about suppress the things
that maybe can wait for later and I
think that's the key to unlocking this
like seeming conundrum between power and
simplicity we want to find ways to do
more be smarter but at the same time put
less burden on the user reasons is a
perfect example of how material design
is software that involves things that
feel real but follow their own virtual
rules instead of trying to directly
imitate physical objects there's logic
but it's not based on things that came
before it's native to now to whatever
device you're holding in your hand the
brilliant work that Xerox PARC did with
with Windows that could overlap and mice
that can point and click
groundbreaking it really helped people
use computers and part of the way it
helped is that it had object
relationships some people didn't
understand actually I'm not sure anybody
understood why that was valuable the
reason why the computer desktop works
with overlapping windows representing
documents is not because it looks like
your physical desk but because when you
work on your physical desk the same
physical things happen right you know
you put the important things on top
because those are the ones that you're
paying attention to then you're like oh
wait I need something else you pull that
out it sits on top now it has your
attention right so it's it's a it's an
interaction congruity it's a functional
congruity it happens to have a visual
congruity as well but that's not the
essential part so as we come to the
smaller screens we want to actually have
that same congruent the things that
you've used recently are at your
fingertips whether material design turns
out to be the most radical rethinking of
what software represents since a desktop
or if it's just a fancy term for drop
shadows it has given Google a fresh way
to think about its products it's added
new metaphors new possibilities but most
of all new constraints and it's that
last part that's most intriguing design
is all about finding solutions within
constraints right if there were no
constraints it's not design it's you
know art
