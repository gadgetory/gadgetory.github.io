developer version of HTC in Valve's
virtual reality headset I called it
unfinished and incredibly fun and I've
been looking forward to the consumer
version ever since now I finally got it
in my hands and it's just as much fun
but it still doesn't feel finished the
vibe has gotten more polished since it
was first announced last year but it's
not a pretty piece of hardware
the finished headsets almost identical
to the vive pre which is to say it's big
front heavy and sort of industrial
looking the pre had a couple of issues
that seemed totally fixable like the
fact that it's foam facemask soaks up
sweat like a sponge but don't expect
that to change on the vibe of course all
the good things about the Prieur here -
the vive blocks out most light unless
you're looking straight down your nose
and it's not too uncomfortable once you
get used to its size although it's
notably less comfortable than the oculus
rift
unlike the rift the vibe doesn't come
with built-in earphones it does include
a pair of earbuds you can plug in but
you'll probably want to use your own
setting up the vive involves a lot more
than just plugging it in the vibe uses
your computer's HDMI and USB ports just
like the oculus rift but in between your
PC and your headset there's a link box
that needs plugged into a power outlet
and then there are the lighthouses -
laser towers the vive uses to detect its
position we're going to hope that this
doesn't over balance and I'm just going
to try to put this tape on here - I
don't know add a fig leaf of protection
the lighthouses are set up diagonally
across the space you want to use
anywhere from a box that's just big
enough to stand up in to a 15 by 15 foot
room they don't need to be connected to
your computer but they do need their own
power supply so hopefully you've either
got lots of outlets or lots of extension
cords once you've got all this done
you're ready to set up steam VR a tool
in valve steam gaming platform given how
complicated the vibe is steam VR is good
at giving you feedback about what's
working you can always see what's
connected right on the dashboard and
there's a simple calibration process
that's even sort of fun
um and actually wait I forgot to run
room setup for room scale experiences
you trace around the entire play space
with a motion controller and steamvr
sets up chaperon lines to match it uh
that went pretty smoothly for the vibe
it was very smooth for the vibe this all
takes some time but it's worth it as
long as you're also fine paying $800
plus the cost of a gaming PC when
everything works the vibe is the best
experience you can have in VR right this
minute the screen is a little grainy but
that's true of every headset the field
of view feels shaped a little different
from oculus but different doesn't mean
worse here and the laser towers are
incredibly forgiving as long as they're
above you and pointed towards you they
track almost perfectly a front-facing
camera can show you a rough outline of
the outside world at the press of a
button or whenever you move outside the
Vives boundaries that's all great but
there's one thing that really sets the v
apart right now it's just about the only
headset that lets you move around in VR
you can use normal game pads or a mouse
and keyboard with the v but most
experiences are based around a pair of
motion controllers that fit in your
hands like remote controls I've got a
few issues with them like the fact that
it's way too easy to hit the home button
under the trackpad but they stayed away
after you've used the controllers for a
while they're also incredibly solid
which is good because even if you never
accidentally throw them across the room
in a game of VR tennis
you'll probably whack the wall or some
furniture at least a couple of times in
side VR adolphus setup a lot of features
you've got a full version of Steam plus
the ability to see your computer desktop
and set a custom environment all around
you
the fact that Valve already has a
ready-made platform is a huge benefit
here there are already tons of people
playing modding and selling a wide
variety of games on Steam the downside
is that this can make everything sort of
complicated your settings are spread out
over lots of different menus and steamvr
itself still has plenty of glitches if
you're already used to Steam it's not
too hard to figure things out but it's
not a friendly system for newcomers
which is too bad because the vibe shakes
up all the usual stereotypes about PC
gaming
it features creative non gaming tools
like tilt brush and virtual desktop plus
non traditional games like audio shield
where you defend yourself against the
notes of your favorite songs motion
controls can feel incredibly fresh and
intuitive and they support a huge number
of different experiences you can shoot
guns at zombies
or you can solve plumbing puzzles to
make tiny alien bears happy there's
something for almost everyone it can
just be hard to find it can also be hard
to find games and tools that aren't
rough experimental or very short this is
okay at first especially because you'll
probably want to take breaks every hour
or so standing up and walking around is
more tiring than sitting in a chair but
after a while I wanted something more
substantial and my favorite experiences
were clearly unfinished ones the vibe is
where you go for cutting-edge virtual
reality at least for the next few months
but that also means that nobody has
figured out exactly what to do with it
whether you're talking about specific
games and apps or its whole user
experience by the time it's polished the
vibes going to be competing with oculus
which will support a lot of the same
titles later this year but for an early
adopters headset the vive does
everything it ought to it's flexible
functional available and often
incredible Oh God
what do they do if you want to compare
