desert morning and here in New Mexico a
group of men wait tensely expectant
behind them three unbroken years of work
work done in unprecedented secrecy
motor de lourdes the New York Times
reporter who said all that McConnell
ternity time Stood Still space was
contracted to a pinpoint it was as
though the earth had opened in the skies
split one felt as though vehicle
published to witness the birth of the
world to be present at the moment of
creation when the Lord said let there be
right at Trinity in 1945 we proved a
self-sustaining reaction could become an
explosive force and that the implosion
principle was sound we had a starting
point they were simulating an aerial
burst because they knew they were going
to do aerial burst over Japan because
they wanted to get the maximum explosion
on the ground or maximum PSI on the
ground and you do that by exploding
above ground the one used in Nagasaki
was identical to this one that material
for that bomb was already on a boat
headed for Tinian when this test was
done you know this site produced more
fallout than either the Japanese sighs
more radiation fallout radioactive
fallout
chicken for Trinitite friend of the
night was that sand fused when the blast
went off and it's radioactive that one's
just users like a green glass or flag
and we little bit on the group of geeks
here from all over the country to come
to one of the two days a year the place
is open to see what what it looks like
just the same doesn't seem to register
much above the background I don't know
that you would be able to kill somebody
with it more than any other group of
individuals the world's great scientists
like physicists J robert Oppenheimer
realize the grave responsibilities of
our new knowledge science has profoundly
altered the conditions of man's life
both materially and in ways of the
Spirit as well as extended the range of
questions which man has a choice his
extended man's freedom to make
significant decisions no one can predict
what vasc new continents of knowledge
the future of science will discover but
we know that as long as men are free to
ask what they will free to say what they
think free to think what they must
science will never regress the freedom
itself will never be wholly lost used to
be that we would get people coming here
that actually saw this test people who
lived in the area and that was always
interesting to tell their stories it's
usually I was awakened by a shockwave
where I saw a flash of light that lit up
the sky and they had no idea what it was
of course until
I would also run into World War two
veterans who would come and a lot of
them will come up to you and say you
know save my life I had orders for the
pacific or if you survive the battle of
the bulge and now he's got to go into
the pacific so that was always
interested
technology can be used for a wide range
of things you can make big things that
go boom and you can also make things
that research the universe and our no no
direct threat to anybody
if the goal of astronomy is to resolve
is the physics of distant objects we're
trying to understand the evolution of
objects the devolution of things that we
see the origin the physical processes
one of the key things you need for that
is spatial resolution so in order in
radio astronomy to get high angular
resolution we need really big telescopes
and it turns out that you can get the
information you want although not all at
once if you build little telescopes
separate them by 20 or 30 miles bring
their signals together and process that
product and that will eventually after
considerable processing get you the same
information by looking at the spectral
composition and the spatial composition
spatial meaning with angle astronomers
can get very strong clues into the
physical processes that are going on the
particular object the Ray was officially
completed in 1980 and since that time it
has been the most productive the most
powerful flexible radio telescope on
earth so who funds this the National
Science Foundation which has a mandate
for pure research funds The Very Large
Array and funds the great majority of
the funding for the National Radio
Astronomy Observatory why does the
National Science Foundation do this I
don't actually have a really good answer
for that i can give you my personal
answer research is a like a window to
the future it opens up new things it is
also by doing this kind of research we
inspire the next generation not
necessarily to do astronomy or physics
but into exploring their curiosity to
understand their environment so the
National Science Foundation from the way
I look at it funds research projects not
necessarily to improve the gross
national product not necessary to solve
any specific human or technical issue
but to open up new information that
might be of use in the future
