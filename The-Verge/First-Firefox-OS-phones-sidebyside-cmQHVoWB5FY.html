OneTouch fire and the ZTE open which are
the two commercial Firefox OS devices
that were just showing off today there
are also a couple of developer devices
that were announced last month made by
geeks phone and those are floating
around as well but these are the ones
that are actually going to be in
consumers hands I don't know if you can
really tell from video but they're
pretty low-end devices and you can tell
there's a lot of air gap here on the
display not like your typical modern
Android or iOS device and they're also
pretty low resolution they'll katella
has a glossy back it's kind of a sparkly
orange finish here and the ZTE has a
matte blue but they're both available in
a variety of colors and I'm assuming the
different carriers will launch different
ones just going into the the UI here see
if we can load up the verge and you can
just tell us you're holding it that's
really it's a really low end device I
really know any other way to put it the
components everything about it is
obviously designed to be entry level and
these are going to emerging markets
you're not going to see either one of
these launched in the US or in most
European countries Western European
countries so you know as it's a firefox
based OS you would hope that the
scrolling performance is decent the
browser and it appears to be the
rendering rendering is going pretty well
but the OS on a whole I'm a little bit
more unsure about
different apps seem to perform
differently there's some tap issue there
and you can see that everything is just
kind of rendering pretty slowly these
are screenshots
you can see we have some multitasking
going on here
everything is just loading really slowly
so that's the fire then let's get the
ZTE fired up
and here we have some of the apps that
are installed I've been told that these
devices are offline but we'll see if we
can get anything loaded here this is
timeout Barcelona which is one of the
offline apps that were that was
demonstrated on stage this evening and
this can be cached so that even if you
don't have an active network connection
i'm not sure if this edge is actually
working right now you can still use it
this is just pretty painful in places
although again we don't know how much we
can attribute to the bad network
connection how much is it just the
performance of the phone in the OS
everything operates with just enough leg
so that if you had been used to any
other smartphone it would be a major
bummer going to this thing but I can see
how you're going from a feature phone it
might be an okay experience hopefully by
the time these things launched in the US
in 2014 they're saying right now we'll
see if that if that stands it will be
running on slightly higher end hardware
that performs a little bit better so
those are the alcatel one touch fire and
the ZTE open launching later this year
probably around summer on a number of
Eastern European and Latin American
carriers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
