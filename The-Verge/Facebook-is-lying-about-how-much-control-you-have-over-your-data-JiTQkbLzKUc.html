Cambridge analytic a Mark Zuckerberg
went before Congress for two days of
questions on Facebook's approach to
users down as Zuckerberg presented it
Facebook users in complete control of
their data with the company taking only
what they share and deleting anything
users don't want on the network on
Facebook you have control over your
information the content that you share
you put there you can take it down at
any time the information that we collect
you can choose to have us not collect
you could delete any of it and of course
you can leave Facebook if you want now
no that's false but it's not the whole
picture there's a lot of data that
Facebook collects behind the scenes and
most of it isn't obvious from Facebook's
privacy tools so active Facebook users
can modify or delete their ad targeting
data or download almost all the data
Facebook has collected on them but
there's a lot of data that falls outside
the reach of those tools you've said
everyone controls their data but you're
collecting data on people that are not
even Facebook users that have never
signed a consent a privacy agreement and
you're collecting their data and it may
surprise you that on Facebook's page
when you go to I don't have a Facebook
account and would like to request all my
personal data stored by Facebook it
takes you to a form that says go to your
Facebook page and then on your account
settings you can download your data so
you're directing people that don't have
access don't don't even have a Facebook
page to have to sign up for a page to
reach their data we've got to fix that
the biggest problem is something called
shadow profiles data that Facebook keeps
on non Facebook users based on the
contact lists that their friends have
uploaded even if you've never signed up
for Facebook there's a good chance that
you have a shadow profile but you never
know that from Facebook static privacy
tools because those tools only work for
active Facebook accounts congressman
I've logged out of Facebook do you still
have the ability to follow my
interactions on the web congressman you
have control over what we do for for ads
in the in the information collection
around that on security there may be
specific things about how you use
Facebook even if you're not logged in
that we that we keep track of to make
sure that people aren't abusing this
system there's a lot of other data that
you can't get through Facebook's privacy
tools Zuckerberg kept telling Congress
you can download all your Facebook data
but the download tool emits a lot of
information that Facebook clearly
collects and you
is like the location that it pulls from
your phone or web browsing data
collected by Facebook's pixel tracking
tool Zuckerberg also said that Facebook
gets rid of all that information when
you delete your account which is sort of
true but what about the shadow profile
that predated your account we just don't
know the biggest problem is that we
don't know how much information falls
into that category or what Facebook's
rules are for dealing with it we don't
know who has access or how they could
use it in this week's hearings
Zuckerberg didn't want to admit that non
profile data existed at all but over and
over members of Congress were ready to
force the issue you didn't know what a
shadow profile was you didn't know how
many apps you need to audit you did not
know how many other firms have been sold
data by dr. Kogan other than cam 'bridge
analytical and annoying a tech knowledge
ease even though you were asked that
question yesterday and yes we were all
paying attention yesterday the big
question is what's Washington gonna do
about it one idea is the consent Act we
should require explicit opt-in consent
anytime a tech company uses or shares
data there's also the Federal Trade
Commission which is investigating
whether Facebook may have violated an
earlier consent decree but no matter
what happens you can expect to see
Washington putting a lot more pressure
on Facebook in the months to come</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
