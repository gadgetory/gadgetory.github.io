Smart vision EQ and if I get scared
here's a emergency cut off oh god here
we go tell my family I love them I'll be
back from the future at some point okay
so it's day four day five of CES and
it's midnight so that's why I'm having
trouble figure out what day it is and
we're about to head to the Las Vegas
Strip because Mercedes wants to put us
in the car that they think is going to
be what we're all gonna be riding in in
2013 the smart vision EQ was announced
late last year at the Frankfurt Motor
Show and this was the first time that
Mercedes has brought it to the United
States it was the kind of opportunity I
didn't want to pass up to see this weird
futuristic idea from one of the world's
biggest and oldest automakers it was
pretty chaotic when we got there
Mercedes had shut down a whole section
of Las Vegas Boulevard had dozens of
people coordinating the whole thing and
a ton of tourists were trying to snap
photos or yell questions about just what
exactly they were seeing I should be
clear this is not driving itself like it
is supposed to some day there's
literally a guy with a bunch of
joysticks in a bag who's gonna be
driving us down the strip so let's see
how this goes here we go we're moving
none of the stuff in here is like
actually really working I mean the
screen is lighting up and showing us
like a demo but like I'm touching it
does not doing anything it's not an
actual touchscreen these are like
speakers or cameras or lights or
something but I can't really tell this
is really just like a mock-up of what
Mercedes thinks a self-driving car would
be like in 2030 something that you would
order on your phone
and have come pick you up so that you
can go out to wherever it is you want to
go it's based off of the smart fortwo
sit like so an actual car that's on the
road today which is why it might look a
little bit similar to you if you've ever
seen some of those flashy or newer smart
cars but obviously redesigned with a
whole bunch of future Flair you know
you've got these crazy blue lights these
doors that scissor up and down and sound
like they're in a sci-fi movie we've got
lights along the floor a big screen on
the front that says like Las Vegas
Boulevard and like watch out and like
all these things to the sort of signal
the pedestrians we're obviously also not
going very fast as you can see and
everybody's taking pictures we're just
crawling along the strip we're actually
headed towards a parked truck right now
all right we're stopped now we're moving
backwards what's really funny is like
there's this giant windshield that just
like stretches from the front of the
dashboard all the way to the back which
is cool because like we're on the Las
Vegas Strip we can see everything that's
happening like there's Planet Hollywood
there's the Paris like that's still
Planet Holly I never knew Hollywood so
big all of this the see-through design
the giant screen has to do with how
Mercedes thinks will one day use a fully
self-driving car and while some company
is imagining them as workspaces or store
experiences the smart vision EQ is all
about turning your car into a rolling
smartphone ride with things like your
favorite entertainment or social media
accounts available right in the
dashboard now maybe that's a good idea
or not I can tell you right now though
that the idea of my Twitter feeds
scrolling by on the dashboard of a
self-driving car is already giving me
nightmares oh there's a picture of a
turtle and it's got 203 likes it has
more the turtle from the future has more
likes than my Instagram posts
so we've gone back and forth down the
street a couple times now and so here's
as much as I can tell you going 12 miles
an hour in a remote controlled version
of this car I get it
like I get what Mercedes is really
trying to do here you know you there's
no steering wheel there's no pedals you
hail the car you hop in
you've got your smartphone apps
connected your social media your
entertainment and you don't have to
worry you can just take it and enjoy the
view and that all sounds great but
there's so much more work to be done to
get the technology the automotive
technology ready to get self-driving
cars to this level that by the time we
get there by the time we get to 2030 so
much more is gonna change that it's hard
to say how close this really is to what
will eventually be riding it so it's
nice that Mercedes is thinking about
these things
it is sweet to see that they're willing
to put this much work into making sure
everybody knows that they're thinking
about these things but for right now
it's just another sort of stab in the
dark what our future of moving around
looks like so for more weird
self-driving cars electric cars right
