and we're here checking
out the Asus Mothership.
Now it's best described as
a portable gaming desktop.
Now what exactly does that mean?
Well, it means that you can
take this top cover here
and detach it entirely as a
portable wireless keyboard.
So with the keyboard detached,
it basically becomes a desktop machine.
Now you've got a 17 inch
display, it's 144 hertz
and then a three
millisecond response rate.
So it's a, you know, up there
with the best gaming monitors you can buy.
It's not 4k and it's not a touch screen,
but, you know, the things that matter
to gamers are gonna be the 144 hertz
and the three milliseconds
and it's got those.
The Mothership is essentially a desktop.
It's got all desktop components
and it can be played like a desktop.
So you can of course use
this nifty wireless keyboard.
It's got a cool RGB setup going on here,
it's got a built in touch pad,
but you don't need to use this keyboard.
You can use your own gaming keyboard
and obviously you can bring
your own mouse to use.
All the components are in the back
and it's all encased in aluminum
and that includes the back of
the keyboard cover as well.
It's not gonna be cheap.
It'll probably run quite
a few thousand dollars
more than your standard gaming laptop.
We don't know exactly how much it'll cost,
but it's designed to be a niche product
and Asus is designing the Mothership
as kind of the top of the top.
It's really the best it has to offer
in this experimental
portable desktop package.
The whole device really just
is very experimental looking
and it's really cool honestly.
I mean, I've never seen
anything like this.
I don't know if I personally would spend
many thousands of dollars
on a device like this,
but I appreciate what Asus is doing here.
It's really novel, we might
see this kind of hybrid device
more in the future,
especially now that Nvidia
is making it's mobile RTX
graphics more widely available.
You can get that powerful
desktop performance
in a smaller package.
It might not look like the Mothership,
it might not work like the Mothership,
but this is really just a
kind of a proof of concept
of what you could really do if you pushed
everything to the limit.
If you wanna see more gadgets
like the Asus Mothership
and other wacky gaming
accessories, machines,
weird experimental concepts like this,
keep it locked to The Verge on YouTube
at YouTube.com/TheVerge.
We'll be at CES all
week with more to come.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
