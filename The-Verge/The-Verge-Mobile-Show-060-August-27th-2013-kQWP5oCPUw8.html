the week of August 26 2013 this is
episode 60 which if you are familiar
with wedding anniversaries is our
diamond show so i hope everyone who
listens to us has been out shopping and
looking for diamond jewelry for us and
plans to send it our way but other that
we've got a good show lined up for you
i'm dan seifert I'm flats mo and bling
bling i'm chris sigler i believe i
believe the phrase is bling blaow chris
and unfortunately dieter still has
better things to do than come be on the
show with us we're just not important in
deters life you know it's it's a sad sad
fact of the matter I do know that he's
not in he's not in his normal home base
of San Francisco right now I believe
he's somewhere in the deep south I
believe he told me that he's uh he gave
me some insane stad about how far into
the middle of nowhere that he is right
now but he does have LTE service which
is impressive does he really because the
other day he said he was I believe
yesterday I received a note from him
that he was on GPRS and I was like I
believe he found the one spot in the US
that's still on GPRS well you know when
I was doing the the Tesla review earlier
this this year I was driving through
parts of California where there wasn't
any service at all which was completely
nuts to me you think that of all states
California would be completely blanketed
but you'd be wrong yeah well okay this I
should be honest this is absolutely
nothing to do with connectivity I think
dieter is just building up a nice beard
that is going to spring on us next week
that's what's happening he's building up
a wireless signal blocking beard that is
shutting down his wireless connectivity
he's building up his lumberjack chops
right now he's like gonna fill in the
beard he's gonna you know pick out just
an amazing selection of flannels and and
suspenders or overalls I don't know I
don't know which way dieter leans on
this I'm the suspenders versus over
overalls beat but I would I would I
would
2 seed eater come on the show wearing
overalls minus a shirt no nothing but a
beard but i want i want dieter on this
program with nothing but a beard and a
smile Tecna Chris you guys shared a
hotel room recently probably save
everybody it's yeah so let me tell you
guys about this hotel room uh we were a
man echoes they were just in the wrong
direction or anything yeah that well you
know we're just going to first of all
what this story that i'm about to tell
is not safe for work if we have any
children listening please avert your
eyes mirrors we tuned to a different
station for a few minutes watch some
sprout which is that television for
toddlers which is whip stuff by the way
if you're like half asleep if you're if
you're on a couch somewhere and you're
half asleep and you turn on sprout it
will freak you out because it's just
like it's like you know basically just
colors and shapes and like really soft
gentle music it's insane as messes with
your mind which anyway to be honest
perfect for my level of intellect yeah
well ditto I mean I have I I'm not gonna
lie I've definitely watch it for
multiple hours before um but anyway so
so we were just it literally everybody
in the company just returned from New
Year New York we were there for the
verge all hands meeting where we talked
about these amazing plans that we have
coming up over the next year and so we
were staying at at a nearby hotel or a
relatively new hotel I think it just
opened in the past few months and we
were staying two to a room and my
roommate was dieter whom I love I've
stayed with him at trade shows before he
makes a great roomie worked out really
well except for one thing this is a sexy
hotel and and what that means basically
in a nutshell is that the bathroom door
is semi-transparent so all of your
bathroom activity be it toilet related
or shower related is is basically
visible to your to your roommates so
dieter and I that I guess what I'm
trying to say is the internet I got to
know each other very well this weekend
and we're gonna leave it at that
also to tie it into some freaky mobile
technology in some fashion the
translucency can can sometimes remind
you of iOS 7 ah I like that it's mine I
pulled his back I put his boat someday
you know random what's the translucency
the door tweaked at any time during your
time there did it get more or less
translucent for you know can you some
feedback now well the fonts definitely
changed also I want to point out that
Dan for some reason that has not been
explained to me was in this amazing like
penthouse suite with Erin support us
whom I'm sure look I don't know how you
guys haven't learned how far slipping
somebody at twenty dollar bill gates I
mean the but the place was nuts I mean
first of all you guys had the your mini
bar was stocked with way more whiskey
than artist witch I'm offended by uh you
had you had a bathroom where the door
wasn't facing the rest of the room so
you could you could shower in privacy it
was great anyway and today we're put
they were pumping like this very faint
subtle but pleasing floral scent
throughout the air-conditioning in our
room yeah that was absolutely unique to
your room that nobody else got the said
so while everyone else's room uh very
very likely up over the weekend
with as verge staffers you know did
their thing in there ours was nice and
fresh all weekend yeah that wasn't a
fragrance being pumped in the room dan I
think that's just your natural scent
it's my natural aura yeah alright so
today we had some Motorola stuff happen
we had our droid ultra and Droid Maxx
review go live and David did those
reviews for us um and I took some time
this weekend to actually play with and
use these and David wasn't very kind to
it in the review and I got dude I
reviewing a brutal yeah heartedly like I
I just aside from verizon's very
specific very obvious business interests
I can't come up with a reason for these
phones to exist well David came
I can summarize this really well I
haven't read the reviews I haven't
played with the phones i play with the
mini which actually seems the droid me
Jackie seems a tiny bit more optimistic
a device in these ones but what I can
say just scanning the review and looking
at the scores is the fact that the droid
ultra plus the droid maxx their
collective score is just over ten huh uh
yeah went you know sorry I think the
this speaks to a couple things right one
it speaks to the fact that you know
design by committee is almost never a
good thing and this was obviously a
device that was co-designed by motorola
and verizon and and it's verizon being
verizon and droiding up these devices
that didn't need to be traded up and
they should have verizon just should
have taken the Moto X and been done with
it they I mean they didn't need to do
anything else but but David came up to
me before we publish this and he's like
can I get a gut check on this am I being
too harsh and I'm like no man like he
you and I he was like I would never in
my life tell anyone to buy either one
these phones like well then give him
give him a bad score and that's exactly
what he did well I mean what really
shocked me was I kind of expected the
ultra to not be that great you know it's
got the salami plastic back it's it's
just thin for the sake of being thin
there's no real reason for it but you
know at least with the droid maxx you
kind of expect it to be like the reason
for it to exist is battery life right
and while it will offer respectable
battery life certainly lands on the good
side of battery life it's not the droid
maxx battery life that i would have
expected especially not compared to last
year's model last year's model you know
two days no problem you know two days of
like real use you could get out of that
phone without having to recharge it and
and on our like our rundown test it
lasted almost 13 hours which was
record-breaking absolutely bonkers and
this year you know the rundown test is
only managing eight hours it's tapping
out after just after a day of use uh you
know it's really disappointing well you
know what bothers me about it is you
know how the back I think the
both of them is real Kevlar but it's
like like you say it's like slimy
feeling on the altar and then and worse
on the max it's against it gives a good
Samsung a run for its money of the
slimiest phone right now I'm just
looking at that particular photo of the
two backs and I was going to ask which
of them is a nasty-looking one can you
actually get Kevlar and then that glossy
disgusting thing that's going on on the
same surface well it yeah yeah I mean I
think one is like I mean I don't know
what the process is but I think they
might just have some sort of lacquer
over the ultra and then they they don't
apply that lacquer to the the max that's
my guess I mean I don't really know but
but what's what's weird to me I mean
it's both good and bad i mean if you
look at the david has really good
picture of it in his review if you look
at the bottom corners of the max you can
see where the weave disappears at the
right at the corners and it looks really
weird and kind of gross in the amateur
hour and then they're the reason why it
looks like that is because they're
literally sanding down those corners to
form the inner tip to smooth and form
the corner of the back because it's made
out of real Kevlar so they can't fake
the weave through the corner because
they're actually standing through it so
it's like it would have been cool if
they'd found a way to like still have
real Kevlar but not do that because I
mean it looks like a half finished it
looks like a prototype or something
somebody deleted yeah that's what I when
I first saw it I was like this can't be
this looks like it's half painted right
it's really bizarre also not made in
Fort Worth Texas nor can you get a
bright pink back with yellow buttons
very solid points unfortunately if
you're a verizon customer you can't get
any phone in bright pink with solid
yellow buttons but it's true you can get
a moto x now oh okay yeah that's
actually you know what we'll segue right
into that so the Moto X will be
available from verizon this Thursday you
can order it online you won't be able to
buy it in stores yet that's another
quote coming weeks deal um but you'll
only be able to buy it in black or white
so if you're hoping to customize it
sorry tough nuggies we know for a while
the 1880s has the
the customization exclusive
unfortunately don't know how long that
exclusive last but if you want to get a
moto x on verizon you can do it starting
this thursday if you want to buy a
motorola phone on verizon you should buy
the moto x this thursday yeah but you're
gonna have to settle for black or white
which isn't that big video actually I've
seen a few of the black ones floating
around the New York offices and I was
actually very impressed you know picking
up and using the phone in person the
pictures don't really do it justice go
ahead then well I was going to say that
pretty much everybody who has like seen
a lot of pictures of it and read reviews
and things and then goes and picks it up
in person and said the same thing I know
I Chris i believe the other week when
you got to see one of the review units
we had he instantly tweeted that this
thing feels amazing as soon as he picked
it up so i felt the same way you really
have to get it in your hands to
appreciate the design of it yeah it's
then it's it's a great you're so here's
my conundrum with the Moto X actually
I'm really glad that you brought this up
then because I have a story about this
so i got my customized review unit and I
was like holy crap this is the best
feeling android phone I've ever like
it's just it hits a sweet spot in every
conceivable way I have to have this
phone in my life uh so I switch like
right before I left for New York I
switched from my iphone to the Moto X
but I brought my phone with me just in
case I day a change of heart halfway
through the trip so went to New York
with it and on like day two or I should
say by day two I was just so fed up with
every app I was using on the Moto X that
I just I mean I literally like it was a
snap decision like I just flew into a
rage and switch back to the I pulled the
SIM out put it back my iphone gave the
the review unit to Ross because he
wanted to try it and moved on with my
life like it was that quick for me like
it just I think I had some like weird
bug in the Twitter app for Android they
just pushed me over the edge I'm like
screw this is ridiculous and
I i left the platform and you know what
else from the guys who been using the
Moto X around the office we had somebody
Jordan from our video t he's using the
nexus 4 and he he was saying this is
good just give me LT in a good camera
and i'll be happy and then I think it
might have actually been Ross who was
responding well there's moto x and then
Jordan said and a good camera and it was
like I actually I'm not going to say
that because the Moto X isn't going to
give you that part I was it was funny
where there was a some sort of Twitter
canoe going on earlier today uh between
I think Josh and dieter and Chris you
might have gotten pulled into it as well
uh you know saying how the Moto X a moto
x max would be like the perfect phone
because it alleviates any battery
concerns but i think a moto x max
PureView I would sell my soul for why
never runs iOS 7 program no I don't mind
android i use android every day I don't
want android at all but Moto X tell me
of you would be an amazing phone so
you're telling me Dan just did just to
make this perfectly clear you want a
moto x with a giant circular hump on the
back and the so the phone itself would
already be like nine or nine millimeters
because it's a max and then on top of
that you'd have a giant circular huh you
know that's what you're looking if
you're already going for the nine and a
half millimeters why not just go all the
way and you know step it up to eleven
get a giant circular home and and take
amazing photos yeah yeah i mean honestly
the reverse of my experience with the
moto x is my experience with lumia 1020
because the first time somebody handed
that thing to me I thought the hump on
the back and it just felt really weird
and creepy like I can't describe it it's
smaller than the hump on the 808
PureView but but has we closed it just
being cut flat at the top it feels weird
and awkward in your hand so that's the
star thing you feel yeah it's like all
the weight is where that lens is so when
you're holding it and it's a big enough
device that you know you're holding like
the bottom half of it the top wants to
fall backwards yeah it's just like
really really awkward in the hand if it
was really weird so
actually think that if Nokia hadn't cut
away from it so if not gay I'd actually
got and just had made a really thick and
fat phone and just stuck fill the rest
with battery that might have been a
better thing I mean it would be in a
heavy phone will be making more tank
jokes like with Lumia 920 perhaps but
still like the economics is a 10-20 a
really weird and whack and actually the
text point that I played around with in
New York the processing with the
pictures was a major issue for me the
processing speed that is so you take a
photo it takes a long long time to get
you back to take the next photo so even
if the tents what it takes amazing
pictures you know if you can't take to
free in quick succession it's kind of a
major pain point because that's the sort
of thing to do with smartphone cameras
right like if you actually have the time
to sit around and really frame your
subject and think about your composition
and balance things out etc etc then you
just kind of bring a camera with you you
know it's never do you don't bring a
camera you bring a stupid snap on sony
rx1 whatever that that's what you want
that you don't even in front glad I know
I know you you mean the attachment right
the Sony attachment so of course just
just to clarify here our producer Evan
who since he's making me clarify this
I'm going to also tell an amusing
anecdote about him following this I you
can actually use a smart camera app on
the Lumia 1020 as opposed to the pro
camera app the smart camera app does let
you do like rapid-fire burst pictures
which I don't think is what Vlad is
talking about I mean I absurdity and you
hold the button down and it does like 10
shots you just want to be able to go
snap snap snap snap snap at your at your
command quickly and easily um and so
Evan actually has a lot of experience
with the the 1020 I believe he bought
one this weekend and then promptly
dropped it and shattered the front
display into a million pieces just
because you should really be recording
that story with a big burn your face
I'm sorry Evan but I think that is proof
positive of the odd organ ah miix of the
we were we were just talking about this
before we started broadcasting and I was
noting to these guys that when Evan
dropped it it shattered in such a way
that there's a there was a hole on the
screen where you could see all the way
down to the circuit board which is like
kind of like kind of like really like
cyberpunk like I almost wish she had
just captain used it that way because it
looked awesome so it's not like it
wasn't like you know what a lot of
people drop their phone or shatter their
phone they have like a spider of cracks
but they could still touch the screen
and use it and things like that that
wasn't this case with Evan was it no no
was like the screen worked it like it
was insane I like I don't know if that's
because I mean you could say that that's
one of the advantages of ammo LED / LCD
is that you know it isn't I don't know I
like I had something about the
architecture the display laws continue
functioning when it's that busted but
whereas with LCD it just would have look
like a you know a weird liquid whatever
the pixels illuminate themselves you
don't have one consistent backlight so
right comp bust up the backlight and I'm
gonna display and I love this vision of
a phone that looks like an exposed
cyborg like it's just being for the wars
yeah you can see you can see it's
freaking motherboard and is still doing
things away it's a terminator phone so
wait did it did Evan swap that in the
store let's do have it because I think
we could probably bid up the price on it
I believe he was able to make an
insurance claim on it so unfortunately
well fortunate for him he has a new
phone that works and it's not dangerous
and unfortunately for us we don't have
an art piece for the office damn so I
just wrap up our discussion on motorola
this weekend pictures of an alleged
droid 5 leaked to the internet um and
it's got a keyboard as you might expect
a droid 5 to have which is kind of uh I
feel like it's kind of like an
endangered species these days sean
hollister must have fainted when he saw
these leaked pictures sean hollister
huge qwerty hardware keyboard fanatic
very excited about the droid 5 he will
defend the qwerty keyboard to the death
long after it's it's past its prime his
reaction was please let this be real
everybody else the direction was like
and why does this exist everyone else is
like why yeah on is reaching is LG
remarkable like Sean who really liked
the physical keyboard and don't want to
have to buy a blackberry mg launched a
slider qwerty keyboard phone on Verizon
I think ya say something like a week ago
yes but it's so freaking anonymous that
I've got no idea where this model name
is for the specs are how big the screen
is I just all I remember is wow there's
a sliding qwerty keyboard I don't see
one of those for two years uh it I can't
remember the name of it to be honest
with you but it sells for about twenty
dollars on contract so that can give you
an idea of the status of that phone um
but you know this droid 5 leaked you
know I would be surprised if it is real
when it is legit and Verizon does decide
to buy it I'd be surprised if we didn't
see it hit shelves like october november
from the holiday season I mean you guys
probably know sooner do you guys
remember the droid 3 uh yeah that was
horrible it's like the most hilarious
project no no the voice notes the most
hilarious thing was that the droid 1 was
released in November of like 2009 I
believe it lasted about 10 months on the
market or so and then for the fall of
note of 2010 we saw the droid two and
then like februari of 2011 droid 3 hits
its market and it was like we had all
these droid phones come out in like less
than the span that you could have owned
one on contract was like four
generations of droid phones right but
the droid 3 wasn't on the market for
very long at all right because I think
it was the last I think it's literally
the last like major release of verizon's
that didn't include LTE right which
woods I'm like at this point i cannot
even fathom what it would be like to use
a video on my smartphone again the mere
thought terrif
buys me do you remember the the r2d2
edition of the joy to know me I was
pretty cool hey I broke that story hi i
scoop that phone that was me Chris to
scoop scoop Ziggler that's right
breaking our GD two editions that's why
they call me raisin bran uh sorry that
was really terrible uh I really needed a
follow-up question but I'm not gonna ask
it uh so I am I am looking for this this
phone you say there was a verizon
released with a qwerty keyboard yeah
it's an LG model for verizon it's an
android phone it's an android phone i
know for a fact it it sells for twenty
dollars on contract I can't find rice
i'm going to say on the subject of these
kind of semi-autonomous android phones
on my way into New York last week while
I was taking the air train from newark
which is hands down the best sign I've
ever seen ok you taking the air train
which is elevated so essentially if you
step out of the doors and you know the
attestation you basically have a I don't
know 30 or 40 foot for drop ok and
there's a sign on there really
prominently position saying stay inside
the train tracks a dangerous and I just
feel like that size shouldn't be there
you know we should have a bit of natural
selection happening so if anybody needs
the sign and has to step out will let
them step out and yeah see if they
surviving ah the risks but sorry I was
degrading myself there what was trying
to say was while I was on it I saw a
lady with something like a 3 inch
display android phone with big sprint
labeling on the front I just felt so
sorry for her I honestly that there was
something inside me emotionally felt
pain for the for the thing that she's
suffering for it so the the LG phone is
the LG enact it features 4G LTE qwerty
slider over word I believe it's a 4-inch
WVGA display um
but it's got really big 24 60 million
power battery so there you go guys hang
on hey I think I identified a phone
that's still for sale on verizon that
runs android 2.3 and if you can slug the
wait do they still sell the palms
because for a long time you can buy a
palm pre 2 on verizon like on contract
and for a long time you could buy a what
was that one windows phone 7 device they
carried you could buy it for like 20
feet contra PSP trophy yes yeah amazing
but i can't tell i mean the product
pictures for this it's the LG spectrum
the the product pictures for it on LG n
verizon site clearly show a customized
version of android 2.3 i don't know if
it's received an update since then if
not spectrum owners my apologies but
then again if you're using a spectrum as
your primary phone you're probably not
listening to the show so say that if
you're using a spectrum and you bought
it a year and a half or two years ago I
don't feel too bad for you if you're
using the spectrum and you bought it
yesterday my apologies yeah it was
especially funny is that they sell the
spectrum to like Verizon cells both the
spectrum in the spectrum two at the same
time also you can currently this is this
is a hot deal folks you can get an LG
intuition also known as the optimist
view for free on a two-year contract
right now how is this not a good deal on
our site I know right you know I hear
stories Chris I beat you all because you
can buy a blackberry bold 9930 on
contract for a hundred dollars wow that
is a good deal okay and it I don't
really know which America holiday is the
one that makes you do good things for
other people pick one maybe thanksgiving
maybe it's christmas to whatever but i
think for our listeners and viewers the
task should be find an ill-informed
person and saved them from buying one of
these devices like everything we just
talked about for the past five minutes
put that on the list find somebody who
wants to buy one of those
was dig them up with like a web forum
asking about it and save them but here's
at the 9930 come out that was two
thousand eleven twenty old what's the
entry they come out of my year it's like
it's literally two years old already and
you have to pay a hundred dollars to
live with it for another two years I
don't know that this LG enact is pretty
tight it has like that you know it's
like the aesthetics of the the original
Galaxy S it's got a pretty nice looking
keyboard it runs something newer than
android 2.3 I'm only four years late in
that case would you say would you say
that the LG enact is your next Chris
that it probably is also I want to point
out that it has dude okay so it has a
hard menu button but it has adopted the
look of the soft menu button in android
4.9 hollow so it's just the three
vertical dots but they like LG took that
and just made it part of the hardware on
the device this is okay never i I don't
want this phone first for a second I was
really stoked about it the 5 megapixel
camera looks pretty tight anyway what's
uh enough about LG enact what's next uh
moving the next I just leave you I just
need to register a quick complete with
Google for the fact that the Moto X
doesn't seem to be coming to Europe or
at least haven't announced any plans and
I is bowing me up okay well you know why
God glad it's because they can't use the
made in America tagline their chest it
has no value there yeah like all you
Europeans will just be all like you know
there's grubby Americans making these
phones we don't want these vote no there
were actually set some countries which
consider the whole made in America thing
kind of a wedge of prestige to be clear
it's only the customized ones remain
America the one you buy from verizon
it's going to be made in china so right
and the thing is Europe is between China
America so it's kind of like yeah you
don't even have to land just air drops
on them yeah just like sprinkle moto X's
across Europe and be
let's see what happens here okay because
I think people will be into that phone
is it would be do you think Moto X trees
would grow like they sprinkle them from
the air myth the myth of mer
metaphorical ones trees of load with a
new design I mean I'm serious like the
bezel in the front is really really nice
like the bottom bezel in particular is
so thin that it really having the
software buttons for android they're
pretty much exactly what you'd have them
when they used to be capacitive but it's
screen you know so when you're looking
like a video a picture that is filled up
with image and one of the things that
really stands out and everybody's been
saying it but until you I put it the
thing in your hand you just don't
appreciate it this is like a 4.7 inch
display right then yes 47 720p yeah and
it feels like it's just marginally
bigger than the iphone like it feels
like HD what me which is a much more
display so the whole okay because
everybody has been saying this didn't
say this with laptops as well we have a
14 inch display in the footprint of a
13-inch laptop and then you look at it
and it's like what is the same thing it
doesn't feel that different but like a
4.7 inch display I've never seen it in a
device decimal and I is really nice
impressive yeah somebody ik member who
might have been might have been evan
rodgers are our podcast producer
somebody was showing me in fact I'm
pretty sure it was he was showing me an
HTC first which has a 4.3 inch display
up against a moto x and there the
outlines of the two devices are
basically indistinguishable despite the
fact that the Moto X says point four
inches on it yeah so I wrote the first
right here there's the first air and
there's the iphone 5 and there well the
first is a bit bigger than the iphone 5
and then the Moto X is a bit bigger than
both of those but that's the point like
I've been hating on 4.7 inch displays
because they make for such big devices
you can fit that display something
that's about the size of the first then
I stopped complaining like you're giving
more for my money I'm happy unless I
can't buy it which are car so I'm not
happy so I've just been
thinking about this concept of Motorola
dropshipping moto X's throughout Europe
and like thinking about the the
nightmare apocalypse scenario of these
these robber baron gangs like scooping
up all of the supplies with like machine
guns and then and then charging like
extraordinary amounts for them to the to
the poor groveling people that won't
want to own moto X's I think you've been
watching castle in the sky the anime
from Japan I I don't know what I don't
know where that nightmare scenario came
from dan I i well like you know what
when when the they air drop like a a
food supplies for people who are like
refugees and like then like some like
gangs come and take them all and then
like charging lots of money you realize
that Europe is not particularly Western
Europe is not a war-torn wasteland right
oh oh that is a propaganda dropped over
it but if they know that they might have
a chance at a moto x it might become
such a wasteland that's all I'm saying
that's a demand for the Moto X might
might might bring some apocalyptic
scenarios that's a bold prediction will
glad I do have one really exciting piece
of news for you which is that Motorola
has promised a developer edition of the
the Moto X which presumably you will be
able to buy off contract if you're so
inclined so fellow ninja meaning oh man
that sounds good yep so I get the good
stuff from the outside and i gave the
tweakable stuff on the inside that that
is thumbs up for me also I just want to
play this is it won't work with your LTE
well again in the UK IOT situation is
really sketchy anyway um I'm gonna bitch
about that next year I promise this year
the carrier's think so the phone
manufacturers get away with it but I
just want to say to me when motorola
were talking up the whole premise of
it's not about specs it's about
real-world use blah blah blah blah blah
blah honestly I just I just wasn't
buying a photos marketing spiel but I do
feel like this phone has a few of these
usability things which again you have to
pick it up and use it it Motorola has
done a few of those things right
and you know what nobody's going to
remember the specs in a few months
anyway I mean I remember them what's up
in my head right now so I you know I I I
have believed in that mantra ever since
Windows Phone 7 because that's the
message that they've been pushing since
Davis since Microsoft has been pushing
since day one I think they've kind of I
mean ever since the first Windows Phone
7 hit devices hit the market they've
kind of put their money where their
mouth is in terms of performance right
like you've never used a windows phone
and said the performance on this sucks
like they have all of the performance
advantages of iOS the problems that they
don't have the app so that you know the
Moto X kind of like doesn't have the
buttery smooth performance of iOS but
has all the apps so it's a it's a
trade-off but it's it's certainly you
know if you compare the performance of
the Moto X to say galaxy s4 or an HTC
One I don't think that you're going to
say this phone feels way slower I don't
think anyone's going to say that that's
correct yeah and actually I have a
killer segue right now I was which is a
big way it's all ready to jump in and
segue why are you guys fighting over the
segue nobody fight over the segue you
want you wouldn't use a real segue
sitting on the sidewalk you want to
fight over that don't fight over the
words yes I would I mean I was crushing
within like 20 yards but I would like
just like get on board okay will do the
segue then we freaking segue back to the
Moto X and it will do Dan segue I think
that's fair it's just a very brief thing
which is to say that the motor works
really only has like a couple of weeks
in which it can be the real standout
mobile device right maybe not even a
couple of weeks because II fleas coming
up in Berlin we know Samsung and Sony
you're gonna do some new devices Galaxy
Note Sony's got a new flagship coming
those might not be enough to overshadow
the Moto X particularly in the United
States but in September 10th is the date
we can anticipate see the new iphone
when we expect see iOS 7 release public
sector etc maybe I found plural right
right and that's where the Moto X is
going to have a bit more of an issue and
that no one is when you should bring it
to Europe so we can
keep it going and you can't get the
motor works in gold you cannot get the
Moto X in gold or champagne yeah just
just get it in yellow and i don't know
like dirty it up a bit well Chris
ordered his custom was in yellow and he
can attest that it does get very dirty
uh but I don't believe it turns cold at
all uh no I've never had a phone that I
was rubbing turned gold never that has
never happened you don't have the Midas
touch chris i don't i don't now it let
me take a quick informal poll of the two
of you are either of you even remotely
considering a purchase of the Sham ponyo
iphone 5s now i'll say this as the eye i
was saying this to some colleagues
earlier and i own an iphone 5 and if
everything that has leaked or rumored
about the iphone 5s comes true I've
never been less excited to buy an iPhone
like I I just don't feel like I don't
really want to buy the new iphone unless
something is completely different like
the the camera technology is completely
different blows me away or you know the
next processors been rumored to be you
know whatever X percent faster and it
contains 30 / 10 lectures like faster or
something how do you even measure that
anyways but you know the which doesn't
sound a whole heck of a lot to me it's
not like like when I went for my 4s to
my 5 the first thing I said with my 5 is
like holy crap this thing's fast yeah
but you know I and so in that case I
don't really have any interest in the 5s
period and if I did have interest in the
5s I am going to say I'd wait until ice
we actually see what this gold looks
like officially and how Apple sells it
to me cuz they'll probably put some
marketing spin on it and make me really
want it yeah this does sound like a very
iterative device right it's going to
have a marginally better camera a
marginally better processor uh probably
the same body and display and we're
hearing a lot of noise about this
biometric sensor built into the home
button right and and that might be it
and and maybe if there's some
something wireless to whether it be NFC
or who knows is it like with every
generation of iphone going all the way
back to like the 3gs there's been
rumored there's been a rumor two of
integrating wireless technology into it
um wait a second in a phone is wireless
technology you know what I mean oh
thanks for uh yes more one of those
technology so and if that is the case I
I think that yeah I'm not gonna be too
excited about 5c is interesting i'm
excited about you know finally seeing an
iphone and a bunch of official colors
but then again I wouldn't want a
mid-range iphone so but I'm definitely
about not buying a sham ponyo actually
this this this great one that's rumor
now looks kind of interesting although
it seems like the least plausible of the
the rumored colors I wonder that's maybe
just like a pre-production chassis that
hasn't been a you know completely
colored or something it looks like it
looks like unfinished metal today yeah
yeah I'm not sure if that's actually
production right so well the thing for
me with the iPhone 5 is it is pretty but
then like we mentioned previously
everybody has managed to scratch up the
edges on the damn thing so if the big
selling point what about iPhone 5s is
aesthetics if it's like a nice pretty
cool paint job and I've gotta say the
idea of a gold iPhone seemed so
outlandish I wasn't buying it for a long
time but then we saw the leaked pictures
and it's a really subtle code it's kind
of it's very desaturated it's kind of
like a silver with a tint of yellow to
it essentially right I'm champagne
listen man know every one of our
listeners is familiar with champagne and
Prosecco for Italian listeners or
sparkling wine for our American
listeners or a corona light for our our
basic or Miller Miller High milk miller
high life for Wisconsin listeners at
labatt blue for a Canadian what kind of
is that
p vrbo whatever it was blue Rob that is
the color of urine there you don't know
red ball no PB uh I think it's go get
here yeah perhaps Pabst blue-ribbon is
what that is called love flood which is
and just makes you a horrible beer just
exactly just to make sure that we're not
actually promoting or endorsing the use
of beer beverages everything which is
discussed is garbage so don't cry I
didn't get a good phone miller high life
is the chef anya of beers this is true
you should save your money and buy
better beer i fix fix that for you but
yeah oh so uh i'm not gonna even try to
go back to my segue because we would
have had to jump out come on board op
it's not teasing like that because oh
what we were talking about windows phone
somehow about the windows phone and so
today ATT confirmed that it is offering
the low key lumia 925 starting on
September 13th in what might be the
coolest looking Windows Phone I've seen
yet like it's in this this custom all
black it's like it just like brings me
right back to when the black iphone 5
was announced and I was like holy crap
that looks totally murdered out and
awesome and makes me really want one i'm
going to divide shall come to look at
that picture now it is it is a tight
looking phone and here's the thing i
mentioned this on twitter this morning
if you are an AT&amp;amp;T and you're seriously
considering Windows Phone device uh I
I'm hard pressed to recommend a
three-hundred-dollar on contract 1020
over a 100 dollar on contract 925
especially when the 925 has a passable
camera and is the best-looking Windows
Phone ever made yes the ergonomics on
the 925 outclassed the 1020's like it's
not even a comparison there's so much
nicer and what was surprised me was if
you've seen the t-mobile version of the
925 t-mobile's headed for a couple
months now they offered in the white and
silver color variant that we've seen
quite a bit before they slapped a giant
t-mobile logo right
lo the capacitive keys and is like the
most tacked on garish looking thing ever
and surprisingly surprisingly for et
there's this tiny little globe in the
upper left-hand corner so they showed a
bit of restraint and plastering their
their logo all over the place well you
know why that is you know why that is
dan it's because they were debating you
know they're like well you know we have
like a really wide but but not very tall
area below the capacitive keys so do we
want to just like squash the the globe
and make it like you know an oval do you
wanna like change the AT&amp;amp;T logo for this
and just make it all the way across do
you want to like keep it a circle and
ultimately they decided not to disparage
their own logo by squashing it that was
the only thing that drove their decision
I mean they could have really lobbied
for nokia and microsoft to let them put
the globe in the position of the start
key people think they could have or or
they could have lobbied to make the
phone with a taller so that there's a
giant black hole the capacitive i think
it but like you know like a four-inch
diameter verizon did etch it slow dough
into the home button on the galaxy note
2 so that like i don't think that would
be like totally out of the out of
possibilities no the next step is you
know these phones will detect silence
during phone calls and then whisper in
your ear between words just like the
ultimate branding it's just always in
your ear in your face the instead of
instead of when you dial a number
instead of hearing a conventional
ringtone you here hi okay you guys these
are just I don't know diamond ideas as
far as the market is a concern so I
think they're just coming up with him
because we we're gonna find any some
freakish phone you know Carl and the
line yeah unfortunately yeah I was just
thinking you know they could also do a
thing we're like that when you press a
number on the dial pad the via the the
DTMF tone is is like a it just says
verizon but in in the right DTMF tone
but then I was thinking you know what if
what if three did that because that
would just be really confusing because
every number you press to just go 3 3333
yo you got you can't apply that to every
operate around the world fortunately
nobody makes phone calls anymore right
ah so you know the other actual same
point that I wanted to make within 9 25
on ATT is that ATT is once again
positioned itself as like the windows
phone carrier in the US they've got the
920 the 925 the 1020 they've got like
multiple lower end models they carry as
many windows phone devices as you know
other carriers offer a range of Android
devices so um yeah if you want a windows
phone chances are you're probably
shopping at AT&amp;amp;T ATT is doubling down on
Windows Phone doubling down hard yep I
was actually surprised but surely that
that isn't too expensive a tts Android
range right I mean maybe chops of things
like the original spectrum I mean at the
end of the day though 85 or eighty-seven
percent of ATT sales or still iPhones so
I don't know how much 18 he really cares
yeah I mean we've discussed this
previously well we mentioned that
blackberry would get some carriers to
port just out of the fact that carries
were more competition among
manufacturers they don't want to be
forced to choose between Samsung's big
device and apple's big device right
which seems to increasingly the
situation of the moment Justin ten nine
twenty-five like we did that that is a
really nice and slick black look but I'm
saying those free dots they look like
they might be for wireless charging
perhaps yeah so the 925 actually has a
snap-on wireless charging case which is
the dumbest thing ever but it was three
dots on the back of it enable it to
enable the snap on case to communicate
with the phone's battery and charge
wirelessly but it does not do wireless
charging out of the box right and in
district 15 were reporting to with it
yeah that's not unique to the 18-team
bottom right yeah the 925 looks horrible
with that snap-on case because it only
grabs the corners of the phone it's just
like so yeah it dad I remember that it
is pretty ugly so we can just kind of
move on can we talk about ugly talk
about garish branding again so I don't
you have this in our topic list but we
mentioned last week that Verizon was
picking up the HTC One finally and one
of our staffers chris welch went out and
bought one he's been waiting for it for
a long time when i bought it and you
know I told them jokingly like oh you
could probably you know get some light
acid or whatever and take off that that
Verizon logo that's on the back of it
with just a little bit of friction and
it turns out that the logo is actually
like etched into the metal so you can
have this massive verizon logo and 4G
LTE logo like you Norma's things that
you cannot like Eve feasibly remove you
can scratch the beats logo off like the
beats logo comes off with your
fingernail verizon logos not going
anywhere but if they were serious about
it they would have backlit the verizon
logo so that whenever the phones on it
lights up or like they could use it as a
notification like you know with the
verizon will go pulses when you get an
email and they're just not being
creative enough they need to hire me as
their CMO clear as I'm saying crazy
turns into a freaking marketing
brainstorming session I mean clearly the
delay for verizon to get the HTC one was
so that they could figure out how to
apply the logo and not let you remove it
yeah and mission accomplished might just
know stuff that that's all God you guys
are uh what do you guys wanna talk about
next you want talk about some blackberry
Wall Street Journal but before we talk
about that I want to I want to
transition into an anecdote that has
nothing to do with anything so what's up
for those on was a Thursday or Friday
last week Chris Grant editor-in-chief of
polygons our sister site was was in town
in New York and he was showing me his
iphone 5 which he detests because it he
has to charge it four times a day apple
says that it's within spec they won't
swap it out it's insane but the phone is
like physically benched like it looks
like a boomerang like I don't know how
this happened but the phone like is the
the antenna you know the the metal edge
is bent on the side like at like
probably a five or ten degree angle and
ne ne
to the Genius Bar and they were like
well did you have in your pocket he's
like yeah he's like you you're not
supposed to put the iphone in your
pocket and and you just look at them
like what and and sure enough if you go
to apple's support site there is a thing
somewhere buried in apple's
documentation that's like the iphone is
not meant to be put in the pocket this
is like a real thing this is like this
is so Apple this is like when the iphone
4 came out and yet they had all the
issues of the antenna gate and people
were holding it doing the death grip and
then Apple told everyone that you're
holding it wrong and that you need to
hold the phone like this or whatever it
was so that you don't block the antennas
so right i totally totally read this the
two finger grip does anyway you hold you
 that's perfectly reasonable
rational but there is actually an even
earlier person for this which was the
HTC nexus one that was one that a whole
bunch of people had issues with the
screens cracking I mean it was original
Nexus device and HTC on a supporter just
like Apple will say you know supposed to
put it in your pocket and then everybody
kind of had a backlash about uh saying
what the hell are you guys talking about
this is nonsense the original HTC nexus
one had so many hardware issues I don't
know of anyone that owned one and didn't
have to have their like power but
replaced and then the screen started
like disintegrating doesn't matter it
had an RGB trackball that's all that
matters this is true that was high
quality that was every awesome that was
that was hype is what it was is straight
up pipe and we haven't seen another
Nexus device for HC since I think that's
a google just being kind of vengeful
google play edition of the of the one
bro not an exit device Oh Evan Evan
wants us to know that that the nexus one
was beefy which by the way is a new
adjective that he is using and Sam
sheffer as you see I don't know if this
is like a new trend or if they're trying
to start a trend but something is good
you say it's beefy stop trying to make
beefy happen like just not gonna cop
I know we can talk like that I agree
yeah let's do the professional thing uh
we'll start with the the news today the
wall street journal reported that uh the
blackberry is looking to spin off BBM or
blackberry messenger into its own
separate company um as it goes through
its various ways of identifying how it
can sell itself apart and make a bunch
of money uh but separating vbm just
seemed like struck me as like the oddest
thing it's like the one thing of value
left in the company right that that
really like has a lot of users uh people
are really into it as a brand name and
they finally got to the point where
they're we're almost at the point where
you can use it on iOS and Android they
said by summer well summer's almost over
so and and and now they're looking at
spinning it off to do a separate company
so the latest rumors peg whatsapp at a
roughly 1 billion dollar valuation and I
can't imagine at this point video is
worth any more than what's app may be
that the user base just isn't there
right do you know how many users what's
up as I know blackberry will say that
depending on you know the phase of the
moon BBA has anywhere from 60 to 72
million active users and what's up i
don't know but i wouldn't surprise me if
it was that hot yeah that wouldn't
surprise me either i'm looking right now
in any case i find a whole thing kind of
dumb because like them saying bbm is the
big value and a big appeal 300 million
users wow so whatsapp is way bigger than
visa but the but the one thing i can say
is that you know whats app should be way
bigger because it has multi platform
support that's not tied to hardware like
BBM could have been way bigger if
blackberry had decided to make it
multi-platform two years ago yeah
apparently yeah really according to The
Wall Street Journal's report they've had
working internally uh multi-platform
support in BBM for as long as as well as
long ago as three years ago and they
just decided not to release it yet and
they even had desktop versions that you
could message BBM users from your
desktop and they decided not to release
it
you know BBM is is BlackBerry's
microsoft office right because microsoft
has head office working on the ipad like
a full-blown version of office on the
ipad for what a year and a half two
years something like that and maybe less
than that year and a half for a year and
it still is now exact same situation but
it's not perfectly analogous because
microsoft charges for office microsoft
already kind of gets an income from it
but the point I was trying to build up
and then you guys completely stomped all
over was that bbm as a value and as an
asset to blackberry just makes perfect
sense as a selling point for blackberry
devices like just isolating BBM it
becomes far less clear how you going to
monetize and get cash out of that
allocate I I can tell you how blackberry
thinks it's going to monetize it thinks
it's going to do it through the channels
these new channels that it can sell to
advertisers and salta brands and they
can own them ah but that's I'm that just
seems like a really long shot to me um
so I mean at the same time fair enough
if you're going to take away the
exclusive to blackberry devices then you
actually take it away that big selling
point you know you're not going to say
the device in the basis that have BBM if
I was an Android have it as well so i
can took i could totally see the point
that chris is making about blackberry
intentionally dragging his feet but at
the same time nobody else is going to
sort our blackberries features up to
them yeah it's up for some Heinz and
those guys to actually make a final
decision at some point instead of
waiting for some really really bored
millionaire billionaire to come in and
fight him up Chris didn't you tweet
something earlier today that uh the
ultimate troll would be a thorsten heins
used his the three billion dollars
blackberry Hasna bank to make a game
system yeah I don't know if I
necessarily call it a troll I just feel
like if you like the ultimate solid
you'd call that solid financial advice
for black yeah I mean they're just be I
mean think about it it's like the
ultimate yolo move right like torsten
just throws three billion at like trying
to win at gaming out of the blue like
nobody sees it coming they call it the
black box okay think of how hot a name
yeah
right thank you but you know they would
call it the play box playbox would call
whatever you want it's not going to sell
any anyway but it's gonna it you know if
you murdered out it'd be like maybe
twice the size of an Ouya they could
they could pipe that it's blackberry 10
powered have these like insane
controllers for it that like have like
this some hinge in the middle so that
you can rotate him like this for no
reason like it it would just be it would
be the most insane device ever created
and they could do it for the three
billion dollars that they have in the
bank no question about it I mean Chris
you clearly put a lot of thought into
this you should whip up a PowerPoint
deck there are two things that I think
about a lot dan one is verizon's
marketing strategy and two is
BlackBerry's video game console those
are those are the only two things i
think i spent a lot of time thinking
about and only one of those is fantasy
they answered yes that's that's true
okay you guys need to make sure you were
seated and prepare because of a kick
kick a segue ok with the segue
blackberry should come up with an
indiegogo campaign for his black books
ah yeah it's not a bad idea sure i can
see that NM feo asking 32 million
dollars and only receive 10.2 is that is
that what your segwaying into blood
that's the one do you enjoy edge
nonexistent smartphone I mean I really
think everything this was a marketing
exercise more than anything you know I
agree I totally agree you know you two
guys the head of software done in some
fashion some form back in January they
still working on the software you know
that they gave us a bunch of renders day
us for you know ob2 amount of money they
didn't get there nobody expected to get
there but at least they got the name out
there the world's tiniest violin is
playing from our shuttle worth right now
the dude is worth what we set it on last
week's show I think five or six hundred
million dollars yeah I mean he can just
he can you know he can spill some loose
pocket change on on the floor of a
grocery store pick it up and fund that
yeah I don't really think that this
whole campaign set the back at all like
if you open to and you well rather if
your canonical and you expect your phone
to be funded by this campaign then
you're making some really really
optimistic projections and forecasts
like that their roadmap would have been
we're gonna have this campaign if we
actually get the 2 million out of
somewhere where we use the money but our
plans are just going along as if we're
going to fail that must be the way that
there would have been planning it so I
don't think this said them back any i
think it was good promotion they got a
ton of coverage from a whole heap of
people who typically don't really care
about boot to his whole right I got a
bunch of interest so I mean frankly even
though campaign Flay what I think that
boasted the chances of this phone
actually becoming something because now
people are actually aware of it I mean
it think about the the yola what's the
name of their phone now uh I just been
calling it the Eola exactly well I the
best-case scenario for the edge or
whatever device ultimately comes out of
this project it is in you know a blue
sky scenario is still going to be like a
developer you know a super shitty
developer phone it's never going to be a
mainstream device right yeah which is
fine I mean it's all good I'm cool with
that are you cool with it I'm cool you
cool cool uh we got one more thing on
our topic list we actually mentioned it
this week the HTC one mini you can buy
it on a TTT as of this friday i got to
play with it for a little bit so um and
i really like it really big fan of the
mini yes the one mini is a great phone
it is but I mean that the problem so
what is 18 he's selling it for how much
hundred bucks okay yeah i mean i was
going to say that the motorway I'd
rather Moto X but then again it's a
hundred dollars more right and I will
say that the one mini gives you little
aluminum body which is awesome gives you
front-facing speakers which is again
awesome it gives you a 720p display its
4.3 inch now 4.7 so it's a little bit
smaller but it's I would argue it's a
better quality display than the Moto X
and it's got a slightly better camera
neither cameras are great I would take
the ultrapixel camera over the Moto X
camera though the Moto X camera is so
bad yeah like I feel like I seriously
feel like Motorola went into the Moto X
just like with a defeatist attitude
they're like we're Motorola like it like
people don't expect us to have a good
camera we don't know how to find a good
camera so we're just gonna half-ass it
and people be like oh yeah it's Motorola
I mean to be honest with you there's
only so many companies that make these
camera imaging sensors right like they
only have so many to choose from that
means that they're definitely or more
than likely using the same image sensor
as somebody else but right for some
reason they can't figure out the image
processing to make that image sensor
saying uh and that's something that you
can see with the iPhone 5 is like the
iphone 5 technically does not have as
good spec take camera or respect to a
lens as other phones on the market but
it consistently takes better photos in
more difficult light situations just
again and again and again and again and
again very easily because its image
processing is so good and so well yeah
and Motorola just can't figure that out
no I don't gotta say is by the Moto X
don't worry about it because in a week's
time stone is gonna kick out this
awesome camera accessory you strap that
on your Moto X and then you're away you
got beautiful beautiful pictures and all
those iphone fools whose phone could
actually fit into their pocket witness
camera they can jazeera go and do
whatever they need to do we won't be
worried about rule i am psyched about
the sony phone accessory i would love it
if they if they also come up with a
phone with just no camera on it like
super high on phone no camera and just
saying we believe in this thing like
that would be bosy it won't happen but
it would be nice you know I wouldn't I
wouldn't surprise me Sony's been known
to do is just really weird high-end
niche hardware Raleigh I know it's
pronounced broly but i prefer raleigh
i've always called it Raleigh I'm gonna
continue to say that sounds like a very
Midwestern wave pronouncing it yeah i
would also throw the PS Vita in that
category
now go to price cut so it actually has a
chance now do you remember the personal
media players that they had a couple
years back that had this like you know
graphite edges and everything like that
they were like super well designed
nobody bought them of course because an
ipod is a million times more usable uh
but they looked awesome and they
probably only played a track oh they
only had like you know four gigabytes of
internal memory for a check file so you
can play four songs yet you had trouble
finding 48 rock songs actually play yeah
yet you guys remember that old the the
the digital walkman that looked like a
pen is like it i think is available in
like 32 and 64 megabytes versions in the
late 90s that was a yeah it was
awesome it is super expensive i spent
like i spent like two years of
hard-earned like summer job cash on that
thing I think I once it was like 399 or
something insane like that and at least
felt insane at the time but the the the
interface for getting music onto the
Singh was just completely absurd because
it was this like you know of course it
was a custom Sony app they had to put on
your Windows machine and it only scored
a track so if you wanted to put an mp3
on there you had to import it into the
Sony app which converted it to a DRM
encoded a track that you had to check
out to put on the the the Walkman and
once it was checked out you couldn't do
anything else with it so like it it
basically took your rights to your own
mp3s away from you it was amazing is the
most Sony thing ever ever produced
beautiful I still had that player by the
way um I don't have a piece of software
that can put music files on of course so
I'm stuck listening to some Sammy Hagar
album for the rest of my life but and of
course it only fits one album on it so
it's just this probably is probably like
a late 90s Sammy Hagar too yeah another
one that you'd want to listen to I think
it was his first post van Halen album I
can't remember the name
um but it was it was yeah it was a very
special album yeah this entire
conversation is happening way above my
head not a sammy hagar fan i was aware
of his existence until like right now
what I hear right I'm done I'm done I
don't want to hear this anywhere I knew
with that that's a wrap for the verge
