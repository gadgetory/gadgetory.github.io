but the medium hasn't changed much in
the transition to digital publishers
have tried to add motion and sound to
comics before but it's an expensive
process that never really took off
anyway
now Marvel is betting big on its
adaptive audio technology which enhances
comics with dramatic music and sound
effects that may sound cheesy and it's
dangerously close but it kind of looks
like Marvel could maybe pull it off the
feature is called adaptive audio because
the sound changes depending on the
readers pace linger on a page and the
music will loop tap forward and you'll
be segue into the next mood you can also
turn the sound off if you want
the first adaptive audio comics will be
Captain America the Winter Soldier story
by Ed Brubaker issues 8 9 and 11 through
14 which are available exclusively
through the subscription app Marvel
unlimited audio will be added to
comments in a back catalogue on a case
by case basis Marvel has been playing
with other enhancements to its comics
including behind the scenes video and
motion comics neither of which have
really caught on but this is the first
feature that seems to actually enhance
the comic reading experience at least
for me the music isn't disrupted it
feels like the opposite it draws you
into the story and helps you understand
what's going on
I even slowed down my normal rapid pace
of reading and absorb more of the story
and other people I showed it to seem to
like it right away but I'm still
skeptical the publisher drafted an
emmy-nominated composer to score the
seats for the features big debut
but his Marvel really committed to
handcrafting sound for each of its
storylines</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
