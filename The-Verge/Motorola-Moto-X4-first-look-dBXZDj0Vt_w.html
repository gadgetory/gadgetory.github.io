evil 2017 in Berlin and the phone have
it in my hands is the new Moto X for any
mid-range handset from Motorola I have
it here in this silvery bluish color and
in black these are two options that
you'll be available in and I also have
the most essential accessory for them
which is a cuff to keep them clean these
phones have good glass on the front and
back rather like the Samsung Galaxy Note
7 last year which was a beautifully
designed phone quite aside from its
explosive issues and I feel like a lot
of companies have picked up that habit
of going for grass on the front in the
back it has the same sort of sloping
Kerr size a kind of slope towards the
front 2.5 B goes on the front 3d girls
on the back
so in terms of aesthetics is really
appealing and personally I really like
the black one not everybody agrees with
me people more like the super a bluish
color but I like the black one it's
really highly reflective and pretty but
it's only pretty if you can keep your
fingers of it I think it's a really nice
really reasonable screen but there isn't
anything particularly outstanding about
this new device you know the bezels are
much smaller than usual the size of them
isn't thinner or especially different
you still have this camera bump on the
top but this time it accommodates a new
tube camera system and it's different
from the c40 camera system introduced
earlier the Z force uses one
black-and-white sense of one color
sensor this one uses one regular focal
length 12 megapixel sensor and then it
uses 128 degree ultra wide 8 megapixel
sensor lens rather to give you a wider
field of view for landscapes do group
photos etc I've tried taking a few
photos with these you still have all the
motor actions and motor gestures such as
this double twist to launch the camera
and they're pretty cool but the camera
itself you know there's a mid-range
device it's not going to give you
anything particular special I wasn't
impressed with a few shots I took with
it you know that's just first
impressions in terms of specs you have a
snap driver 630 processor inside I think
that's perfectly adequate you know
there's a Snapdragon 835 that everybody
is familiar with but the difference
between that and the 630 I'm not
there is much of a difference for most
people's uses this starts with free
gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of storage
and this microSD expansion that we
priced at $399 here in Europe when it
launches later in September actually
launches with Android nougat but that's
just a matter of timing and Motorola
says you will get Android ory on there
as soon as possible
there'll be a 4 gigabyte RAM 64 gigabyte
storage version available later on and
it won't be coming to the United States
now in terms of software this motor
works device is exactly the same as what
you get with the other motors II devices
that have launched this year it's pretty
close to stock Android with motos
actions and a few other enhancements on
top it moves really fast is fluid and
it's nice and lovely motorola also has a
new system where it can integrate all of
your android controls down into the home
button which uses swipes and taps and
long presses instead of the free button
speaker have the on-screen buttons as
usual when Android the one stand-up
thing with a moto X 4 is that this model
is first device with Amazon's Alexa
integrated into it I ain't have any luck
training it but it's kind of a noisy
environment around here and also most of
these voice systems hate my voice and
accent so won't hold that against it but
what all also says that this is the
first of many so will be seen other
devices with alex integration later on
so as the motor works for motorola it
will be available in black and silver
blue that we priced at $399 here in
europe when it launches later in
September
and coming to the United States later on
the phone oh and it has headphone jack
it's too much Vlad you got it oh gosh no
no you have to include it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
