of the most interesting things we've
seen at CES this week is the
announcement of the WWE Network it's a
way to get 12 monthly pay per views plus
original programming plus a library of
everything WWE has ever released all for
999 a month but at the same time WWE
will be giving up a huge chunk of that
revenue they used to make on pay per
views it's a gamble the company says
they're going to make it up by creating
a huge subscriber base but it might not
work out we talked to WWE's Perkins
Miller about what the move means for
wrestling fans and when it could mean
for the cable industry at large I think
the way we look at it is we have an
incredibly rich history we've got this
archive that's a hundred thousand hours
of programming 52 weeks live programming
a year we have a live pay-per-view
business and we have our incredibly
engaged fans and our fans just live and
breathe and love the WWE so for us it
was really easy step to take and I think
you look out there in the market and the
path that's been paved by Netflix Hulu
Plus you know people are using these
devices in order to consume media like
they never have before I think you're
going to see a lot more brands
potentially like ours be able to make
this decision we're hopefully ahead of
the curve and will continue to stay
there for a little while it's only
because of the success of services like
Netflix and Hulu which proved that
millions of people are willing to cut
the cable cord if you give them access
to a large number of TV shows and movies
at a fraction of the cost in the short
term WWE is likely giving up millions in
revenue but if the network works you
could have implications that go far
beyond the world of professional
wrestling we're all waiting for the day
that we can buy channels like HBO and
Showtime a la carte over the Internet if
WWE network works that day could come a
lot closer but if it doesn't WWE's
lucrative pay-per-view network could be
going down for the count
