Verge at CES 2015 I'm back with yet
another ride of all these are the rocket
skates and this is literally the first
time I'm riding them are they on the way
it works is one of these is like the
dominant skate so you put that foot in
front and you sort of just push off with
your back foot and lean a little bit and
they propel you these are very difficult
to rely on oh it took me probably 25 to
30 solid straight minutes of doing
everything I possibly could to get these
to work so the subtlety of pointing your
toes down it's like everything that it
is to ride this thing where you sort of
just let the motors take you
so the back wheel not only provides
stability but it also acts as a brake
each skate weighs 7 pounds and when
they're on your feet it is very tiring
at first especially because you know you
sort of do like a lot of panic running
when I'm first we're learning to ride
but once you pick it up these skates
propel you and you can go 12 miles an
hour on expert mode and we tried out the
r6 model which has a range of 6 miles
Beverley names this costs $4.99 and
they're shipping now and there's also
the r8 and our 10 also based on how much
range they get and those are $5.99 and
$6.99 respectively so these are the
rocket skates they're awesome
really hard to ride but they're awesome
