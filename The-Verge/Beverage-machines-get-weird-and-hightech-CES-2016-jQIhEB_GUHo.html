with the verge at CES 2016 unveiled and
I'm not sure if you've noticed is my
first CES pretty nervous pretty
overwhelming thankfully my bosses have
allowed me to drink so that's what we're
gonna do so this is the Pico brew and
this is essentially a Keurig unit for
making beer in your house it can brew a
mini tank five liters in about two hours
so pull it out here you've got this
mixture
you've got grains in here and then
you've got hops in here I smelled them
earlier they smelled like hops they're
strong and then what will happen is you
put those in there you fill this with
water and you engage it using this dial
here you can tinker with the settings if
it's against the exact taste that you
want as you can see here I'm trying I'm
setting the desired bitterness you can
also that how hoppy you want the beer to
be out full you want the body to be so
you're able to tweak the taste right up
until the minute that you're actually
brewing it
so this is the soma bar this is an
electronic bartending unit on the side
here we've got three 750 milliliter
chambers on each side that holds the
ingredients for each drink and then what
you do is using an app you select from a
set of over 300 hard-coded recipes and
then you can also upload your own so
when you select a recipe like spirit
selected the moderates you see the
ingredients here and then if I tap here
it would make the drink good it is good
I don't know what else to say I'm just
enjoying a lovely beverage on the CES
show Florence it's divine so this is the
divine and this machine what it does is
it optimizes tasting conditions if
you're drinking wine at home you want to
experience a wine the way it's meant to
be drank you can pop it in this machine
and the way it works is that there is an
RFID chip in this vial full of wine and
you you put it in the machine upside
down like so and it'll read the chip and
spit out the dry conditions for you for
example this red leaf and then after a
minute or so it'll pour the wine at the
right temperature it'll be hair ated and
then you can drink it and it'll taste
the way it's supposed to taste so that
was the divine and I want to make clear
this isn't a machine that turns water
into wine or anything it's just spitting
it out at the right temperature and you
know it was cool to try but none of
these machines that I tested today I
don't think I'd use on a regular basis
they were just fun to use once but
that's not bad for CES right and I mean
this was my first CES I got to drink all
afternoon there's a nothing wrong with
that I'm doing all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
