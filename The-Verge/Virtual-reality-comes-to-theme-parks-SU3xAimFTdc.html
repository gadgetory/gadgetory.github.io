big tech companies like Google Facebook
and Samsung are all building headsets
consumers can buy and use in the comfort
of their own homes but virtual reality
is also reshaping an entirely different
set of industries it starts here in
theme parks but it will spread to malls
and movie theaters and arcades virtual
reality will reshape the way we consume
entertainment not just passively sitting
on our couch but also when we're having
fun out in the real world this summer
the future of this industry will start
to roll out to the masses Six Flags is
going to put VR coasters in nine parks
across the United States and Sony
Pictures is working with an ambitious
startup called avoid to put a
ghostbusters virtual reality experience
right into the heart of Times Square
okay I know what you're thinking wearing
a VR headset on a rollercoaster seems
ridiculous and well obviously it is but
having tried it myself I can say there's
actually something amazing about it when
you combine real-world forces with great
virtual reality you get something new
something more exciting and terrifying
than either one on its own layering
virtual reality on top of rides that
already exists works well but startups
are also starting from scratch zero
latency for example is creating a sort
of virtual reality shooting range
think the next generation of laser tag
and the void with its new Ghost Busters
experience is going even further it's
trying to map the virtual world onto the
real one so that when you reach out to
touch a wall in the simulation it's
actually they're using heat lamps and
fans trapdoors and elevators it's adding
physical effects to the simulation
creating what it calls hyper reality
these projects will have a profound
impact on the VR experience in two ways
first they'll act as a catalyst for
mainstream adoption Six Flags estimates
that 7 million people will get to
experience VR this summer on their rise
that's 7 times the number of active
users samsung believes it has for its VR
headset right now second they'll give
consumers a taste of the near future the
void is willing to spend a lot of money
on its headset for the average consumer
VR experience consumers not willing to
pay more than six to eight hundred
dollars plus $1,000 for their gaming PC
the void can spend around ten thousand
dollars on a single headset in order to
give people an ultra high-end experience
that's worth the price of admission and
that's why theme parks are going to be
the future of virtual reality you want
the biggest number of people to
experience the best the technology has
to offer and that's only gonna happen in
a place like this unless it doesn't
actually we've been on this ride before
a few decades ago people thought that
theme parks are gonna be the future of
virtual reality and vice versa that ride
didn't end so well it's 7:40 3:00 in the
morning right now we are gonna rock your
world through virtual reality ah the
1990s at the time a lot of companies
were jumping on the increasingly hot VR
bandwagon and one of the biggest was
virtual world entertainment
now the guys from that company you
thought that VR headsets made you look
like an idiot and they were not wrong so
they created what they call battle tech
pods these big complex looking cockpits
that you could strap into and battle not
very realistic-looking robots people
loved it they loved it so much that VW
is able to create its own series of
virtual reality parks they even had bars
we could go to tell your war stories
Weird Al was a fan yeah it was a thing
around the same time Disney began to
experiment with its own brand of virtual
reality it opened up in Aladdin magic
carpet ride with some very cumbersome
looking helmets and Bill Nye did a
little work on a cyberspace Mountain VR
theme parks and arcades were big
business until the novelty wore off that
is it turns out that they couldn't keep
the software updated fast enough to make
it interesting they didn't have the same
eternal enjoyment as a roller coaster VR
was just another amusement one with a
very short shelf life so is VR today
just another fad it's hard to say
obviously we know it's not as bulky or
expensive as it was back then and no
doubt the immersive experiences you can
have in your living room will improve by
leaps and bounds over the next few years
but until people start putting
rollercoasters in their backyards or
turning their houses into funhouse mazes
full of props there'll be a certain kind
of magic that's only possible when you
actually get off the couch who was the
virtual reality King getting ready to
are tickets on the virtual reality tour
this morning he joins us live from
Pasadena the mornings are nice you guys
gonna fly with me today Tony Susan
you're there what we're in virtual
reality somewhere yes somewhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
