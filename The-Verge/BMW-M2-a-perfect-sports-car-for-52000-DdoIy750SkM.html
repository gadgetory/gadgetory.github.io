been a fan of cars my entire life but
I've never actually had the opportunity
to drive one on a racetrack so here I am
- I Love New York today we're at the
Monticello Motor Club which is a big
giant racetrack where lots of really
fast cars drive around and we got the
BMW m2 with us which is a $50,000 sports
car that anybody can go to BMW and drive
and purchase and drive off the lot it's
really fun to drive on the road but it's
also really fast and capable on a crack
now I've got no skill level here so I'm
a novice and we're going to be doing
some track stuff and some auto cross
stuff we also have our creative director
James Baron here who's kind of like an
intermediate he's been on the track a
few times in his life and then of course
we have our expert Jason Harper who has
been on the track a bunch of times
driven lots of fast cars and fast places
and we're going to have some fun and see
how each one of us does with the m2
so this is the autocross which is kind
of waiting places that you don't really
go for oh fast but it shows up all your
mistakes you learn what your good right
which were wrong and you learn really
what the car can do a little bit without
big consequences which is awesome
so the idea is you can play a little bit
you're running some cones not that big
of a deal this is really really really
really hard faster
I'm actually getting a little bit rough
got a hit
when you spend just in Tanzania it's
such a good loan car having a car see
canvas what's happening McCarthy's car
scene in this week I have a
three-year-old he liked it a whole bunch
he's faster dead faster so the great
thing about this car the m2 is it's a
throwback BMW youso BMW was the idea you
didn't have to be an amazing driver to
just love your car but if you were an
amazing driver you could get the most
out of it that's what this m2 is yeah
and it's a lot of fun fun to drive even
if you're inexperienced like myself it
doesn't clamp down on the fun and so
much as like other cars but if you have
more experience you can take it even
further to your limits of what you drove
it in sport mode sport mode yep which is
just beyond the comfort mode - sports
plus the sort idea allows you a little
more latitude a little bit more feels
and I mean for me this is a this is an
important thing I'm back on the track
for the first time four years the last
time I drove a car on a track was a BMW
m3 e30 but again it was about handling
it was about late breaking it was about
just the craft of driving fast and the
incredible thing here we're driving on
such a tight circuit where everything
happens so fast bright change Chris
turning do this we need a track yeah we
need a really really big track where do
we have one of those yes I did this is a
great car for back roads but you can
take it to the track but it isn't a
track car we're out here doing it
because we can it's safe we don't have
to worry about cops or you know any
other problems so this is a chance for
each of us to explore our sort of limits
safely
so this is when I finally get to go fast
well though I'm going to take it easy
but then I understand it's your wife's
birthday today that it is does she
expect you to come home enough I'm in
this car really should not be able to do
this for $52,000 car this car handles as
well as a lot of sports cars that are
way more than that like twice that price
and then not only does it handle awesome
it has enough run to push you out of the
corner you can fit one child seat here
I'm not sure about - yeah a couple
groceries in the trunk couple bags per
groceries in here so you just have to
give up one child which one do you like
les voix man thank you
that was exhausted I know it is I grew
up loving BMWs and this is like I
remember why now with this this is small
and fast a tight and like Dan said you
can just drive it and it's gonna go as
fast as you want it to go and if you
suddenly go oh my god it's kike it's got
you it's gonna pick you up this is a
driver's car and the idea that we can
all go out and have a great time didn't
scare the out of anybody when I was
also interesting to your point it's
forgiving and yet when you push really
hard we hit 140 150 on the back straight
you did imaginary brake but other than
that you know uh no harm no foul we had
a great time and it's not a track carpet
that's really good out here I know the
thing with the track it allows you to
really find the limits of a car man you
said slam on the brakes and I'm like you
slam on the brakes and it
oof there's so much power that you can
brake so much later than you think
and the great thing here is we got a
chance to really push something like
this which let's be honest you don't
want to be learning those limits out on
the road hey the 52 grand 340 horsepower
this is as much car really as you'll
ever need and I promise you everybody
I'm gonna have a good time somebody you
can still put a kid in the back yeah -
if you must
so the beautiful beautiful thing about
the m2 is we can play a little bit so
you know there's no real consequences
out here it's cones nothing your hand at
all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
