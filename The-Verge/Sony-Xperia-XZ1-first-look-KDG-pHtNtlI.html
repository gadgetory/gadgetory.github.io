2017 in Berlin and someone has just
announced its new flagship smartphone
this is the xperia x said one right here
it's a 5.2 inch Android device has 1080p
display an aluminum unibody design and
it's then and aside from this color
there's really nothing exceptional about
it seemingly honestly when I was coming
here to do this video I would you get to
complain about just how iterative Sony's
design has become it's just a little bit
slim but it's still the same old design
the bezels is so Sony large and in place
they're not like Samsung and LG they
don't seem to be moving with the times
you know this was the thing I was going
to tell you about there's this and
there's also Xperia z1 compact which is
a four point six inch device which again
has this big bezels on there and we have
the bezels and Android controls you
don't get a much screen anymore
and again comparing this to something
like the LG v 30 which I've seen here at
Aoife it's night and day such a massive
difference and again I was going to
complain about someone it's design it's
nice but we've seen it for five years
running that's what I was going to talk
about instead this is runaway sensation
here which everybody is going to try you
know invest a little bit of time to try
it's going to love with these new Sony
phones it's a thing called 3d creator
it's a face / head scanning application
that Sony has pre-loaded on here and it
has honestly blown my mind I've scanned
a couple of our video producers here and
liked the quality of these scans is just
amazing
I'm one of these people who actually
hates a are most applications up until
now have been terrible and I hate
anything that has tried to work with it
because it'd just be so clunky and
horrible and Sony has actually done it
they've done such an amazing job with
this scanner it's shocking I am lost for
words with how cool it is and there are
these dorky applications which usually
put me off which usually I'm a cynic
about but with the quality of these
scans I want to use
you know there are these things that
make your friends face they superimpose
it on like a bear costume and starts
dancing and doing sit-ups and whatever
else in AR and usually I just roll my
eyes at that but because of the quality
of these scans I love it and walk
running and just can't get over the
quality of it is just so sharp and good
so for once okay so many designers been
a terrific iterative again yes but for
once sony has done something truly
unique that makes his phone stand out
aside from faces and heads you can scan
food you can scan all sorts of freeform
items and I just I love it it's amazing
honestly the LGB 30 as far as phones go
is the best phone of the show and maybe
even the best phone of this latter half
of the year but as far as just brand new
experiences surprises go so nice pretty
crazy just run away with it so sorry
fawning about a pretty crates I might as
well you know do my duty and tell you
about what these phones actually include
in some suspects and everything else
like I say the displays themselves
aren't all that impressive or special
you've got 1080p resolution on a larger
phone five point two inches 720p
resolution of a four point six change
smaller phone both of them we're running
on a Snapdragon 805 processor
both of them have twenty-seven hundred
million power batteries which isn't that
much for a larger phone but it's
actually a pretty nice size for the
smaller phone I think this will get you
a lot of battery life also cool these
are gonna be among the first Android
Oreo devices the Xperia x8 one is
shipping in the middle of September so
somebody says it's going to be first
Android or a device and the exit one
compact is shipped in October just a
little bit later a lot of other
companies launching phones here when
Android nuga
Sony's in the late webs and your Oreo
and it's really creator honestly I
haven't been this impressed with so many
deeper ever really the designs have
always been attractive but this thing
this pretty crater it just blow me away
this is a new experience at one and exit
one compact usually with smartphones
would like to ask who is this phone for
and with the big new feature here being
that 3d creator you might have said
people who do snapchat and want to
create stuff and just do videos and have
fun or whatever else it doesn't actually
me I'm not that person I'm somebody who
hates AR and I've been blown away by the
3d crater purely because of its quality
so who is this phone for who is for
these applications for I think everybody
you know you just gotta give it a chance
to give it a try it's it's off to it
because I'm not in the middle and I
gonna be in the middle I pray okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
