here at LG CES press conference and they
just introduced this brand new phone
this is the LG spectrum if you've seen
the LG optimus LTE on the international
market on the or the nitro HD over on
AT&amp;amp;T you have a pretty good idea of what
this phone is it features LG's true HD
IPS display that basically means 1280 by
720 pixels it is pretty amazing pixel
density 326 pixels per inch comes with a
dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon s4
processor 1.5 gigahertz it runs android
2.3 gingerbread which has been
disappointing but LG promises that it's
upgradable to android 4.0 presumably
that upgrade is in the works taking a
look at it I mean the display is LG says
is pretty amazing the pixel density is
quite terrific we already loved it on
things like the optimus LTE so that's
not surprising you can also see this is
a LG's custom Android Gingerbread screen
nothing really new there it has three
capacitive keys down here at the bottom
as a glass surface that covers basically
the entire front including this front
facing camera 1.3 megapixels flipping
around to the back he got the 4g LTE
logo so that basically tells you it's
verizon LTE it is exclusive to exclusive
to verizon in the u.s. LG logo 8
megapixel HD camera LED flash underneath
it right on the top you've got
power/lock button pretty much classic LG
microUSB port cover flip it open like so
korean have me a headphone jack volume
rocker on this side and pretty clean
bottom actually try and get the back
cover off this is plastic it's kind of
glossy plastic it's not the best cover
in the world it's but it is kind of
typical for sorts of things you get from
LG and Samsung looking under here you've
got an 18-13 mini amp hour battery and
you got your verizon LTE sim card right
here so this phone will be available on
verizon on the 19th of january so
basically this month shortly so yes
you'll be available now
January for 1 99 99 it comes with 20
gigabytes of storage that's walking by
storage in the phone itself and a 16
gigabyte memory card which come in the
box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
