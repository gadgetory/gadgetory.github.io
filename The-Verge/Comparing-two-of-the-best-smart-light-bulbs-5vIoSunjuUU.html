some smarts to your home is to start
using smart light bulbs they're getting
easier and easier to use and more of
them are starting to come out on the
market so today we're going to take a
look at some smart light bulbs this is
Phillips - and this is C by GE so we're
start with Philips hue because they're
the most popular ones and you've
probably heard of them folks who is like
the most advanced light bulb you've ever
imagined you don't even need all the
features it has you can change it to
pretty much any color just by flicking
around your phone screen and you can
also just dim it and even turn it all
the way off you really want to the other
cool thing is that Philips app has a
bunch of preset scenes and so you can
choose to make it AG playful and
colorful if you want or you can go to
specific night scenes and movie scenes
to kind of prepare your household for
whatever you might be doing I don't
really know why you'd want all those
colors but they could be fun for a party
or like those mentions a movie night J's
lights are a lot simpler there are two
types of them and they could both be
controlled from your phone over
Bluetooth it's really simple and you
sort of just go into the app and that
allows you to dim them or change the
color temperature you can also set the
light to automatically kind of follow
the color temperature of the Sun so in
the morning it'll be a little bit cooler
and at night it's going to be this nice
bright warm orange and that's supposed
to help you sleep better it's a lot like
the features we've seen flux and Apple
introduced with night shift so both of
these are starter kits and Philips
starter kit has three bulbs all which
change colors through all the different
colors and see by GE has four bulbs in
its starter kit two of which do this
color change throughout the day and two
of which are just standard white lights
but that you can still dim from your
phone see what you use much cheaper
because they're basically just enhanced
LED bulbs with a little bit of Bluetooth
in them it's fifty dollars for the
4-pack Philips starter kit is a lot more
expensive because you're also getting
the hub with it which allows you to
control an entire ecosystem of Philips
two lights that'll cost you $200 and you
get
three color changing bulbs and the hub
itself so if you want smart lighting and
you don't want to break the bank to get
there see by GE is the way to go you get
four bulbs to start if on the other hand
you want a lot more Flair and a lot more
possibility going to future Philips hue
is absolutely the way to go because you
can control an entire home once you get
started with the tub room look yeah okay
oh um we're actually getting rid of that
but you're getting rid of that worry on
you can carry on where you start what I
think we are</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
