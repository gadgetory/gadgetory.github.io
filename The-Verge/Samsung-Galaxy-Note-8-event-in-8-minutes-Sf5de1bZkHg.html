Armory it is my pleasure to introduce
the Galaxy Note 8
there's one thing that's always set the
note series apart the large immersive
screen and today we're combining the
revolutionary technology of the infinity
display with the power of the s-pen and
bringing it to the note for the very
first time it has a cinematic screen
that pulls you into the story when
you're watching movies or videos without
any obtrusive bezels or sensors or
camera lenses getting in the way your
view the notate makes it even easier to
multitask and to customize the
experience to fit your life thanks to a
pair you can create a shortcut to launch
two of your most use apps with a single
tap from the edge panel and you get to
choose your favorite color as it comes
in midnight black my favorite orchid
gray maple gold and deep sea blue we're
proud to introduce a dual camera that
will set a new standard for smartphone
cameras everywhere one camera has a
wide-angle lens for capturing big scenes
and the other has a teller lens with two
times optical zoom so you can get closer
to your subjects without sacrificing
image quality the node a is the first
smartphone ever to have optical image
stabilization in both cameras that means
you get crisp clear shots even when
you're on the move just look at the
difference
it's not just photos that benefit from
dual OS its videos - we've created a
brand new mode called live focus live
focus gives you the freedom to decide
how much your subject stands out by
adjusting the blur and focus of the
background in real time let me show you
I'm gonna launch my camera turn on live
focus mode and now since this picture is
all about Kelly I'm gonna turn up the
effect to maximum all right let's see
what what we've got in live focus mode
you can adjust the background blur even
after you take in the picture so I want
to dial it down I can but this is
Kelly's profile pic I'm gonna dial it
back up in live focus mode the cameras
simultaneously take two pictures so not
only do you have Kelly's view portrait
but you have all the beautiful detail
behind it which includes all of you
Kelly's new profile pic all of you we
call this feature dual capture the S Pen
has always been the heart and soul of
the note series and now we've made it
even better it has a finer tip and
greater pressure sensitivity to
faithfully capture each stroke and it's
paired with the larger screen we've ever
put on a note so now you have a larger
canvas we created live message a new
feature that lets you put some self back
in self-expression with live message you
can animate anything you write or draw
or add personal messages to photos
perfect looks good so now I'm gonna take
my S Pen out let's get back to that
picture
I'm gonna take my S Pen out click on
live message select that picture that we
just took from my gallery not gonna lie
the sparkle pen is my favorite now this
is saving to an animated standard
animated message format so I can share
this with everyone isn't that cool
screams memo is one of the most popular
ways to capture and easily share your
ideas and thoughts when you pin a to-do
list you're always on display you can
also edit it from there with a simple
double tap and that's not all you can
keep writing and writing and writing for
as long as you want
Wow up to a hundred pages all without
turning on your screen you can now
translate entire sentences with your S
Pen with the s-pen I can just hover over
a menu item and it will translate the
entire sentence for me it even
automatically converts units of
measurement and foreign currencies to
Galaxy s8 and si plus we launched Bixby
today Bixby voice is available for
English speakers and more than 200
markets around the world let's talk
about decks with game launcher on decks
you can put the graphics in a
full-screen immersive mode and destroy
your enemies with a mouse and keyboard
we've partnered with zoom to make video
conferencing completely seamless so I
can just open up the zoom app and start
the meeting with Suzanne
what's great it's cuz I started that
meeting while I was walking down the
High Line on my phone when I'm back on
my decks all I have to do is open up the
app in the videoconference still
connected alright so let me just share
you my screen so you can see what's
going on remember when I was talking
earlier about how powerful the note 8 is
and how it can run multiple apps
simultaneously well it has a 10
nanometer processor and a full 6 gigs of
RAM the node 8 has a micro SD card slot
and even without the card
it's got 64 gigs of storage onboard you
need to keep it safe that's why we embed
Knox our defense grade security into the
hardware and software we have a whole
menu of advanced biometric options
including fingerprint facial recognition
and the iris scanner with the Noda you
don't have to worry about getting your
device or the S Pen West Samsung has had
wireless charging since the s6 and fast
wireless charging since the note 5
now you can power through your day and
charge the no dates 33 hundred million
power our battery quickly and
conveniently beginning on September 15th
the no date will hit stores and thanks
to our partnership with Harmon the no
date will come with a pair of premium
AKG earphones and guess what you can do
with those earphones that's right you
can plug them in to the standard
earphone jack
thank you so much for your vision your
loyalty and your support thank you 107
employees who have joined us today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
