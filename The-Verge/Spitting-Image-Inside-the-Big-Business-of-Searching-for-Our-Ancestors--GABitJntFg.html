maybe four or five years ago a friend of
mine was telling me how she was really
into doing it and it sounded like fun
sort of i started online and God got
hooked and it's been a fun thing to do
sort of as a hobby in my spare time I
really yeah it's really relaxing I would
say I'm a hobbyist genealogist the need
to provide records to people goes to
sort of the need that we all have to
understand where we came from you our
ancestors were who helped us understand
who we are it's actually fulfilling a
very human need I would say to
understand ourselves genealogists
research oriented genealogists they're
interested in names and dates and places
and facts but I think there's a vastly
larger number of people who are
interested in understanding the story of
their ancestors I'll just give you a
little background we think there's a bit
about a hundred billion people live on
the earth there's about 10 billion of
the 100 billion that have ever lived for
which there is some documentation
early on at the turn of the last century
we would go in we would find an archive
and they would have these records and we
said listen what we'll do is we will
come in with our volunteers and cameras
we will take a picture we will image
these records you have and in return for
doing that will give you a copy so if
you get a flutter of fire something
you've got a copy and we will keep a
copy and all we ask you is the right to
share that microfilm was somebody wants
it we have five floors over a hundred
and forty thousand square feet over 500
computers over 750,000 books we have
approximately 2.4 million rolls of
microfilm that's about 3.3 billion
individual images of the 3.3 billion
only about 800 million of that has been
digitized being sponsored by the Church
of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints we
have a special kind of affinity for
family history research we love our
families we want to be connected to them
through the generations and so we have
sort of a tradition in the church to
research our ancestors we don't have
anything we sell everything we have is
free and people ask well why would the
church do that we believe that families
not only exist in this life but they
exist in the life to come and so if we
can document our families and they can
be together and we know who they are
then we believe that's an eternal
principle not just a worldly principal
and and frankly we are all dots children
and so it not just members of the church
is this useful for but really for
everyone who's a child of God who comes
to know themselves so knowing their
ancestors and you can serve their
ancestors through identifying them and
learning about them
there are large profit players there are
large nonprofit players there's the
commercial and non-commercial side of it
and they all play together in the
sandbox data is big business there are a
lot of data brokers out there
ancestry.com technically could be seen
as a data broker they are in the
business of acquiring data and selling
it to you and me under the guise of
searching for our ancestors 20 years ago
family history was pretty much the
definition of a niche now the family
history is social it's a lot easier than
it used to be hundreds of millions of
documents actually go through our
operation to be digitized and presented
to the side we have 10 billion records
actually on ancestry.com right now and
once all of that information has been
transcribed or entered into the system
then our teams here work to optimize
that data so that it's searchable in the
site we make deals with repositories all
over the world archives courthouses
libraries to go in and digitize original
family history material we spend over 20
million dollars a year acquiring content
this combination of a continual feed of
new content along with our customers
using that data adding structure to that
data is very powerful
what's just so satisfying about it is
sort of solving all these little mini
mysteries and you feel like this sleuth
and that you you know used your hard
detective work to figure something out
there are certain points in the research
that done we're just haven't been able
to go back any further I've hit
roadblocks there's just so you know I
met a dead end and hopefully the DNA
test will be able to tell me further
back and with some actual accuracy
correct any mistake that may have made
I'm sure I have made mistakes and that
is why I'm going to spit in this tube
and take this test one of the issues
that we have with family histories it
takes a little bit of time you have to
do some research you have to look up
records and you know your younger
generation doesn't necessarily have all
that time and so by taking a DNA test
it's a way to supercharge and jump right
into family history so 23 Emmy was
founded with a mission to really change
healthcare by giving people access to
their personal genetic information and
we had some genealogy features where
people could learn a bit about their
ancestry
and ever since then we've been adding
health reports and adding ancestry
features that enable people to learn
more about who their ancestors were
parts of your genome might look like
they come from Northern Europe parts
from southern Europe parts from the Near
East and then we at the end once we've
covered the whole genome we add up the
fractions of all pieces and and that's
your basically gives you the percent
ancestry from each region DNA is really
exciting is a technology that family
historians have not yet fully harness I
don't think we have some great products
on the market and what I can't wait to
see further integration of the records
companies with the DNA companies to
provide a really interesting experience
you can walk through the past with your
DNA and it's coming it will be there I
get I mean I guess what's sort of
surprising here is that this doesn't
include it doesn't include British or
like southern European which in theory
should be a significant portion of my
genetic makeup I mean I would hate to
see it at a point where it was so good
that it took away the old method of
research that you know you could just
take a test and would tell you
everything just about two months ago my
uncle Doug up in his attic this whole
box of old family photos one of the
pictures was of my great great great
aunt and uncle as children at a costume
ball that they attended and there in the
you know sort of funny outfits and they
look like kind of weird glowing
Victorian children you could sort of
immediately relate to them as these kids
in these stupid outfits I do not want
you to have their picture taken their
parents dragged them to this children's
costume ball they're probably a little
bit too old for it the DNA information
itself the ast season geez are not very
interesting to people it's just a long
string
but it's really about the stories that
you can pull out that are meaningful to
people when I share this with my niece
and nephew if I show them a chart they
run the other way that's not interesting
but if I tell them the story about my
great-grandfather who actually died in
Jacksonville Florida that's neat that
puts it in perspective as a family
history business we see right at the
root of everything I the every person's
story you know that story is what's
important to us what was life like for
them and what was going on at the time
in the place that they live tour de do
you know the environment look like what
kind of jobs that they have we are
related distantly related to Abraham
Lincoln right and so I went home that
night I told my kids listen he's a
distant relative and so now when they
see Abraham Lincoln or they see
something about him but they read a
story my little seven-year-old the other
day he goes dad remember he's our
relative right and it was like you know
what that's what it's that's what it's
about there's an old saying you don't
know who you are and tell you know where
from where you've come
when you try to find out about people if
they didn't leave anything you're
frustrated so the best thing you can
start doing is preserving about yourself
right now if you think about it today
we're actually generating more records
than we've ever generated before and yet
UNICEF recently came out and said over
forty percent of the world's population
will die with no records at some point
we need to think about what our
grandchildren here to wish that we would
have saved I'm it's almost a fundamental
human right to exist you know and once
you're gone if you've left no story
behind then did you exist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
