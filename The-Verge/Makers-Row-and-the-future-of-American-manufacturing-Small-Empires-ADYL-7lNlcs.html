invested in them and met amazing people
using the internet to change the world
our generation has an opportunity unlike
any other we can create small empires
without anyone's permission
we're literally down under the Manhattan
Bridge overpass also known as Dumbo and
a lot has been said over the last decade
about the decline of the American
manufacturing industry one startup here
in Brooklyn makers Row is actually doing
something about it just want you to know
before we get any further I am an
investor in makers row but just like any
other startup on the show we're
profiling them because they're cool I
also just happen to be a professor we
connect designers and brands with
American manufacturers basically our
mission is to make manufacturing
accessible in the US when I graduated
from Pratt I design watches for Marc
Jacobs DKNY if you have the designer
brands decided to leave that behind
start my own watch company and there I
was producing overseas and I got a very
difficult lesson in like sourcing
overseas as an independent company
versus being part of a large corporation
got tired of that and I want to start a
new company still very much in love with
design but now I went to have much more
control over the manufacturing process
so I wanted to do everything locally so
everything I was getting was hyperlocal
the leather I was getting Queens the
hardware I was getting in Bronx and
everything was assembled in Midtown in
the garment district so I knew every
single person that was touching my
product and it was a world of a
difference I was working full time where
we were
I was working at Goldman Sachs why why
did you want to leave goldman sachs on
one of my half days i visited a factory
with matthew and so at that time i was
working with him part-time like doing
spreadsheet stuff for him and operations
stuff and i visited a factory and i was
just blown away at you know at seeing
what used to be a drawing of his that i
had to see him like last week and seeing
someone put it together and all of the
steps are going to it and all the care
that goes into it it was just incredible
it was really interesting to see how
long it took matthew to find american
manufacturer because it that was his you
know domain of expertise he wanted the
best materials the best contractor and
to be able to produce things with you
know within two weeks within a month and
so really hard it would take us months
to find these American manufacturers
Tania was really the one who saw the
opportunity in that because we would
meet other designers all the time and
they all had the same problems they
couldn't find the right manufacturers it
was much easier to find them overseas
but they're having problems with it I
would go to conferences and people were
complaining not just about marketing and
sales but they were complaining about
production and how do I find a
contractor how do I find an American
manufacturer and one of my designer
colleagues paid two thousand dollars for
just an excel sheet of American
manufacturers and I was like this is
ridiculous how like brokered the
information is how hard it is just just
find information like the Yellow Pages
isn't enough Google isn't enough I'm
from Detroit
and I've seen what manufacturing can do
to build up a city and I can see with
the loss of manufacturing
new to a city and devastated so it means
a hell of a lot to be a part of
something that can make a difference I
love going to factories not only is it
something that that's kind of like my
roots my family came to Detroit because
of war and all that sort of stuff some
manufacturing is in my blood I wanted to
apply my manufacturing experience to the
platform so that were not just a like a
Yellow Pages basically for American
manufacturers I wanted it to be a
platform which it made manufacturing
easier to understand as well as access I
broke down the manufacturing process
into six basically bite-sized steps so
that from basic concept to product in
hand a beginner would be able to follow
those steps to be able to create
whatever they want it before makers Row
was it really that bad was the sort of
market for knowledge that inefficient
that even you a Pratt grad like couldn't
get the access you needed as efficiently
as you'd like so I'm gonna throw numbers
at you bring it please so the first time
entrepreneur over 75% of first time
entrepreneurs trying to produce physical
products fail before they even get to
the prototype phase many designers they
basically draw something up on a napkin
and send it overseas they have no idea
what the process is they have no idea
what the materials are that are going
into the products that they're producing
and that's really dangerous
we were both non-technical people we
didn't know how to code we had never
started a tech company before and so we
didn't really know how to get started so
I started like signing up for mailing
lists and going to meetups and
and so on one of the mailing lists there
was this application for an incubator we
applied we put like our business plan we
did a video and we got accepted so we
used the acceptance into the incubator
as leverage to get a technical
co-founder and so we found Scott and he
came on on board and and then within
those three months of the Brooklyn bethe
summer camp program we created makers
row what was the initial feedback like
it was awesome it was awesome I think
that you know from designers they were
just like oh this is really cool like I
saw from my friends they went to Pratt
with me they said this is really awesome
like I was the guy who was kind of
sitting back in class and just kind of
like sketching out stuff and not really
paying too much attention in class I
think they're a little surprised that I
would go back to the rudiments of like
how a product gets produced but it's
very much something that I fell in love
with and then to see from the factories
to see how many people were reaching out
to these factories and see that they
were actually getting orders enough for
them to make a new position whether it
be in labor or management with something
that you know I'm a strong guy you know
it made me well up a little bit I will
say that adapt or die is a pretty
well-known business tenant a company has
been manufacturing here in New York for
longer than I have been alive and
they've been able to take this age-old
business online right here in the
garment district my father actually
started making belts and my dad is a
very you know driven motivated person he
immigrated to this country from Russia
he had to make something he started flea
markets and then he started selling he
started making headbands and things like
that and then finally he moved into
handbags what happened was he had a
small little shop then he got bigger and
bigger and he started selling wholesale
and he made his own brand it became
pretty big they had
showroom on 35th Street in Manhattan
they had an enormous factory just making
their own merchandise
I actually saw their bags all over the
world they were shipped everywhere and I
remember being a little girl on vacation
with my father and walking into a store
like in the Caribbean and seeing their
bags and saying oh they made that and
they would be all shy they know we did
it Mickey you know for the first 20
years he made his own line of lower-end
bags so that these were 10 15 $20 bags
we cannot do that anymore I mean China
took over that whole market so we've had
to change in order to adapt otherwise we
would be gone just like most of the
handbag manufacturers in New York he
said you know the business is changing
you know I want to go do in a different
direction you know I can keep the
business open if you want to take a stab
at it or you know we're gonna close I
was like okay I'll try it I was young I
had no idea what I was getting into um I
was 21 just right out of school yeah so
you guys so you graduate from college
yeah where'd you go to school
Cornell University awesome all right see
graduate from Cornell and your dad's
like here's a business good laughs we
had to switch to a more luxury product a
more niche product we can't compete with
lower end beds there's just too many
factories overseas makers row they came
to our office and they said we you know
we have a new idea we're going to be
making a website and would you like to
be featured there's very little
marketing in the manufacturing world so
if anyone approaches me with a good idea
they seem very serious I'm gonna go for
it we had pretty much immediate you know
response from new designers you all have
been in this for decades now how
optimistic are you about manufacturing
in the USA I know that new designers
cannot just go overseas and start
placing orders it's just too much
commitment
so from makers Roe from the website I
mean we see that we get so many
inquiries every day so many so we have a
full-time person just answering
inquiries all day long so there is there
are so many people with ideas in the
that don't really have the option to go
overseas so all those people have to
come to companies like ours we see you
so because of orders from makers row and
online you've got an entire person like
hired to handle inbound yes from because
of makers row and I think just the
economy some people are you know out of
work and looking for things to do and
start new things and of course makers
are all I mean that we get emails all
day long people like to hide their
manufacturer if they find a good
manufacturer it's kind of like you have
to know the right person or ask the
right questions and but people are that
everyone is so protective of their
manufacturers because it's just that's
the nature of the industry I would say a
lot of people are yes some people are
not you know they don't mind but most
people try to keep their factory a
little bit secret every founder wants to
disrupt an industry right they're all
talking about some big thing they're
gonna change you guys are going after a
really entrenched one that has a lot to
lose for basically having this
information out freely you know if if
makers ro succeeds there are lots of
people who have made it their business
to hoard information about food
manufacturers probably not gonna want to
give it up so what's been I mean what's
been the biggest challenge so far with
dealing with that kind of disruption so
we've gotten scathing emails from
consultants which oftentimes you're
you're right they hoard this information
so that entrepreneurs like myself will
pay them two thousand dollars just for a
spreadsheet of contacts and you know
that there's no real critical
information in there to let you know
whether this is the manufacturing that
so you're still on the phone there was
this one time where I picked up the
phone we don't put our phone number
anymore because we just got too many
calls that's about
but they picked up the phone and this
consultant or this guy in the industry
wanted to come over and talk to us so I
was just like sharing come on and talk
to it and so he came over it and then it
actually ended up being a bad situation
because he threatened us we sat down
with him and he basically was like you
know I'm gonna get what I want you know
and I want to be a part of what you guys
are doing like we have ways of shutting
these types of things down but you know
who is the we he's talking about here
it's always that we where it's it's not
this big guy that's called tiny behind
them but you know they always try to
make it seem as though they have this
crew of people that are this uh yeah
basically crew of people that could shut
you down is he's just like you guys are
crazy for giving all this information
away for free I charge people for this
information if you don't work with me
I'm not saying I'm gonna do anything
illegal but I'm gonna get what I want
and and we're sitting there in the
conference room and which is like what
do I do
like I'm not ashamed oh yeah and it's
like this big guy that is madness
startups don't have to deal with like a
mafia style shakedown like that's like
really nice start a period be a shame
for something that happened to it like
that's exactly but then he was also
telling yeah cuz he was telling us other
stories about like violent things he had
done and I'm just like is that are you
trying to put those two together um
when he says shut down what do you think
he's talking about oh you and that both
no and he's talking about he's he's in
he's using intimidation tactics to try
to you know shut down the site which is
understandable if that's if your only
means of revenue is that spreadsheet
you're gonna be pretty pissed because
that's probably been supplying you you
know for over five ten years we didn't
know that you know so many people were
going to be upset because we were giving
the information away for free and so now
we don't we don't take meetings unless
we know everything over and nothing
ended up happening he didn't end up you
know shanking us or anything long as you
don't wake up with any horses heads in
your bed like yeah we still were a
little bit shaky on that but I'm really
happy that nothing came about so
hopefully he's not watching you got a
quite a few neighbors in here yeah yeah
got a ton of companies here in the
incubator it's really awesome to be able
to network with so many different types
of companies cuz you get lead is there's
just a MakerBot here in the office for
anyone to make stuff with absolutely I
feel like I don't know if it's a New
York tech thing i but there is a kind of
I feel like there's an undeniable
camaraderie at least oh yeah absolutely
this is our home right here in this area
you guys do not hide anything about this
made in the USA pride you couldn't tell
when area was on what has been the most
surprising thing on the job here rocking
social media for anchors
the positive
response we get from everybody so it's
really passionate about made in USA I
don't really excited and they want to
see you grow a lot of the stuff that
you're using today was that education
learned in the classroom or just learn
from googling and Stack Exchange and
just trial err I'm glad yes yes no
essentially it's all from trial and I
were googling other people on the job
actually looks at college Syracuse
University for design and I just been
coding since I was thirteen so similar
work throughout they'll said I never
went to school for this I don't believe
that that you can really I mean you'll
be really better and you slur on your
own I think means nice to have the
degree you'll have like this foundation
but in order to stay up with with trends
I mean stack overflow googling terms all
the time I mean I think anyone can
really do it if they put their mind to
it and they're really excited fun doing
it I encourage everyone to to start
building a small Empire because we
recently met this amazing couple who
were so incredibly in love that it made
me feel guilty for being a not nearly as
romantic as I could be boyfriend I want
to make this special purse and now what
would my experience be like if I say
went to Google or went to Alibaba and
tried to get this purse made overseas
there would be a little bit of a
language barrier you're just assuming I
don't know Mandarin or Cantonese or
Vietnamese or a Okinawa yeah I'm
assuming that you would probably have to
act as if you are going to be placing a
larger order in the future so they
usually if they're making a sample they
might charge you a low fee for the
sample but they expect you know a few
hundred peace order afterwards their
businesses are set up for the production
side all makers
so here's where a bag starts we take the
sketch that the client gave us and we
make a set of patterns then the pieces
are hand cut and assembled after that
into a finished prototype he's cutting
the leather skiving it
what is skiving at me skiving is when
you take the leather and you thin out
the edges that was a course for the
viewers I obviously know what skiving is
I just wanted everyone else to know
so roughly how many bags would you say
can be made here
in a day about 100 I live in a world
where all we do is like pixels so just
watching physical stuff be made and
start out as like a sketch over there
and be a thing that I would touch it not
get me in trouble it's pretty cool
you're going to place the rivet on there
we're going to press the foot down and
the rivet is tight on the bag now all
right it's in there
first let's push down
there you go the rivet is on tight you
know if I've learned anything from just
doing this for the last 15 seconds I am
not cut out to do manufacturing I see
she's doing a pretty good job off the
line are you doing at this rate no I I
need to stick to keyboards I your speed
is a little slow but I know I that is
riveting surprised the missus I love it
it comes from the heart and the Riveter
just don't say you made it here that if
that's what you're getting hurt
Wow that's how much does it help you all
that most Americans are now old I think
it's pretty safe to say aware of our
dependence on foreign manufacturing this
was something this is not a new
phenomenon but I feel like it's
something that certainly last 10 years
has really peaked in terms of awareness
does it help you now because you can
actually say like yes we have
manufacturers who are producing the
stuff United States you know all of the
benefits that are there are available
not just for designers but also for
consumers isn't like is the timing of
this right whereas even like 10 years
ago it wouldn't be nearly as optimal as
it is today
I would say the stars are really aligned
for us because it's a it's a political
issue this is something where smaller
communities are talking about jobs
because they're losing jobs because
factories are shutting down but this is
also a time that we're fortunate because
the prices of overseas manufacturing are
rising in their rising really fast the
watches that I produced in 2007 have now
doubled if not tripled in price of
production alone so we see this
happening all across the board and now a
lot of larger companies like GE and
Apple they're looking for domestic
manufacturing alternatives right so
there isn't it's not just a kind of
moral decision it's a business one right
and and I think that a lot of people
basically relied on the consumer to make
the choice to choose you know domestic
over foreign based product but I think
that's really unfair when you see only
3% of the apparel that's consumed in the
United States is actually made here you
can't really blame the consumer what we
want to do is encourage the decision
makers the brands that are deciding
where their stuff is made and
encouraging them to produce here locally
so then we can switch it around where
there's many more American goods that
can be found in stores we make a lot of
very
here a lot of it is because we can stay
on trend because it turnaround is so
fast that people really can kind of see
what the trend is and get sales how
often do your designers sort of rave
about made in USA like you guys ever get
asked to put little American flag tags
inside or anything that absolutely we
usually have made in USA labels so if I
take one of these bags we have a video
show it off go ahead under the tag don't
see enough of that it feels like there's
definitely a mission element to this
company you know what what is the what
is the best case scenario for for a city
like Detroit which has seen so much
manufacturing disappear I mean it's
certainly coming back a little bit but
what do you hope makers ro can do for
cities like that you wouldn't say that
with your chest out yeah and you're
factoring is axial oohed lien come on
you're saying it I mean like you could
say with conviction it is a mission for
us and I think that we found within the
first few weeks we saw that this wasn't
going to be something in which we're
just calling people asking them to sign
up this is an on-the-ground effort and
we've just recently you know formed this
type of series in which we're going out
to these communities so more recently we
went to Newark and with the help of Cory
Booker in the city and Brookings
Institute and so many other sponsors
that basically open the doors to these
manufacturers that if you knocked on
their door they're not going to open it
unless they have that from
your voice so we're taking that type of
series and going across the country with
it we're going to make our way back to
Detroit definitely there are lots of
reasons why manufacturing is coming back
to the United States plenty of them are
economic what's so remarkable about
makers row is that it's making it easy
for anyone to take a sketch in their
notebook and turn it into a physical
good and all that efficiency means a lot
more innovation
