favorite utilities for the Mac but
here's a question what about Windows yep
we're doing Windows and just like we did
with the Mac utilities video I want to
talk specifically about utilities these
are little tools that make your
experience of using Windows better not
just apps and I have to be honest with
you I can't pretend that I know Windows
quite as well as I know the Mac this is
my surface and I do use it all the time
but I really wanted to call in an expert
and lucky for me I've got one I can call
his name is Tom Warren he's a senior
editor for The Verge and so we're gonna
have a chat he's gonna talk about his
favorite utilities I'm gonna talk about
mine and we're gonna see where Windows
10 is going so you know let's Skype him
in hey Tom thanks for being on yeah all
right it's good to be home and I know
you just wrote an article but ear
trumpet so what's that all about I don't
know about you but I've got gaming PC I
like to have like Spotify coming out my
speakers and YouTube coming out my
headphones and stuff that's not really
super easy to do in Windows at the
moment so it trumpet is like kind of a
third party app that lets you switch
apps between the outputs so it basically
imitates the system tray icon we have
the volume icon right now it lets you
sort of drag and drop essentially apps
between different outputs within that
interface so on the Mac there's a bunch
of different window utility options that
let you set up like split screen and
fullscreen and blah blah blah blah but
Windows doesn't really need that because
most of that stuff has sort of built in
but there's this new utility called
group II right can you tell me about
that so say you've used file explorer
stuff for that I've always wanted tabs
just to have different you know
different folders open and in the same
window and stuff like that so this
enables that it's pretty simple you just
click you know classic it generates like
a tab within within it's the whole
window interface you can group different
apps together you can let group
workflows to say you use I know like
word file explorer you can group them
all into that single window and just tap
between them you can't like tab pretty
easily there's like you can create your
own shortcut but like usually you use
ctrl + tab to tab through things you
can't do that for example but Microsoft
is working on their own sort of version
of groupies so you know one of the
themes that I'm picking up on here is
that a bunch of the stuff that we're
talking about is basically going to be
built right into wind
at some point in the near future and I
guess a lot of those updates gonna come
in this redstone update so Tom how is
Microsoft gonna be doing its version of
a tabbed interface yes they're doing
it's very similar they're doing it in a
way that it's like they're calling it
sets that the idea is that you'd have a
set of applications that are grouped
into there's no single interface but
they have like some form of like
connection to each other so say you were
working on an email and you open it
linked from an email it might open
within that you know that interface
rather than opening a separate window
okay let's talk screenshots everyone
needs a good screenshot utility right
but the one that's built into Windows is
honestly it's not that great and there's
a bunch of replacements out there
there's like light shot and a few others
but you use one called share X right CS
sherek sees a totally customizable
screenshot tool for Windows and so it's
super powerful
you can upload stuff to imager so I can
literally hit like a print screen on my
keyboard drag around the desktop for the
region I want let go and within a couple
of seconds is uploaded to imager it link
is in my clipboard and I'll just paste
it into slap pool wherever I want to
share that image the reason I like it as
well is you can record gifts on it so
particularly you know sort of job when
you're trying to grab gifts off the
screen so it's pretty great does it also
let you do annotations yet so when you
get the region capture you can also
annotate on it crop it well that's all
stuff okay so we know that a bunch of
the features we've been talking about
are basically gonna get built into
Windows 10 later on but what do you
think it means that Microsoft is being
so aggressive at converting these like
third-party utilities into things are
just built into the operating system
lots of thing it's them listening but
they don't have been asking for a lease
for Alfred for Windows so maybe that
will come at some point but yeah I feel
like it's a mixture of them listening
and just realizing what kind of people
who use Windows for maybe it's moved on
from what the general consumer to more
of a subset of people who are using it
for like real work so to speak so I feel
like they're picking up on that trend
it's the one thing that Microsoft has
that they have to keep pushing is the PC
right there yeah they have to keep
making it better and better to keep
people using I did find some utilities
on my
want to give me the stuff that I found I
really can't use a good proper desktop
operating system without a clipboard
history my memory sucks and I love that
it can just remember the last hundred
things that I copied and then just build
an arrow through than what I paste and
so on Windows my favorite one is called
ditto it's a free utility just lives
down the system tray and you set a
hotkey to it I've set mine to shift
command V and when you hit it it pops up
this little window and then you can just
arrow through the last you know a few
things that you copied hit enter and it
pastes it right there at the cursor it's
super convenient it doesn't take up any
memory it's just great whenever I use a
computer with the keyboard I want to
have instant Universal search no matter
what I'm doing no matter where I am in
the computer and in theory Windows is
very good at that they have this thing
where you hit the Windows key start
typing the thing that you want to search
for hit enter and bam it opens up but
here's the problem that windows search
it uses cortana and cortana wants to use
bing and I don't find it that easy to
customize and it doesn't really match
the way that I want to work so I've
installed an app called walks that's wo
X and if you're familiar at all with
Alfred on the Mac this is basically the
same thing you hit a button and a blank
search box comes up and you could just
type a things so I've got g4 Google type
verge and then it searches the verge and
there's a bunch of other stuff you can
do to customize it you can put in custom
searches you can have it do calculations
you can do all kinds of stuff it's a
little bit complicated to set up but for
me it's totally worth it anyway look
this isn't a review of Windows I just
wanted to talk about some of the tools
that make me feel more productive on the
soccer team system because like I said
before and I know this is really corny
but these utilities make me feel like I
have superpowers and Windows is really
good at enabling that and the thing I'm
worried about is I don't know if
Microsoft is really into that anymore
they're pushing edge super hard they're
pushing Bing so hard oh my god stop it
with the Bing they're even pushing
Cortana a little bit too much and I hope
that they change their mind about that
because I don't think Windows should be
about locking us into Microsoft services
I think Windows should be about making
us feel powerful
hey thanks for watching and if I miss
your favorite Windows utility now is a
perfect time to drop some knowledge on
all of us down in the comments we can
have a chat down there you could click
Subscribe and the other thing you can do
is go check out verge science they're
doing some amazing work I love the video
they made about ferrofluids not too long
