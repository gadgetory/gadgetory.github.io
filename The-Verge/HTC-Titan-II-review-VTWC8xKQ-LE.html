the HTC Titan too it's an AT&amp;amp;T phone
it's the successor to the HTC Titan
which we reviewed last year and it's
mostly the same phone it's a little
thicker and because it has such a big
4.7 inch display it's actually kind of
hard to hold in one hand especially the
power button which is located up top can
be really hard to press if you're only
holding the phone in your left or right
hand it has the same specs mostly as the
last phone which worked quite well it
has a 4.7 inch Super LCD and it looks
nice it has great viewing angles and
really deep blacks but it's got the same
800 x 480 resolution which Microsoft
mandates for its devices and that's just
too low res and especially on a screen
this big it just doesn't take advantage
of all the screen real estate that's
actually there you there are two major
upgrades from the Titan to the Titan to
the biggest one being the 16 megapixel
camera on the Titan too and it's a good
camera definitely one of the best we've
seen on a smartphone but it's definitely
not as good as HTC makes it out to be
puts out relatively soft images to the
point where it doesn't even seem to be
necessarily in focus you can never
really find a spot in an image that's
really sharp there's a 1.3 megapixel
front camera which is basically the same
it's decent for what it is but it's
really nothing special the other big
upgrade from the Titan is the LTE
connection which is awesome it's a huge
upgrade from hspa+ which 18t has had
before it's a pretty fast connection we
got about 8 12 megabits down and 12 up
in general the performance the device is
solid it has a 1.5 gigahertz Qualcomm
processor and it works pretty well
there's really no lag as you do anything
around the operating system and that's
again consistent to most windows phones
the reception was solid and call quality
was pretty decent the speaker phone is
not great but the microphone is actually
really good and battery life is great
the Titan doesn't have a particularly
huge battery but it lasts a long time I
consistently got a day and a half or
more out of the battery before it died
really the Titans biggest problem is
that runs Windows Phone Windows Phone is
a beautiful and elegant operating system
and I'm a fan of both of those things
and it actually does a number of things
especially basics like making phone
calls or sending text messages really
really well but there are a lot of
issues especially with third-party apps
there's some scrolling problems and some
weird multitasking quirks and the email
app has some trouble and even Internet
Explorer does a bad job rendering web
pages a lot and they're mostly minor
things but over time they become
increasingly frustrating overall the
Titan two is kind of a hard phone to
windows phone is definitely a
third-place operating system behind iOS
and Android and there are great phones
for both of those operating systems on
AT&amp;amp;T like the iphone 4s or the HTC One X
which is coming soon and even if we're
committed to buying a Windows Phone
device you're probably better off with
the Nokia Lumia 900 which is a much
better design phone and because
Microsoft so controls the user
experience and specs the design becomes
really the only thing that matters to
tighten too is a good phone but
unfortunately it's competition and its
operating system kind of kill the appeal</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
