we're here with Apple's new iPod Touch
which as you can see is ridiculously
thin it's got this new kind of aluminum
back here's my old iPhone 4s you can see
it's just really really small compared
to the 4s obviously the big feature is
the new display it's the new same size
of the iPhone 5 it's taller shows more
content in every optimized app so I can
just show the mail you see more mail
messages I go back in your open mail you
see more mail messages if I open the app
store you see more apps in this screen
if you have an anon up some ice app I
believe DJ it's not optimized you can
see it just does the black bar is the
top and bottom just like the iPhone 5
inside it's not me if I processor plays
game it's really well basically an
iPhone 4s in a much smaller tidier
package without any cellular
connectivity one really interesting
feature is here on the back it's called
the iPod Touch loop it's just a little
silver button you push it it pops out
and then you can attach one of these
little lanyards to it Apple's also
updated the cameras on the iPod touch

illuminated camera with flash and on the
front there's a 720p front-facing camera
for video calls and faced on Apple's new
