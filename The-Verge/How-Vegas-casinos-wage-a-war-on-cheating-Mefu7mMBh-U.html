place set up this game they made the
rules
they provide the equipment they provide
the dealer and they're basically saying
come on in and try to beat us any time
there is an opportunity someone is out
there that's going to try and take
advantage of that opportunity whether
that's a poker table a slot machine or a
table game we're gonna know who you are
if you're a bag if you're not a bad guy
we I don't care who you are but if
you're the bad guy we're gonna catch you
always been interested in finding ways
to make money by playing games or
basically ways to make money without
actually getting a job there's a lot of
work to beating games an awful lot of
work people who get paid to catch bad
guys are getting paid whether they catch
them or not
the cheats don't get paid unless they
figure it out so they're motivated
1962 the only state in the United States
that allowed gambling was Nevada
gambling was a much smaller industry a
much smaller business much more run by
the mob and kind of shady characters but
there was there was a lot of cheating
that went on in 1962 Thorpe wrote a book
explaining how players could use this
card counting system that he devised to
actually get an advantage over the house
and it was the first book that actually
gave players an edge at the game of
blackjack and suddenly when people
learned there was a way to beat a casino
game everybody wanted to do it and the
casinos just made money hand-over-fist
because people couldn't do it
you know advantage players are not
cheats so we don't treat them like
cheats they're just I've been an
advantage player I played blackjack
whole card I've card counted I don't do
it anymore just because I don't have the
time or the bankroll my wife and
daughter seem to that
I'm going to give you guys a little tour
of some of the gadgets and devices that
cheaters have used throughout history to
win money at poker blackjack craps other
card and dice games all of the world
this probably won more money than any
other single device in history with the
exception of marked cards it's a chip
Cup that's not really a stack of chips
it's a hollow shell that chips can hide
inside but it is a device that uses the
Trojan horse principle it allows us to
shuttle money back and forth across the
table these are actually weighted dice
you can't really hear a difference when
they roll if you handle dice a lot you
could probably feel a difference I can
tell when I pick these up instantly I
know that they're loaded I don't
necessarily know what they're loaded for
but I know that they're heavier than 3/4
inch casino dice should be a lot of the
stuff I have in this room may have been
used in the casino world at one time but
these days the private game world is
where most of the money is as far as
cheaters are concerned most cheaters
just aren't willing to go up against the
modern surveillance systems and the
modern security devices that they have
in the casino
this is our surveillance room we're
pretty proud of the room we've done a
lot of things here they're kind of
innovative we've been open three years
but we're still pushing the envelope on
the new things we bring in this is the
future right here and this is just the
beginning of the future with these
cameras so um this camera goes back
seven days and it's a forensic tool what
we use it for is to follow people who
were here three days ago five days ago
seven days ago it doesn't matter when
they were here as long as we have the
video we're gonna be able to track every
step they made in this casino with just
about 50 cameras so wherever that
person's going we'll follow them and
look at the shot we have there and
there's other things we can do then the
facial recognition technology has pushed
OCR even further than we thought we can
actually read the cards now the suit you
saw the 1080p camera we can see it with
our human eye and silk and software so
I'll be able to track the skill level of
every blackjack player that walks into
this building that's what's coming next
we do have staff that monitor
continually the what's going on with
technology what's going on with risks
with technology right now and what our
methods of penetration we do have
ethical hackers on staff who stay
conversant in that particular area just
to stay on top of you know could it be
possible to hack into Vegas at present
I'm not aware of a significant presence
of hackers or of any and hackers you
know folks from outside trying to
remotely perform some nefarious activity
on a gaming system the the Rings of
cheats that we typically see involve the
physical realm where you have people
trying to take advantage of the slot
machine itself we you know that's
typical fortunately I believe the gaming
devices themselves are pretty
bulletproof and that it requires a
significant level of
illusioned to do anything with a gaming
device so we have over 700 fixed cameras
that are in over 350 PT Z's and you can
see they're all focused primarily on
games because that's what I'm interested
in if someone's going to beat us that's
where the money is that's where I've got
to have my focus I don't how about
baccarat what we're looking for there we
look for past posting we look for a lot
of different things here we look for the
bets being switched which we've caught
the casinos we look for players
introducing their own cards perhaps we
look for players dealers doing a fall
shuffle like the Tran organization
you've probably heard about we look for
players with a camera in their palm that
will fan the cards when they cut and
then gather the sequence of the cards
and then they download that into their
iPhone come back a few minutes later
with all the data and they know how to
bet every hand twenty hands in a row
they win every hand it's not just the
cameras it's the data and cameras now
are data so it's all data it's just
learning to understand that data is
important
we're here at the Consumer Electronics
Show in Las Vegas Nevada we're about to
take a walkthrough on the showroom floor
and see what kind of objects or devices
we can find that could be used to cheat
at gambling so when I look at something
like this I don't see a cheating device
yet but I see a cheating device a couple
of years from now and maybe there's a
company out there that's already got one
can we get rid of these wires and can we
build it into the frame of the glasses
because once you've done that it's there
and now you have some potential because
now all you're doing is filming
something gin rummy bridge poker
blackjack games where our decisions
really matter all you're talking about
at the end of the day now is information
if I know your whole cards I'm going to
be you know if I know what's coming on
the flop I'm going to beat you so it's
all information transfer and that's all
everything in this room does is move
information from one place to another
information management is all it is at
the end of the day
I've had a lot of people asked me what
draws me to all of this stuff and at the
end of the day there is some sort of
kind of cool James Bond and Q quality to
some of these devices you know I think
most of us have seen a James Bond movie
were desmond llewelyn der whoever's
playing Q these days pay attention
double-oh-seven and he shows him the
watch with the laser beam and there's
something in in all of us that kind of
goes like to have one of those and you
know you kind of have to leverage that
with the fact that most of this stuff
has been designed to rip people off so I
don't necessarily approve of the
morality of these devices but I approve
of the ingenuity of these devices I
think most people feel that if you can
find a way to beat a casino more power
to you most people respect it doesn't it
doesn't matter who they are we're never
going to be ahead that's just the way it
is the cheats may succeed but once they
do it then we go full in anyway if it
happened at another property we're going
to know everything about it and stop it
here I think almost everybody has a
certain amount of compulsive gamble in
them I mean life itself is a gamble you
get out of bed in the morning it's a
gamble you have no idea you know if you
you go you find a new job that's a
gamble you get married it's a gamble you
have kids it's a gamble you you buy a
dog it's a gamble everything you do in
life is gambling it's you know it's it's
it's not the same as drinking where you
don't have to drink to live you have to
gamble to live you have to take a chance
you got to take a risk and anybody who
thinks like you know yeah but if what if
I could do it good enough to make my
everybody fuck would find that
attractive it's like gee that's like the
ideal lifestyle I can go play cards and
go home with money in my pocket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
