and I'm here at the New York Auto Show
standing in front of probably the most
exciting thing we're going to see this
week the New York concept from Genesis
Genesis is a new brand they were spun
off out of Hyundai at the Detroit Auto
Show where they introduced the G 90
which we're standing right next to as
well just a luxury sedan nothing really
out of the ordinary but the New York
concept is something totally different
this is supposed to represent the soul
of the Genesis brand which is important
because we don't really know much about
the Genesis brand yet they're brand new
now I think this is one of the most
beautiful cars of the show this year
even if you don't think that it's
definitely one of the most striking and
for a lot of different reasons it's got
this powder blue paint job
this copper trim all around the car
these cheesegrater vents on the side and
then the interior is crazy as well
there's a really big touchscreen panel
right up in front of the driver there's
this f1 looking steering wheel there's
just a lot of details here that you
wouldn't really expect from a newer
brand doing their first big concept car
now this is a concept car so we're
probably never gonna see it on the road
but it does inform what Genesis cars
might look like and how they might
behave going forward and that helps
because we already knew a little bit
about what Genesis wants to do we knew
in Detroit that by 2020 they want to
have six cars on the road and the next
ones would be the G 80 and the g 70
those are going to both be sedans today
we learned that they want to release a
crossover and SUV as well how much of
the New York concept makes it into all
those cars over the next couple years is
something we'll have to wait and see but
if this is what the future of Genesis
looks like I'm definitely interested for
more here the New York Auto Show
definitely go to the verge calm but also
