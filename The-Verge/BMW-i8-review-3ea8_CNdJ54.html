to come out of Munich in a very long
time
powered by precise combination of
electricity and fossil fuel this insane
machine brushes up against $150,000
this is the future of BMW this is the i8
you
it's just like it's like the car is like
from the future right like it doesn't
feel like a BMW it doesn't feel like
anything else I've ever been in or
around it just like feels like from
another dimension
it's like he was telling it in from
another dimension and now I'm driving it
if you weren't told that it was a hybrid
you could conceivably believe that you
were just driving like a nice sports car
if it just feels like really rock solid
everything feels like it's constructed
immaculately everywhere you looking and
around the i8 there are bits and pieces
of technology that are going to find
their way into the company's entire
lineup over the coming years one way or
another take the cars frame for instance
it's made of something called carbon
fiber reinforced plastic CFRP and it's
significantly lighter than the metals
found in a typical car you can see bits
and pieces of CFRP when you open the eye
it's exotic scissor doors and trunk it's
a dark woven material that you don't
really see on many other cars one
notable exception is the I is little
sibling the i3 in fact in many ways the
i8 is rolling ad for the far more
attainable i3 which starts at about 41
grand
then there's the drivetrain the i8 is a
gas-electric hybrid that's powered by an
electric motor in front a three cylinder
engine in the back you can run it on
electric power alone all the way up to
75 miles an hour if you like but when
you pair them together you get a total
357 horsepower that's not really up to
supercar standards but then again this
isn't about making the fastest exotic on
the block
that was they just throw a v10 or 12 in
there and call it a day one thing that
sets the i8 apart from your average
supercar is that it has an electric
motor driving the front two wheels and
then the relatively well not relatively
very small three cylinder turbocharged
engine in the back driving the rear
wheels and so you end up with an
all-wheel drive system and you can set
it into electric-only mode and you can
also set it into a power mode that keeps
both the electric and the the gas engine
turned on at all times for maximum power
it definitely feels a little different
from your average car but it's
surprisingly poised and for lack of a
better word normal
I think that you could get into this car
having driven pretty much any sports car
or GT and feel right at home at this and
in this and not feel like you're missing
anything right now of course since we
have this parking lot to ourselves we're
operating in sport mode which is the the
highest performance mode that the car
has so let's have some fun
okay
by it is by no means the fastest car you
can buy but it's not slow I'm definitely
going to pick when this is over BMW
claims zero to 60 in 4.2 seconds which
puts in the upper echelon of sports cars
that's particularly impressive when you
consider the tiny 3 cylinder twin-turbo
engine spooling up just a few feet
behind you to make sure that the i8
sound lives up to its image engine
sounds are piped into the cabin I can't
really tell what's real and what's fake
but I do know that the car sounds great
throaty powerful like there's a v8 or
v10
there are a lot of beautiful cars in the
world but this one's different
I won't even really call it beautiful at
least not in the traditional sense its
technological it just looks like it's
full of patents and gadgets and doodads
and I think everyone on the road agrees
driving the i8 is a social experience
you can't stop for food or gas or really
much of anything
without people stopping by to check it
out something about those scissor doors
I think which don't really serve any
function look you look awesome
the insane taillights low aggressive
stance and the tricolor paint scheme
don't hurt either it's been possible to
do anything without attracting attention
we had not one but few state troopers
stop their patrol units fast about it
one got in the car it's basically a feat
of gymnastics to climb in and out that's
partly because the i8 is still low to
the ground but it's also because there's
a wide tall sill at the bottom and an
open door at the top you kind of have to
get one leg in sit on the sill scooch
over and pull the other leg in if you
want to drop into your fancy ride
without looking like a fool on the way
out you have to remember to reverse the
process otherwise you'll end up with a
hand on the pavement as you flop out of
the car
fortunately once you're inside you don't
really ever want to get out it's a
comfortable cozy futuristic environment
doesn't necessarily look as fancy as you
might expect on a car that's expensive
but it's not bad at night light pipes
all around the console and doors can be
configured to glow blue orange or white
gets a lot to the Future car feel
directly ahead of the driver of full LCD
takes the place of a traditional
instrument cluster this is becoming
pretty commonplace nowadays and a colour
heads-up display up in the windshield
means that you never really need to look
down behind you there are technically
rear seats but don't take them too
seriously there's no real chance of a
full grown adult
ever sitting back here you could stash a
child or two in a pinch
bottom line I was really sad to give
back the i8 after three days on the road
it feels poised and balanced and with a
low center of gravity as a good sports
car should it feels really solid and it
feels like a tour meaning that you could
take it on a road trip and not want to
kill yourself after a few hours either
through engine noise or vibration or
this harsh road feel it's comfortable
but still sporting I can't get enough of
the engine noise and I still can't tell
what's real and what's fake but I don't
care because it just sounds dope and and
I've you know I've heard the car go by
as a bystander and and it sounds good
from the outside too so yeah as you say
it's music to my ears it just it sounds
great with a gun to my head I'm not sure
it's the first car would buy with
$150,000 to spend but it's still
incredible display of a lot of
cutting-edge car tech in one place
if the i8 is a little peek into the
future of driving company in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
