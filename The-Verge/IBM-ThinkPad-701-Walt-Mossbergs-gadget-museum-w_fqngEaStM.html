some ways clever laptop I ever reviewed
and you might say looking at how thick
it is and I'm telling you it's heavy you
might say what I'm Walt Mossberg I have
been reviewing tech gadgets since the
early 90s and collecting them since the
80s and I wanted to show you some of my
collection this is the IBM ThinkPads 701
and it's in the Museum of Modern Art
we're here at Epcot Center to show you
this powerful new system it weighs a
mere 4.5 pounds and it measures a
diminutive nine point seven by seven
point nine by one point seven inches
came out in 1995 and here's what's
interesting about it it was
state-of-the-art digital technology at
the time it came out but this piece of
mechanical technology is what made this
special when you opened it the keyboard
expanded boom the trouble with most
notebooks this size is that most hands
are this size that's why we created the
four and a half pound think pad 701 and
it solved a really important problem
that people in the early days of laptops
felt very strongly about which was these
keyboards are too small
we really are used to the keyboards we
have on our desktops and we want
something bigger but we don't want to
carry around something this wide this
giant so IBM solve it with this they
drop this whole idea a couple years
later the screens got bigger so you
didn't need the butterfly keyboard
anymore because you you had the width I
gave this model this butter butterfly a
keyboard and pad a great review I've
been
I remember took out ads quoting my
review bragging about their innovation
it's really a seriously well thought out
mechanical engineering marvel</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
