david pierce and fun fact christopher
columbus was terrified of flying that's
why he always chose to travel by boat
this is 90 seconds on the verge the
long-rumored HTC One max is finally
official and the rumors were pretty much
spot on the smartphone is essentially a
5.9 inch version of HTC's flagship but
with the power button now on the side
and a fingerprint scanner on the back
unfortunately we found that taking the
HTC one's great design and making it
bigger a lot bigger didn't always work
for those in the US the one max will
likely arrive in november on verizon and
sprint street artist banksy continued
his new york art show with perhaps his
most unique work yet an art stand was
covertly set up selling banksy's
stenciled work for only sixty dollars a

Kubrick intended for Terry Gilliam to
direct the film a fact Gilliam didn't
know until after Kubrick's death no
words still on 2002 a space alien no
words still on spartacus two electric
boogaloo no words still on a clockwork
banana no word still on the shining to
to shine and that's it for today's top
stories coming up tomorrow I find out
that after discovering America
Christopher Columbus did not direct rent
or I love you Beth Cooper so why are we
celebrating the same</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
