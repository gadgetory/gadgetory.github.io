at CES 2014 I got Matt Rogers co-founder
of nest matt has brought us a fire truck
we got a fire truck here is the best
thing ever i honk the horn earlier and
now I don't have any experiences left to
have why on earth do you have a fire
because it's awesome it is ok which
engineers do not have a fire truck yeah
this is the best thing way we talk about
fire safety we take kids for rides we
show up at schools and wholly evil
locations and talk about the product to
talk about fire safety yeah so you
actually there's like demos and stuff on
the side right yeah like ESO weekly demo
the products Joe some cool features we
have like firemen suits and hats for the
kids to play with Wow t-shirts it's all
good stuff I mean I really want one they
let me let off the siren earlier and I'm
gonna do it again I just want everyone
anymore so Matt why doesn't have to come
CS so we do a lot of means that see ya
so it's kind of the one time of the year
where every vendor Under the Sun comes
to one place at one time so like all of
our different chip vendors and
manufacturing partners are all here yes
it seems like the whole nature of the
show is changing its like there was a
minute when everyone was making laptops
in a minute when I'm
fownes minute when I was writing tablets
and this year it's sort of like sensors
for phones and tablets you already have
right and a lot of ways nest is like
part of that sensor network right so do
you see that like it's a big trend here
are you part of it well you see a lot of
smart home stuff and there's a lot of
noise but in the end there's a lesson
there's lots of coming out and I feel
like what kind of dawn is something new
and it's not like a immediate thing I
think over the next five to ten years
we're gonna see a lot of cool
interactive devices again it's thinking
it's still early days now so you just
launched your second device to protect
right yeah yeah we love it's about two
months ago how's it going I mean it's
going really well the one that's selling
very well like we're a top seller in
Amazon we're kicking butt in home depot
and apple stores all those kind of
things but it's also working it's saving
lives like we actually got an email from
one of our customers saying they never
had a settle on before but they
bought nests protected they actually had
a carbon dioxide alert and they left the
house they called the fire department
and they had a real emergency really
late they had like 10 times the safe
limits and it because it could hide so
it's a serious product and it works uh
so that's actually when you were
launching it we were doing a big story
before it was launched I asked you you
know the thermoset you get to play this
at all time it's a toy in a protecting
kind of malice feeling you wait for a
kind of something bad to happen our
customers like seeing it that way
they're mounting it they feel safer you
have all these features in it to like
sort of interact with you all the time
are they asking for more feedbacks so we
get a lot of feedback for more actually
the biggest thing we get is more ties in
with our old product without thermostat
so today you have this feature where it
turns off the furnace if there's carbon
oxide the house because first can't
generate yeah
uh also we have this feature where it
basically they tie together for on our
way so if you're in one room in the
house your thermostat doesn't see you
next protect I'll see you but that's all
we've done to date and there's a lot
more we could do we actually have a
temperature sensor humidity sensor nets
protect now why couldn't that be
communicated the thermostatic candy just
things we going to do there's lots of
more ways to tie those two products
together and then there's a whole wide
world of other products and you
announced some stuff but you know
there's a lot of there's a lot of
question marks over whether nest would
ever open up and like kind of work with
other partners and you recently
announced you're going to start doing
that so are you seeing anything great
it's CS that like what makes you excited
for what could happen smart hub in
general in the definitely is actually
see we do it with with something
Phillips you guys yesterday to talk it
through like what things we do gather
there there's a lot of really
interesting stuff and I love you saw the
Mercedes booth but there's a tie-in
there were like your car now tells nest
it's coming home yeah so like ties in
like that I think could be really cool
and I could use her features it's not
about creativity for creativity's sake
it's about adding some cool stuff that
users can appreciate so I asked you if
you put in all these sensors on my
smarts in your house how do you guys
think about like security right like I I
can control my parents thermostats at
will and I'm always like I should just
turn them up all the way let you guys
worry about that aspect of it like once
you have more sensors and more cameras
and more whatever in your house how do
you sort of lock things down to make
sure that everything is safe and secure
so we actually worry about it a lot yeah
to the point where sometimes we do
things that are a little bit more
difficult because it's for security and
privacy reasons like for nest protect
and you installed it it asks you to scan
a barcode not just to kind of connect to
its network and the reason we do that is
going to make sure it's you who are
installing it not your neighbors turn
their kind of hack into your system so
we actually put a lot of time and
thought into this we use all these
encryption protocols and we actually go
above and beyond to make sure this stuff
is secure we have to if we don't again
like your parents he could get turned up
and that would be horrible and I'm doing
agent of constant look and I had
temperature troll my parents that's a
phrase that you should use control I do
it constantly
time and so that was actually another
thing I was selling his story before I
saw the interview there's you guys are
still kind of teaching your users how
the products work right so i went home
over the holidays my parents program was
like wild swings like my mom turned all
the way up to 80 my dad will turn all
the way down to 60 and that's just like
it kind of didn't understand it
you had a big base of early adopters who
kind of understood the stuff I think
it's a challenge or smart up in general
you've got a big base of early adopters
who have like control for and like they
want the stuff and gadget heads like fun
i can just buy one thing but you got it
there's the big broad market app and
it's still learning how the technology
integrates how do you go after that like
in terms of there's a lot of costs there
so we have a lot of work to do in terms
of explain the features and letting
people know what nuts does so I think
for the most part people aren't even
aware of who nesters yet really like in
a tech community people know who nest is
I think the broader you know population
it's no idea who we are and where that
is you know learning is a difficult
concept to understand and part of this
we have to get the word out and we're a
new company well there's getting the
what happen there's also like you know
wearables our big story at the show and
I think the biggest the roadblock to
wearing something anybody's it has to
provide you with benefit that's worth
the cost like glass the cost is you look
like a huge dork and the benefits are in
line right the benefits are in line you
don't get something out of being a huge
dork all the time you like take a
picture that's kind of not worth it all
the time with stuff in the house it's
like well I've got to replace all of my
light switches and that's a big cost
with an ass tits and pretty low cost
like it's a great product and you can
insult really easily i installed mine in
like 20 minutes right but once you kind
of get beyond that set of products
you've got to start telling people what
the benefits of these extra costs are
exist at a challenge for you and home
people eager for I think people are
pretty eager and what we seen was helped
us get more mass is actually utility
partnerships and regain the product and
getting people to understand what are
the energy savings is you can save a lot
of money with nest and it's about
getting that word out and you know again
there's a lot of work we need to do in
terms of making it easier to use making
learning more efficient so that you
don't have to think of that how it works
you just use it but you know this is
this is a good early days yeah them in
that it's funny because you see I I see
it CS like the halls every Hall is
popular different times it's like five
years ago this alcohol was all Intel and
Microsoft and then right now it's all
the device manufacturers sort of in the
middle and then you see the car
companies
they're north hall and like in five
years the North Hall be the most popular
one there's a car coming to doing crazy
stuff what I don't see is anywhere where
like a unified home they all there's
bits and pieces everywhere there's no
standards to talk to each other and you
kind of locked into one ecosystem or
nest only has two products you're
waiting for them to have more how do you
see that kind of network how do you make
it so that all these things and talk to
each other people have like choice no
market or is that not something you guys
really worried about so what we think
about it is there are standards today
yeah but there are multiple stand being
standard so it's really hard to pick one
for the other I mean form a user's
perspective they shouldn't care what
communication standards that companies
used as long as the products work
together right so the way we think about
it is let's find some really high value
prox and work with those guys and build
out really obvious experiences that
people can understand so like Philips
here like what if the lights get turned
on when you leave home like really
obvious stuff but that's the kind of the
important things like it's less
important about like tying all these
things together and having one app just
let's make it work together right but
does not like with the hue it's to me
that he was crazy because it's light
bulbs not switches and I I kind of in my
mind can't understand why people are
more willing to change a lightbulb than
they are to like change a light switch
but they are like absolutely the entire
market has gone to light bulbs and it's
like I look at nest and you guys are
reinventing these all my products like
that's the line you always say Tony
always says but I don't see I'm always
curious like where you guys see the next
one
it's always the question I know you're
not we probably answer but I always see
in terms of how you think about the next
one is it where the market is not gone
or is it where the market is rapidly
expanding like you know you surprised
everybody at the thermostat but people
aren't going to be surprised anymore
like Samsung's here right there trying a
bunch of stuff LG's here Sony's here
they're all trying a bunch of stuff
where do you see like the market really
going in terms of smart do you think
it's a broad penetration it's like going
to happen everywhere from every company
or is it going to be kind of selection
benders so so I think it should be
pretty broad any company that makes home
appliances today in the next five years
will build a connected appliance yeah
that said there's not a really good
reason to have a connected appliance
yeah I can't think about yeah why don't
we try the texting the washers I have
not but I can imagine tweeting from
refrigerators not too useful yeah like
is that fine an application and that's
it like what's next for us I mean we
have to find other great products to do
like we're going to when we can improve
the proxy already need those are to get
better but to like five is unloved
categories and the we like to find
things that have no innovation where the
people are not like kind of in the Wayne
Gretzky I'll estate to the buck isn't
right yeah what's gonna be right so like
we're not going to follow we're too weak
I look at what you guys do is almost an
extension of the phone like you there's
standalone devices but really there they
become great when you add a phone for
the next
the phone knows like what your sensors
the house for doing what your
temperature is what's going to happen
you can look at all your energy saving
charts do you think the phone is kind of
the central computing device is the
tablet is it the does it still the
laptop so I don't think there's any
central computing device it's definitely
a primary user interface device it's
what you're gonna look at it's the best
way to interact with your house yeah
that said I think the intelligence in
the home has to be distributed amongst
the home okay so if your phone isn't
there it's the worst right like one of
things that we're thinking about is how
do you take advantage of the phone the
hardware you have in your house like
your smoke alarm or your thermostat but
also the cloud and how do you tie all
these things together and make sure they
work seamlessly and when one's there
once when not there has the benefits
were making those kind of things this
has been a most distracting interview
all time because we're in a fire truck
and I've been wanting to lie clean out
the windows and scream I'm in a fire
truck this whole time and thank you very
much for letting me ride your flytrap
matte blush bronzer great this is the
best
daddy
that's the best thing I've ever done it
is the best thing I've ever done okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
