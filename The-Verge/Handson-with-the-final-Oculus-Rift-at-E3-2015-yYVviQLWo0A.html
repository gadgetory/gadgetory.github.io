at the final oculus rift that's going to
be shipping early next year
the final oculus rift looks quite a bit
like the prototypes that we've been
seeing for the past year but
everything's better it's a lot more
sturdy it feels like an has higher
resolution wider field of view than the
development kit everything about it's
just a little bit more polished and a
little bit more like the kind of thing
that you can put on and you don't have
to be a big VR enthusiast to think oh
this is pretty great it's actually
coming with an Xbox gamepad which is
something that they announced last week
which has managed to work really well
but not because the Xbox gamepad is
somehow magical but because they've
managed to design a really good catalog
of games that gets around sort of the
the motion sickness and the problems
that just playing a normal game in VR
can give you ever since the second
development kit the oculus rift has used
what's called a positional tracking
camera which is this right here and it
tracks sensors in the rift headset so it
can see where your head is the original
riff could just tell sort of what
direction you're tilting your head in
and now you can actually lean over you
can look over something and see what's
going on it actually helps cut down on
the motion sickness quite a bit it also
lets you do some really cool things with
worlds in the oculus rift it's like
being able to actually lean over a table
instead of just moving around it with a
controller so like I said the oculus
rift is going to ship with an Xbox one
controller but that's not the final game
plan these are prototypes for what's
called the oculus touch which is a
handheld motion controller that's a
little bit like the Wii Nunchuk if it
actually worked really well it's
essentially a very simple controller
that runs very heavily on these triggers
that kind of mimic the motion of your
hand this is basically a controller
designed to tell when you're making a
fist it has sensors on this trigger and
on this analog stick right here that can
actually tell when your
touching them so you don't have to clamp
down on it for it to tell how your hands
are moving it can actually tell if
you're sticking your thumb up and it
will give you a thumbs up we got to try
it out on what they were calling a toy
box which is just throwing a bunch of
things around and even though I have a
couple of little glitches overall the
whole thing tracked incredibly well it's
a huge improvement over just hand motion
controls like the Kinect because it's
really really precise and being able to
just click a button instead of trying to
make a fist and have it recognize that
fist it gives you a lot of very fine
control that we haven't quite managed to
do with just camera detection yet if
you're excited about using these you're
gonna have to wait a little bit longer
than for the oculus rift the rift comes
down in the first quarter of 2016 and
this isn't out until sometime in the
first half we also don't know how much
it will cost but and again we don't know
how much the wrist is going to cost
either or even the exact date that it's
coming out so there's a lot that we're
still waiting for here but this is the
first time we've actually gotten to try
out more or less what people are going
to be seeing when they buy the wrist
next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
