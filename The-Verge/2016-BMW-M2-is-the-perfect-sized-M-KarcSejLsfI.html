standing in front of the BMW m2 coupe
now if your BMW enthusiast or just a
performance car enthusiast you're very
excited about this car and you have been
for a long time it was actually
announced back in October this is the
first time we're seeing it in the flesh
though the reason people are so excited
is because over the years the 3-series
and now the four series and the m3 and
m4 have gotten progressively larger and
heavier over time so they're not really
the small light performance coupes they
used to be the m2 is a smaller car so it
gets BMW back to the place that it used
to be with the m3 the car has 365
horsepower which is more than the e46 m3
just about a decade and a half ago so
you can see how performance kind of
changes over time it gets us back to
that level it's going to start around
51,000 dollars a little bit over that
not bad for what you're getting and it
looks beautiful it's so much more
shapely than the standard too a lot of
fans of the 1m which is the previous
version of this car made in very limited
numbers a generation ago and now we have
this version I think it's a proper
successor they did all the right things
here looks great inside and out
launching this spring in presumably very
limited numbers so if you want one move
quickly
that's it for now from the Detroit Auto
Show we are here at the BMW booth but
there's gonna be a lot more from all
over the floor check out our youtube
