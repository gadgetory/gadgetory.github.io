here to the event at GDC 2013 for the
gamestick it's a $79 Android portable
gaming console the plugs into the back
again TV was integrated controller we're
taking a look here at the UI that's a
very minimalist and Queen laid out right
here featured as the as the games to
explore plane out here this is the games
that are actually downloaded onto your
game sticker so she can play it has
eight gigs of flash storage built in and
also to go over here it also features
media settings it has netflix it has
XBMC as you can looking at some video
stuff as well that's pretty cool there's
two different controllers they had a
tonight they had a the dev unit which is
going to be going after developers this
week and also a aesthetic prototype for
the final design ones that's going to be
shipping out to X or Kickstarter backers
next month that one in the white version
let's jump into a game here this game is
actually ported over to the gamestick
the company's basic trying to bring a
lot of elvers on board they hope to have
about 20 to 30 games ready for the
device from the ship's the Kickstarter
backers next month right now we
unfortunately weren't able to go and use
the the dev control it's not actually
working with the games to get set up
today so we're using a nyka wired
controller today the real deal will use
bluetooth to interact with the game
stick itself and of course the a
controller has a slot that features that
allows the gamestick a slot inside of it
when you're good to go so we give me
some tutorials here so I don't go in do
too terribly here I'm jumping across the
building here
so it's actually pretty nice experience
know if you're feeling of the game or
not but it's fun there something that's
very very definitely fun about some of
these portal android consoles similar to
the you yet there's a retro feel to them
it makes them nearly really fun as we're
kind of own sub-genre of console and
there I'm dying that was ugly you go
again mr. by sexy undercuts Dewey about
a sitting and dollar price point it's
not clear when it's gonna be shipping
out to consumers with a full version yet
but obviously we'll be keeping an eye on
this is the play jam gangsta</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
