OnePlus is a company
that has really built up
a cult following over the years.
Their shtick has always been making phones
that don't cost as much as
a typical iPhone or Galaxy,
but do punch way above their weight class.
This year, with this
phone, OnePlus decided
to just go all-out and make a flagship.
But it's still a little bit
cheaper than the competition.
And you know what?
They've pretty much pulled it off.
(relaxed electronic music)
So, right at the jump,
here are the prices.
The base model is $670,
the middle one is $700 —
and that's the one that
T-Mobile is selling —
and then there's a top-end
spec beast for $750.
They come in gray, almond,
and this one, nebula blue.
The 7 Pro is a really large Android phone.
Like, kind of huge.
It has a gigantic OLED display.
But the thing that most people
are probably going to notice
about it is the selfie camera,
which pops up with a
little motor, like this.
Okay, sorry, yeah.
I'm going to come back to cameras, I promise,
because the thing that
you are going to notice
every day is this screen.
It is stupendous.
OnePlus calls it &quot;Fluid
AMOLED,&quot; which, fine, whatever.
But they can't decide
whether it's 6.67 inches
or 6.46 inches because it's different
depending on whether or not
you count the rounded corners.
Fine.
It's also super tall, with
a 19.5:9 aspect ratio.
Look, it's just really big
is what I'm getting at.
But what's special about
it is that it not only goes
edge to edge, but it also curves
around the sides just like a Galaxy phone.
And just like a Galaxy
phone, it looks great.
It gets really bright,
and it gives you lots
of options for calibrating the colors.
There's no notch, of course, thanks
to that pop-up selfie camera.
But OnePlus has included a feature
that's still pretty rare on phones:
a high, 90Hz refresh rate.
I know you can't really see it
on the video here, but
in person it's awesome.
It's the thing that
instantly separates the 7 Pro
from almost every other phone,
except for weird gaming phones.
And the 7 Pro will ratchet
that refresh rate down
in apps where it doesn't make sense,
like when you're watching
videos for example.
The resolution of the screen will also
dynamically ratchet itself down
to match the video content.
While the phone has Quad
HD, it's 3120 by 1440,
it will drop down to
1080p when it needs to
in Netflix or YouTube.
There's also a Night Mode,
it blocks blue light,
and there's a Reading
Mode that gray scales
the entire screen.
You might think that some of this stuff
is a little gimmicky, but
it kind of does matter.
I really did use the Reading Mode
and I definitely notice the
smoothness when I'm scrolling.
I'm spending a lot of time
talking about the screen
because, like I've said
in previous videos,
that's what you have to
do with top-tier phones.
You're spending a lot of
money and you want the thing
that you're looking at
all the time to look good.
This screen looks great
and it has features
you can't get on even
more expensive phones.
Also, under that screen is another one
of my favorite features,
the fingerprint sensor.
It's way faster and more reliable
than last year's OnePlus
6T, and it's also way faster
than the Galaxy S10's ultrasonic sensor.
OnePlus stuck with an optical sensor,
but it made it much bigger
and more responsive.
The screen does have to
light up to scan your thumb,
so that looks a little bit weird,
and you might have
issues with wet fingers,
but I haven't had any
problems with it at all.
You can even choose faster animations
if you want to speed it up more.
It's just fast and it's super easy to use.
Thumbs up.
Spec-wise, you've got a
Snapdragon 855 driving the thing.
And depending on which model you buy,
you're going to get 6,
8, or 12GB of RAM.
This one's got 12.
And it's going to have either 128 or 256GB
of UFS 3.0 storage, which is faster
than what you'd get on a lot of phones.
Look, it's fast, the
whole thing feels fast.
And I have had way fewer
app restarts than usual.
Performance is no problem.
The speakers sound okay,
they're much better
than the ones on the older OnePlus phones,
but they do get a little
bit chippy at max volume.
(cheerful music)
&quot;This is a Galaxy Fold.&quot;
Battery life, though, is even better.
I'm getting through a full day super easy
and often a good way
through the second day.
Standby time is also
just ridiculously good,
probably because OnePlus
is a little bit more
aggressive about turning stuff off
when it thinks you're not using the phone.
I really like OnePlus' custom
version of Android, too.
It's called OxygenOS.
It's based on Android
9 Pie, and it's filled
with nice little touches
without being overbearing.
And it gives you a ton
of customization options.
You can set gestures up to get around,
so swipe up for home or swipe
up on the side to go back.
You can turn on a &quot;Zen
mode&quot; that locks you out
of your phone for 20 minutes so you can go
look at a damn tree or something.
(birds chirp)
There are very simple theming options.
There's a game mode
that's way less annoying
than Samsung's game mode.
And there's a screen
recorder, which, thank you.
Why doesn't every Android
phone have one of those?
This is the part of the review
where you say &quot;Dieter,
what about the camera?&quot;
Because that's the rule
with Android phones.
Unless it's a Pixel or a Galaxy,
they fall down on the camera.
The camera's always disappointing, right?
Nope!
I think people are going to be
really happy with this camera.
Actually, all four of them.
There are three on the back.
A standard lens that's
technically 48 megapixels,
but mostly outputs 12-megapixel images
unless you go into a special mode.
There's also an 8-megapixel
telephoto lens
that does 3x zoom, and a 16-megapixel
ultra-wide angle.
And of course, there's
a pop-up selfie camera,
which has 16 megapixels.
Maybe you're worried about
this motorized selfie camera,
moving parts are always
a thing that can break.
OnePlus says it's rated for
300,000 uses, which, okay.
It does auto-retract if it detects
a sudden movement, like a drop.
Sort of like a spooked prairie
dog on top of your phone.
I can't promise you that it won't break,
but it seems fine to me.
The selfie camera, it's not as good
as I had hoped, but it's passable.
You just have to remember
to change the default away
from mirrored selfies
so you're not looking
at your evil twin all the time.
Here's the news for the main camera.
The shots are good, but to my eye,
not quite as nice as a Pixel 3.
But it's very close, and I'm betting
that some people are going to tell me
that they prefer the OnePlus.
It makes different choices.
The images are warmer and just way less
contrasty than the Pixel.
I sort of prefer the Pixel's
sharper look and color choices,
they seem more photographic to me.
But the 7 Pro's main camera is solid.
On a technical level, the telephoto
and wide-angle cameras are
just not quite as good,
but they're a hell of a lot of fun,
especially when you're
outdoors with good light.
You can usually trust them
to get something decent
and I do love having all this versatility.
But if you want the best-quality shot,
you should use the main camera.
The OnePlus 7 Pro also does
a bunch of the camera tricks
that you'd expect on a modern camera.
It does instant HDR by using
all of those 48 megapixels
in parallel instead of sequentially.
It's got a night mode that
brightens things up pretty well,
but it's not the magic
that you're going to get
out of the Huawei P30 Pro
or the Pixel's Night Sight.
Portrait mode is about as good
as everybody else's,
which is to say it's fine
as long as you don't zoom in too much.
And there's a pro mode that I really like.
Now I haven't done a ton of video testing,
but I also haven't noticed anything
really bad with the video, either.
It has OIS and EIS, and it can shoot
up to 4K at 60 fps
or 1080p at 240 frames for slow motion.
Here's the bottom line on the camera:
OnePlus did the thing
that they needed to do,
the camera should not
stop you from buying this.
Okay, but what might stop
you from buying this phone?
Actually, fewer things than I expected.
It doesn't have an IP
rating for water resistance.
OnePlus is trying to do this thing
where they say it's not worth the money
to get the official certification.
But you know what?
It is.
We actually want to know how
scary water is for this phone.
It also doesn't have wireless charging.
OnePlus says it has
this custom Warp charger
that can charge it up
super fast, and it can.
But I like wireless
charging, even if it is slow.
Also, did I mention that it's big?
It's big.
And heavy.
More than anything, that's
probably why it's not for me
and it might be a deal breaker
for a lot of other people.
But if you like big phones,
it should not be a deal breaker for you.
What else?
Oh, there's no headphone jack.
I mean, come on, did you really think
there would be a headphone jack?
So that's the OnePlus 7 Pro.
It's a spec monster.
And sometimes with phones
that are spec monsters,
I get a little bit nervous.
It's often a sign that the fit and finish
end up being an afterthought.
But in a week or so of using this phone,
I didn't feel like OnePlus
really cut that many corners.
The software is really well thought out,
the ringer switch is still
here and I still love it,
and things like battery life, performance,
and camera are all very impressive.
Plus, you know, have you seen this screen?
If you want a big Android phone,
I'm sort of hard-pressed to think
why you'd get a Galaxy
S10 Plus or Pixel 3 XL
instead of the OnePlus 7 Pro.
This has a screen to match
or better those phones
and the cameras are in the same ballpark
and I don't really see a
performance gap, either.
The bottom line is that
the OnePlus 7 Pro proves
that great phones don't
need to cost $1,000.
Hey, thank you so much for watching.
And you know, I think
the story of this phone
was really the screen and the camera.
And let me know in the comments,
which of those is more important to you?
And also, if $700 is too much for you,
we just did a review of the Pixel 3A,
which starts at $400, and you
should check that out, too.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
