here with the gia not 360 and Justin
product manager from gianna it's an
oculus rift compatible it's sort of a
panoramic what's the way I what do you
call this type of footage well it's a
360 degree action camera yeah but not
just 360 because it could be 360 around
but then you can also look up right
exactly so it's not just around it's
also above the the camera as well yeah
um you can't look down cuz it's on a
post but who wants to look at like the
post of the thing is exactly he wasn't
look at your face cool cool yeah so I
mean this is one of the things when the
oculus rift when we first got to look at
it one of the things I was really
excited about was the idea of you know
the demo they put you in a virtual
environment but footage is footage right
so I it seemed really exciting the idea
that you would look around and see
something like an actual environment
which is what this lets you do right
exactly i mean that's one of the things
that is unique about this camera is if
when you're starting to interact with
the video it feels like you're there
yeah so walk me through what's actually
in this thing all right so the camera
has free optics each one's 8 megapixels
it's got its own each has its own Center
the unique thing with this is everything
stitched together on the camera mmm so
it's really easy to use use no need to
muck around with software offers
post-processing it does video at 2k and
photo at 4k oh wow so gives you a lot of
you know great image quality yeah very
simple to use one button for start stop
and then you're connected to computer
afterwards with micro USB cable download
your files and you're pretty much ready
to go awesome getting it how is getting
into the actual oculus rift because I
know a lot of that sort of software
behind it is sort of still being
constructed even on the oculus side yeah
I mean one of the things that we wanted
to ensure was it ease of use so we've
got software at least so you can look it
on your computer on your Mac your PC
we've got an app so you can eat you know
experience that on an ipad iphone
android tablet or device yeah we've got
our own online platform so it's like a
youtube channel but every 60 video
because at the moment you can't share
360 video
very easily yeah and then to get things
on to oculus at the moment we're still
working with oculus to make that really
smooth and simple but by the time this
is shipping we're hoping to have
everything you know seamlessly
integrated so you'll be easy if you use
is just to hook their oculus up and pop
it on and look around yeah totally um
there's mountains behind me that's there
I'm gonna look in here and see them yeah
pop your clothes on and you can awesome
he just like you're in the French Alps
yeah well and so this is this is real
pro excuse me this is real footage that
you guys got of the yeah we got
different scenes ok now I'm moving I'm
looking at the UH ok now i'm not in the
french a your insulin we sent a camera
up into the stratosphere oh ok now yep
like this song wow I'm right I'm right
on the water yep and now you having a
drinking oh yeah the toasting right
above me I don't have any beer though no
this is terrible I'm just oh now i'm
back in the mountains whoa bowling this
is like quantum leap what's happening
right now we're tripping you out now
it's a little yeah it's a little cuz i'm
in one place and then I get pulled right
back okay I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna
unrisked here ah Wow yes a living Wow a
little bit manic but yeah that was
intent I was like a mountain Dew
commercial um that was sweet awesome
okay so if for the less manic version
and for people who don't have the rift
but want to check out these things it's
the ipad is what you were saying yeah i
mean unless you have a rift yeah the
most immersive experience and the
interactive experiences with some type
of smart device which you know your
iPhone your iPad tablet something like
that and of that you get used gestures
or you can actually move the device so
here we've got a time lapse of San
Francisco well with a normal camera you
just get this type of scene which we can
see here you're just looking straight
ahead but actually you can move around
mmm and look at what was going on around
you while you're waiting for that
trolley yeah you know we're gonna jump
on in a second now we're on it right at
us yes exactly but you can actually you
can pick this up and if you move the
device
yeah it moves with you so when do you
think you'll ship we're actually taking
like pre-orders at the moment so
customer oh okay can reserve a camera
and we're hoping to ship in the coming
months we haven't got an exact date or
just oh yeah so fine tuning final
production yeah you want to leave some
mystery exactly exactly how much damage
will only set you back 499 okay in the
US that's not that much more than your
GoPro no but it can do a hell of a lot
more than a GoPro yeah well and so I
mentioned the GoPro because it has that
same mount right so anything that
exactly one of the things we decided to
do was use a mounting system that would
work with GoPro accessories but we've
also got our own accessories as well
okay so but if you've invested in a
GoPro and you've bought hundreds of
dollars worth of accessories yeah you
can just clip it on and you ready ready
to go yeah or you've got like a GoPro
ready drone right that's what I thought
if I'm like I'm gonna you know yeah I
mean we've had this up we've had this up
on the on the quad copters all the
drones and you get some pretty cool
footage so yeah yeah so what elder I
mean what do you think I'm always
curious about the first people to get it
do you think it is it's the GoPro market
it's sort of i'm gonna strap this on
while i'm taking my snowmobile through
this i mean Andie's we're a sports
company okay yeah so obviously we're
targeting that market but there's a lot
of interest from different areas
security military police you know from a
surveillance point of view really yeah I
mean that's an interesting because why
not I mean when it just have like seven
different cameras than they don't
connect at all no all i care about is
like that they'll like rye information
no but its ease of use as well hmmm and
it's also the size so well and that's
you know defense that's a hell of a
markup that's good yeah well and I mean
political stuff like in you know
important events right like if you could
be on stage the inauguration or you can
be on you know you can be there when
this big important speech is happening
right like just the sort of c-span level
of you know you can now we can make it
we can put this little post up you know
or you know we were carrying around on a
backpack yep um there's a helmet mount
to helmet mount this let's answer we've
got that yeah and then suddenly anyone
who wants to plug into the stream or
watch it after the fact that mean it's
all after the fact now
can plug in and feel like feel like
they're there exactly so this is the
other thing I tip my hand a little bit
but the dream would be live right that
would be awesome of course and it's
probably the number one question we get
asked at the moment is can I do live
streaming on this everything's possible
it's we want to get this one to market
yeah and we're looking at what's coming
in the future and you know how you can
make that nice and easy and get a good
enough call image quality because you
know streaming as well you've got to
think that oh yeah you're pushing a lot
of information and you were saying at
some point again we're dreaming big
you're thinking directional audio might
be yeah I mean your models of course
it's I mean okay we've been talking
about the oculus yeah pop that on you
start looking around but if you could
put on surround sound at the same time
it's that you know I start to hear
things and you you hear a noise on your
left and it'll helps you are there's
something happening i moved to my left
it gets louder and things like that so
yeah we're also dreaming being in you
know we see this is the future of the
way in which you interact with video and
yeah absolutely one cool things for the
audience if they want to play around
with these videos they can actually
download the app we've got all the
videos we've been shooting it up online
okay so it's right play G or not just
pla yge o ni UT or one word ok download
it and then you start to experience that
world yeah and you took it to cool
places well like you someone even
entertains somebody that's never been to
San Francisco yeah well i was gonna say
the alps in Tahiti and well the
wonderful things yes san Francisco's
cool but haha that's not the real here
we've gotta sell it exactly yeah so
someone that's ever been to the French
Alps exact yes see that now you're now
you're getting me okay awesome well
thanks for coming by this is fantastic
rest on my pleasure yeah Cheers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
