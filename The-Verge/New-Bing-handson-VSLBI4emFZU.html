microsoft today rolled out the new Bing
to users worldwide so let's check it out
so let's try a search for Windows Phone
and as soon as the search shows up
you'll see that the new Bing has been
grouped into three columns there's
search nose big nose and friends now so
let's start with search nose so if you
see this is kind of the same blue length
search you've been used to you'll notice
that there's some blank space over here
which Microsoft got rid of last week as
part of the UI update so here's kind of
the same search you've been used to they
tightened up the navigational bars up
top so they're more relevant to exactly
what you're doing and if you scroll down
you can actually see things that friends
on Facebook have liked and that's kind
of the theme here is that the new Bing
is tightly integrated with social and
it's kind of trying to do what Google
did with search plus your world but with
facebook twitter and blogs and google+
as well if you look on the right side of
the page you'll notice this real Metro
strip right here which is the friends
know area and if you see we just
searched for windows phone so if you see
my friend Harry Zhang actually has a
photo of Windows Phone it looks like
it's broken on facebook you can see
chris ziegler likes Windows Phone other
people like Windows Phone and then
people who know which is actually
Microsoft's intelligent algorithm to see
who on Twitter knows something about
Windows Phone so Paul Thurrott knows a
lot about microsoft and windows see he
might be a good person to ask you can
actually see some of his tweets reply
retweet and favorite right within this
screen an activity isn't quite ready yet
but it's supposed to show queries and
questions people have been asking inside
of being on facebook or inside the
search engine the section right here is
called snapshot and it's going to be
rolling out over the next few weeks and
it's going to show data just like what
you'd be used to seeing in the search
area like for example New York Knicks
tickets this kind of data like prices
for cars sports scores things like that
like the map of a restaurant you're
going to they're going to show up in the
right sidebar and what Microsoft's
really trying to do is take advantage of
api's like this one to populate data
without owning any of the data like
Facebook or Twitter or something like
that so this is the kind of thing that's
going to show up in that new snapshot
section that isn't available quite yet
and depending on what you search for
this is also where ads are going to show
up either above or below the snapshot
area which is called big nose so
Microsoft is a bunch of scenarios in
mind when you're searching so let's say
you want to know about the strokes you
might want to go to a concert coming up
soon you might want to listen to some of
their music so the first thing you see
is that here's 14-year friends like the
strokes and if you click that you can
see their Facebook page and find out
more but if you go over the right you
can see friends who might know so Jesse
Abrams has photos of the strokes that's
actually pretty cool John likes the
strokes Lyle likes the strokes maybe I
ask these guys about them say should I
go to this concert what song should I
listen to because Microsoft knows that
when you search for something there's
not always an exact answer it might be
more relatives in real life you might
want to ask your friends like Kyle about
strokes if you're really stumped you can
click here ask friends what are the best
songs by the strokes and you can also
attach a link if you want people to
check something out in particular sold
attach their official page so you click
that little link icon over here and you
can attach that and this will actually
post straight to Facebook and when
people post answers then it'll show up
in your activity feed right here if
you're thinking about going on a hot
date to the park don't know what it's
going to be like you can look up Bryant
Park you can see some attractions in
Bryant Park you can see a map this is
one of the things that's going to show
up in snap shot right here once it rolls
out completely and then you look over
stephanie has photos of Bryant Park I
could ask her about what it was like
where I should go so if you want to ask
somebody specific about their experience
listening to a band or going to a park
you can actually click the plus sign
right here and say how was the park and
if you you can add a link hit enter and
Stephanie will be notified this will
show up in her notifications menu on
Facebook just as if she was tagged in a
post or a picture of mine and she can
respond that way another way you might
want to test out the new Bing is by
typing in the name of a restaurant or
let's say
you want new york pizza while like i
said doesn't seem like the API is
working completely yet like nobody's up
here I'm sure some of my friends have
taken pictures of pizza before almost
positive of that none of them are
showing up here but if you look here's
another place that being checks for data
so these are actually places on people
places on Twitter that that is
influential about the topic that you're
looking for so depending on what you
look up certain people and places might
show up like let's say you want to know
more about the verge being actually
intelligently decides who might know
about the virgin it's actually pretty
accurate here you see Ross Paul Chris
Neil I and Josh and I can't promise Josh
would get back to you if you tweeted at
him about his site but you can do it
right from here and see see who's
important you can also see my brother
likes the site and I could ask him about
it Jordan here is actually worked at the
verge so here's another API call for for
where somebody was employed and you can
also see that with something like the
New York Knicks not that any of these
guys are going to tweet back at you but
you got people who know about the next
Jamie Lynn Baron Davis and Tyson
Chandler we hope know about the Knicks
that soccer another thing the new Bing
is useful for is shopping you can see
who owns something that you might want
to get they've taken a picture with it
so if you type in nike shoes you've got
your results here from nike and some
shopping results and if you look to the
right here my friend corey actually has
a photo of nike shoes so this kind of
thing won't always be useful but it's
nice to see Microsoft taking advantage
of Facebook's and Twitter's and other
API is to expand the breadth of social
search so you can really see this data
adding up to something in the long run
and while there isn't much here
Microsoft told us that they're really
interested in expanding to cora linkedin
Foursquare so if you wanted to look up
the name of a restaurant like sunburst
espresso bar you could actually see over
here whose son so and so is checked in
there then you could definitely ask them
about it but as of right now it's pretty
empty so all in all the new Bing is an
interesting take on search and we
actually think they were more successful
than Google with
search plus your world because Bing
simply just brings in more social
networks so we'd use this although it
doesn't really include all the social
data we would expect it to just yet but
microsoft says they're adding hopefully
going to add foursquare linkedin Korra
and other social networks to really make
the search experience even more rich and
since it's not really obtrusive while
you're searching it's a welcome addition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
