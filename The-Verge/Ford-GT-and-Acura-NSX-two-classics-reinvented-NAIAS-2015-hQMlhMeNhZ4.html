here at the Detroit Auto Show this year
is the reinvention of classic exotics
new Ford GT is without a doubt the most
incredible car at the show this year
besides being one of the most legendary
brands in automobiles the GT has a
really interesting back story created in
the 1960s because Henry Ford ii had
wanted to buy ferrari and was ultimately
turned down so he created the GT sort of
as revenge against them and then raced
them at Lala and one and then the second
generation GT which is also here was
created about 10 to 12 years ago as a
successor to that original GT and now we
have the new one all three cars are
amazing in different ways and you can
see that lineage that DNA sort of
continued through all three generations
the new GT has a really small engine a
strangely small engine it's only a 3.5
liter v6 twin turbo which sounds like
something you might find in a family
sedan except in this case it's putting
out over 600 horsepower this car is
striking it is without question the most
insane para visually Ford has ever made
as scissor doors it has deep cuts on the
side almost looks like a Lamborghini
from up from some angles and then on the
back you have these twin tailpipes these
enormous tailpipes that are set between
the taillights from every angle is just
an incredible looking car and then
there's the NSX now this supercar first
began life back in 1990 and that first
generation vehicle was produced until
about 2005 Acura announced in 2007 they
were gonna work on a second generation
car and we're finally here with the
first customers being able to take
delivery of their cars at the end of
2015 the car looks both similar to and
different from what we first saw on
stage back in 2007 as a concept car it
looks wider it looks lower it looks
meaner it looks more aggressive than it
used to which by most accounts is a good
thing there's still a lot of specs about
the new NSX we don't know but what we do
know is very impressive
we have over 550 horsepower on tap and
that's between a twin-turbo v6 and a
free motor electric system it's a hybrid
there's a nine speed dual clutch
transmission and a cool dial in the
center - that lets you switch between a
quiet mode when you don't want to wake
the neighbors all the way up to track
mode for when you're on the track it was
amazing to see the crowds form around
both of these cars immediately after
their introductions the GT the moment
after the announcement was over hundreds
upon hundreds of people just formed a a
perfect circle around the car and the
same thing happened with nsx launch so
there's obviously a lot of hype and a
lot of excitement for these
introductions don't get me wrong there
are a lot of cool things happening here
at the Auto Show this year but if I had
to put my finger on it I'd say that
these two are the defining moments the
defining cars of this year's for Troy
Auto Show so hopefully we'll see more
soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
