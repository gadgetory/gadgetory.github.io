beneath our very feet surviving in some
of the harshest environments they're
solitary and communal elegant and fierce
for our planet is full of gadgets so
come with us as we reveal the
unimaginably diverse world we call
gadget earth there is perhaps no greater
diversity than in the different breeds
of drones from the large and aggressive
to the small and clumsy drones come in
all shapes and sizes and colors here a
DJI drone known mostly for their size
hunts for prey it uses prosumer lenses
for sight giving it the ability to hunt
in high-definition
some drones on the other hand want to be
seen here one dances flamboyantly eager
to catch the attention of a mate another
shows off its intricate moves drones are
quickly dominating the land of gadgets
migrating from their natural habitat of
barren wide-open spaces
and settling instead in our cities and
our parks but drones aren't the only
gadgets that have made their way into
our homes just take a look down these
little gadgets known as Raleigh's have
evolved to move among us they're round
shape allows them to quickly pivot
direction and avoid collision with both
US and themselves some however still
need a little practice it's estimated
that there are already a large number of
small gadgets in homes all across the
United States and that number is only
growing
here a young bot has been separated from
its family lost and confused it
struggles to find its way back while its
family desperately searches alone and in
the sea of people its batteries won't
last the cold night in the vast regions
of the assembly lines we find the
mechanical arms here
their survival hinges upon teamwork from
raising young to gathering food each arm
has adapted to perform an individual
task working together they are able to
procreate rapidly and more efficiently
than most other gadgets it's no wonder
that the mechanical arms have spread so
far across the globe as the micro ions
pass gadgets have evolved becoming
smarter faster and living amongst us
gadgets will continue to change
they'll impress us with their skills and
remind us of their limitations but if
nothing else they have shown us that
they are here to stay on gadget earth
drones will likely become domesticated
maybe even used as messengers given
their ability to move great distances in
a short space of time
