big thing keeping us connected looking
good and making us feel like we're
living in the future at least that's the
promise but though all of the many
smartwatches you can buy right now make
those promises few if any actually
deliver a good SmartWatch does three
things it tells you the time easily so
you don't have to constantly look at
your phone it gives you notifications on
your wrist so you don't have to
constantly look at your phone and it
looks good while doing it so you don't
feel like you're wearing a computer on
your wrist everywhere you go everything
else that many smartwatches attempt to
do is just extra some count your steps
some can be controlled with your voice
and some can run a variety of apps right
on your wrist but the best smartwatches
focus on those core features and don't
worry too much about the extra stuff if
you're looking to buy a SmartWatch right
now
the best option for the most number of
people is the pebble steel the steel is
compatible with both Android and iOS it
doesn't cost a fortune and looks good on
almost anyone's wrist the steals
always-on LCD display makes it easy to
check the time indoors or out and it's
battery life of five days or more is
hard to beat you get notifications for
email texts incoming calls and more and
you can control your music right from
your wrist as well pebble does have an
app store to add more functionality and
custom watch aces to the steel and it
can count your steps as you walk but
neither of those things are as important
as the core functions the steel gets
right which makes it my top pick if
you're looking for more from your
SmartWatch like the ability to talk to
it or send messages from your wrist or
run a variety of apps
Motorola's Moto 360 is the best option
among the many Android wear watches you
can buy today the 360 looks great it's
comfortable to wear and it's not as
large or cumbersome as many other
Android wear watches as a color display
that's visible outdoors as well as
indoors voice controls to quickly reply
to messages without touching your phone
and a built-in heart rate monitor instep
counter the Android wear platform offers
a ton of apps to add more functionality
to the Moto 360 but if you're an iPhone
user none of this is available
to you you can't even use the Moto 360
for basic time and notifications though
google has rapidly updated and improved
Android wear since its debut earlier
this year
it's still not as stable or reliable as
the pebble and it requires more setup
and tinkering from you to get it working
best the Moto 360 display isn't always
on by default requiring more effort to
check the time and its battery life is
less than half that of the pebbles on a
good day fortunately you can charge on
almost any qi wireless charger in
addition to motorola special dock the
rest of the field is dominated by other
Android wear watches from other
manufacturers the second best option is
LG's G watch R which is very similar to
if not quite as good-looking as the
Motorola it really comes down to
personal preference between the two but
most people I've spoken to prefer the
looks of the Moto 360 over the G watch
are the G watch R has a nicer display
and slightly better battery life but you
can only charge you with LG stock so
it's not as convenient as the 360s
wireless charging Samsung's also has its
gear 2 SmartWatch that doesn't run on
Android wear but uses Samsung's own
software platform that limits it to only
Galaxy smartphones and greatly reduces
the number of third-party apps you can
install on it there really isn't a good
reason for anyone to buy a gear 2 at
this point if you're on a tight budget
pebble also offers its classic watch at
half the price of its steel it does all
of the same things as a steel but it's
plastic so it doesn't look or feel as
nice as the steel does there are other
smartwatches that work with both iOS and
Android like meta watches m1 and Ito's
pop and the Martian notifier but none of
them work as reliably as the pebble or
they cost significantly more many people
probably don't have a need for a
SmartWatch but if you're looking to buy
one right now and you're not interested
in waiting to see what Apple and other
manufacturers bring next year the pebble
steel is the best SmartWatch you can buy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
