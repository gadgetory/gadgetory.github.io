thing that's right the cars that float
above the ground could become a reality
I'm Nathan Tsai Kurt and this is 90
seconds on the verge this week at
Bloomberg's next big thing summit in San
Francisco Toyota's Hiroyoshi Yoshiki
confirmed that the company has been
investigating the possibility of
vehicles that hovered just above the
road Yoshiki declined to elaborate on
how far along Toyota was in the
investigation or if it ever plans on
bringing the hover cars to market but he
did make sure to note that these cars
would just float a little bit off the
ground in an effort to reduce friction
and improve efficiency hover cars are a
long-running science fiction trope from
Star Wars to Total Recall and even video
games like f-zero people have dreamed of
floating cars for a long time although
generally speaking they don't fly more
than a few feet off the ground at most
in our efforts to actually build hover
cars dates back decades Curtis Wright
made two working prototypes of the US
military the model 2500 created an air
cushion that lifted 10 to 15 inches off
the ground and had a max speed of 38
miles per hour but the idea was quickly
abandoned since it couldn't really do
all-terrain for more on hover cars check
out the verge coming up tomorrow what up
don't don't say coming up tomorrow it
never happens but think about it it has
happened
remember episode 1 will be back tomorrow
when we're taking a look at hoverboards
they're cool but are they safe yeah by
me hoverboards aren't exactly Nathan
Nathan where is everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
