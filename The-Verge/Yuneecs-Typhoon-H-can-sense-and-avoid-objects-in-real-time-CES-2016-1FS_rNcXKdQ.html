and we are still here at intel's booth
and we are looking at a drone that has
Intel's real sense built in which means
that it has this little sensor on here
that can sense and avoid stuff so if you
look at the screen over here you can see
it's actually it can detect me in real
time and what that means is that this
drone can do sense and avoid which is it
can fire fly around it can follow you
and if something gets in its way it can
automatically dodge to avoid it which is
pretty incredible now Intel demo this
last year but it was on a really
expensive prototype duty but this thing
they say is going to retail for under
two thousand dollars so here at intel's
booth they're also showing it inside
this death cage where it's going to
follow somebody around and maybe avoid
some obstacle so CES is crazy there's a
lot more stuff to look at so you should
definitely subscribe to us here at the
average calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
