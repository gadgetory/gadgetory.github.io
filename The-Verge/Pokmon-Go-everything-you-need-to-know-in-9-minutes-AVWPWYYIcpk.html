of the biggest Pokemon video games of
all time and it's available on iOS and
Android
you're just starting iosing beginner is
just for you and if you're really
obsessed with the game already I've got
the advanced tip to be the very best and
I'll help you conquer the gyms so let's
go Jamal if you're just starting on
Pokemon here are some tips for you first
you'll have three Pokemon and choose
from at the very beginning squirtle
Charmander and Bulbasaur who is the best
but if you really want to pick Pikachu
you can simply walk away from your three
options four times on the fourth time
Pikachu will appear you'll toss a
pokeball at it and you'll have it in
your collection how we're doing you toss
the Polka ball you might ask well it's
quite simple put your finger on the ball
flick it forward there are more advanced
techniques we'll get to those later
every time you catch a Pokemon you'll
get Stardust you know get candies
candies are specific to the type of
Pokemon you have so if you catch a whole
bunch of zubats they're going to have a
whole bunch of svet candies and when you
have enough you can spend those and some
star dust to evolve as you back into a
new creature in this case a goal bat
while you're on your past walking about
you're going to see a little blue post
those are poke a stops I'm going to ever
you visit one you can collect free items
by spinning the little token nearby
these refresh every five minutes so if
there aren't a lot in your neighborhood
you can double back after a while and
collect more stuff we'll get into what
those items do later but for now make
sure that every time you visit your
collecting free things now as you're
playing you might find that the screen
freezes or it doesn't connect to the
internet there are a number of bugs in
this game it's still relatively new but
we expect a lot of those to get fixed in
the coming weeks so make sure to keep
the game updated regularly okay these
are the final and most important tips
for a Pokemon go beginner first get a
battery pack if you can afford it it
will be a huge help you don't want to be
out in the middle of nowhere searching
for a Snorlax only for your battery to
die and you not know how to get home
even if you have the battery pack
conserve your battery if your phone has
the option go into settings
selected power saving mode but only if
it doesn't affect your GPS and inside
the Pokemon app you can select another
power saving mode from settings when you
choose it you'll have the normal phone
screen but if you flip it upside down it
dims the game saving a little bit of
power it'll buzz your phone if a Pokemon
is nearby lastly and here is where I
don't know if I would encourage this but
maybe you're becoming a bit more of a
hardcore gamer you can turn off the AR
mode not seeing a Pokemon and the world
around you but seeing it inside of the
videogame its joyless and I don't know
anybody who would want to do it except
for maybe my friend Ross alright at this
point you've committed yourself to
pokemon you've maybe drained your
battery once or twice maybe you've hit
level five they decide to pick a team
you started to question things like what
if footprints actually mean and what are
the ethical implications of
domesticating aggressive animal by
cramming them into a tiny ball thinking
realize you don't really care about this
emotional trivialities because for you
Pokemon has become a numbers game and to
be very the best be very best you're
gonna have to get those numbers as high
as possible so when your kitchen Pokemon
you probably notice the ever shrinking
colored ring it's green you start out
but later on you'll start seeing yellows
oranges other shades of red and what
that means is those Pokemon are both
powerful more powerful and also harder
to catch now later on you'll get things
like great balls and ultra balls which
will make it easier to catch them but
there's also these things called
raspberries and once you've hit level
eight you'll start seeing these pop up
his items use a raspberry beat the
Pokemon it'll start liking you and
that's when you get it now as long as
you toss the pokeball into the outer
ring you still have a chance of catching
the Pokemon but there's a method to the
shrinking rings madness and that's where
we're going to get extra points landing
the ball within the smaller ring gives
you some bonus experience points if you
get a fuller ring it's a nice 410 points
a half ring gives you a great 450 points
and you can realize your dream of
becoming an inhuman Pokemon catching
machine and excellent on the small ring
won't let you 100 extra bonus points and
for another 10 experience points you can
spin the ball ahead time give it a nice
little curve it is an acquired skill and
remember it's a lot easier to get a nice
every time so sometimes a Pidgey in the
hand is worth more than
lot of missing pokeballs also turn off
AR mode look if you have it on obviously
you can make a lot of memes but the
Internet has made literally every funny
joke about Pokemon already you're not
going to add to this all you care about
is the points get those points
turn off fair mode you might even save a
little bit of battery that's extra
pokemons in the long run okay so now
it's time talking about catching
pokémon
I mean catching as many Pokemon as you
can as fast as you can and they're all
good to get new pokemons get you you
know extra experience points and new
Pokemon the old ones are repeats look
you can always transfer them to a farm
upstate go get extra candies and don't
worry they're gonna be fine
professor Willow promise let's talk
about those footprints basically if it's
got three prints it means it's the
general area it's going to show up in
your little menu two is closer one is
closer still and no footprints means you
should be clicking on already why are
you eating in that menu now there's no
great way to tell if you're walking in
the right direction but you can play a
bit of a hot and cold game keep that 3x3
grid open to all the Pokemon the area
while you walk around and you can figure
out which is closer by the order of the
Pokemon and why are out searching for
Pokemon do not forget to use items
they're there for a reason there's no
point to order them at all instance will
track Pokemon two at a much faster rate
wherever you walk and while you're doing
that might as well toss in a lucky egg
they work great together because they
doubles the experience points of
whatever you do in a set period time as
well
again this is about getting as many
points as you can as fast as you can
but it should be clear by now that I am
actually the laziest person in the world
I don't want the Pokemon to like find me
in the streets I want Pokemon to find me
at a bar or a coffee shop or a cocktail
lounge or a bar so this is when you
actually get the lords lures are great
because they help everyone they're like
incense the attract Pokemon to the
location but it applies to everyone
who's playing Pokemon go so as long as
you got a pokey stop near a bar or
perhaps your office break room you're
set
I might even recommend getting friends
because the friends can take turns pen
down lures after you're done just sit
back relax you know let the Pokemon come
to you but say you want to stay a little
bit more true to the original Pokemon
travel across the land searching far and
wide and just like when you get a bike
in cerulean city getting a bike in
Pokemon go completely changes the game
pedaling along leisurely will get you to
polka stops faster help you hatch those
pesky eggs and get you to new areas to
catch any Pokemon on my way to work I
hit about 30 polka stops getting
pokeballs items to heal and attract
Pokemon as well as way more eggs and I
could possibly know what to deal with
mileage may vary if you're not in New
York City where the landmarks are super
prevalent but all the more reason to
have a bike or skateboard because it
will get you from one focus top to the
next way quicker than walking since
different pokemons are in different
places it's important to get there and a
bike is the most efficient way to cover
all the areas you can get different
Pokemon in different places like I had a
sand tree when I on my way here or in my
apartment all I can get our zoo bats
because I don't know why now it's
important to keep it slow because you're
going too fast
those egg steps don't count anymore so
if you're in a train or a car not going
to do you any good plus if you're going
too fast you can't hit on those pokey
stops or the Pokemon very accurately ok
so let's talk about safety the bike or
skateboard is for getting from point A
to point B don't play while you're
riding in traffic no Pikachu is worth
your life or someone else's so when
you're playing stay alert and use common
sense and definitely do not drive and
play this game so you just hit level 5
and you're ready to start taking on the
gyms you can find gyms at major
landmarks and areas of interest it's
helpful to look at the gyms near you and
see what factions control them because
you can battle for control of gyms that
are owned by other factions but you can
only add Pokemon to help defend gyms
that are owned by your faction Pokemon
you add two gyms will stay there until
the gym is defeated since the game is
fairly new there actually is still a
bunch of unclaimed gyms there'll be
great gyms on your map you can conquer
them by adding a Pokemon but make sure
it's a strong Pokemon because that will
be the only one left to defend the gym
until somebody else adds another Pokemon
conquering a gym is probably the hardest
part of Pokemon go you select six of
your Pokemon to take the gym on once the
battle begins you can do three things
you can tap to attack you can swipe to
dodge or you can press and hold to do
your special attack but the special
attack only works after you filled up
the blue bubble
you can even team up with other members
of your factions to take down gyms and
working together can make beating a gym
a lot easier the gym becomes unclaimed
as soon as you beat the gym leader so
add a Pokemon as fast as you can
otherwise you risk losing the unclaimed
gym to some random bystander who's just
going to reap the benefits of your hard
work now that you've finished your
battle your Pokemon are probably fainted
or pretty weak so you're going to need
to use items to bring them back to
health and potions and revives can be
found at polka stops or you can buy them
through the app train your Pokemon and
conquer the city you're ready to be a
Pokemon master</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
