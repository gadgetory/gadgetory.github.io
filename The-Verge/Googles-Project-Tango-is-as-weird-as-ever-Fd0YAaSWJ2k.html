I'm here at Google i/o Google's big
annual development conference and I'm
checking out project tango so project
tango is a sort of science fictional
augmented reality project that Google
has been working on for a while but it's
now getting a little bit closer to
becoming a real thing because Google is
going to put it in the very first
consumer product it's a phone
it's from Lenovo and it's coming out
this summer so here at i/o they've got a
handful of experiments that can show you
exactly what tango can do so we're going
to go check them out so we got to try
six project tango experiments the first
one is low vision Louis really likes to
do augmented reality systems to show
what people's houses might look like
with Lowe's furniture or appliances you
can live around it can sense where a
blank space would be that you could put
say a fridge you can place that fridge
there and then you can sort of move it
around rotate it see what it would look
like and then obviously buy it Wayfarer
view is a little bit like Lowe's and
that it wants you to buy furniture but
it wants you to be able to see what it
looks like beforehand so again you find
some blank floor you put a chair down or
a stool or a table and then you can walk
around is it's not perfect with its
mapping but it's good enough to give it
a general idea of what the room would
look like with this furniture and
obviously there you can click through
you can add it to your cart and buy it
and then you've got constructor so you
can bring your camera here you scan a
room and then it will give you a sort of
navigable 3d version of that room and
then it will smooth it out so it
actually looks pretty good you can also
play some games with tango one of these
is world from a studio called phenomena
and what's notable about it is that one
of the developers is the creator of
Katamari Damacy
so it brings that same sense of weird
lindsey but you're placing things around
the room but you're not really playing a
traditional game you're just putting
down a bunch of objects and seeing how
they interact with each other it's much
more like a sandbox which is great
because if you're trying to actually
build a gay
and in your room like make characters
jump along your tables that's often
really boring it's sort of difficult to
structure but if all you're doing is
basically playing with Legos or toys
that's pretty cool the last thing I
checked out is called dinos among us and
that is exactly what it is it's a way
that you can place pretty realistic
looking dinosaurs and then you walk
around them you can look at animations
and you can scale them so obviously
tangos not the kind of augmented reality
we mean when we talk about whole lens or
something that realistically looks like
a hologram and it's still kind of rough
how things are going to jump around a
little bit it's not like you will
actually mistake them for real things in
the environment but for that it's pretty
cool they can come up with a lot of
creative applications for it and it's
actually great in a situation where what
you're trying to do is use it as a tool
instead of an entertainment product so
again we're going to be seeing it in the
wild this summer so we'll get to see if
other people think the same thing if you
liked this you can check us out at
youtube.com slash The Verge or we've got
a whole lot more</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
