evening good afternoon good day internet
welcome to another week where we hang
out with Alexis Ohanian the host co
founder of reddit host of small empires
co founder of reddit and a whole bunch
of other stuff ah perky and Kirk yeah
helped create small empires which is an
awesome show on the internet about
startups hosted by Alexis Ohanian the
dude and our hangout this week the
episode was about actually it was a
really interesting episode watcher this
morning uh it was on a company called
sandwich or sandwich video who makes
those k starter videos or IndieGoGo
videos or just like startup videos uh
and they're actually pretty interesting
because I have backed Kickstarter
projects and I've backed IndieGoGo
projects and it sucks to admit but a lot
of those projects I backed because of
the video like the video is compelling
like oh this company seems legit their
video is good you know that's like what
Kickstarter is it's like oh do you have
a good video and even in the episode
that that cooler uh they they fail they
flopped and then they were back a few
months later and they shattered
Kickstarter's record because they had a
good video um so let's talk about this
company Alexis what do you think about
them and what's you know what's the deal
with them I was really pleased um I
really like I Adams hell guy there's a
founder with the great beard um I I am I
have become more and more aware of their
work over the last couple of years
because I've seen more and more
companies that I've advised basically
trip over themselves to try to get a
sandwich video made it's a point worth
come otone me like or this idea of a
sandwich video there are plenty of
people like the cooler guys like people
might see that and think all right it's
like a sandwich video I mean it wasn't
per se but what sandwich has done has
really created a tight video which is
like a um it's like the 21st century
infomercial it's like
you know their tape you're so authentic
right um you know I think is actually an
interesting part of the whole thing it's
like yeah a good video will make me more
inclined to donate to a Kickstarter or
IndieGoGo or even just like be
interested in the project but on the
converse I'd like a bad video I'm just
I'm like running for the hills you know
what I mean like it are you just have
like a good infographic or like even
just like a good paragraph than a bad
video like a bad video it's like you
don't even take yourself seriously right
I think that's that's also partly
because Kickstarter's is on like that
you hit the project and it's like nice
full title and then boom you're already
you're hit with that video right away um
but I do agree with you like if some
company has some jank video you're like
okay these guys can't even afford or
create a good video why would I believe
in the project and I think that worst
works inversely to which is why I
sandwich was so successful and it's
interesting the way they got started to
for those that haven't seen the episode
yet I'm going to spoil it for you they
were they they made like a nap and he
the guy Adam his name is uh he was
starred in his own video and then this
sort of got his own ball rolling as
people were like oh we want our own
videos made and now it seems like a
majority of those great Kickstarter
videos are done by sandwich um and I had
no idea they did things for square and
the coin video they did on and now I
kind of I kind of want to go back and
watch some of them because yeah he's in
all of them like that's such a good
troll he creates the videos he is the
man behind this and he's just right
there in front of you selling you these
things or actually not really selling
you this these things just straight up
this is a thing here's how it works do
whatever you want now it's just like
explaining and then length suggesting
like I think it's dope I don't know you
know like which is the way that it's
it's just nice because it's almost like
Alexis like what you're saying it's like
the modern-day infomercial but it's like
it's almost more of like a
conversational like it's like here's
it's kind of like talking to a friend
it's like here's the thing they're like
here's until graphics that I made that
explain the thing that I like but
basically I'm just telling you about
what I
the restroom I don't know again if you
want like I yeah that's exactly the way
look I mean if they did it like billy
mays i think it would fail oh here is
something like this is this is very
unique to the world we live in that
where people are craving like
authenticity and so even and yeah i mean
everyone knows these are pitch videos
for products right there approach is
like okay look we all know this is a
pitch video but when I just talked like
a dude yeah basically uh Alexis do you
think you think they have the right
business model approach I mean they've
got it I got to be taking you know five
ten something percent equity in order
for them to be you know make it worth it
he said they did 50 videos in a year
that's one a week and was there a team
of nine he said uh you know but granted
their videos kick ass and they usually
really do help like he was even saying
it's like as it's almost as if sandwich
is launching these products for these
companies do you think that that
approach is a way to do it or do you
think they it would be better off you
know in the long term to get a huge sum
up front like charge like 50 grand video
or something well then well I mean they
are there are some clients who they are
charging on some upfront but it lets
them basically lets them pay the bills
to pay employees and take the bigger
bets on the upstarts with the equity
revenue share thing I mean I think like
look this is if they weren't doing this
this would be like every other just
about every other production company I
have encountered and and none of those
businesses can really scale because when
you talk King just pure revenue like
you're only going to be able to charge
so much and then when you do you have to
hire a certain number of people in order
to get the product to get the thing made
and and that's a business that like
fundamenta doesn't fundamentally does
not scale because you just have to
always be hiring more people as you're
creating as you're growing you have to
hire more people and you still have to
keep quality up really high those are
two very hard things
you if you're talking about building
like a billion-dollar company it's
doable but it's really really hard and
it takes a really really long time so I
love the fact that they're thinking
about other ways to make money that are
working with their partners taking
bigger risks but potentially getting
bigger rewards right if they make the
video for the next Facebook forgive the
expression they could very quickly find
themselves with a lot of cash flow but
oh in some part of the company right
yeah I think it's like we kind of make
this point the video but like there is
no reason why they shouldn't be factored
in equity wise along with everyone else
like like we're saying if there's a bad
video it's as bad as having a really
like a bug in your code that makes it it
so every time you try to order something
thing crash it's like people won't use
it again or then then we use it at all
so it's like it makes sense that they
should they should be a part of it it
makes it just I don't know it was the
first time that it actually makes sense
and it will help them make good business
I just it's so interesting because I
can't think of another company that does
something like this they're able to get
their hands tied with so many different
companies of so like it's it's kind of
like a really awesome business idea and
I can it be done with any other type of
service besides like this video thing
like I like I guess like a PR company
maybe but PR companies never ask for
like a share of the company right oh
yeah I mean the only the only thing that
we were able to find were in like the
2000s before the first bubble burst they
were a lot of design in like web design
firms who were taking equity um and you
know since antiquity lawyers have been
taking equity and exchange for work
right because legal teas are so
expensive right that makes it yeah week
the thing is if I think if they brought
this model to you know there are lot of
production companies who do like small
businesses of all stripes and if they
brought this to like a baker or you know
even if it was like Melissa's cupcakes
like a big Baker who I think the
response would be like
what who the hell are you and what the
hell are you talking about yeah Vince is
the startup world in that sort of equity
trading and like talking a lot about
equity valuation is just part of it
almost seems more part of the startup
world than the other sorts of
entrepreneurism or entrepreneurship so
it's like sandwich happens to be in a
perfect space for this to be happening
so I can see like a tech PR firm trying
to do something like this but like the
tech PR firm would be pushing the
sandwich video yes yeah yeah basically
they are literally like the production
company they're doing everything to make
that video create it right there
creating like part of the product right
right you can in a sense i mean canvas
can this business continued lasting like
we'll each order continue go ahead
Alexis well it's less hey there's
there's definitely crowdfunding part
excuse me and there's that who talked
about this in the August episode yeah um
be your it's one thing you know it's
great to set expectations really high
which is what these great videos too
it's another thing to actually meet them
now hi mm-hmm it's it's hard um in you
know but that's only a portion of what
they're doing right there they're a
bunch of startups that have actually
built products that are ready to ship
that are great that they just want help
spreading the word around these tend to
be software ones but regardless um it's
really I think what's interesting to me
is a PR firm can't really demonstrably
show that they had an impact I mean it's
like if it's a cool I've been doing this
for a lot like if you've got a cool
thing peak that you're launching people
are going to want to write about it so
so it's more like how do you how do you
help us create a cool thing or a good
thing or an interesting thing and and
sandwich is actually creating that and I
think because there's so much
competition now with early-stage invent
things like seed investors the first bit
of investing I look at this I'm
referencing all kinds of stuff like part
pick I'm Kabul that seat coming from
different angel investors
and and so you go around with the hat
you know 10 15 20 30 people might be in
your seed round and these kinds of
investors really have to compete over
cool deals over good companies that have
sort of traction and height because
there's plenty of money to go around for
these companies and so if you're one of
the lucky companies that has the height
you basically can take your pick of
investors or at least has the whatever
is the promise is the magic whatever you
call um and having someone like sandwich
in the mix is really interesting because
like Joe dentist who's like an angel
investor on the side isn't gonna his ten
thousand dollars or his fifty thousand
dollars in angel investing is really
just dumb money sorry Joe the dentist
and you can't have a ton of value that
early stage company but if sandwich
comes then it offers to do this video
for some portion that's hugely valuable
to the company rights and all of a
sudden they're acting in a world of
investors where they're bringing value
that like ninety-five percent of early
or five percent of early stage investors
can't provide the valuable knowledge can
yeah oh like no one is asking you don't
ask an investor or even usually
developer or even sometimes to see you
know to frame and tell the story of what
you're trying to do and sometimes people
make great stuff without even realizing
how great it is or how like how to tell
people how great it is and like I can
see like sandwich making these videos
they're like here's how to use this
thing it's awesome I I would imagine
that there there have been certain
occasions where the people who hire them
to do it didn't even realize how dope
the things of t-birds presenta you know
what I mean like oh I can explain like
push room look isn't a great example of
that because pusher pizza is like oh
look i push it this pizza but like i
don't know even just like like seeing
the thing in action is so much different
than hearing about it is that make sense
no i totally agree with you and it's
it's just I guess it's fair to say that
sandwich has like a very like they play
an important role for these companies
like sure like like Alexis you were
saying the ten-thousand-dollar see
is like it's cool but it's like okay you
have ten thousand dollars in cash what
are you gonna do but coming like the
videos that get made and his like
creative direction he's like effectively
creating the product in video form for
them and that is like invaluable okay
you really can't put a price on that
well you can you charge for equity but
well it's like it's like a pitch to
customers like and I think a lot of
times sometimes when I'm seeing people
get their start up for their idea it
sounds like they're pitching to an
investor and I don't want to hear
someone talking to it if like I don't I
don't care about most of the things that
as like a consumer I don't care about
standing yeah it keeps really good at
telling that consumer facing story yeah
because that's it's basically just
following the truth about what it's like
to use right and it was interesting uh
the dude with the beard I think someone
someone in the episode was saying that a
lot of the companies they work with
there are products that they would
actually like use you know so cool to
see that they are you know sort of
enjoying and not just like they're not
just doing it for the money they
actually enjoy these products and they
get to sort of put them in the best
light possible it's pretty interesting
yeah really cool though so Alexis you
think they're gonna be able to like
continue going on others like
Kickstarter projects happening you know
all the time but this can't last forever
Kandra though I mean Facebook's been
around for 10 years so yeah but like
advertising has been around since
prostitution started that's also true
you mean like there's always been
somebody saying hey here's the good
thing go over here so then do they move
away from doing just start up videos
like startup company videos to like I
don't know making TV commercials for it
they've done TV commercials for the half
next they've done TV commercials for
mostly like internet-based companies and
but I think that they've also done some
bigger stuff with just normal grants
that like you know just because they're
good and friends want to be involved so
is it are they special because their
videos are so good like his jet is that
just what it is is that the magic I
think I think so good like commercials
are
Russian quality of commercials is fairly
across the board great you know what I
mean like their videos are
production-wise on the level of
commercials but yeah the tenor of them
and the tone of them is so distinct and
so aligned with the way that it seems
like many p it seems like it resonates
with many many many people and so I
don't think that there's they're not
necessarily like objectively better than
anyone else they're just better at doing
exactly what they do you know what I
mean like like Chipotle wouldn't want to
chipotle mostly does like stop motion
ads right like they wouldn't even hire
sandwich to do like a stop motion
chipotle ad but like if you want someone
to beautifully and simply present what
your product service or idea is then
that's when you go to sandwich and
Trinity that's not if that's at least my
takeaway it's like a the best I what
they do bar none hands down I guess it's
only a matter of time before a
competitor comes along but this this
Adam's creative vision is like that's
everything of the company like he was on
one person before you know like he was
just one human with and he still sort of
has like all the you know he seems like
I don't know when you guys were there
did you watch them film any videos by
any chance or now we had unfortunately
we weren't able to actually go on set we
had to have a stringer in la go on set
but I think basically it's like he has a
team of folks who work for him and then
and you know I think it's like I think
that he's found a way to uh make sure
that there's a consistent vision while
being able to trust people and it's you
know like a typical creative director
like we have it's like a like a Neil I
at the verge it's like he's guiding all
right a little bit more than then maybe
an editor-in-chief would write and he's
also he's daring his own videos took any
time starring uh many times writing many
times directing right but I think they
figured out a way to provide a level of
autonomy to their directors it's pretty
admirable while still maintaining Adams
a vision you ask
it's crazy it's a crazy crazy company
that he started I mean and there he's
everywhere he's really really everywhere
at seven I saw him on my TV a couple
days ago on hulu wow that's a because
like oh great wait he was wait he's in
the hulu add know he's on carmax add
that was playing on hulu ah couch
football as weekend yeah it's okay yeah
how you did you ever wow wow um okay
cool well I guess there's nothing
there's not much left to say about this
company other than that they're awesome
and Adam is a really awesome creative
genius um yeah I mean you guys have
anything else to add or should we wrap
it up um adam has a really dope son he
was jumping all around the office it was
just a cool little dude he's like her
haha shout out to have and I'm sorry
miss billing Salter everywhere break did
you break any electronics in the process
