physically is almost identical to the
iPhone for the antenna notches at the
top of the phone or in slightly
different places on the left and right
sides the iPhone 4s also has a faster
CPU than the previous version it's the
a5 versus the iPhone 4 is a4 it's the
same CPU that's in the iPad also the
camera has been massively upgraded
versus the old version it's now gone 8
megapixel camera which takes really
beautiful very very nice looking
pictures I definitely think you could
use this as a replacement for a average
to decent point-and-shoot camera it also
does 1080p video which looks really
great and is now now has image
stabilization so your shots will be a
little less bouncy than they were
previously but of course the big feature
with the new iPhone is Siri
functionality Siri is something that
Apple is calling an intelligent
assistant you can set reminders remind
me to call my wife at 6 p.m. here's your
reminder for today at 6 p.m. you can
find out all kinds of weird facts
through WolframAlpha how fast is a
cheetah checking my sources this might
answer your question Siri can also read
your text messages back to you and it
will take dictation so you can send text
messages and emails you'll be sorry you
said that you can see here that Siri
doesn't always take perfect dictation so
you can tell you stock prices nearly in
real time and she can also give you
weather forecasts even if you ask pretty
normal human language questions should I
wear a raincoat today there's no rain in
the forecast for today so in all the
iPhone 4s is a pretty nice bump if
you're a 3GS or lower user if you're an
iPhone 4 user there's not a ton of new
stuff here it is faster not super
noticeably faster but definitely faster
the camera is way improved I mean it's a
probably one of the best if not the best
camera I've used on a phone and then
there's the software improvements most
of which will come to the iPhone 4 but
Siri will not if you've got an iPhone 4
I think this is somewhat of a hard sell
I don't feel like there's a ton of
compelling stuff here to make you want
to upgrade but if you're on an older
model or if you're thinking about
switching there's no question that this
is definitely one of the best
smartphones you could possibly get right
now Siri who made you like it says on
the box I was designed by Apple in
California</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
