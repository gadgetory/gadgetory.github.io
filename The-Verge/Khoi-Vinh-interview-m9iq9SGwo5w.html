founder of Mixel a social collaging app
for ipad but he also helped curate part
of apps in this beautiful gallery here
he's also worked as a designer on the
New York Times com blogs at subtraction
com very influential so what exactly are
we doing here and what threads do you
see between the seven apps that you pick
to display here we really try to gather
some of the most interesting user
interface designs going on on iphone and
on ipad and I think the common thread is
that everybody's still figuring it out
it's really young platform if you go
back to the beginning of the iphone it's
five years but the ipad is certainly
only about two years old or so so people
are really trying to figure out what
makes sense for all the really different
kinds of creative uses that they're
putting these multi touch devices to and
when you look at the size of the ipad
screen do you feel like ab developers
are taking advantage of it so I feel
like the apple the Apple model is kind
of like well the set the menu bar is
going to be exact same size no matter
how big the screen is not I don't really
feel like that works do you see a lot of
guys taking advanced on the screen size
or just maybe inflating the iphone you I
that's really interesting question a
Mixel is on ipad only and in some ways I
guess the question isn't really are we
taking advantage of it is do we know
what to do with all of the space because
it's compared to iphone it's a lot of
space and the way that you create a user
interface for the ipad is very very
different from both the phone and from
the web I think on the web there's a
compulsion to sort of cram as much as
you can in there but ipad assistants
middle ground where you really want to
put as little as you can in there and
yet you have a lot more space than you
do on the phone so it's just very very
strange thing I think in a lot of ways
the ipad is still evolving it says in
this awkward teenager phase we don't
really know yet how it's going to turn
out
and you really see that a lot a lot of
apps how you compare that to looking at
the site for like the New York Times
where there's so much text it's like
those sites began before tablets even
existed how do you visualize those types
of sites kind of changing to be more
like paper for example which really
doesn't you know you're using your
fingers to interact with it there's not
much navigation well I think that's a
really big open question I mean if you
see it look at a lot of the ways
publishers are tackling the phones and
the tablets there they're very much
still in the experimental phase as I
said everybody's figuring it out phone
is a little bit more straightforward
because we really understand the use
case of the phone in that people are on
the go they need a quick hit of whatever
content they're consuming and then it
needs to be like highly optimized for
speed and download and so forth tablet
the use cases are really evolving so
people aren't really quite sure how
they're using tablets a lot of folks
will leave their tablets at home and not
pick them up until seven or eight
o'clock at night right when they're on
the couch yeah and so that seems to be
the predominant pattern for most people
but that's really changing as tablets
enter the workforce and I think you'll
see in the next year or two people being
issued tablets more and more and then
they'll have these tablets with them all
day long and how that impacts the way
they they want to access information and
how the apps respond to that I think
remains to be seen
it's interesting and another thing is
all the apps fear on iOS go back to that
a little bit um why is that why do you
think perhaps a higher quality of
developments have an iOS or is it just
the fact that there are only a couple
screen sizes and resolutions are
developing for I think they might as
well take I oh well we picked iOS
because we're most comfortable with iOS
we know we the people that we know the
companies that we know they're producing
really beautiful ABS the ones that we
look to their doing it on iOS on phone
and on tablet and I fully believe that
they're going to be some beautiful apps
on Android in there there are right now
and I think if we've talked about
potentially doing another installment of
this show or you know at some point the
future and it would be great to get
Android companies and at that point but
I think right now it's so clear to me
that that the interface design being
done on iOS is really leading the way
more for all the platforms when you look
at some of the apps around here like
path or pick two or Instagram as in here
but you know it's like this is kind of
this this everywhere mentality you know
your bottom navigation bar you have this
kind of fuzzy top bar we can able to app
or something like that and then you see
something like tweet bottom what you
have here yeah what do you think is
interesting about that like what are
they doing right I guess because it's I
mean it's modern in different ways but
in some of the other apps it's kind of
breathing well we really wanted to get
mark Jardine from tap BOTS to bring
tweetbot to the show because they really
are sort of a very interesting almost
like argument for how Apple's is you I
foundation is really just the beginning
and you should
take it at face value right because they
have a lot of the same visual motifs but
then there's so much for power users
right and they've also reinvented almost
every little widget in UI toolkit and in
many cases improved upon them and so I
think it's really important especially
to get that work here to sort of show
that that people are improvising and are
you know figuring out what works for
their their app their features their
content and their users when you look
forward at the way these apps are being
seen by the public I mean I haven't
heard of any other art galleries of apps
and how our apps working is kind of like
a platform for designers now and it's
like you're totally great looking Mac
apps and people are just for some reason
getting really really excited about us
development I mean is it just that
people are using these things a lot more
like other phones every day I think it's
apart form for artists now like how does
that work I think that's part of it i
think you know i mean it's kind of hard
to you chose to focus your time on us
yeah absolutely after working on some
cool projects oh yeah and it's hard to
hard to remember what phones were like
before the iphone yeah i mean they were
not very capable of showing really
really beautiful user interface design
and now all of a sudden you've got this
beautiful screen that in many cases is
got more resolution than we had on our
desktops five years ago and you're
carrying it around with you all the time
on top of that Apple did this terrific
thing the terrific favor for designers
in fixing the resolution so you don't
have to design you know I'm team number
of prompting a number of screen sizes
and so more that's huge but I think the
biggest thing is as you said these apps
are more integrated in our lives than
desktop apps ever were
it's a great opportunity to do really
focus design but also to have a great
impact on people's lives and and to sort
of meld with their their you know their
usage patterns and she's the way they
think about the world I think that's
that's why I think user interface design
in the next you know decade is going to
come more and more important more more
interesting to people as I kind of
promised like a competition people are
like who can do the best job right you
know it's like paper I mean there are a
million drawing apps on the App Store
they came out of nowhere and built
something that like yeah I think the key
thing about paper is they made it look
like magic as soon as you open it up it
was like wow that's what the tablet can
do for you that that you couldn't do
with the Wacom tablet and you know put a
shop or something like that on a desktop
so that's really really huge
breakthrough so we are in a gallery
after all you know there a lot of
galleries word you're buying things yeah
I think most the apps here are free but
when you look at like putting a price on
this kind of art it's like not that many
apps right i mean tweet tweet bug tap
box is doing well selling line products
but it's like do you think this is a
sustainable industry and be building
these move apps especially free ones
where you can buy little pieces of it
right like how do you see that as a
business that you're now in are you
asking me every app is worth a billion
dollars haha i don't know i mean i can
say that if you want yeah i think as as
the co-founder for start-up is the CEO
we spent all of our days thinking about
what is the worth of this thing that
we're building and i think what's nice
about this show is you just get a chance
to really admire the work and so I'm
gonna punt on that that question I don't
know how we really value these you guys
for that being all i know i said think
they're there the work is interesting
enough it's beautiful and all
the work is interesting about the work
is interesting enough it's beautiful
enough and it's pushing it up boundaries
that I think it really bears closer
inspection and that's what the shows
about mm-hmm do you think that they're
gonna be a lot more things like this
like I mean even WWDC sold out in two
hours yeah are you gonna be there mica
powder will be I i was actually added a
breakfast on it so I was too late to
scorch it too late already taken yeah
have you heard of any other like events
like what you guys have done here we
have it that's why we're so excited
about this I would hope to see a lot
more of this because you know a whole
generation when people are focusing
their energy on apps and they're doing
amazing work and I think it it really
deserves this kind of showcase it really
deserves people looking at it more
closely and and having a dialogue about
it and I mean you're obviously a busy
guy what part of you wanted to spend a
month putting something like this
together reaching out to companies and
bringing bringing this type of work
together you know when you're going to
start up your heads down so often and as
a designer's foot in the stirrup you're
often sort of drowned out by the
business dialogue and the technology
dialogue and just to get a place where
people can look at at the you know the
artfulness of the user interfaces that
are being you know made all the time I
thought that was really valuable and I
really wanted the opportunity to let a
lot of these app designers shine so it
seemed totally worthwhile firstly the
gallery space just made it really easy
because it's ideal for showing digital
art mmm yet there are no iPads to play
with the apps here there is one
downstairs you can play with Mixel
downstairs yes song yes so speaking of
mix of what do we have to look forward
to for your company sharrap so we're
going to focus on the phone next right
now mix-a-lot's ipad-only and we're
taking a look at all of the interactions
that we have on the iPad and seeing how
they make sense in in your hand and on
the go yeah that's interesting because I
mean people see the ipad is like a
creation or consumption device whereas
phone is more so communication aid
consumption yes my recreation yeah but I
think you I think multi-touch in general
is much more conducive to creation than
people really give it credit for when it
first debuted especially on the ipad i
think i think the amount of screen real
estate you have the ipad is just very
very conducive to doing like really
great creative stuff let me just take a
look at the stuff that people are doing
on paper yeah so you know from nixle
like our journey is to figure out how to
get people to lower their inhibitions
about expressing themselves with
pictures and you know art that kind of
thing and so we're going to be we've
learned a lot on the iPad we've learned
a lot about what it takes for people to
to dabble in this kind of stuff and
we're going to apply some of those
lessons to the phone necks and reach an
audience of people who are on the go and
try to create a way of cream this kind
of content that is complementary to
the way people you know think about
their phone how are you finding the
different ways like very surprised by
any of the ways people engage with Mixel
like look at the users and what they're
doing yeah so is everything social these
days but what's surprising you know what
is is unexpected because everybody's got
you know social references so there are
a few things I think are really
surprising first the tools that we built
into Mixel that allow you to edit and
make a collage or really quite primitive
we we didn't put a ton of engineering
time into letting you crop things that
you flip and duplicate right you just
got a lasso yeah basically yeah but
people have done some really amazing
impressive jaw-dropping work inside very
very sophisticated and and very very
complex shmixels the other thing that
it's been really gratifying as well as
surprising is the communities come
together really really quickly and
really feat they've sort of jointly
decided okay we're going to figure out
how to use this tool and support each
other and get to know each other and
they really you know they very often
refer to themselves as a kind of family
now and they know a few of them are
hitting these milestones like 100 pixels
or five hundred or a thousand nixle and
that in itself is amazing but what's
even more amazing is the community is
waiting for each person to hit that
milestone and as they get to like 495
mixels they start making mixels cheering
them on and
and really trying to to root for each
other to get there it's just been
incredibly gratifying to see that kind
of stuff and a lot of this stuff is cool
and I'll get people tend to like put a
lot of effort into one or two creative
absolutely do you think there's time in
our lives for all these apps or do you
think over time let's say in 10 years
things are going to be distilled down to
the point where you know or is it really
just like you know what everybody likes
different books are really likes
different video games that kind of
things I mean theory I think in Sami
people all just throw around the other
but like is there time for all these
apps well I think you hit on it I mean
there's not enough time for all of the
books they'll be published this year or
all the movies that will be released
this year but having that variety and
especially with digital media with the
web creating these apps where people who
have passions that otherwise would be
unmet can go and meet other people and
engage in and get and get sort of
encouraged to indulge those passions I
think that's incredibly valuable and and
you know we see people make time for it
i mean the the session links inside
nixle are really super healthy people
come home they have been wronged me oh
yeah for yeah this is sit down they have
dinner sit down maybe it from the TV and
open up Mixel and they're in there for
you know half hour hour or longer
they're incredibly engaged that's part
of the beauty of the iPad as well it's
very very immersive platform in creating
experiences when you look at just in the
past few months or so since draw
something started taking off do you
think style I are sticking around or are
we going to stick with fingers I will
tell the guys at 53 who make paper I
think that that
it's fingers all the way I'm hope four
fingers but you know style I'd there
might be a market for them and if
anybody can do what those guys can do it
what about in terms of computers I mean
you you right you right you mark things
up and sketch things out in applications
I mean is it is everything going to be
touched at some point or I think you're
always going to be a place where typing
I tell you I I got a bluetooth keyboard
for my iPad and I can travel just with
the ipad now which is it's lighter it
has a lot of additive life it's a
logitech one maybe I think made by
another company I can't remember which
one it is zagg and yeah it's a zag
exactly yeah and and that's terrific it
doesn't replace everything that I can do
on my laptop but I think in five or ten
years it very very possibly could or if
not sooner so I and I think there's you
know a pretty good bet that some touch
properties will come to what we think of
as desktops and laptops today but you
know I would be a fool to predict win I
will thanks so much for your time thanks
a lot really appreciate your wisdom and
expertise yeah thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
