Microsoft has put every consolation
prize imaginable into one beautiful
stopgap i'm ross miller and this is 90
seconds on the verge this week marks the
first major Xbox one event since the
console launched last November one of
the biggest announcements was the master
chief collection available November 11th
the compilation features halos one
through four all remastered to run at
1080p 60 frames per second in addition
to the remakes and this is key the
Master Chief collection will include
access to the halo 5 multiplayer beta
this December halo 5 however isn't due
out until next holiday season 2015 in
some ways it's just housecleaning since
the Xbox one isn't backwards compatible
but in the absence of another top-tier
flagship exclusive this holiday season
the Master Chief collection is also
something of a necessity sales of the
xbox one have trailed behind Sony's
PlayStation 4 since they both launched
last November and last month microsoft
announced a four-hundred-dollar Xbox one
bundle without connect so that it could
compete directly on price but halo has
always been a guaranteed system seller
for Microsoft and it's not just the
games themselves to the whole halo
mythology that's why microsoft also
announced halo nightfall a live-action
weekly series from producer ridley scott
nightfall will tie together the first
for Halo games and lay the narrative
groundwork for Halo 5 still no word on
that steven spielberg halo series
announced last year for more on III
check out the verge coming up tomorrow
Oregon Trail is rebooted as a
live-action wait do these stories ever
