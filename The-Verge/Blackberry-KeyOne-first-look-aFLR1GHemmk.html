first phone in this new era of
BlackBerry to come with what people
actually expect from the brand a
physical keyboard here's how it works
the keyboard sits below a 4.5 inch
screen with three to two aspect ratio if
touch sensitive so you can scroll
through web pages and so on without
having to touch the screen and just like
classic libraries you can customize each
key with shortcuts for things like apps
and contacts unlike classic libraries
however this run's android 7 nougat and
is a pretty modern smartphone and all
the ways you'd expect it's actually made
by TCL a Chinese campaigns as licensing
the name from blackberry the build
quality is very solid with an aluminium
frame and textured back panel and
overall the industrial design seems
likely to please the kind of
professional user the same depth another
aspects of the design centered around
productivity is that it's easy to use in
one hand partly because the screen is
narrow partly because you can do a lot
with the keyboard itself and the
keyboard also makes androids
multitasking more practical you could
send a text while watching video at the
same time for example and you would need
to obscure screen with the software
keyboard TCL is also targeting
professionals with a range of security
software and BlackBerry apps like bbm
and the BlackBerry hub which condenses a
bunch of information from emails
calendars and so on into one feed the
BlackBerry key one will cost you five
hundred and forty nine dollars and it's
going on sale sometime in the second
quarter of this year is it enough to
make blackberry cool again maybe not but
it looks like a pretty solid effort and
if you can be holding out for a physical
keyboard all the way into 2017 that's
probably enough to make you happy
