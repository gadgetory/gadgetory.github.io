checking out air time which is kind of
like chatroulette but a lot more legit
and it's from sean parker and Shawn
Fanning the guys behind Napster so let's
check it out before you start air time
you'll notice that you need 1.5 megabits
a second of bandwidth which is actually
a lot it's more than most video clients
would need but that's because the
quality is actually pretty good you
can't do group chat like you could with
Google+ Hangouts but the one-on-one chat
is pretty great quality when you first
get into air time you'll see yourself in
a box on the left your name where you
are some interests which you can use to
find people who like the same things as
you and chat with them you can see
videos you've most recently posted to
Facebook or watched on youtube so you
can watch videos with the person you're
chatting with and then below that you
can see achievements which we're not
really sure what that does yet in the
right sidebar you can search your
contacts you can see who's online using
the play button right here so if
somebody's online and facebook chat they
are going to show up in this list as
well as anybody you have chatted with
and liked and added to your buddy list
once you've taken a look around the app
you can click talk to somebody to just
get started right then in there you can
check or uncheck people nearby common
interest friends of friends for now we
will leave those all checked and see who
we come up with hey how's it going okay
it looks like we both live in New York
and grew up in Michigan what do you have
to in New York I'm actually doing a
hands-on video right now for a tech news
site called the verge have you heard of
it sounds familiar yeah i work for a
tech startup know which one we cover
tech startups nice i capture one PT you
are calm sweet well it was nice to meet
you and now you're plugged on the verge
great see you later so that's air time
and it's really a lot like chatroulette
except it's more intentional and the
quality of the video is better and it's
interesting because when you sign on and
talk to somebody you can see interests
which is something that chatroulette
never offered so they want this to be a
way for you to video chat with your
friends but also a way for you to chat
with people around the world about
things that you care about
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
