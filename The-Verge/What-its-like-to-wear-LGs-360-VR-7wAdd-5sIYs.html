at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
and I am looking at LG's 360 VR which is
a virtual reality headset that connects
to their new flagship smartphone the g5
I'm currently going through a little bit
alright I just went through a London bus
and now I'm underwater I'm on a
rollercoaster ride
looking at magical sunken chests full of
g5 smartphones
unlike the gear VR which is Samsung VR
headset LG's doesn't have a slot that
you put your phone into instead it has
this tether here that connects to the
smartphone directly this means that the
headset is lighter just 118 grams but it
also means that there's not this kind of
gasket that fits around your face and
blocks out external life it means you
kind of have an awareness about what's
going on around you all the time which
definitely takes away from the immersion
so the 360 VR was announced along with
the g5 but it'll be coming out sometime
later in the summer at the moment the
content you can access with a 360 VR
it's mainly stuff from Google cardboard
as well as VR stuff on YouTube but the
whole concept of it isn't going to be as
convincing for the HTC vive for example
you're connecting to a much more
powerful PC this is running from your
smartphone
that means there's lag when you move
your head about compared to other VR
headsets it's just a bit underdeveloped
for more information about the 360 VR
and everything else
LTS announced recently you can go to the
verge comm or check out youtube.com for
slash the verge for more videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
