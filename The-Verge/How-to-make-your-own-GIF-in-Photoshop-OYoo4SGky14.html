every day whether it's to share your
reaction of something or to spice up
your Instagram or to argue online about
how it's pronounced but what if there's
no perfect gift out there that expresses
how you're really feeling easy you just
make one yourself there's a lot of
different ways to make gifts now and
it's actually easier than it's ever been
using a YouTube video takes the least
amount of effort because gif II has
online tools that lets you cut out
specific parts you can also use their
desktop app to drag the part of the
screen you want to capture and recording
the clip you need to your computer but
if you wanna expand past this and stand
out with something more original you'll
want to make your own to begin you need
a basic understanding of animation a
gift is nothing but a sequence of frames
it's like a digital version of a
flipbook
if you take any gift from the internet
and open it in Photoshop you can see all
the individual frames it's made of this
short gif is 41 frames each frame is
showing one layer of the image at a time
and when you put it all together it
creates a tiny story we can see that it
takes about 20 frames from the doc to
walk up to the gate and maybe 10 frames
for the doc to actually pass through but
your gift doesn't need to have a lot of
frames to make sense it can be as basic
as 2 or 3 frames and that'd be enough to
get the point across like this drawing I
did of me typing away on a keyboard
which is just two frames looking at
frames can be helpful if you want to
study motion and timing like an
animation you're creating an illusion of
movement through a bunch of still images
put together the more frames you have in
your file the smoother the motion will
be and the more complex your animations
can get not to mention your file size
gets bigger too here's one that's made
of 5 frames so let's make a gif
I'm going to open up this gif in
Photoshop and use it as a guide to draw
a version of yourself breakdancing and
I'll have a link to this gif in the
description box below basically you're
going to draw over this using it as a
guide and it's kind of like a technique
called rotoscoping in which animators
draw over live-action footage now we
have our gift opened up in Photoshop and
you can see I have the five layers here
and the animation timeline on the bottom
and the layers panel is where you can
see which layers will be visible
in each frame so I'm going to use this
as a stencil and create a new kit so I'm
going to create a new layer here and
adjust the opacity of the bottom layer
so I can use that as a guide and I'm
just gonna draw maybe like a bear over
this so now that we've drawn our five
layers we're gonna go back and delete
the original stencils that we worked off
of just to clean up
now go to the timeline and set it so
that each frame is showing one layer at
a time so we're gonna start on the first
frame and make it so that the first
layer is the only layer that's visible
and do the same for the second frame but
we this time it's the second there
that's visible and you're gonna do this
for each frame in the timeline just make
sure that only one layer is being shown
at a time so now that we've cleaned up
everything let's test this out and press
play by pressing the spacebar and it
looks like he's going kind of slow so we
can address the speed of the animation
here you can go to the bottom of the
frames in the timeline and this panel
shows exactly how long each frame will
be shown so I'm gonna change this to 0.1
seconds and you can do this for each
frame and let's test that out so that
looks great so now let's talk about how
we're going to export this so you can
actually use it on the web so before we
go to export make sure you go below the
timeline and set looping to forever
because you want to keep dancing forever
and then you go to file export save for
web and make sure the looping options
here are also set to forever and here in
this window you can set your gif file
size keep in mind that most platforms
have file limits of like 5 megabytes and
it looks like we're way under that so
we're in the clear so just hit save and
you're ready to have so now let's take a
look at our finished products
I'm just so filled with pride looking at
me dancing there son
I think I would use this to express like
a victory dance or I'm like TGIF
whatever I'm just really happy to see it
go
thanks for watching for more videos like
this make sure to subscribe to the verge
and let me know in the comments how you
pronounce gif is it gif or gif its gift
either way I expect all of you to be
tweeting me your gifts</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
