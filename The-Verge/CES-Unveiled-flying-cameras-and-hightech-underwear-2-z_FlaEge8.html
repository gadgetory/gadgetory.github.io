Digital shower so first Wi-Fi and
cloud-based digital shower in the
marketplace possible to prank a loved

and boxes of the boxes of the future and
they're high-tech boxes which protects
your manhood from cellphone and Wi-Fi
radiation you know what I think this
business takes a lot of balls so I
congratulate we're looking at a hovering

I've ever dreamed of it takes the
guesswork out of taking a selfie is it
safe yeah so when I launched it it was
just swinging around when the brother
poni sure we haven't come to that guy
okay all right
he loves him tell him I've heard a story
that is a perfect CES story an exhibitor
of intelligent Underpants was not
allowed to be exhibiting and so he got
kicked out meanwhile intrepid reporter
Ben popper of the verge calm has his own
pair on and he's just wandering around
and the guy who owns the pair is gone
he's literally an underpants bandit and
you stole the underpants I'm trying to
get him back they got kicked out so
you've just got illegal illegal pants
I've got electro-magnetic pants my
friends all right
