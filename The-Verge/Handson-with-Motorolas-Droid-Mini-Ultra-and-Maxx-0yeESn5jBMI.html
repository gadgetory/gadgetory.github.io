i'm here with jeff from motorola and
three of the new asteroids on verizon
literally in order of size this is the
droid mini which has a 4.3 inch 720p
display the ultra which has a 5-inch
720p display and then the droid maxx
which has the same 5-inch 720p display
but has a 3,500 milliamp hour battery
it's just a millimeter thicker than the
ultra if you look at it but other than
that the hardware's all the same inside
it's a 1.7 gigahertz eight-core
processor it's got two cpu cores for
GPUs one core that there's nothing but
listen for your voice and your natural
image processing another one that does
nothing but monitor the sensor should
knows higher waving the phone around the
software is all the same so let's take a
closer look so here's the droid maxx as
you can see the software is virtually
exactly same stock there's a couple
little differences that i've noticed one
obviously is Motorola's widget which is
now called the droid command center and
if you swipe on it you can see it lets
you do miracast it has a bunch of other
little things what's you go right into
settings right away which is cool
they've changed from stock this is
totally mind of difference they've
changed these two buttons that one
dismiss is all your notification that
one goes right into quick settings they
still do have the two-finger swipe down
for quick settings so really this is
exactly the same as stock with just
these few minor changes and of course
because it's on verizon there are a
number of rows and apps that shouldn't
be there but there they are there are
some new features here so if i turn this
off and just waggle the phone it opens
right into the camera you don't have to
do with that much i just don't know how
to do it very well yet but that right
opens camera then i can look out here
there's David Pierce I can just hold
down the button it will focus and start
it's taken seven pictures of David right
away there so that's pretty cool now if
I turn this off and I get a text message
from my buddy Jeff over here the phone
will light up only that part of the
display turns on and I can grab it and I
can swipe up to go to messages or I can
go down to dismiss it that's Motorola's
active display which is pretty cool
really useful so that pop right into
messages another big feature is called
droid zap which jeff over here shared a
photo from his droid and then
or a few minutes every other droid
within 100 meters can find it so all you
do is you take two fingers you swipe
down this screen it says looking around
it actually logs to your google cloud
and it it says I found something and now
it's automatically if you look here it's
saved it's found a photo it's received
it automatically saved it to the library
so that came from Jeff's phone it went
up to Google servers and came down using
SAP this photos are available for two
minutes two minutes two minutes and then
they automatically disappear so there's
going to be an app for Android that lets
anybody receive the photos it should
probably also let you send the photos in
Android but for right now the Android
app for an android phones will only let
you receive a formal and the other big
feature undestroyed Zyzz touchless
control which is basically voice
commands for the phone connected to
Google now the interesting thing is that
it learns your voice and doesn't respond
to everybody's voice so if I say okay
Google now it doesn't do anything but
this one knows Jeff's voice so if he
tries it ok Google now navigate to Times
Square can still doesn't Oh does listen
to it navigating to x squared very nice
so let me ask you that's this thing all
the time is it always doing the
recognition up to Google servers or is
it doing that locally it's recognizing
for that trigger on a local basis just
so that's only way up that's not it's
using that one of those cores and that's
not it's not on all the time because
that's a big deal right correct right
it's a low power core it's always
looking out for that trigger phrase so
that it can recognize it and then do
that voice command that follows right
afterwards that sent up to the Google
Cloud to use google now ok so it's not
google isn't listening to rats fracture
your phone is waiting for that command
ok and that's literally dedicated one
processing cord yep are you sure Google
isn't listening to you all the time
correct you're sure the NSA is a poor
we're positive it's a big deal Deb
middles answers very poor I'm sure you
from for him be rest assured where
they're not listening ok so what other
commands we use yeah not really so we
can do things like I'll turn it back off
ok Google now what time is it in London
watching the time in London UK is 604
p.m. so any of the commands that you
have through google now can be accessed
through this ok so it's really tied to
google now yeah um is there any reason
that you chose ok Google now is the
catchphrase can change it is that what
way it worked out really well from a
from a sound perspective something that
was very distinct so that we the phone
will be able to recognize it very well
of course ties in with the breathing too
yeah so that's the new droid lineup very
cool actually the hardware is much nicer
than any of the previous droids and the
software to see something so close to
stock and I carried a branded device
just fills me with joy so tell people a
pricing and availability sure the droid
maxx and the droid ultra are both
available on August twentieth and there
are 2 99 for the droid maps and 199 for
the droid ultra and then nine days later
on August twenty-ninth you've got the
$99 droid mini yeah good things come to
those that way and you've got something
there oh yeah so I've got the red droid
ultra yeah same price same price same
same availability that's awesome its
cool the same Kevlar San deal yep
exactly very cool and that will be
twentieth forget August twentieth cool
so those are the new droids from motor
oil very nicely done thanks
