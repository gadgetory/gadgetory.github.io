is the new samsung galaxy note 10.1 2014
edition sure there are a ton of
different tablets available but
Samsung's Note tablets are key for the
stylus aficionado the new Tab 10.1
continues the tradition of a powerful
Android tablet with advanced stylus
support but the tablet is not without
its troubles
Samsung has completely redesigned the
Note 10.1 from last year besides being
slightly smaller thinner and lighter the
note has lost the smooth fingerprint
prone plastic backing in favor of a faux
leather texture there's actually quite
pleasant to hold the borders around the
display are a lot thinner and there's
now Samsung's trademark physical home
button sandwiched between two capacitive
buttons at the bottom overall the tablet
feels much more mature it's not just the
industrial design that's gotten better
the Note 10.1 now has a 2560 by 1600 LCD
display which is double the pixels of
last year's model the screen looks great
with text and images looking sharp and
bright but this quality screen is
nothing too special anymore
the Note 10.1 is finally caught up to
tablets like the Nexus 10 and the iPad
inside the Note 10.1 everything has
gotten an upgrade there's a 1.9
gigahertz quad core Exynos processor
with a whopping 3 gigabytes of RAM and
the rear facing camera is now 8
megapixels the 10.1 comes pre-installed
with Android 4.3 jelly bean with of
course Samsung's TouchWiz interface
right on top as expected the s-pen plays
a new-and-improved role with a note
tablet there's now a widget called Air
Command that opens whenever you pull the
pen out or can be conjured by hovering
over the screen and pressing the S pen's
button this allows users to take a quick
screen capture jot a new note open a
search or open an app in a tiny window
by drawing a rectangle on the screen
handwriting can also be used for any
text field by hovering the pen and
tapping a small button that appears and
the transcription is pretty accurate the
biggest addition to the notes user
interface is the magazine style
interface that's reminiscent of the HTC
ones blinkfeed but better
powered by Flipboard there's a different
column for different types of content
titled news personal here now and social
the biggest issue with the 10.1 is that
the interface is still frustratingly
slow despite the big boost in power
there was still trace amounts of
stuttering when swiping between home
screens especially if I hadn't used the
device for a few min
it's the magazine interface was the
worst offender sometimes taking a second
or two to recognize a swipe up gesture
we had the same issues with last year's
Note 10.1 and while this is an
improvement it's by no means fixed even
last year's Nexus 10 felt faster to me
the 2014 edition Note 10.1 is definitely
faster and better looking than last
year's model and if you've got to have a
stylus there is absolutely no better
tablet on the market right now but 540
999 is quite a lot of money for a tablet
that just doesn't feel cutting-edge
especially when you can get an iPad for
$4.99 or the Nexus 10 for 399 the s-pen
support is handy but doesn't make up for
what feels like last year's technology</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
