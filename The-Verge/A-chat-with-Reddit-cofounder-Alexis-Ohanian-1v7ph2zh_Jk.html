I'm in our studio and Alexis Ohanian
just say read it on your badge just as
reddit does he does just say read it
also but generally on Devon it ended up
down Internet bro I just rolled in and
demanded to go on air so here we are I
got I got pretty feisty you guys had you
guys had a nice comfortable sofas and I
mean it's a very nice so thank you
anyway so let's just you're here
actually - you just had a press
conference about a bunch of senators I
did your fancy yeah what happened there
well you know that a number of US
Senator Wyden senator Moran myself and
Scott case we all came there to
basically have a press conference about
this sort of state of the open Internet
talking about Internet freedom and
taking questions from the press but you
know those two senators have been really
at the forefront of championing this and
and you know they represent very
different political parties and yet like
so many Americans can agree on the open
Internet being awesome and wanting to
preserve it at all cost right you know I
think I don't know who I was talking to
you but it was somebody told me that if
you asked Americans to rank their
primary needs they would pick the
internet over water in many cases it
wasn't it also over sex yeah where am I
there is it's like you know it's the
hierarchy of needs has been in like the
internet has like snuck in over this
hello yeah he could have never seen the
internet coming right I didn't know man
you don't have a ps3 he of maslow
Samsung gs3 he's like oh game Cheney
writing who's gonna be too busy playing
Angry Birds
exacta bother getting it all done well
it's like yeah I will say this I come to
CS every year and I for the past few
years I did I tried to do a bunch of
policy stuff like chase down Julius
Genachowski last year I've talked to
senators I've gone to the panels and not
too harsh on your vibe but to me it
seems like a lot of nothing gets set at
CES about policy everybody comes here
they take the closed-door meeting just
with ATT
you know Verizon waves its Hansen led
into those meetings for some reason lot
and they do not invite me to those
meetings but how do you your the stuff
that you're doing here the policy kind
of stuff you do and yeah I know that you
tell me your some of your policies very
narrow it's the internet is good and
everybody agrees with you it's a nice
but how do you go from everybody agrees
with you
to making things happen that are good
especially to show like this yeah and
you know and in what is what is a little
this what is a little disconcerting to
is you know everyone here is pretty much
on board with this like if there's a big
echo chamber here because we're all and
we've what no matter where we are in our
necessary well pretty much support this
and the people really need to convince
you know why using the Verizon support
this the ones who I actually get to talk
to I do support it you're right the that
I think the challenge for us and this is
what I don't like thinking about policy
specifically is this to make this an
issue that is just I don't that is that
is being tackled from know from from all
of us doing our various things as voters
as entrepreneurs and so when I see
things like so specifically kazumi we
did this internet 2012 bus tour right we
did this bus tour from Denver to
Danville to basically show off all of
the innovation going on yes how could
TCC did a fabulous job yeah and so we
debuted our documentary called silicon
Prairie which we showed it here but I'm
more excited to be showing it in DC on
Tuesday at the Newseum and hopefully get
all these people in Washington realizing
that like they all have a digital
district I think that's that's my
favorite catchphrase that they come out
of this weekend because it's not just
you know if you're in Silicon Valley
it's it's every district in America has
constituents who care about this and you
know these policy discussions yeah
they're not gonna go anywhere until it
is so clear that every American cares
about this that making a decision
against the best interests the open
Internet is gonna upset all of your
voters and make sure you don't have a
job well you know I think it's really
interesting and it's funny how politics
is changing in a place like Kansas City
where Google drops in Google Fiber this
and now there's just like vibrant
startup economy you can't see that's
just happening because there's real
connectivity there yeah it's in a very
serious way and that will change once
you get a flood of entrepreneurs in a
place where they haven't been the local
community in the local politics will
change and we and we see this happening
we saw this happening in downtown's all
over where you know for decades these
downtown's were derelict these buildings
were abandoned and startup communities
are moving in there because they're
getting you know large space great rates
downtown hubs with bars and restaurants
all set we're seeing these communities
be reborn thanks to the Internet economy
and what gules done has been so great
because it's you know I I think what I
like I I'd like to think of myself as a
doer and I think some of the people
doing great stuff right now are yeah
that's the key word is that they're
doing it and so Google actually did what
everyone said was not possible to
expensive we can't have the fastest
enter in the world at a reasonable price
but they're doing it and once you do it
it becomes really hard for all their
competitors to hem and haw about oh
that's not possible
so that that kind of stuff is exciting
right I want to look to activate more of
those kinds of projects because it's
gonna motivate other people to follow
suit and actually realize how big of a
deal this is do you think are you
getting a good vibe at this at this show
in particular yes I mean again it's the
there is an active champion yes right if
we're we're all you know don't get
invited to 18 team meetings but those of
us who are here and actively talk I just
imagine them like everyone's got cat on
there yeah they're all we're dressed on
black and they're like a red tie you
know it's like hmm yes what can we do
about it we'll take Google Wallet off of
the phone yes we cut a competition no
you know if you go to horizons with and
Verizon through three fairs are very
impressive but you know if you go to it
what's really interesting about it is
the phones are pushed all the way to the
back where Verizon doesn't want to talk
about phones it's yes they want to talk
about a bunch of other devices right
here's a bunch of tablets here's like a
some weird crap for your house it's all
connected to our network but they don't
want to talk about how when they bought
the 700 megahertz spectrum from the
government Google basically forced them
to sign an open access provision so any
device could use it it's been years and
years and literally no devices that use
that provision have ever come to the
table yeah
and that means that you know Vizio
announced phones here they're nice you
know they're competitive with Sony right
5-inch 1080p they're compared with any
Android phone but they're going to China
to sell those phones because they can't
get on the American carriers here and
that's like if the Internet's that
important then we need to get 18t and
Verizon in the conversation it really in
a very proactive determined way and say
the Internet's important the mobile
internet I think is
more important mmm well when you start
talking about if not I mean don't get me
started on the importance of tiny
internet but yes big we need bigger
phones and smaller and it is again it's
so I mean when you hear stories like
that and it's like they found more
opportunity for their business in China
like that is not a sentence that you'd
like a as an entrepreneur here in the
States like it hurts me to hear that
utter and competition is ultimately
gonna make all of our lives better as
consumers and we just want better stuff
and yeah you know incumbents may not
like that but the spirit of this whole
capitalist system is I think
competition's gonna concert it's rough
it's gonna have to disrupt you and and
it's frustrating because we encountered
this with soap and PIPA we continue to
encounter it and I I mean fortunately we
have a voice as consumer right we have
more ways than ever to be able to let
people know what's what and what's cool
and we're talking this earlier there are
more and more new and new entrants to
the world of hardware thanks to things
like Kickstarter thanks to all the new
things that are you know showing up here
at CES now that a few years ago we're in
a garage that started out as
conversation over beer so we should talk
with this because should I know I feel
like your your your foot in the door of
the policy world is actually you want
life to be better for startups because
you're really start-up guy yes and so
your policy so if I know it's very
public but really you're just trying to
make money with your startup it's very
straight community solution which is
great I don't know what I would do with
my life if I did not have the startup
economy I don't know I would probably be
a lawyer right remember that here's what
I think is a real interesting story at
the CES there is a whole like giant
collection of essentially Kickstarter
projects here that are the story of the
show so the pebble guys had a press
conference this morning the SmartWatch
that thing looks amazing
we had the oculus rift on our show
yesterday that's a Kickstarter project
the immersive head-tracking
we just we're actually just here with
another guy the Central Standard Time
inquiry Ennis watch all these indie
hardware developers who are you know
crowdfunded essentially and they're
making cool products I think that's a
great story here that there's hardware
startups doing innovative things I think
there are lots and lots of question
marks about how they go from I'm a guy
at a cool idea and raised 100,000
of million dollars - I'm a company yes
how do they how do they make that job
you know and I know I know the Pebble
watch team well because they were in Y
Combinator they did an interesting story
because they could not raise money they
went to AngelList you know they'd had
the sort of blessing of YC they still
can raise money because people were
scared about hardware you know they
built prototypes and they went to
Kickstarter and you know very famously
raised ten million dollars and I I hope
I really hope not just because I'm
friends with them but I really hope that
they succeed and really deliver a great
product we're all hoping it is because
you know that's a ten million dollar
campaign that everyone's looking at to
see if this means you can start a real
company I think I think there are a lot
of doable smart people on both sides who
think a they're definitely gonna make it
right we're gonna crash out is this
crowdfunding like the height bubble will
basically pop there is I think there is
we're undoubtedly due for a spectacular
failure there's gonna have to be
somewhere to come and that raises
millions on kick well actually won't
even be able to raise on Kickstarter
anymore because there are constraints
about like a creative project versus a
hardware on but you know crowdfunding is
gonna involve someone will crowd fun a
ton of money for something out of a
garage that's gonna be spectacular
failure and everyone's gonna be like dub
TF but I think up dub TF yes I the
broader hardware industry is resilient
enough and the costs of getting this
stuff started keep falling enough that
that I think consumers so long as
they're prepared with you know what
they're doing
taking setbacks gamble and accept the
risk buyer beware but beyond that to
know that like pre-order or beware I
think it's gonna mean more innovation
and more cool stuff and I hope I hope
the larger companies look at this and
instead of thinking I mean we all see
this right we see hardware that you know
it may be it's it's got some shine on
it's got a little polish at Bell and
whistle but at the end of the day no one
probably actually wants it right and and
let me ask you this how do you avoid
making something no one wants well what
if you started with this pre-order what
have you started with that man so
there's I mean there's two things there
that I think are are gonna be challenges
I think in the industry large because I
I think looking at this CS I think the
vibe of it is very much more like the
beginning of like the computer era right
bunch of guys and garages trying all
kinds of crazy stuff they're enabled by
basically smartphone platforms so people
are like now I have a smart friend what
else can I do with it and there's like
try all this other stuff
and I think that's where the Pebble
watch comes in I think that's all the
body tracking stuff the Fitbit but I
also think that there is like you know
two years ago I came to the show and a
soos was here they're kind of a new
company right they're just being
introduced to the world and they had
like a thousand crazy concepts and maybe
nobody wanted them but like you put them
on the map none of them ever shipped
what I mean these are a difference I
mean is there a difference between as
soos and maybe some other Chinese
company here that we've never heard of
doing crazy stuff it's a big corporate
level Samsung showing off curved phones
that are never gonna ship and then this
like economy of like little guys I you
know I want to believe I really want to
believe that the more people we can get
trying crazy be better off as long
as we know that most of its probably
gonna fail as I mean as a start-up
investor I certainly think about that
with software right and and hardware is
still more complex obviously you know
you have a we have 10,000 broken widgets
like it's a lot harder than just Matt
Rogers from Nesta near and their startup
and obviously they're well funded
they've got a lot of very smart people
from Apple and he was like to ship our
first product took 70 people it's a
thermostat right he's like you know
they're using smartphone part they
basically built the smartphone can
control your your furnace any is like it
took 70 people to make that project it's
like I don't know that you can crowd
fund your way into 70 people hmm yeah I
mean it's to be seen I know the Pebble
watch team is maybe two dozen yeah how
many minutes and you know it's it we're
still I guess what gives me hope and I
am the glass is not half full but you
guys it's the car waterfall it's not
enclosed I announced mister guy and I
really want to believe that long term it
is gonna thank you well thank you that's
very empowering of you long term is
without empty I just wanna say we're
coming from right now oh geez but I
absolutely see a future where you know
we are now what two three years into the
Kickstarter experiment right it's still
so early so early that the the long-term
future just it makes a lot more sense to
me that you would build something as
intensive as hardware
whether it's a thermostat or a watch
based on demand as opposed to building
it and trying it Hollywood style of just
like throwing enough ads and trying to
convince someone that sure you know John
Carter is gonna be a good movie
which I haven't seen that's presently
John Carter's a terrible is a battle
occur based on a classic it's like my
cannon yeah but the thing is that the
other movies that came out after after
that you know there's so many other
movies that ripped off through it well
yeah but now John Carter seems cliché
it's like uh it's like Van Halen Van
Halen guitar solos seem really cheesy do
you know and you think he he was the
first guy who rocked out the guitar
thing huh I'm easiness factor taxes well
it's the price of fame someday if people
are gonna think you're super cheesy
they're so famous I think they already
do does that mean I'm super famous or
just super cheers the mayor of humans
it's far off the road ah no I mean let
me ask you this is there a not a danger
that if you are Samsung or you are a
sewer whatever lanova any of these huge
companies you're just gonna start
looking at Kickstarter hmm and you're
gonna say man these four kids in a
garage are generating a lot of demand
for this watch but we're Samsung and we
can kick out the watch tomorrow
yeah and steal their thunder yeah and we
don't have to do focus groups anymore
the so yes in theory that makes sense
it's dastardly but it's certainly been
done before I mean I think dastardly is
actually the ground state of the
industry like when things aren't
dastardly I'm like something weird is
going is that right okay fair enough but
the thing the thing that I look at right
now and present is that like every one
of these every one of those hardware
companies you just named they probably
all sit around the boardroom with their
Apple devices in her life so we need to
do this and yeah there's there's that
side of stuff there's a whole nother
issue but like every one of them has an
example of how to make this kind how to
design this kind of thing that people
clearly want right that's beautiful
that's well design that's well thought
out okay and yet they still can't really
do a good enough job replicating it sure
I mean that's there's there's been a lot
of progress made but it's still like go
accessories you can't counter that oh I
mean I own if you have a device but it
is
I don't know sure it's hard to capture
that spirit and I and I I am foreign to
the world of hardware but I know for
startups we are we are never afraid of
being combin trying to copy what we do
so specifically like the Hipmunk
google launches Google flight search
great job Google that's awesome we don't
care because they don't care enough
about solving this problem as our team
does and I think in many ways validating
your model precisely yeah and so I think
and I know hardware's the different bug
in but I think it's it's the same way
for these upstart companies and if they
were to get copied and replicated it's
still when weather it wouldn't feel
genuine it wouldn't work as well I just
wouldn't I don't know it I don't I still
believe they get executed nearly as well
as a team that's so wholeheartedly
focused on it right I mean I my response
to that would be to focus on the
hardware software difference because
it's really hard to do software but I
think if you are Samsung it's way easier
for you to do hardware than any team of
Indies and I think the cost and the
scale and getting the distribution and
going to Best Buy here Sampson gave me a
hundred thousand I think your Samsung
you can say we're gonna make a point
shoot camera that's an Android device
and make 18 key sell it even though it's
not even though it's a more of a concept
part than the kind of real products yeah
once you bring 18 Verizon that just
muddles everything open it
come all the way right so important well
wait a bit real quick though you
mentioned something Best Buy is that a
to sell hardware but what he's got a go
some what is a Best Buy is that a is
that it's a place where you don't buy
Hardware where do you buy all your
hardware to net you don't buy it all you
got to go to Amazon like right so I'm
just I I wear as as this world continues
to get disrupted you know the importance
that obviously you know it's still
nothing to laugh at you get that where
do you buy your having the internet you
know where the regular people buy it
from the Apple Store oh the regular
people yeah they're not not the mayor
not the Nerds yeah really yeah I mean
okay yes I've seen the lines and yeah
yes you've seen the massive success here
they've done yes you see Microsoft
Samsung racing to copy their strategy
that is like well and that's and here's
another example where yeah you know and
I've walked by the Microsoft Store in
New York and it's like okay it's sleek
its polished but uh
they don't have the hardware you can't
sew software at the store right right an
Apple strategy there's a software online
mmm successful yes they saw all the
hardware products in the store and when
you go to the store to buy software they
hand you a gift card until you go online
yeah I need to spend more time in the
real world
thank your oculus rift off and come back
to the brittle but this is interesting I
do hope I mean again bring a lot of hope
to this table cuz I got my glasses you
see what happened is my glasses snap
like way in the gray is as so long as
our expectations are set appropriately
as preorder errs or backers whatever you
want to call it right I I can't help but
feel like we're gonna get better stuff
because you know for four decades
you know these industries do that maybe
they do a lot of navel-gazing no matter
whether it's hardware soft whatever it
is and to be able to just say like
you've got a garage you can you know
I've got a 3d printer like you do this
Artie there I think I think there is an
one and a hopeful note good I'll try
I'll see you it I'll see if I can do
this I need to give someone yeah please
oh god just so good oh yeah that's it oh
you're gonna like start crying no I will
say this we talk a lot as we cover the
show and we were here in force you've
got 68 people rolling beans we talk a
lot about how covering the show for us
isn't necessarily all about the news the
news is important and the product
announcements are great whatever but the
visceral experience of we're here the
entire industry is here everybody you
could possibly want to talk to is here
and everybody thinks the world is cool
and gonna do better stuff we're trying
to communicate that to like basically
myself as a teenager
that's what I think of my reader eyes
right I think if you like the mass of
our readers is people who love
technology who don't have the
opportunity to come here who want to see
what's going on and I think there's
something far better about let's show
them all these startups particularly
hardware startups doing things like the
oculus rift did we try this thing I'll
have none you gotta find it the other is
this immersive head tracking display it
is like you are in another world it is
the future for gaming for gaming we can
run around one is this the one the
Carmack pitch yeah a starter video or
look you know that's so on and we hit us
okay I mean that thing is amazing all
you did say was Carmack and
they're done they were here we did we
had them on our show top shelf yesterday
and then they set up in the little
office in a trailer and we had a line 30
people are steps to the line
waiting to try this thing out for a
minute each because it is so crazy and I
think saying and the inventor II was the
guy who invented it and his product
right now you know here to announce the
product eyes plastic case but the one
that we use was like literally like
wires and circuit boards and a box
together yeah and it's like well that's
awesome
right I mean it that's like you don't
have to go work for Samsung yeah you
don't have to try to get a job at Apple
yeah which is a daunting task you can
just try to make stuff and what is so
what is so big it's working gentlemen
what is so important about that
storytelling is it is showing and it is
showing it when it's just an ugly hack
it is showing it before it's the
polished thing and we're all looking at
that comes out of the box and smells all
new like because when you look at that
and you see the ugly hack you're like
wow like this started out as a pretty
humble looking piece of hardware and it
makes some teenager think oh okay this
is accessible this is how I do it I show
you will finish the iPod in your life
come on I don't know I don't know
Japanese miniature Asian experience let
alone an army of under page Chinese
employees to manufacture at scale soon
we'll have those than throughout our
line because of the open Internet think
about it wait what I don't know I'm just
trying to I'm trying to get you to well
no I mean that I will say that I will
say that the thing that's different
about the isuzu concept cars and the
bunch of any people trying to make stuff
and maybe failing is that that story is
inspiring yeah the suits making weird
stuff is like maybe even maybe you can
buy this maybe you can yeah I don't
think there's a lot of kids out there
trying to build their own cars after car
shows they're probably not ya know but
they who knows if 3d printing takes off
like we hope it will like you what's
your you have a 3d printers startup in
your labs I I do not actually well you
know down the street from me is MakerBot
right make a muscle represent in
Brooklyn yeah but they you know I I'm so
I love talking to 3d printing
enthusiasts because they are there
they're there are 10 years and if yes
they're already living in they know
exactly that I'm a little bit more cost
in terms of where this is all going I
mean I'm I'm I I expect a really
hopefully awesome future where yeah but
you know the idea of doing may be
impractical oh man dude this is true
there's a lot of Hope going on here but
they're you know we're manufacturing
does actually start coming back here and
actually rapid prototyping can happen
for an upstart we actually met one in
Boulder on the bus tour that does all of
their prototyping right there they got a
3d printer they make these badass sort
of like 21st century Legos these little
cubes that stick together and start
worrying or spinning and rotating anyway
they do all of their manufacturing
except for a few basic circuits right
there in Colorado and they can do so
with some 3d printers and and it's like
again it's still so early but you can
get a glimpse in know what's gonna
hopefully be a pretty awesome next five
to ten years so two questions Jenna sure
what's your what's the best thing you've
seen here so far the best thing aside
from The Verge contest had me beat me to
it um well I and again I'm biased
because I'm chummy with the pebble guys
but I am I'm really really hopeful I'm
just continuous to be like like I I
really think it's gonna I mean I'm
looking forward I got the black one I'm
really hoping it meets and lives out the
expectation so yeah I probably pebble
and then what was your second question
my last question is the question I'm
asking everybody what what apps are here
on screen
I don't know my doing my phone on me I
think okay let's see Evernote how good
um I want to turn my phone off because I
want to be a responsible interviewee I
haven't no alien blue of course for
reading the reddit we don't have an
official app at reddit there's an
Australian developer who's awesome made
the alien blue read it out which you
should all download and a bunch of
random stuff I only recently discovered
Gmail as an app on the iPhone I'm just
using the janky what is wrong with mail
it's really good weeks I know and I
think I used to it's like proof that
Google is getting really good at design
yeah we'll be while apples like East
figure out cloud service oh man have you
tried Maps lately okay well we were out
of time thank you so much lesser people
who are watching you should stick around
top shelf is coming up at 3:00 for some
time very soon
three o'clock tops tops coming to three
so stick around we're actually gonna
have all of the watches we've been
talking about the pebble the Central
Standard Time in the world's thinnest
