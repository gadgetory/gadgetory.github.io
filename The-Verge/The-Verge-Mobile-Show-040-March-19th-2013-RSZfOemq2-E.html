the Virgin Mobile show it is the 40th
episode it's the week in march 18th we
have eight hum of news and we're going
to jump into it no snappy banter no
chitchat no no fast and furious jokes I
am dieter bohn hi I'm flats mo i'm dan
seifert and i'm chris ziegler um yeah no
I don't want to chitchat I'll talk to
you guys I don't care about your lives
or your personal feelings on anything
ever I just want to talk about the
galaxy s4 because it's finally been
announced in an insane and majestic show
last week and we've seen it and it's big
and man I don't even know where to start
dan you were there yeah yeah so I was
there for that spectacle um the Broadway
show if you will instead of a product
launch and yeah I mean we we covered it
quite a bit on the site and Neil I did a
really interesting report where he
talked to the behind the scenes people
who actually produced it and as far as
press events go I guess it could say it
was a up there as one of the most
memorable ones but probably not for the
best reasons you know it's I I said this
before but like you know as as press we
kind of just want to go there we want to
see the news you want to be shown the
news and we wanted to be like wrapped up
if we want to get our job done and this
was much more of a show than an
informative thing so it was a bit
grating for us but I guess if Samsung
was trying to entertain people it did do
that to some extent but it also managed
to rub a lot of people the wrong way
with the way that some of the characters
were portrayed in Samsung's little
vignettes so yeah I mean I guess let's
just talk through the event before we
get into you know the device itself I
mean Samsung with the the galaxy s
series always has this problem where its
primary set of differentiators is the
massive slew of features that it packs
in on top of Android and so we had a
whole bunch of them here but actually
communicating that without having a you
know a single sort of thesis statement
or whatever is difficult and so they're
angled Eric around
narrative thank you thank you their
angle was to like try and put a Broadway
narrative on top of it by having all
these little vignettes all these little
stories about the different ways of the
features that they're adding in might be
useful to your life and they hire a
writer abroad yeah i'm sorta the idea
for the broadway show is because they
were having their men at radio city
music hall in new york city which is you
know world famous theater and it seats
like 6,000 people so now that was their
whole angle with the broadway thing but
you can go on no that's that's about the
size of it that the problem was in the
neil i got into this with his sort of
behind-the-scenes look at how it came
together is you know the people from
broadway put together a pretty edgy show
and then it went through the standard
corporate meat grinder of let's not
offend any of our potential customers or
audiences and what that ended up meeting
was that a lot of the stuff especially
that portrayal of women came off as
let's be gentle and say it came off as
ham-handed oh yeah well i mean this is
this do you think saying one is as you
say deed said they set off with a much
edgy show and there are some remnants of
it insofar as the whatever DMC or the
guy who's leading the whole show was
saying our fake family and such and such
oh that would be the case if it wasn't
an actor and then they had a chinese
actor who spoken perfect in a perfect
American accent because he's a
chinese-american etc etc so to all these
little hints of self-awareness which
hinted at the edges show that the
producers were coming up with but as you
say putting it through the corporate
approval process probably softened then
neutralized a lot of that self satire I
think but that's why i SPECT the other
is that companies exemption I feel feel
compelled to do these shows and I'm not
sure that they may benefit from them all
that much like okay people are giving a
publicity about it but frankly people
getting publicity together says for
whatever happens they were given their
building it up before the event and they
talked about it after the event and it
also talks about the device itself like
well I mean
they did get a crowd at Times Square to
show up oh yeah and they also i think
this is important they got apple to trip
over itself trying to do some you know
call it defensive sort of you know
pre-event making fun of samsung in a way
that didn't really work out especially
well for apple so i think that it's a
big moment in terms of the apple vs
samsung story and it's a big moment for
samsung itself because and this gets to
your story about a flat that it the s4
shows that samsung is confident enough
to not try and you know reinvent the
wheel every year they feel like they can
put out something that matches their
design language and sort of feels like
an s3 s and and do it which is something
i don't think any any other android
manufacturer has the confidence to do
right now right yeah i mean that's been
kind of the theme samsung chasing apple
and emulating apple but we just finish
up the other point about the whole event
structure in styling i don't think that
pushing your product dirty things I the
time square thing investing heavily in
marketing is a bad idea too but I think
these companies can actually stick to do
tried and trusted where it's a company
we're just going to do is take away
instead of trying to also delve into
popular culture and try and be savvy and
smart and all of those things because
those things really hard to achieve I
think the Steve Jobs keynotes have set a
really high standard insofar as
demonstrating features by showing how it
will be used and I don't think that many
people could do he was able to do out of
think apple's keynote so now as library
or as compelling as when he was doing
them and performing them but everyone is
still kind of trying to emulate that
style but everyone is still trying to
call for something really special for an
event whereas people could or companies
could actually rely on the strength of
their product and to some extent they
could just say Samsung is doing that
with galaxy s4 because it's saying we've
got the features with other components
and we think our design is already good
enough ah
now that's the debate school part
because somebody already said in the
comments so that bubble show posts in
the site is I can't wait for the part
where somebody complains about plastic
or is just as blessed as the galaxy it's
free and quite frankly if you put a two
side by side yes the s4 is the bigger
device but it takes you a while to
recognize which is actually the new
advice there's a similar yes yeah that
does the striking thing that when I
actually got to touch the device and
hold on to it is like I I mean if you if
I was walking by a table and there was a
galaxy s3 in the galaxy s4 sitting next
to each other and I was just walking by
and I looked at him I wouldn't really be
able to tell the difference between the
two without taking a closer look like
they're exceptionally similar and even
as what I mentioned the 4 has a larger
screen but Samsung managed to make the
rest of the phone smaller around the
screen so there's there's even a
minimized difference between the size of
the devices so it's and I'm sure we'll
go into this more with the hardware
itself but is they are strikingly
similar as far as design did build
quality goes so I got a chance to play
with 14 just like five minutes at the
engadget expand conference and actually
Samsung have one of their design guys up
on stage talking about he specifically
mentioned this plastic thing and it's
the story that you'd expect which is
Samsung cares about putting a removable
battery in there they think that's
important and so for them that means
they know how to do that using a plastic
back and so that's what they went with
and yeah it does feel plasticky and
doesn't feel like SuperDuper crazy
premium but i will say that i think it
does feel better than the s3 I think
that I don't know if the may the rail
around the edge is metal now or if it's
still plastic but it feels way better
than the rail did on the s3 so I mean
it's I think it's it feels slightly
better it doesn't look all that great in
photos but at the end of the day you
know samsung believes in this you know
plastic and they haven't really done a
ton to make it feel like awesome
polycarbonate but it you know if that
bothers you you know get the 1i guess
but it's it's a trade-off and that's the
trade-off that they might with
well it's interesting that the plastic
actually has this like patterned
textured look to it that makes you think
that it's almost going to have a
textured feel but that's actually
covered by a really thick sheen of gloss
so when you see the back of it wanted
photos you've got this like a hatch
thatch mark pattern or whatever that you
see in photos but when you actually
touch it it's just as smooth and slick
as the galaxy s3 so I don't know why
they did it make it texture at all which
i think would aid to their enhance the
quality feel and obviously give you a
little bit more to grip but that's way
it is well I think the glossy grip is
this grippy like they're glossy thing
like it doesn't slip out of your hand it
just doesn't feel premium right right I
mean the idea of that glossy bag doesn't
fill me with much confidence that I
would love it if I picked it up and but
I'm just thinking about that ASA do some
really nice pets and backs and their
phones like the liquid line which you
know actually budget and mid-range and
low-end devices for the most part is
what ASA produces so it's odd to me like
it's not that Samsung can forward it
Samson definitely can't afford to use
higher grade plastics it's just a choice
read on the company's pot like they
could make them mad they could make them
textured they could put a you know
patted on the back something that's
scrivere and better basically in the
hand they're just not doing it but those
are design choices one thing I'll say
though is actually got quite a bit of
stick when I reviewed the galaxy it's
free a year ago and I gave it a pretty
high school for design and everybody was
like and you know do you need to have
your eyes examined you know where in
your lenses etc have you looked to the
thing and does the point that I keep
making with respect to the experience
said as well which I gave a lower score
for design and most people expected
again because of the few and a hat like
I think ergonomics is so much more
important than looks because looks
matter to you in the first week plus a
couple of weeks but then you just kind
of start to ignore them and you just
looking at the display itself start
using the phone and that's when things
like the side now
power button samsung was one of the
early adopters of really matter
particularly with these large sizes
that's where the curvature of the back
which kind of makes it look like it
doesn't have a definitive shape where is
the galaxy it's free of the galaxy s4
you just don't have the you know the
sharpness of the design that you have
with the experience then but i still
take the samsung design / so anyone
because it's just so much more
comfortable to hold even as course is
it's yeah it's inspired by nature yeah
that's true the nature of your hand
which is ironic we didn't we didn't hear
any of that in this year's presentation
even though the software largely looks
the same and the hardware itself large
you must have had some blue stone you
know the water blue it definitely makes
the water bloops I don't think we heard
and nobody nobody during the
presentation commented that they had to
go to the bathroom because of its oh wow
yes we'll talk about our progress you
know what I went outside this I mean and
it the gaseous free bones last year they
had them the thing with the for cause
was it was that we said when they show
down and yes and and and they show the
big wind turbines and how one core is
blowing your hair back in two cores are
pushing your tied behind you then for
calls just blowing the guy out of the
screen I miss those little video clips
like everything if you want to see more
of these crazy you know made-up
analogies add two informants we like s
yeah I guess we should talk about specs
so processors just as with every phone
for the past couple years it's going to
have a different processor without LTE
out you know outside the US Samsung
Exynos 5 then the u.s. we're going to
have the Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 we've
got two gigs of RAM we've got a 2600
milliamp battery and of course we've got
a 5-inch display 1080p it is a super
amoled but I mean at that pixel
resolution I like to think that people
will not have a whole lot complain about
with the the pixel layout well Eddie
it's it that the pen tile layout is what
we would complain about I guess but
you're right dealer that that resolution
we're not going to have anything really
visible unless you're using a magnifying
glass to look for it my only issue that
I've always had with Super AMOLED
displays that I always have a very blue
cast compared to LCD displays so when we
put it side-by-side with say the HTC one
that always or at least last year with
the One X versus the galaxy s3 the 1x
had much truer colors then the samsung
but if you are just looking at the
samsung alone and not comparing it
side-by-side that's something that
you're less likely to notice yeah but
it's also kind of cruel to compare any
phone against the HTC One when it comes
to this place okay so we'll say that the
nexus 4 display or the iphone 5s display
or whatever is not using a super amoled
display but also i think there are a new
set of adjustments on the new galaxy s4
so it gives you more granular control in
terms of color temperature and things
like that I read this anyhow I haven't
seen it myself so previously samsung had
a couple of settings display settings
which let you kind of tone down the
saturation which is usually over the top
with Sam so example in this place but
now now think they're giving you more
grander control over what the display
does but besides that okay we just run
for it especially I mean frankly it's an
upgrade on pretty much everywhere but I
don't see where those things are just
going to emerge in the user experience
like when you pick up the phone you
start using anything it's so much fasten
guess it's free I don't think that's
ever going to happen maybe Danny you had
hands-on time with it how step is it's
fast i mean like i didn't i didn't
really see like like there's certain
phones that you pick up and you start
using them and it instantly feels choppy
maybe the frame rate isn't as high or
just isn't as responsive and there was
none of that with the the s4 but I you
know in the last time I use a galaxy s3
I don't remember really complaining
about the performer to be honest so I
you know it it has no trouble pushing
out the the pixels on the 1080p display
that doesn't seem to be holding it back
or anything the performance is very
fluid and very snappy and fast um I
didn't run any benchmarks on it in the
time when I had it so I can't speak to
that but as far as from a perception
user perception if you
very quick and fast yeah the benchmarks
that are out there right now it's off
the charts it just seems crazy fast yeah
and I mean the most high-end phones are
like I don't have performance issues
with them anymore like when I use the
nexus 4 you know I I've never once
complained about the performance of
speed or fluid pneus or performance on
the e92 complaint inviting about other
things yeah no I'm too busy can play
about other things but like you know i'm
not saying with the iphone 5 there's no
real issues there same with like a
high-end Windows Phone for the most part
you know the the lag eNOS and things
like that are kind of things that we
talked about a couple of years ago or on
lower end devices so you know I don't
expect it to be slow I didn't see it
being slow you know it's gonna be fast
how much faster and you may notice that
you may not we've also got a 13
megapixel camera and I we talked about
this with HTC one you know HTC went 2-4
and now Samsung's going to 13 and I'm
really hoping that it's way better than
the s3 because the s3 was just sort of
an a camera but I will see what they can
do with 13 megapixels I'm actually
shocked that they went to 13 megapixels
you didn't really need to write yeah I
thought they would stay with 8
megapixels and just improve the quality
of it kind of like what Apple did from
the 4 s to the 5 but you know will say
when when we actually see the results of
the images themselves I know that
Samsung is that itself has said that
people aren't complaining about the
image quality on smart phones cameras
these days I guess I don't know who
they're talking to because I complain
about it all the time but so I I know
that they and we'll talk about this with
the the software features but they you
know were more concerned with adding
crazy software features than going in a
crazy hardware direction on the camera
yeah they added like you can take a
picture with the front-facing camera on
the rear facing camera at the same time
and put smashing together they added an
action node where someone's running you
can get the whole series of them running
with the first mode they've got a thing
where it can automatically get rid of
like motion bombers by doing another
burst mode shot like there's just a ton
of camera features that i don't know
maybe people get there's even one the
there's a camera thing where it takes a
still image and records like eight
seconds of audio a little bit before you
get the shutter a little bit after like
in case you want to like have a picture
and like a still image and then narrate
it ok ok yeah well I think again from an
uninformed perspective and an experience
perspective I think the most interesting
thing is the ability to use the front
and rear facing cameras at the same time
I think that's available for photos the
video so the narration part I mean we
don't do it enough i think like taking
notes we keep typing away instead of you
know like old-school Twin Peaks pick up
the recorder and be like now what is
this about I didn't hook to yourself and
then listen to yourself and then have
these wonderful conversations with
yourself before they come in you know
take you away and but yeah I think these
narrations and these dual camera things
can be compelling and there's so much to
ourselves because we don't have that
many physical friends nearby to
videotape all the time but with
Samsung's demos of families you know
with the father actually showing up in
the photos and in the videos instead of
always being behind the camera I mean
nothin I can relate to that I have a
young daughter and I I take pictures
most of the time and it's mostly my
daughter my wife is supposed to you know
me it's it's never my wife and I because
my daughter's 14 months old so that's a
little much to ask of her at this point
but I mean I don't know if I think that
it's very weird to take a picture of a
scene or a couple of people and then
like have the front camera capture your
picture and then just jam that in there
like that yeah I me not going to go see
civ most of the time the picture of you
is gonna be something like this like yes
yes yeah or like squinting its or
whatever if I would have but I mean
sensors do something else they I think
they announced
is where they print out your photos as
well yeah you can get a hardcover books
made with your photos so they've
partnered up with a company that will
you can place the order right from your
phone and then you pay for it and it
gets shipped I think anywhere in the
world you know these these hardcover
bound books which is just just to throw
in the other thing which was that they
brought in from the galaxy note that the
whole idea that you can take notes on
the back of photos right yeah i think so
i think they did any happen I mean I I
just feel like yes Samsung is completely
carpet bombing us with these features
but some of them in some circumstances
it for some people can actually be
compelling a useful like oftentimes have
actually found that taking notes like
essentially it's a digital version of
taking notes on the back of the photo
where you flip the photo and then you
can take a note on the back I find those
things can be useful I you know a salad
right you can you can break your
ingredients on the back para that's
closely right see something that's how
you do so sad side right so yeah I mean
it's carpet bombing us with features but
at the same time so that can emerge is
useful I think the most difficult part
of this it's because of this you know
sure sheer feature overload is surfacing
them to the end-user like how do you how
do you get the end user to realize that
had all these features are there and it
does all these things when all they want
to do is whip out their phone and take a
picture in their lives and sure yeah
otherwise otherwise the features are
completely invisible just like chris
sigler on this podcast yep you lie
without me out of epic okay I have
nothing bad well I'm very concerned
about my hardware today I've had so many
failures in the past 24 hours between my
microphone my internet connection but I
I never know if I can be hurt or not but
uh yeah the the galaxy s4 is not a
particularly interesting device to me
it's it's a it has become a you know I
think that this annual cadence for
samsung has become a
what's the word I'm looking forward it's
it's it's like a it's an expectation and
it's a it is a revenue driver but is not
an exciting device it is not a device
that anyone looks forward to with hot
hot anticipation it's a device that wins
over consumers with raw marketing muscle
and it I frankly a very little add to
add to this device I have nothing to say
about it it's something that I'm sure
it's a very very solid phone and it's
going to sell of course extraordinarily
well but I think that the the real
innovation the meaningful innovation in
this space right now is not coming from
Samsung that's certainly not coming from
this device these these these features
that they've had in this for parlor
tricks yeah nobody needs to be able to
wave in front of their phone to change
photos I my thumb is not weak this is
not so weak that I can't scroll a page
with it so yeah I mean there's 11 of
these crazy features that I like and
that's the they took from the the note
to the hover mode that you spilled you
can do with the stylus that you can
instead of just tapping the screen you
can hover over the screen and have it
pop up stuff instead of actually you
know directly acting on it that's kind
of neat I could get into that if it were
well supported I thought it I tested out
some of the the motion features that
Chris just mentioned the one where
you're you tilt the phone to scroll up
and down a web page and it actually
actually kind of worked so i guess you
know if you're if you're on a subway and
you're reading a page and and you tilt
it and it goes further without having to
move in you're less likely to maybe drop
the device out of your hand I suppose
that's a good thing it just struck me as
really funny because that's one of the
things that I remember sergey brin
talking about when Android was launched
back in two thousand eight or launched
the public as something that he wanted
his phone to do and then in the book in
the Plex by Steven Levy which goes
really deep on Google and how Android
among other things was developed inside
of Google they the engineers determined
that it wasn't practical to do and here
we are in 2013 at Samsung just went
ahead through it in their phone anyways
so I found that amusing and then I also
i tested the feature
you are watching a video and it looks to
see that your eyes are on the video and
then you if you get distracted or
something like say there's a garden or
outside of your house taking a shirt off
and you look smart pose to look yeah you
look away from your video the video
itself actually pauses so that you don't
miss your video while you're being
distracted and and I mean as Chris
managed and that's a total parlor trick
it's it's it's not something that's
really needed it's not difficult to just
hit pause or rewind a video on mobile
devices these days and it had about of a
second delay or so before it would pause
and then restart when I i looked back at
it but i guess it worked as the as the
it was sold to us well Mull to the point
it's actually going to be inconvenient
to a lot of people because so somebody
like myself for example you could have
your phone just playing a video and you
could just be listening to it as a
background thing or is like you know
like a radio stream whatever you know
there are all these scenarios where you
don't need to be looking at screen
directly well i mean it's a feature you
can turn on and off you have to dive
into settings and you can enable it or
disable it but yeah does the other thing
the de la salle picked up of galaxy is
free in to consult an hour just to the
same with events usually I'm customizing
things and I'm cursing sense from HTC
for not giving me the option to make
something suit me with the galaxy s fine
it's like stop it no don't do that stop
talking to me like I accidentally this
is this is a truth accidentally enabled
this talkback mode way read everything
on the screen to me and did it in this
loud unpleasantly you know dictatorial
voice and I it just freaked me out isn't
that an Android feature yeah there is
talk back in stock standard Android well
that's what I'm saying I fell into it
and it wasn't a happy experience but
here's a bit of cultural awareness for
guys like Chris I have watched the video
and I can tell you guys that the
scenario exists and it happens very
often in Korea where you have attracted
young women in the 20s doing some baking
cooking and having their hands just
covered with flour and only happens in
panties commercials that only happens to
get tech commercials and then it is
somebody really important close you know
because the young independent women and
they run their own businesses and they
have to be a call 24 hours a day tell me
pulling ko's and then they just waved a
hand in the air in front of the phone
and it works seamlessly I've watched a
video well I'm just gonna pull this out
of the there might be a woman out there
who needs to do this because I find I'm
in a situation all the time when I'm
obsessing over brewing some coffee and
I'm making messes and I've got grinds
everywhere and I need to either start
the timer on my smartphone or answer a
message or a call and I have to touch
the thing and it gets dirty and filthy
and stuff like that so this happens to
me quite often I don't think Samsung's
waving gesture is the answer to my
problems uh with for what I need to do
but right i mean the dishes are varied
amends for that that's always the thing
like cut apple the thinner apple does is
it looks at things like gestures and
says we're going to implement this until
it's mature enough to give to give them
the full opportunity to set the time
already spark right until you have more
of a comprehensive service whereas
samsung looks at things like gestures
and says what part what portion of this
can we just jack into our fold and
expand our feature this with and that's
where complaints the parlor trick
complete comes from because these aren't
fully fleshed out you can wave around a
bit to go back and forth a grave around
a bit to scroll but then you can't
really do much more else like i don't
think it's going to be a terribly
cohesive use experience all together so
there's also an IR blaster which i put
in the same category of just throw
features at it because you can there is
one thing that actually i do think is
interesting and I don't know why
nobody's done it before and it's this s
health stuff where they actually
activate the pedometer in the
accelerometer and you know couple other
sensors I forget exactly what on the
phone to track your health you know
you're walking in your exercise like a
Fitbit or whatever and
like that's just something that should
have been on phones from the beginning
as soon as they created these things and
then you know why you need to you know
get a separate accessory to do some of
this stuff kind of blows my mind if you
can do it on the phone and so that's
potentially interesting to me and say on
Samsungs actually selling a whole whole
host ya need to extend that to with the
wristband type of things and other
Fitbit like devices where r samsung is
saying is gonna sell them let's remember
the S pebble yeah there's a lot that one
on sale you might if you dare and you
can tap it to your Galaxy s3 to transfer
your musical the one thing so they also
said that they're going to bring some s4
software features to the s3 I mean if
you own a galaxy s3 you should not buy
this phone like right straight up
there's nothing here that would make you
desperately want it the screen is bigger
it's gonna be faster it's got a higher
megapixel camera but the only thing that
I could say is and then we'll we'll have
to wait and see until we actually do a
review on it is the battery is
significantly larger so maybe the
battery life is something that's you
know really impressive with this but
we'll have to have to wait and see on
that but I sure you guys get is gonna be
kind of balanced by p.m. what's that
Chris my secrets hey i sorry I a vibe
items talking anyone I interrupt him um
uh I I suspect that the higher battery
capacity is going to be counteracted by
the the high resolution screen and the
faster processor but we'll see yeah that
could be I mean as as these new
processors come out they get faster but
they're supposed to get more efficient
to write so we'll see it's a lot bigger
what was the one on the s3 there was
like 1700 or 1800 it 15 21 goes to
thousands in this week thousands we got
one right here and so now this one is
2600 so 1750 know this yeah what this is
I'm sorry this is Galaxy Nexus never get
out of my face what I had a samsung
battery had to grab it but either way
this is at least 500 million bow or more
so it's at least twenty percent more so
um okay so just a record I think chris
is like this epic delay on the rest of
us I think we should just give him carte
blanche to just interrupt the crap out
of so we're just automatically stopped
because his input is so precious depends
on little man ever not felt that way
chris has been talking this whole time
and so what's going to happen is we're
gonna stop the podcast when we normally
do but it's going to go on for some
bonus content from extra 20 minutes
we'll be able to hear everything chris
has been saying that's pretty much like
the a 2100 event London in New York 2120
it's 2100 ok so the the new one is 500
billion power more so slightly less than
twenty percent more or 25 for someone
does something jump it is a big job yeah
so I'm curious to see how that how that
works out and they managed to make it
thinner samsung says the thinness was
unprecedented though it is thicker than
the iphone 5 but they did manage to make
the the phone thinner while packing a
much larger battery into it so i guess
that's pretty impressive yeah I was
yawning about that because that's boring
interesting stuff I think Genesis 4
works with gloves so it has one of those
a nice new fangled hyper sensitive touch
screens like the Nokia Lumia 920 and
other you know keys so I actually like
that particularly with the amount of
glove worrying I've been doing with this
a seasonably cold weather I appreciate
it for making work with gloves agreed
yeah I had to shovel four inches of snow
off my driveway this morning so this
morning looks nice nice last day of
winter but maybe if you're in like
Iceland or no way or any part of Canada
you know that's that's what that's where
this stuff comes in cuz that's like
number one featured like forgetting 13
megapixels in the number of course it
won't suit gloves man so okay this phone
is like it's iterative it's what we
expected it looks very proficient it's
got a million features does the
smartphone landscape but for Android
change with this phone or is it just
going to be the same because it seems
like our senses
that that's the s4 it's a lot like the
s3 and they're going to market the hell
out of it and you know HTC is trying to
make a comeback and we'll get into that
and a little bit a minute here but I I
don't see you know any huge opening for
another manufacturer right now because
of this because it's a perfectly
proficient device you know I don't see
them falling down anywhere and I also
don't see them like utterly crushing
anybody you know at least not more than
they already have well I just got to see
status quo I I think I think Samsung is
in a very good position to further
extend its lead with the gaseous where
maybe not dramatically so it's not going
to be as dramatic of a shift as say it
was from 2011-2012 but you know every
carrier in the US was very eager as soon
as the s4 was announced you to blast out
that will be carrying it and so you're
going to be able to get it on the four
major carriers and even on a couple of
regional carriers in the US i'm sure i
think samsung said it would be on a
hunch at 155 countries um at law or it
will be launched eventually at 155
countries where we do um I had ever seen
carriers maybe that was carrier succeed
but still either way that's a lot of
places that you can go buy this phone
it's literally just gonna be carpet
bombing the market with with the galaxy
s4 and it's going they say it's going to
be available in April so uh you know
you're not going to be able to escape
this device Samsung's marketing as we
mentioned earlier is extensive and
massive and it's going to be thrown on
you in every which way as far as
commercials and advertisements and
things like that so I really think that
the Samsung took a safe bet with this as
far as the s4 but it's probably going to
pay off for them with tens of millions
of sales and you know furthering their
lead in the Android landscape and likely
furthering it ahead of Apple in as far
as the general smartphone landscape and
just the front an extra thought here if
it's no longer just Samsung's own
marketing does the other thing Samsung
has invested really heavily in that but
it's built up inertia now and it's built
up momentum momentum to wear like you're
saying dita oh damn brother Wow
d name is getting mixed up but like
you're saying carriers all blasting
blasting out the announcements here in
the UK is the non carriers as well as
like car from warehouse phones for you
those guys say we're going to have it
you can have a pre-order you can
pre-register interest everybody is
announcing that but also accessory
manufacturers are coming up with
announcements as well like I've not
noticed any other phone launch before
the galaxy s4 other than iphone launches
where it was immediately followed by
every accessory in fact manufacturer or
most of them coming up and saying we've
got new cases we've got new trinkets
extra batteries etc for this particular
device like I haven't seen any other
Android device gone and that kind of
attention and that kind of extra PR from
accessory makers and that's that's
actually been a criticism that's been
levied at Android for a number of years
at Apple's you know third-party
ecosystem for accessories has always
been much stronger you could always find
the latest and best cases for your
iphone you could find all these like
crazy cool trinkets and things like that
you could plug into your iPhone and you
know maybe that's Samsung's not quite
fully there yet with the galaxy s4 but
it's definitely getting closer um 22
word if you want an accessory for your
phone and you have a galaxy s4 there's a
very good chance that you'll be able to
find it yeah we can move on that we can
stop boring Chris and getting involved
in a conversation well Chris might be
excited about today's if we're gonna say
one more thing about Samsung that was
news today that Samsung is working on a
SmartWatch oh and of course this is
going to peak Chris curses interests
right right Chris I still have very
serious concerns about my leg here is am
I am i calling a conversation here
you're here man okay uh yeah no I'm
excited to hear that Samsung's doing
this of course they this is not
therefore as as are our good friend
Sascha Segan has been pointing out at
all day on Twitter this is not Samsung's
first entry into the end of the market I
mean
frankly they've been doing phone related
smartwatches longer than just about
anyone they showed a gsm prototype
watching what 2003 or something but but
yeah I mean we'll see what they can do I
I think that that this is going to be a
really really exciting market for the
next 12 to 18 months I'm sure but we're
going to see Apple get involved we can
see Google get involved samsung will get
involved in you know well I think the
biggest question is can the small
players like pebble med wat survive and
then and then the other big question is
will Apple and Google be able to sustain
this mark and get a broad consumer base
interested in wearing a wristwatch again
yeah or will Lil one of the bigger
players just buy one of the smaller
players and all right I don't know if
they need to i mean the the thing that
makes a SmartWatch right now is the
phone supporting it with its software
which neither android or iOS do very
well and i don't think they see a need
to buy there's no expertise even a
pebble that apple or Samsung desperately
need I don't think I'm gonna watch a
room ever ok so there's another huge
giant seismic change in the smartphone
space that we need to tuck into we don't
even like referenced it yet and that is
that Andy Rubin has left Android he is
going to work on you know some moonshot
somewhere and they're handing Android
over to sundar Pichai who has led up
Chrome OS and Google Apps in chrome and
this is a big deal this is a really huge
thing and I don't know what do you guys
think I mean there's there's a lot of
angles we can talk about here we just
had a profile of Reuben go up today we
can talk about sadar talk about whatever
s super Oakland amen I know maybe you
should just jump in man i can't i can't
be on point all the time with perfectly
placed questions and thoughts and
openings for you to speak i can tell you
what I think but then that leaves
nothing for you you know boo ok well
here's the thing as far as Twitter
presence goes and the Rubin used to
tweet like two times a year
sundar Pichai tweets maybe one time I
years or no change there so um um
personally I'm not so sure that this is
so much of a seismic shift because i
don't i don't get the feeling that Andy
Rubin was running Android the way to
let's say Steven Sinofsky seem to be
running Windows where he wanted to
control of everything and everything was
going along to Andy Rubens dictum you
know I kind of think the opposite I kind
of I kind of disagree with you I kind of
think that there was a bunch of stuff
where you know Android was sort of not
fully as fully integrated with the rest
of Google as it could be i think that i
mean just think out the fact that we
didn't see chrome get on android til way
late in the game not sure you should and
you know you can carry on with your
facts and reality as much as you like
but then that doesn't stop me from
talking out of my imagination no but I
mean you have matias duarte who whose
presence and influence at least one user
interfaces we felt very strongly since
he's been there i also feel like android
is so critical and so central to google
overall strategy that Larry Page Google
CEO khan have just given Andy Rubin such
totalitarian control so I don't
necessarily feel that Android is just
going to deviate from his current
trajectory like if you really needed
that big of a change I think Larry Page
or somebody else would have instituted
it already and Reuben being there or not
I mean the interesting thing with ribbon
is what sort of project is he going to
add up you know I mean what is this
thing that he's going off to he hasn't
been fired it's not that like he's left
to go in fish or whatever which is fab
yeah and I mean yeah let's be clear like
this is a sign that Android is failing I
think it might just be about Reuben in
that Rubens strength everybody seems to
be saying that Reuben is really good at
starting things up and you know writing
making you know building new system and
making something happen and then you
know now that it's happened he wants to
go do that again
and and sooner is coming into pitch
right now now he's really interesting
because like he has just been rocking
and rolling I mean say what you will
about Chrome OS and its adoption not
that she that she you know laptop the
cheap Chromebook is selling super well
and Amazon still they just released the
pixel which yeah nobody should buy it
because it's way too expensive but it's
an amazing feat of hardware engineering
google apps have been doing just fine
both on the web and on iOS and even on
Android so like he's been executing and
executing well across lots of different
parts of Google so he's kind of a key
kind of strikes me as a golden boy
although I wouldn't call my boy golden
man golden child no he's not trying out
of their it's made of gold that's
what I'm saying maybe that's what it is
maybe it's a very simple case of andy
rubin being suited to being the guy who
initiates projects and pti be suited to
managing projects and just running them
and being a manager so you know one guys
better management the other guys better
at getting things off the ground and
google just reposition them and that's
it maybe that's what it is but that's
kind of boring and it exciting so Chris
I'm going to ask you a question and I'm
letting you know that I'm going to ask
you a question well in advance so you
can prepare yourself and start speaking
before I finish speaking in about five
seconds do you think this is a big
change or are you kind of lads can i I
think that it's a combination of things
part part of it is that I think that
that it's a natural progression of
putting android into cruise control
which is what you alluded to by saying
that Andy is good at starting things up
and soon as ours is good at at you know
keeping things running maybe and in that
that could very well be be a part of it
but I also think that I also think that
that Andy can be an abrasive personality
to put it in a politically correct way
and it's in you know we'll probably
never know the full story of what's
happening here but I think that it's
entirely possible that he rubs someone
the wrong way or the
on the series of people the wrong way
and it finally came to a head and they
needed to put him into a different role
where he wasn't as prominent in the
company and and needless to say nobody
really knows if you if you read a turn
Jeffrey's excellent profile and Reuben
that's up on the site today you'll know
that we still don't really know exactly
what Reuben is going to be doing in the
company and its it's possible that
Google just simply hasn't figured that
out yet they just wanted him out of that
leadership role and he's off doing
something else now and you don't know
well I deeply regret asking you to speak
Chris because your microphone is a purse
thing ever yeah that's Google I mean
we're using google hangout to you so
that's Google sensory but it's it's on
Google yeah it's a yeah he sounds like
an Android almost you might say I'm
sorry that was a terrible terrible thing
um so the other things like mention yeah
I mean are we still talking about Google
I don't want to interrupt this no we are
continuing I've for most things ok
whatever then I'm just going to roughly
two seconds Dropbox book mail books
which to me is a really significant
thing because I did and once they did it
I decided to get in line so here i am
i'm in line and like 394 thousand
something something it's really
depressing but that's it Joe I mean
Dropbox by mailbox is really intriguing
to me because i really love dropbox
every luck with those guys have done in
how reliable and how yeah just reliable
that's the key thing with what dropbox
is doing and general is is just kind of
clean and intrusive so then coming
together with the mailbox guys because I
mean we'll discuss mailbox already and
it has issues of those two so paradigm
but if Dropbox can straighten those
things out and just become like this
extra ecosystem that you could jump to
so you don't always have to be looking
towards Apple Google Microsoft cetera
definitely really exciting it fun well
it's it's interesting that you know
Dropbox is very good at
cloud storage and cloud computing and
things like that and where my mailbox
has struggled in a lot of people's eyes
is in that exact area and that's why
they have that's 400,000 long waiting
lists and things like that because they
need to scale their cloud servers up to
support all the users and there is
actually a a couple of weeks ago uh
there was a number of downtime or number
times where the service was down and he
just literally couldn't couldn't get
your email from it so having Dropbox
behind them will certainly very likely
improve those things well it's also
interesting from Dropbox's perspective
because this is a company that's you
know moving probably to get an IPO and
become a public company and let's be
really clear like what Dropbox does is
something that if they don't maintain a
leadership position and maybe branch out
is something that can become
commoditized really quickly they provide
cloud storage and syncing well guess
what Google is offering that basically
for free Microsoft is there's box net
there's sugarsync there's a million of
these services and Dropbox needs to one
make sure that they're ahead in terms of
app integration they already are they've
got great api's and lots and lots of
developers use Dropbox and two they need
to make sure that like they have a
reason for existing beyond that just in
case you know these other services might
take off because you know it's kind of a
commodity service at this point so they
need to push forward I so I think them
purchasing mailbox is really interesting
in terms of what kind of services is
Dropbox thinking about offering directly
that will sort of justify its existence
when Google and Microsoft our offer an
apple of course with iCloud although
let's not talk about I clogged too much
because that's embarrassing for Apple
are offering you know similar or
identical virtually identical services
at some in some cases of our cost that's
that's why the the first is interesting
to me and also they they took over and
what they bought a small photo sharing
company oh oh yeah they've been they've
been they've been acquiring all kinds of
different services that can use their
cloud services and but provide a music
service or a photo-sharing service or
now even
service so it's uh like you mentioned
either it is almost like they're
building an ecosystem yeah which would
be nice box or less oh go ahead and have
drum Dropbox for feedings yeah drop
boxes were stripped us I want to go back
there's one last thing I want to talk
about with ya with Google and Reuben and
photographer option no no it's so big I
runs Chrome OS and we also have android
OS and you know it seems kind of like
they should combine these things somehow
maybe we could expect android apps
running on Chrome OS is a first step
maybe we could see more of the way the
Chrome OS handles apps or maybe you know
its infrastructure you know running
directly of Linux could apply to Android
I mean not too tight well yeah not to
put too fine a point on it i mean
android isn't exactly the most efficient
and awesome operating system out there
it's got dalvik it's got you know a
couple of layers of stuff it's never
really felt all that web native so
there's there's definitely ways that
Android could improve especially if it's
going to you know move out of being
useful on more than just phones and if
it's you know gonna start you know
working when you scroll instead of
stuttering all that problems mostly so I
mean do you guys think that we're gonna
see these two operating systems merge
well I've cedar a dieter I'm going to
well first of all is the is my audio any
better oh yes please I hope fingers how
it's good robotic dinner I'm gonna have
to fault you for for trying to slip in
the fact that Android isn't web native
and and just passed off like like you
know that doesn't make fault and that's
something that we should all be upset
about ok hang on it's a major fault for
Google because Google you know makes
more money off of stuff on the web than
they do off of you know native apps on
Android and if they and you know that's
the whole point of Chrome OS that's what
they believe the future should look like
and we're nowhere near it yet but
they're trying to actually create that
future right now with the pixel and so
if Google thinks that they can actually
pull off something that you know
integrates the rest of the stuff that
Google actually makes money on into
Android and make that more native of
course they want to do
I'm not saying it's grown I mean but
even even as Android is right now a lot
of the Google other services all benefit
from the fact that Android exists even
if android doesn't directly make Google
money you know maps are improved by all
the Android users that are out there
running around with maps on their phone
it the companies can harvest all kinds
of voice data information from google
voice it can harvest all kinds of data
information from gmail and things like
that so I know integration yeah and
let's not forget AdMob AdMob is a major
generator of revenue for Google + and I
correct me if I'm wrong but I think it's
the most widely deployed ad network in
android apps so yeah but i think the the
level of monetization they get off of
that pales in comparison to what they
get off of that you know search standard
oh yeah yeah sure yeah yeah no no
disagreement there and I mean let's face
it like Google Google knows that people
are looking at windows 8 and going yeah
right like if they could go in and like
be the new Microsoft if they if they
really put their mind to it they've got
all the pieces they just froze set aside
windows 8 Google Stewart has this
massive program of tablets and the fact
that doesn't have a really pathetic
tablet OS so it tried to an Android it
doubled down and his back while it was
doubling down now it's like work what
else do we do maybe that's what's
happening is Android just kind of
flunked too many times on the tablet
front the other thing is Windows 8 is oh
wait as far as Microsoft goes Windows 8
is the most dramatic transition ever yes
they kept your desktop mode but they're
just moving into I mean for Microsoft
being as conservative as conservative as
it is it is as business centric and its
business dependent for his preferences
is Windows a represents a massive change
and the fact is they haven't gotten it
right completely but by next iteration
by you know things in Windows blue which
are going to iterate quicker and faster
and upgrade and introduce new features
faster you can kind of see a roadmap
developing an ideal case scenario what
Microsoft really nails it and
gets things right and polishes off its
OS so it Microsoft or it has a
foundation for really compelling tablet
I was Google really doesn't yeah like
Jeff Gordon for HTC he tweeted this and
it was a brilliant point in the mobile
smartphone version of Chrome you can
just swipe away tabs you don't want it's
really natural and intuitive and easy
program on an Android tablet you have to
press the particular X which essentially
is so small it's like a click for mouse
it isn't anywhere near as intuitive or
slew it as a smartphone experience
that's just like a microcosm of how
frustrating Android can be on a tablet
because he has no tablet specialization
so yes I do you think there's going to
be a lot of cross-pollination between
Chrome OS and Android we've seen
evidence of Google now coming to Chrome
OS and notification center or
notifications at least so it might will
be the case that Google is preparing
Chrome OS to be its tablet OS and to
grow up to be several OS because sees
more potential dead and with Android
itself yeah I completely under percent
agree and I hope that that happens I
just did the question is how quickly can
it happen and how well can they pull it
off because they really have an ad other
than the nexus 7 which i think was a
limited success you know they're you
know I pads eating our lunch right and
the next seven is running this month
from version of Android any right well
you know what he doesn't have a
landscape mode that's disturbing to what
is also now it doesn't know yeah there's
a yeah that guy was it four point one
point two or something like that editor
one of those point point updates edit a
landscape mode but what's also
interesting is not only is Apple eating
the Google's launched with the iPad
amazon's eating it with the kindle fire
too yeah using a heavily modified
version of android that doesn't do
google any good so and let's talk about
this this class of sony edge devices
like you know they're sort of
entertainment stuff you don't do i quote
real work on it you're doing that on a
pc or laptop or a full-size tablet and
google has no I mean the nexus 10 is
great is beautiful I think it's a lovely
device
if I have a choice between that and an
ipad I'll use an iPad every time right
they need they need to close that gap
and they need to do it quickly because
you know the future of computers is you
know not what we were buying two years
ago it is you know a tablet and you have
a keyboard attached it's something like
the surface you know it's something like
the iPad it's something like the Nexus
10 whatever I'm google doesn't have
enough skin in that game and they need
to well Google has the investment is it
just yeah you know think things are you
flopping yeah fortune for google they've
dried and destroyed and keep trying I
guess como message is the longer
longer-term strategy something that they
can look forward to at least but but due
to point about 7-inch tablets that's my
kitchen and statement unit yeah that's
my radio that's my streaming device
that's and as for him so freaking
annoying that I have a landscape mode so
every time I wanna the I mean I'm
basically an addict to the BBC iplayer
right and every time I want to stream
something from there download something
I have to turn the tablet because i
don't have the latest update which has a
landscape mode have to turn the nexus 7
to portrayed and then get into it and
dig in get to the thing i want to play
and i'd put it back into landscape and
put it down and also this thing needs is
freakin stand because right now i'm kind
of putting it right next to yeah it's
finally available again yeah you can buy
the dock and Otis bunk yeah well let's
move on let's talk about HTC because you
know we obviously reviewed the one but
they can't seem to get the damn thing in
stores as quickly as they need to Wall
Street Journal had a report that the
supplier is no longer consider HTC to be
a Tier one customer which I totally
believe we've seen you know shipment
delays they were originally targeting
late March some markets are going to see
it in April now and whatever bump they
were hoping to get by getting on store
shelves ahead of the galaxy s4 is
rapidly dwindling yeah like this is not
a really create super solid start for
them I would just like to correct the
wall street journal reports i have my
own exclusive sources and I can actually
disclosed that the boom sound feature on
the HD one was certified as being
dangerous to human health in fact a
completely modify the design and put it
in my hardware modifications to suffer
the freakish loudness of effect and then
honestly like half of the volume that
you can reach on the HTC One is well it
distorts isn't that great it's kind of
superfluous thank you if what I mean
maybe it's superfluous but if it gets
louder than say like my nexus 4 which I
constantly am annoyed at the fact that
the speaker is on the back of the phone
and firing away from me when I'm holding
the device and I have to cut my hand
around it and it never gets loud enough
when I'm watching a video or something
like that I think it's awesome that the
speakers around the front of the one and
that they're blasting right at me and I
think that that's a like when you talked
about the the lack of innovation on
samsung's galaxy s4 that is like one of
the things that comes to my mind is like
ball you know HTC saw problem and they
resolved it or you know at least made an
attempt to resolve it by putting the
speakers on the front of the device
which is very like kind of like a
no-brainer thing maybe it's there's
really hard engineering that's it
required to make that happen but you
know HTC did it and yet you know samsung
what a generation without really doing
anything different so I actually dread
people Google talking me now because the
one like shatters all my windows waiting
for my ear it's like it is freakishly
loud it is scary loud like if you have
always if you're the kind of person that
has always complained that the
loudspeakers on the phones are too quiet
there is only one phone for you in 2013
and that is a lot of fun that is the 1i
it was completely unintentional but it's
just the fact that they called it the
one I mean that they took a digit from
from mathematics and used it for the
name of their device there's nothing I
can do about that know if I'm if I'm the
count I'm suing you know seriously
that's my trademark 12 every time I
count is that's with one look for the
record I was also being facetious about
the boobs out I do you think it's a it's
an added bonus and feature writer to the
rest of the competition is just very
freakish loud evident it's it's well I
mean just so that we're gonna go back on
topic here with the the actual story
that we're talking about how the one is
delayed it's interesting to note a
couple of things in this report one its
delay mentioned as being related to the
camera parts which is really quite
interesting because the camera is
something that HTC is like touting and
it's it's one of the major features of
the phone and it's one of the custom
feature for this phone so it's
interesting that that's actually what's
whole might be holding it back from
shelves and then the other thing was
this other mentioned that if the one
doesn't succeed uh Peter Chao HTC's
current CEO has said that he'll step
down from its position which is kind of
insane to think that's as long as I've
known followed HTC Peter Chou has been
CEO so that would be quite a quite a
shift for the company should that happen
yeah well I mean we've been saying that
the one was make a break for HTC and a
bunch of people have been like no here
it's not the stakes are that high what's
wrong with you cut it out no look Peter
Chao himself is like this doesn't take
off fight it's right for me to step down
like stakes are super high for them on
this phone good but let me let me say
though that I think that I mean yes I I
totally agree with that but I still
think that from a management perspective
it's mistake to like pre announced that
you will step down yo if if a particular
product isn't successful I like it it if
it puts everybody in a weird headspace
it's not I I don't think that was the
right thing well it's
it's about being classy and in
basketball is like if you hit the
backboard when you score you have to
call glass before the ball hits the
backboard and goes in so people know it
was intentional so we pizza chat what
he's doing he's doing the same thing
just in corporate terms so he's saying i
am putting it all in the line and where
you guys know that I'm putting it on the
line for when we actually succeed and
then he collects his youth credit after
the one succeeds which anything so there
is there is one potentially piece of
potentially good news so you know freed
over at all things do you have this
report that she heard from sources that
the one was in fact going to come to
verizon contrary to everything you know
we had heard that it was the other
victory they're taking it and then hcc
like you know didn't really say anything
and then HTC's twitter account tweeted
that the one is not coming to verizon
but have you seen the droid DNA and then
i deleted that tweet and you know posted
another story saying uh yeah look it's
coming I've heard it'll be late but it's
definitely coming to horizon um so
that's good news I mean there's no way
verizon's gonna actually push marketing
on it but you know being available on
all four majors in the US is our super
duper important thing for which Jesus
whenever whatever it actually gets there
okay if Verizon is smart they just gonna
call it the drone haha yes yes yes yes
it's culturally relevant it's a pun it's
got everything I love it Jake just two
points to not one which is the 2014
model by the way I promise you is
happening s to the camera I mean HTC
took that risk phone itself because the
camera in the HTC one is custom-made for
HTC by its abaya which are most likely
Sony and this is the this this probably
just one fabrication facility and they
all just making those chips those
sensors for HTC you have one flow with
it you
go back equal discuss them it's a risk
of the company to call this one is
backfiring but also been thinking about
this for a while now about HTC's
financial situation and the way it's
kind of been going downhill for the past
I don't know a year and a half or
whatever whatever it's been two years
maybe and the thing that struck me is
that when Windows Phone several was
introduced HT and Samsung go to the
biggest endorses and decayed I mean HC
let's face it came with the biggest
hardware investment they they had the
most devices or the nine devices three
or four of them were from HTC it was
crazy wild with the speakers speakers I
bought that Wow yes I did well I mean
you grows the surround yeah okay the HTC
had won the landscape slider with a
hardware keyboard had aluminum ones
aluminium for a UK business and they had
everything for windows phone 7 and
invested heavily in that and what what
actually in and this is a coincidence
i'm not suggesting causation i'm just
pointing out correlation ever since
windows phone 7 was introduced which is
kind of the peak of HTC's powers and
growth things have been going on here
for the company and one thing that I've
noticed with Windows Phone is that
licensing costs are significantly higher
than we'd Android you know people for
example well one of the smaller Chinese
companies well actually it's a giant
Chinese company but smaller in support
for market herbs was saying how they
couldn't do what they can do with
prepaid android phones Windows Phone
just because the minimum license is
filled with Windows Phone is so high so
they had to pitch their windows forms of
contract customers rather than prepaid
customers so there may be a theory that
that you know HTC kind of always
stretched itself with Windows Phone
overspent and didn't see the same
returns they might have expected that
anybody might also be the case that we
can make the argument that HC stretched
its own resources
which obviously it did we'd like the
design team spending time with Windows
Phone 8 s Windows Phone 8x giving them
unique designs most recently whereas
those reason resources could have all
been pulled into its Android efforts
nobody can say if HT spent 100 percent
of his sign when I droid it will be all
successful today I mean Sony's a good
example of not being successful why
being focused on Android but it's just
like interesting alternative scenario I
wow we've been going for over an hour we
have to talk about t-mobile though they
have got an event coming up where
they're going to probably announce their
uncarrier plans don't think that we're
likely to see the iphone stuff details
there but maybe and they've got LTE
launching this month with the galaxy
note 2 is going to take advantage of it
right away presumably the s4 will when
it comes out and then the biggest news
is the FCC has approved their proposed
merger with metropcs so it's not a done
deal yet but it's for all intents and
purposes I think it might as well be and
Chris you sort of wrote a explained
article that sort of tells us exactly
what this merger means you want to get
into that a little bit yeah I mean that
the bottom line is that then I kind of
spell this out in the piece but I think
that this is the closest thing to a
win-win-win that we're ever going to see
in our lifetimes in the US wireless
industry I'll just ever in our lifetimes
period and do a pregardia civ context
yeah greatest thing to ever happen to
any of us ever oh yeah i mean it's it's
it's kind of freaky and uncanny how good
this seems to be from all sides the the
one piece of bad and unfortunate news is
that there will be layoffs at both
companies it's inevitable as with
virtually any merger but in terms of
t-mobile's ability to compete with the
big guys in terms of its spectrum
portfolio in terms of its ability to raw
LTE in a more effective manner this is
just brownlee good news and of course
t-mobile is still small enough
so that it doesn't raise any you know it
doesn't raise any sort of competitive
concern verses eighteen t and verizon
and i think it's very telling that
public interest group public knowledge
which follows this stuff very closely is
endorsing the deal and and they kind of
did in a back-end way they're like you
know it's it's it's unfortunate that we
live in a world where we a merger is a
good thing in this business but we do
and this is a good merger and and you
should be happy about it and I i think
that's that's kind of the case I think
that for people who are on t-mobile and
for people who are on metropcs they're
going to find that this is very good
news in terms of their ability to get
LTE faster and and for people who aren't
on t-mobile considering the value
proposition the t-mobile offers versus
the larger carriers it's it really gives
you pause as to whether these are guys
that you should seriously consider I
know that I have I'm my primary phone is
currently on ATT and ever since they've
they've rolled out contract free
unlimited data it's it's been it's been
a daily fight an internal struggle for
me not to move t-mobile because it's you
know it's a good deal but you know they
still they still struggle with spectrum
in certain key areas New York in
particular I've heard many complaints
from New Yorkers about you know failed
calls and and whatnot and I think that
metropcs is really going to help boost
their their um their portfolio in in
those places so this is good news can we
just have like a team-wide policy for
the entire virgin box teen for everybody
to just switch to t-mobile and support
the good guys I am seriously considering
you know just switching them on moral
grounds but it turns out that you know I
need to use my phone and and I mean I
don't know I need to I've got it I think
I've a tmobile reviewed and I need to
see what the situation is like out here
again because like what it's good it's
great especially their HSPA stuff and so
if they can if they can actually pull up
what they're doing I've said this before
then yeah I'm totally
willing to switch away from AT&amp;amp;T because
the worst man as bad as a eighteen t is
a tmobile is is almost non-existent
where I live so yeah I'm gonna just
stick with AT&amp;amp;T for now so of course
when are we when can we expect like
actual real world customer like effects
of this merger like is it like am I
gonna we're gonna see oh hey they bought
metropcs and the very next day boom
they've got a whole bunch of LTE and
signals great and rakes that's not gonna
happen right well they are so in terms
of the roadmap for integrating metropcs
customers that still kind of up in the
air they've committed to decommissioning
metropcs a cdma network by 2015 i think
and you know obviously they're going to
do what they need to do to get people
who'd over to the HSP and LTE networks
by then but they are in fact we wrote a
story on this they they have committed
to rolling out the initial LTE markets
this month and there are only what 11
days or something left in the month 12
days so we're going to start to see this
LTE turn on really really quickly and
they're going to start with the markets
where they reformed their 1900 from edge
to UMTS and they initially did that to
to bring on you know to make the iphone
the unlocked iphone a more appealing
proposition and i think they have a
total of maybe 45 or 50 markets where
they've done that so far including any
large ones so those are going to be the
first markets where LTE is is possible
because AWS has opened up for those LTE
airwaves so it'll be very interesting to
see which are the first markets to go
live that we were initially expecting
this was back in January when we were at
CES we heard rumors sparked by none
other than t-mobile zone CTO that that
Las Vegas would go live they initially
wanted it to be live in time for CES
that didn't happen but then it sounded
like it would happen by then end of
January that never happened but now the
finally going to happen and they've
already started rolling out this
firmware update to the note to us that
those people will just be able to take
advantage right away so you know what
struck me is that although this
conversation is not of the highest
relevance to the European audience
essentially probably even less relevant
to rural people in the US and have you
heard what Dan had to say because hey
we're talking markets but we're talking
big cities right so the first we're
going to benefit from this rollout I
probably gotten people who already have
LTE options from verizon and AT&amp;amp;T I
probably Sprint and t-mobile is just
going to be catching up on those fronts
it's kind of disappointing that you guys
don't have more of a controlling states
in government it can instruct the
carriers and just sell them okay these
guys have LTE leave them with ATT to
suffer and to be some of the soul to the
devil whatever go and get the other guys
because it's like not everybody lives in
cities and I'm trying to figure out how
we can address I mean the other thing is
the guys who are out in the countryside
probably need LT a lot more well I could
say to verizon's credit that between its
initial rollout of the 700 megahertz LTE
and then it's follow-up with its AWS
spectrum using LTE that it plants have
ninety percent of the population covered
with LTE by the end of 2014 so uh all of
the carriers and I know ATT as well is
is moving full force into getting their
customers or their coverage maps off of
the 3g services and anon to LTE so I
mean verizon is is way ahead and yeah
surprise and safari hat um but I mean
they they are all trying to get there I
guess you could say well that's
companies uh so we've got a whole bunch
other stuff we want to talk about z10 is
going on sale on verizon March 28 their
excitement of her video is the worst
thing ever
or whatever um like her he's talking
come on dude is Zeb 10 I'm sorry 30-10
didn't I I will see you I mean I never
have I'm saying let's let's pretend to
be excited about this boat yeah well
well I know the day before that verizon
Anna or the day of that verizon
announced pre-orders blackberry
announced that it sold 1 million Z tends
to a suspect a mystery customer I guess
you could say because they would not say
who it was I by the way exclusive scoop
I know that who that mystery customer
was it was Mike Lazaridis no I heard of
first folks so actually we should talk
about the be provocative comments you
have made by torsten Heinz yesterday
regarding apples a 500-ton quote
five-year-old user interface and while
he does have a point in fact eater wrote
about it at the launch of the iphone 5
hey I don't think I mean he is literally
Tim Tim Carmody um who wrote about this
yesterday and I were talking about this
and what I told him is that uh you know
Himes is literally just now walking he's
in like the FOIA of the glass house and
he's like standing on the front lawn yes
yes he's trying to leave the glass house
and he's getting some resistance the
weather isn't very nice outside and but
he's got all these rocks and he can't
wait to throw them but he's literally
he's just inches outside of this Glass
House of his and he's in serious danger
of hitting the house so yeah yeah i mean
III get that that he feels I'm sure that
he feels cornered he feels the need to
be both defensive and offensive and you
know it's just if I can't imagine that
he didn't know that this was going to
generate some some backlash and some
some humorous internet humor around the
fact that that
rim should be the one to talk about an
aging you I like it you know he listened
his big mistake from the start was to
refrain from making such comments
because now I mean listen rim whoa whoa
the company formerly known as rim back
Barry when it announces that 10 the day
of the event its UK one of its I think
it's it's UK / European marketing chief
did some interviews and also Dawson
himself was doing some interviews and
they were being asked the question what
hasn't worked out why has blackberry
fallen or such tough times what about
the iphone and they just refuse to
answer those questions and it was just
kind of hilarious train wreck watching
that European marketing chief going
through those interviews they would ask
him what went wrong in the past and you
just refuse to answer and the trouble is
when the company's being so conservative
and just refusing to do any trash to
hook the first time something that even
kind of gives you the inkling of trash
talk you know just a hint of trash talk
or competitive language whatever
everybody picks up on it and it's like
oh here it is you show you some fight
you show me some teeth etc said where's
in the other hand if it was something
like the nvidia CEO who goes a stage
with biking jackets and you know has
orange skin from who or the fake tanning
that he does and just says most regis
veins and a second firm does it is that
confirmed does he faked him no I'm sure
to agree with him he he goes to the
freakin equator to get a stat I don't
know the man is eccentric but that's the
point like if you have this personality
if somebody's going to say crazy things
and you say something controversial
people might ignore people might just
let it slide but we toast and he's
played it straight for so long that the
one time you freaking comments at the
iphone i think it comes to be really
reasonable like it is point about
history repeats itself is we suffered
because we didn't change for an awful
long time
Apple might do to say if it doesn't
change right I think they're reasonable
comments they're rational their
justifiable comments but now everybody's
picking up on them and just kind of I
mean a lot of people blow in a matter of
origin as far as uncle well a lot of
people seem to be focusing on on the the
other half of that statement where he
says that the iphones interfaces is five
years old which it's technically six
well i mean i just i mean interest which
is it just a factual statement but what
exactly he this is what you need to
understand stating about people state
facts um speaking of facts we've gone
for like an hour 20 years there anything
else you guys desperately want to hit
that we wanted you as well talk about
anything else hear from our I'm limine
giant list of features I'm very happy
and saddened at the same time with the
gmail for android update just why are
you saddened by it so that if you didn't
hear that you can now here he replaces
I'm sorry your complaint is invalid in I
saw your complaint on Twitter I complete
you that very valid they often tell you
i Ferb starters i use both of delete and
archive functions on in gmail all the
time and you can only have one or the
other in the notification so that's
that's a bummer right there the other
bummer is you cannot mark an email as
read from the notification you can
archive it directly from the
notification but it's still marked
unread in your gmail account and that's
totally fine that's totally fine like
like I use the search operators for
unread emails all the time uh and and
that would like just screw me up all
over the place why doesn't it if I'm
archiving it why doesn't it mark it as
read as well it should thank you for a
Toyota but also your complaint is
invalid d the Android app on gmail is so
far ahead of anything else for handling
in triage yeah and I mean this this
notification thing my god nobody has
ever thought of deleting an email out of
a notification before it's never come oh
wait that's right webos one point on it
could I archive you go to the straw hat
to say that DITA yes I just happen no I
have a I have my very first parody
Twitter account dedicated to me
Peters had it want to know why I wasn't
wearing a hat I / what a troll right now
by the way the camel casing on at deters
hat is really important that you
capitalize the H not the s just oh that
beautiful beautiful note ladies
gentlemen thank you so much for watching
the Virgin Mobile show it's been a
pleasure speaking to you and speaking
with my my fellow co-hosts if you want
to follow us on twitter you can i am at
back long and or at peter's hat
apparently vlad is why it's a bob dan is
d CC for chris is e power we're all at
verge you can leave a comment on the
post that this show appears on you can
email us at sammobile show at the verge
calm and we'll be back when we're back
and it'll be exciting thanks much see ya
