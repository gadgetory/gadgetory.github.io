is day how many days sorry 45 of no
internet you know I stopped counting I
stopped counting everything when I left
the internet so I don't know but it's
been a while since I've used the
internet and I've been in Chicago for
about a week I came to Chicago friend
Eli's wedding and that's like just been
hanging out Chicago for a few days
before the wedding and then the wedding
was like a three-day extravaganza at
first I felt a little out of place
because a lot of cool things would
happen and then everybody would share
them on Instagram or Facebook but I
think as the wedding progressed as some
people even like The Verge editors
started like slowing down
how do pictures they were taking how
many tweets they were doing and we all
started living and loving and laughing a
lot
throughout the wedding I am I felt no
disadvantage dancing wines well without
the internet I felt like I could pick up
all the moves here on the spot nothing
you had to look up on the Internet it
was it was a good experience I I didn't
really think a lot about the internet
they either way because how does just
enjoy the wedding basically
so it was blast is awesome and yeah you
know everybody's tweeting I actually I
forgot my camera on this trip which is
kind of suck but I got this Yashica
Elektra of 35 so I'm learning how to
shoot film so I've been shooting a
little bit of my big problem with film
is that I forget if I wound it or not I
think I either have a lot of blank
frames on here I have a lot of doubles
it's a pretty cool camera I haven't
developed any film so I don't know I'm
taking horrible pictures there are
definitely a few people here that uh
know me from my work by the no internet
work because like you know you somebody
asks you what do you do I still want to
write about technology and they like
phones like yeah if I get phones and
laptops you know and a lot of times the
like the conversation could end there
but it's fun for me because I gonna say
yeah I write about technology right now
I'm living the year without the internet
oh you know so I'm like I'm Corey I'm a
pretty hot commodity when it comes to
conversations at social gatherings I
don't want to toot my own horn but I
think I'm getting really good at
navigating cities I just absorbed them
like sponge when I ran into my bike they
gave me this map this is this map is
courtesy of Rahm Emanuel and this
thing's epic and so I can get I could
get anywhere in life
I don't even know what you call the area
this Chicago's very large the place I
went to Wicker Park I went to a camera
store the best buy my name how about two
shirts you like oh my gosh by like 40 I
don't miss the Internet I don't dream
about it I don't learn for it you know
everyone wants while somebody's like oh
there's this really funny thing a lot
happening on Twitter but I can't tell
you you know but I don't I don't care it
you know my biggest fear though is that
at the end of the year I don't want to
really go back to the internet full bore
even though it's so awesome it's just a
cool thing I just I didn't like myself a
lot better not on the internet so I feel
like doing a year of this is gonna be
like a piece of cake this is just
basically really easy right now they're
like there's tiny minor inconveniences
in exchange for having a blast a total
complete blast
