press conference which is the final
major press conference of III this year
and it was really big one there's new
Cod war there was naked Norman Reedus
don't ask but of course the big thing is
happening this year for Sony is
PlayStation VR they gave us a firm
release date October 13th
it's got 400 ollars 500 Vignelli
accessories so it's not too expensive we
just feel like a lot of the launch
lineup and you actually gonna see like
the bigger games - what was that like
right so I have to see a couple of the
big games and they sort of show that two
different tacks you can take with this
the first one is an arc and VR game and
the whole idea that it's sort of
supplemental to the entire Arkham series
it's a really short they said maybe an
hour maybe two if you're looking for all
the Easter eggs experience that's just
sort of like the detective vision and
you're solving a little crime and then
there's Resident Evil which takes the
total opposite tack and says that this
is the entire game it's the same in VR
or outside VR but inside VR it's kind of
like the kitchen demo that everybody
loved last year it's creepy and you just
get to have this extra little thing on
your horror experience and I felt the
same way when I was doing final fantasy
like it's an add-on that's a kind of
shooter and then like a little riot it's
really just a tech demo that they're
adding to the game that's nice it's nice
and additive I guess if you're buying
the full game anyway but it didn't
really justify why you'd spend even four
hundred ollars to do the PlayStation VR
I get that there are a couple games that
did seem to like own up in a really wall
way there was mostly the indie games
soare was a nice like just fun
experience I know how long it would be
enjoyable I enjoyed it
Psychonauts is a great point and click
adventure I wouldn't pay four dollars to
get a whole headset for it but I really
did like it if I have it I'm definitely
picking it up right and there's another
game I played which is far point which
theoretically is the middle ground for
this it's sort of like a space shooter
you have to buy a new peripheral that's
a gun peripheral to use with it and it
theoretically could be good but it also
just feels sort of in tech demo stage
it's not clear to me that it feels like
a thing that I would wanna buy to whole
new peripherals for but at least Sony
can make the argument and this was I
think it's like the best part about the
place of GTR is I I think it's the most
likely
succeed a lot of people already have a
place in sports you're not asking to
invest a lot if the accessory works also
if it doesn't fine but Sony can also it
has the known franchises it can write
those checks
you know oculus you're starting fresh
flawed new games ditto vibes a lot of
tech demos sony could just write check
and say hey give us a Batman thing you
know it's exciting and if we can build a
consumer base which i think is the most
important part of this if they're
building a consumer base the gamers and
developers will probably just flock to
it like I said shaking the egg problem I
think something's got a better head
start than most of them right and it
doesn't take that much mental effort to
buy a PlayStation VR and just plug it
into your PlayStation it feels like
plugging in a peripheral instead of
setting up an entire operating system
basically is what the rift and the vibe
feel like the thing I'm worried about is
that it's going to make Sony feel I
don't know complacent that I think
that's what I'm worried some of these
games feel like is that they knew okay
people are gonna get really excited
about Final Fantasy or Batman we don't
really have to make a game we just have
to have a thing that has the properties
of that franchise and I really hope
that's not the case because they could
do some really exciting stuff</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
