can ask yourself when you're thinking
about buying a smartphone is whether or
not it has a good camera and luckily for
all of us over the last couple years the
answer to that question is increasingly
yes so we took the five best ones
released this past year the iPhone 10
the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 the Google
pixel to the LGV 30 and the HTC u 11
then we put them to the test in a whole
bunch of different situations all to
figure out which smartphone has the best
camera
so we're here in the studio and we're
about to take a look at some of the
images I'm joined by James b√¶rum the
Verge's creative director thank you
James and why don't you give the people
an idea of what it is that makes you an
expert in this field
okay well that's interesting I've been
taking pictures for a very long time but
I've been specifically taking pictures
with these phones for the past week I've
had pockets full of phones and if you
caught our circuit breakers show last
week you'll have seen that we went out
and shot some pictures and started
comparing them and then we handed the
phones over to you and you've been
picked up the mantle and I've been doing
it ever since yes and we we decided to
pick these phones not only because
there's some of the industry leaders and
sales and things like that but they just
are the best cameras that are out there
as far as the top tier of smart phones
that you can buy right now there are
definitely some other competitors that
we could have included in this test but
then we would have been here for the
rest of eternity so we're gonna be
viewing all these photos on a retina
MacBook Pro but we know that not
everybody has access to a screen that's
that good so we're also gonna take a
look at them and some other settings
we're going to upload some of them to
Instagram to see what they look like
sort of at the end state of everybody's
images these days and then we're also
going to take a look at them on some of
the phone's screens which is where I
think most people probably do the
viewing to begin with the interesting
thing is 90% of the pictures you take
you look at on your screen on your phone
yeah you're not gonna do what we're
gonna do so this is the only way we can
really get into these pictures so what's
this one where are we starting alright
so we're gonna start with this is just a
relatively you know it's not the most
exciting shot in the world it's a little
bit was a dreary day yeah but it's sort
of a good test there's a lot of detail
in the foreground and the mid-ground in
the background and it's a good I think
the biggest example coming from this is
that what phone is this so we're
starting with the iPhone 10 right and I
think one of the things this particular
scene shows more than anything else is
the fact that there's how the different
cameras interpret color and contrast so
jumping to the HTC the iPhone image is
almost a little washed out but but sort
of not as dark the darks aren't as dark
as the HTC which has like black blacks
take a look at the LG which is sort of
on the iPhone end of the spectrum where
it's you know a little washed out a
little bluer then the rest of the other
the other images the note eight is a lot
warmer which I feel like is something
we've come across a lot with shooting
with these phones this is really
interesting because Samsung is as I say
everything looks like it's been dipped
in tea it's slightly brown but if you
click back to the iPhone it's pretty
close it's a little bit more grain than
brown yeah but it's definitely in the
same kind of color gamut as the yeah
we're a Samsung whereas HTC LG yeah yeah
much more blue and a pixel which is this
one which is also blue but like probably
maybe the most accurate of like what it
actually looked like in that moment my
memory serves but if you look it's
definitely you look it's so funny and
this is the problem with doing these
comparisons is we're gonna be bounced
around yeah and then you come back to
the iPhone now now the iPhone looks
awful in green like and I didn't really
notice that before okay so I'm gonna
keep interrupting you just because it's
going but look if you go to the pixel
what's interesting about this is the
overall thing is kind of that gray blue
like the HTC like the LG but look at the
colour of the cab here yeah the water
taxi but also there's still quite a lot
of brown here and a lot of brown here so
it's not it's not pushed so far to the
warm end of the spectrum as the Samsung
or the iPhone and I think another way of
saying what you just said is that it's
taking it's taking all that colour
information and sort of representing it
in a representing all of it better as
opposed to you know skewing the picture
because it's dominated by one particular
part of the color spectrum right
absolutely I think that this is a really
good it's actually a really good choice
of pictures because it's very neutral
thank you of course well you know you
know what you're doing it's very neutral
it's very flat as well so you've got
very even tone from the foreground and
the background and I think that this
kind of image really shows up the
neutrality of the pixel camera which is
I think having played around with them
myself for a week
that you've been playing around I think
that's my immediate takeaway about the
pixel it is the kind of in most
environments it's the most neutral see
what I wanted to do and one of the
reasons I shot this photo this way was
also to show off the sort of detail
capture of all these different smart
phones with the big thing that separates
all these smart phones and the cameras
on them these days is the software
processing that these companies decide
to do and not in like a you know filter
white kind of way I mean software
processing is in how they're getting the
information off the sensor into the JPEG
that it shows you and that process is
handled so differently by all these
different companies and it sort of
there's artistic judgments being
incident and sort of judgments being
made as to like how to like make the
photo look because you're going to be
looking at on a smartphone things like
that I think that this is a cool point
to make at this time it's like two sides
of a coin neither side is more valuable
than the other and the two sides of the
coin here are the hardware and the
software and I think by bringing it to a
screen we can see exactly not only that
Hardware decisions that are being made
like two lenses on the iPhone here and
those software treatment of that to
create a final image so I think it's
really important that's why we want to
do real-world we don't want to go down
the bench testing route this is about
this is what these pictures look like
yeah I mean the hardware is closer than
ever on these yes you know these days
and they're all sort of pushing up again
against the same physical limitations of
putting a camera in and like a space
that small on a smartphone so here's the
iPhone 100% view right of this image HTC
is a little wider so yeah not getting
quite as these were both shot this is
shot with the wide angle of the iPhone
and you know that only camera is you see
it so pretty good you don't get quite
not as just quite as much detail there
right the LG ooh and this is something I
found and I think we noticed this when
we were doing that yeah first go around
with these the LG is fine details
especially ones that are in the deep
background of the photo always seem to
have this like aberration they're always
a little bit blurrier it doesn't have
quite the resolution and even the sharp
bits on to show
right in Akutan right here yeah yeah I
mean you look at some of the detail on
the rope
right there's just tons more get on the
iPhone so much and on the HD stations
really good now Samsung kind of the same
it's sort of blue some of the is this
whole crazy thing with Samsung is it
takes sharp pictures and then softens
them yeah it just seems yeah and then
let's take a you the pixel which is
again I think like right in the middle
uh-huh I think the iPhone might make you
think it's got more detail there there's
like a little bit more sharp I also
think is to your point that it's got
lighter shadow detail right here's an
impression of more detail yeah but I
also think I think we have to be honest
look at the difference there like the
iPhone is sharper yeah and I think that
this as well is is it using both lenses
to get the sharpness in the background
or is this just one I would assume it's
just using the wide one but that's sort
of the thing like one thing we don't
know about how Apple uses the dual lens
system right now is like we know it will
use those two lenses to help the other
out sometimes but it's not explicit as
to how it does that sort of like we're
not totally sure how Google does the
software things yeah it does with HDR
plus so the other thing I'm gonna make
here is I've noticed with pixel much as
I love it it's very crunchy
it's adds a lot of contrast it's almost
in a Photoshop we call it a high-pass
filter where it just you bring out that
textural sharpness and it's sometimes
goes a little bit crazy with it yeah so
I think the iPhone and the pixel
probably have the best photos here and
it's really hard to pick a winner like a
winner if we were gonna try and do that
the iPhone probably overexposed it just
a touch which it I found it tends to do
but they're all relatively good I think
the pixel is probably the best like them
yeah I don't like representation of what
that seems like I also think that the
pixel camera is the most photographic
I've said this before as I think they're
the files off the pixel look the most
like a camera shot rather than a phone
shot mm-hm
nice picture a much different scenario
this time this is obviously on the
subway this is
you know sort of low and challenging
light not the darkest situation you'll
find because there is a lot of bright
sort of LED lighting in here but lots of
variation in the light and the scene
which makes it challenging for a
smartphone to handle and so we have
let's take a quick look again we sort of
get different color representations of
some of of the scene like some bluer
stuff again from like LG and the Samsung
and then the pixel it's really funny
that the Samsung is so blue yeah yeah
it's it took a different it I sometimes
when it's reading lights like the
information coming from especially LED
lights it it will cast that color across
the scene I've tended it notice but this
one I want to dive right into the
details yes because it what's
interesting about this shot is if you
look at the highlights on these pillars
you've got that it's an overall dark
picture with then very brightly lit
white areas which is very hard for a
camera to retain that level of detail
because it's got to make a choice and
the choices are compromised and it
basically lands in the middle yeah can I
fit all the information in the brightest
brights and then the darkest darks of
the picture so it's got to pick
something it's you gotta swear
allegiance to one partner gotta make a
choice sometimes yeah so we gonna start
with the iPhone or were you gonna what
are you looking at now this is the pixel
and I think what's interesting about
what the pixel did is is this is like
where you almost start to get into the
territory of what I was talking about
where it's almost doing a little too
much with its HDR because I think the
point you made is really good about how
there's detail in these brights that
some of the other like the HTC missed
some of those tiles yeah the iPhone
missed a lot of those tiles that
surprise Sam so I missed a lot of this
house so that the pixel captured more
information in the brights while not
losing the information in the darker
parts look at the detail on the subway
map behind here that you could almost
read it yeah and the Samsung is fuzzy
that LG looks like it's been painted
the HDC again HTC's a little bit wider
and so that means like when you're
looking at fine detail it's it's if it
feels like it's farther away it's
smudged and iPhone did a decent job but
yeah the pixel yeah it really does feel
like you can read the individuals so
it's very clean there doesn't seem to be
it's almost like in paint where paint
bleeds the colors bleed yeah these are
very kind of restrained and crisp and
clear right all images within the lines
which is kind of funny I think if you if
we think of contrast ratio you know as a
visual thing that here's a contrast
ratio on most of the phones the pixel
just has a broader gamut it's gonna
capture more in the dark and of more in
the light and and just give you an
overall better exposed image and I'll
say it like one of the things that we I
think both you and I were not expecting
coming into testing all these these
smartphones out is that we weren't
expecting the HTC to find like the HTC
is as good as the iPhone and the pixel
at in like a bunch of different settings
sometimes and and that was something
that surprises both of us and here is
like that one of the clearest examples
of that like this image looks a lot like
that maybe not at the detail level when
we zoom way in but when you look at it
sort of zoomed out it has the same sort
of color balances the pixels image it
has the same sort of dynamic range where
you know it did lose some of the
highlights but the shadows like look you
know the detail is still here like we
saw in the pixel image so like the HTC's
camera I don't think it was as
consistent it Mistborn than the pixel
did but when it hit which is still a lot
it did almost as admirable a job but
yeah I think is really nice to see from
a company that made smartphones with
great cameras that led the pack years
ago I mean like they were the thing that
like the iPhone was catching up to
before I got to the sort of iPhone 4 era
I think you you are absolutely right it
was definitely the surprise of the test
I had no idea it was going to be as
consistent this is another sort of
challenging scene for a smartphone
camera because we've got again some
bright brights and dark darks and a lot
of intricate like lines lit a lot of
fine detail just something that's harder
for you know underpowered phones to
resolve very close terms yes and what do
you mean by that a lot of close down so
if you look at it overall it's it's the
squint test if you squint and you can
see what disappears it basically turns
into bluey gray at the top gray green
here with black of the branches and the
roof line so it's it's very uniform and
then as you said those bright warm
lights hanging in the tree which confuse
everything so I mean I think the you
know the pixel again did the best job of
keeping the highlights from being blown
out maybe a little too dark overall was
it when you look at this scene you were
that you took this pictures how which is
the one that's most like the season I
missed it like crazy exposed a bunch of
stuff is green again which is like I
think the iPhones got a really great
camera and I think it's probably one of
the two best you know layout may be
behind the pixel the pixel too but it
still has this tendency to make it green
to put this green cast on things which
is just a really weird thing that I
don't know why that's never been
hammered out of the system HTC probably
did one of the most if not the most
admirable job of some of the details and
the highlights but the color throughout
it doesn't have as much of a green cast
there is separation in the colors down
at the bottom of the photo like you were
talking about like you can squint and
see some difference in the green and the
brown here yeah whereas the LG's just a
little muddy I mean it's the same deal
as we've seen in some other photos where
like I mean I think it did a pretty good
job resolving some of the detail back
here but it's not as good as maybe
something like I love
maybe I'll just eat my words you know I
guess it's about on par with what the
HTC did there and the Samsung is again
like pretty even I think the iPhone
missed more than any one of the other
hands did a better job but if you zoom
into the Samsung I we're gonna see this
smeary effect again and it's like in the
roof line and everything it just looks
everything's got a wash over it it's
kind of weird
yeah but the color is bleeding I mean
look at
here you can actually see the blue he's
bleeding around let's take a look at
what that did in the iPhone it's not I
found it a way better job with that way
you actually see detail in this like
grassy thing where is apparently that
all got lost but it was not in the
Samsung if you zoom in you can also see
on the iPhone how much artifacts is
adding from the sharpening what we
wanted to do though with with some of
these pictures and with this one in
particular is look at it in an even more
neutral platform then maybe this screen
which is Instagram because you know how
much do these differences matter if
they're all being funneled through
instagrams compression algorithm which
is probably removing a lot of these
these differences in the first place so
we have uploaded a few of them here I
think the one where it's showing me the
most of what Instagram is doing is we
zoom way in here on the LG versus like
what we saw here let's get to the same
spot the LG which we knocked a little
bit for resign some of this detail like
still was able to get some of these like
the finest little branches here whereas
like in the Instagram oh no that's as
big as it's going alright you can see it
yeah like I'm looking at this spot right
here where you know that's a nest of
sort of information like with all these
branches and twigs and here it's just
like it's been blurred together it's
there's all these artifacts from the
compression yeah and that you're also
noticing it in the shadow data on the
trees is if you if you jump back to the
original picture looking at crisp the
separation of the different colors of
bark are okay then once you get into
this is kind of again it's almost like
it's stripping some of those colors out
it's making a decision of this is this
kind of brown this is this kind of green
yeah and so what matters about that is
you know we take a look at let's say
whoa here the HTC which we said handled
the scene really well right mm-hmm that
actually looks worse than the LG does on
Instagram it lost so much more detail in
the sort of back
branches of this tree that it you know
the the HTC photo uploaded on Instagram
on the HTC phone viewed on the web now
is to sort of give it a neutral platform
looks worse than the LG photo uploaded
Instagram on the lg phone like that's a
weird thing that like it's stripping
more information out of the file from
the HTC phone than the LG one which like
apparently had less to compress I don't
know I think looking at them I would sum
it up like this is it's the platform
kind of it's like an amplifier for
whatever the trait of the image is so if
the image is slightly soft it's going to
make it softer if the image is slightly
contrast II it's going to make it even
more contrary if it's slightly warm it's
gonna make it even warmer it just seems
to take these decisions and push it that
much further as you said you know we saw
that slight softness in the HTC image
and that's now much more pronounced when
we look at it through instagrams what
was the pixel one like on Instagram
that's fine
you see it's made it flatter and darker
yeah it looks even darker and moving
under than it does sort of on this
screen here at least here there's some
information in the shadows it doesn't
feel quite as like dark and dour and
here it it's it's subtle but it there's
definitely a little bit more here that
that was lost in sort of the dark end
I definitely think that's my takeaway
from this is if you have a slightly dark
picture you're gonna put it up and it's
gonna be it's just gonna push it that
much further right in whatever direction
because I mean you think about it like
all right if you have a slightly blurry
photo or if you have a slightly dark
photo or slightly bright photo or
whatever like you were talking about its
exacerbating those things because they
are there because of a lack of
information yes right like the photo is
blurry because it did not resolve the
information to make it sharp it was dark
because it did not capture enough
information in the shadows to bring out
the detail and so it's just gonna sort
of exponentially run down that path as
you run it through Instagram if you were
to upload some of these you know the HTC
which is a little soft upload is
Instagram a couple more times I'm sure
it would just be like one big foggy
image by the time you did that I mean an
interesting exercise would be to
actually then process the image
before you upload it so you start if you
know it's going to block up you fill in
some shadow detail if you know that it's
going to go too bright you bring the
highlights back or push the color up I
mean I think that that's the other side
to all of these images there's the this
is what the image looks like now what do
you want the image to it and I think
we've said that at the end of the day
these phones take really really good
pictures and a lot of these choices are
going to come down to what kind of
pictures do you like I mean if you like
brown fuzzy pictures then the Samsung is
for you I mean let's just put that out
there and clearly there lot of people do
they sell a lot of folks mm-hmm just
like if you want to if you know if you
are going to live with the fact if you
get an iPhone you're gonna have to live
with the fact that it overexposed
sometimes yeah the question then is does
this change the opinion of like which
camera did the best in this situation I
think maybe it does I mean I think the
best photo out of the camera is looking
at it on the screen was probably the HTC
alright and on Instagram it's the one
that sort of got rekt the most in the
process and so I wouldn't agree with
that I would say like mmm the pixels
like I guess the LG seem to have held up
well I don't know
no it's what's that one yeah yeah I mean
it lost like we said it lost some detail
in this like one nasty area but it
actually liked it wasn't as fuzzy as
some of the other ones wound up being
and that color was pretty medium to
begin with so it just wound up looking
kind of medium in the end the problem
with once you start viewing the images
on Instagram and saying well now you've
seen the image on the screen and now
you've uploaded it which do you think
handles that the best the problem is the
answer is it depends on the picture I
think that if you're going to upload a
bright sunny day with a deep blue sky
and a bright red car and a big green
bench then the brightness of the iPhone
is probably going to make that look
amazing yeah I think if you've got muted
colors grain shadow detail backlit which
we've experimented with before and then
and the pixel 2xl pixel too is going to
kill it I mean it's just by far the win
yeah I think the htc is still the
average one and I and I think these kind
of tests are very much we're trying to
find definitive answers and the actually
the answers are this is probably the
best maybe but then you could compensate
for it so where do you stop you could
say well if I have an iPhone I know I'm
gonna kind of push the push the color
balance a little bit I think that's the
point where you where you lose people
right like right most people aren't
going to do that to try and compensate
to make the photos look better they just
want it to work and so like at that
point you know you just have to know
that Instagram is going to sort of again
skew or enhance the albums that you're
already dealing with yeah I mean I think
the answer is that overall you know
where you are with the iPhone you know
where you are with the pixel - yeah I
think consistency on the other three is
means you're probably gonna know a
little bit less I think that's the thing
I think that you can compensate and take
into account what the iPhone 10 and what
the pixel 2 are going to do and they
will consistently always do that ok so
here's another sort of weird test that
we want to use to show like how
differently these photos can look how
much differently so can I just say this
yes so you know where I said we should
get into the weeds yeah so we're gonna
get into the weeds with pictures of
leads what we're looking at right now is
a picture that was taken by the pixel to
excel on the pixel to excel screen and
on the iPhone 10 screen same picture
same picture and already on it it might
be hard to see in the video but like
already it is insanely different
insanely different yeah you know we
don't have like true tone or anything to
turn it on these are just sort of we've
got the pixel to excel in the screen
mode that actually matters whatever one
they call it the one that doesn't have
dumb colors the right one yeah the right
one and then the iPhone just sort of in
its standard mode and the iPhone is
interpreting the pixels photo is like
almost kind of dull you know it's doing
it deliberately very for ya right it's
very flat like there's
not as much contrast yeah it's still a
good photo it looks like it's you know
representing some pretty good detail but
here's something crazy right we've been
saying up to this point how the iPhone
makes everything look green and the one
color it's stripped out your pixels
image is the green has gone yeah in
comparison that pixels is just like lush
and beautiful and it's got all this
vibrant color it's just gone it just
looks like this is normal and this is
after a few days when the waters gone
and it's gone a little bit brown so what
I want to do is get in a little bit
closer so we can see some of the detail
I'm having trouble because then Cole
hates Google yeah the Google try that
won't let me zoom in further on the
iPhone but you know one thing I will say
is that you know they're not
representing the they are resolving the
detail any differently this is really
just about color the difference here and
I don't know like I do pulled back kind
of look like the way that the pixels
looks in the pixel but I the sort of
photographer in me is looking at this
one and saying like that's a more
realistic image because like I was the
hair using this picture those greens
were not that green and that blue was
not that blue like that is an aggressive
reproduction by Google and in sort of I
don't want to live in the real world
fair enough let's take a look at the
other way around
yeah the iPhones photo and the pixel
okay okay so the other way around now
we've got the iPhone tens photo from
this scene on both of these screens and
it's doing the same thing I mean it's
like almost the exact same differences
the iPhone is almost like it's making it
more neutral yeah I mean this is like a
real color profile kind of problem
you're like you know you have one photo
that's the same everywhere but it looks
different everywhere yeah and so it's
the same thing again we've got the pixel
sort of really going crazy on the colors
making the greens way more green the
Blues way more blue which is much more
muted but interestingly it's blowing out
the detail on the flowers a little bit
yes pumping up the contrast yeah well I
mean I think we noticed that in the last
one but I think the difference here is
that the pixel
photo of this scene wasn't as
contrasting it was a more it had more
dynamic range mhm and the iPhone didn't
quite nail that as much and so the pixel
is sort of exacerbating it because it's
screen is punching up the dollars in the
contrast and so it's making taking a
problem and making it work so - yes -
you'll point out earlier if the
information isn't there is not that
right so remove from all that sort of
phone screen trickery now we're looking
at those same two images here on the
retina MacBook and I think a pretty wild
difference in the sense of the pixels
image actually looks flatter wave I'm
not as saturated as it did on the phone
which is super weight it feels like we
got flipped I actually almost called
like thought I was looking at one and
not the other and the iPhone has sort of
greener greens and more purpley purples
and but it's much more blown out it's
blowing out the color yeah this is yeah
it's a really remarkable
so clearly the screens are actually that
last stage of punching the color yeah
because the pixel this image here the
colors are basically more muted you know
what it's like it's almost like we're
looking at the pixel in neutral mode and
then when they're looking on the screen
its enhanced mode right it's the punchy
mode so anyway maybe that maybe that
even makes sense yeah and as far as like
how the pictures stack up against each
other I think the pixel really got this
one better I think the iPhone might be a
little more pleasing initially just
because there's a bit more color there
it's also a little bit warmer and a
little bit greener in that sense not
just the screen in the image but in the
way that it tends to apply those sort of
casts to the homage this sort of like
haze of warm colors and green colors but
the pixel obviously much more meted much
cooler dude but like just way better
detail again it didn't lose the detail
in the highlight detail in the
highlights as well as just the sharpness
like the detail of the actual like
subject like the actual flower is in
here much more rich this is it feels
like blowing it's blowing out it can't
these times on their on the flowers it's
like actually and this wasn't it's not
like I took them in different settings
like where the Sun was out in the it
just really read this read a muted scene
well mm-hmm and the iPhone sort of
didn't and kind of missed it so so we
haven't talked about one of the sort of
flagship features for some of these
phones yet because not all of them have
it in the portrait mode and so the ones
we're talking about here the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 the iPhone 10 and the
pixel to XL so this is just one portrait
mode photo we're not going to go into a
whole bunch of and this is I think
probably the most representative things
that we saw a lot with portrait mode on
the different phones which is that the
iPhone tends to create probably softer
maybe less sharp looking yes portrait
mode photos and it's more progressive
yeah and then and then the the depth
that it's sort of creating by blurring
some of the background yet it seems more
progressive it feels more like it's
trying to and doing a good job of
recreating the sort of blur that happens
is you know towards the back of the
image whereas the pixel I think in most
photos has better edge detection than
the iPhone 10 it is finding the sort of
seams around a person's head or their
hair or whatever the subject might be
even if it's not a person it's finding
those seams better and sort of cutting
around them better but the part of the
problem with that is like it's doing
that and then immediately just blurring
everything else yeah it makes everything
feel like a cardboard cutout which is
aggressive in some images and not in
others and so I think the pixels
portrait mode like might Wow a little
bit more from time to time but I
actually wish it did more of that sort
of progressive blurring that made it
look like it was coming out of an actual
sort of like SLR camera kind of thing I
think that having seen these now I mean
the the Samsung is so it's got the washy
it's got the warm it does it does what
it does I mean the notes of the Note 8
again like it it's aggressively
smoothing the features on his face it's
sort of missed the exposure it does the
it handles the blurring kind of well one
thing I love about the Samsung that I
wish the other two phones would adopt is
you can yes while
shooting or after you've shot a portrait
mode photos slide to adjust how much
blur there is on the pixel you can sort
of toggle it on and off which is nice
but I wish there was that feature on the
iPhone I feel like Apple's never gonna
not believe fully in its ability to get
it right so we're never gonna get it but
and it and it it's it's so dependent on
the picture that you taken with one of
the good reasons to use this is there's
so much detail in the background
obviously if you have a cleaner
background then all of the cameras do a
better job yeah and I think one thing to
note about the way the iPhone does port
remote is it seems to really I think
it's sort of like almost cheating in a
way that when it knows it's got a face
it really tries to keep the focus on the
face and it's even blurring his shirt
we're like that maybe I don't know with
a really thin aperture like a really
good portrait lens like that would
happen if it was really we working with
really small depth of field but you know
like I think that looks makes more sense
to me on the Samsung photo or even the
pixel photo where like his shirt should
be in focus like maybe not as cardboard
cut-out he is yeah a pixel did it but
but I think the pixel did better detail
and better color representation here the
iPhone always skis a little warm like
we've seen in most photos but especially
in portraits and and that warm kind of
greeny cast I think gives a weird
feeling when I'm looking at someone's
face I just don't like that they apply
that there so I think it handles the
portrait mode a little bit better yes
but it still has some of the problems
that I have with the the way that the
iPhones software processing is being
applied to it it's really funny that
having used these phones so much having
being the owner of a pixel I never use
portrait mode yeah well we into like
some of the other things we should talk
about with these because it's not just
about having like sort of the best
camera that captures the best detail in
every scenario that's great obviously
and I think if we're talking about just
that I think the pixel to excel wins I
think the best I think the pixel from
last year would probably beat out most
of these phones in certain situations so
the two excel I think and the software
team that they have pumping are very
Google to make the most out of the
hardware that they have you know only
having one lens not two and all that is
just they're just crushing
and they are again a sort of step ahead
of the pack when it comes to just like
image quality in every situation
one thing I don't like about the pixel
to you Excel and it's portrait mode is
that is buried in the sort of hamburger
menu and you like can't just easily
access it it's easy to forget that it's
there as far as like the UI go you want
I don't use it that's a problem yeah
yeah I think that's probably part of it
but you can go too far on the note eight
the their version of portrait mode is
called live focus and it is right under
the shutter button all the time which
makes it feel like you're always in
portrait mode even though you're not you
have to tap it even though it looks like
a swipe and that is mind-boggling to me
hate is that I hate that and I also hate
that on the Samsung it shows you what
lens you can switch to so it says yeah
x2 for the telephoto lens but on the
iPhone that means that you would be in
that lens and it's just it feels so
backwards that was to me and I think
that's another big difference here like
software across all these is wildly
different and we're just talking the
sort of stock camera apps for these
phones one thing that I think the
Samsung does the best out of all the
rest of them is it still to me is the
quickest EF camera and and by that I
mean it's the quickest camera when I
take it out of my phone I can double tap
the power button and the camera is just
up and ready to shoot the HTC the pixel
will also do that if you tap a double
tap the power buttons I don't think
they're quite as fast and Samsung's
autofocus is still really fast I think
probably still a class above the others
especially during video and so I think
that's probably still the fastest it's
it's real small though the difference
between that and like the HTC and it's
something that I wish the iPhone would
really address I wish there was just a
way to to launch the camera easier I
still hate swiping over to the camera
because it I never get it right 100% of
the time
and the new sort of 3d touch button on
that 10 at least it puts it in a place
where I know I can find it but like I
just I wish I had a hardware button
honestly I think the most the fastest
I've ever launched a camera app on a
smartphone is the sort of s 7 and older
category of them I remember those damn
home button and it was just is so much
better okay so we've come to the end of
the video
we've been arguing a lot and now you're
expecting us to tell you which is the
best camera we're not gonna do that
actually yes we are it's the pixel right
so no because I think the pixel is doing
things that is more impressive than some
of the other things I think they have a
better lead on the rest of the
smartphones as far as their cameras and
I think they can take it to more
interesting places
I think the iPhone is right there with
it if not a little behind it I love the
versatility of a second lens and we
tested this on the circuit breaker show
the telephoto lens is still like we're
using over just cropping in unlike the
pixel twos image there is a quality
difference so I like that and I do like
some things that the iPhone does like
live photos you can re select an image
now so if you just miss the moment you
can pick the one that you that you
should have had and it also does some
interesting software stuff like long
exposure simulations with live photos
now so I think apples got some
advantages over the pixel I think just
like hands-down most consistent gonna
always give you the best photo in most
situations I don't think you can say it
isn't the Google pixel to it I own it
but I was just trying to be the most
sort of diplomatic diplomatic I mean
there are times and I think that this is
the point there are times when an iPhone
is going to be better there's times when
the HTC u 11 is gonna be better times
maybe not when the no day it's gonna be
better or the LG but I think we have
three that are sort of in a class of the
others and then these are the sort of
bests that are out there which is why we
picked them in the first place exactly
we have way more comparisons on the
website so make sure you go find the
smartphone camera comparison there where
I'll have just way more detail than we
could fit in this video so look for that
