and Google Maps for the iPhone is
finally here and I got to say it's
pretty amazing now what you're looking
at here is actually the b-roll footage
that Google has provided to media
outlets we haven't had a chance to shoot
a video of the app ourselves yet
although I did get a chance to take a
look at the app when I was at Google's
offices the other day so what you need
to know about Google Maps for the iPhone
is it is really fast and it is
completely native Google is using
vectors to draw the map which means that
it doesn't take up a ton of data and it
just pans around really fast on the
iPhone 5 that we saw it on it was even
better performing than I've seen Google
Maps performance and Nexus 4 or galaxy
s3 the other thing about Google Maps is
that it's really well designed it takes
a lot of the design cues from the recent
Gmail for iPhone update which means
there's nice clean white info sheets you
can swipe around between different parts
of the app and you know it just looks
great it's the best-looking Maps app
I've seen on any mobile phone of course
most of the standard Google Maps
features are here you have turned by
turn directions you have standard
navigation you have full transit
information you have satellite view you
have Street View you have indoor view
about the only thing that isn't here is
indoor maps and there's also no support
for offline which is kind of a bummer
hopefully that'll come in a future
update although there is some caching
that happens but it's not fully
dependable if you're not going to be on
the Internet so Google Maps fully
supports turn-by-turn navigation and it
will actually work when you're not in
the app what it does is it takes a
standard iOS pop-up notification and
gives that to you and your turn is
coming up so if you're on the lockscreen
or if you're in some other app a
notification will pop up when your next
turn is approaching and that
notification will actually be spoken if
you turn that on which is a pretty
clever feature one other thing about
Google Maps that's interesting is that
Google is providing a couple of tools to
developers to integrate Google Maps if a
developer chooses they can choose to
link to Google Maps instead of to Apple
maps from within their app to give
directions and whatnot and developers
will also be able to build Google Maps
directly into their own apps using an
SDK that Google is releasing so that's
just a quick overview of what there is
on Google Maps on top of Google's
footage of Google Maps we'll have our
own hands on and impressions of the full
app very soon stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
