here today at the 2017 Detroit Auto Show
checking out the new Kia stinger in 2014
Kia showed the gt4 stinger concept at
the Detroit Auto Show and now three
years later its unveiled the real thing
and it sure has some bite to it the Kia
stinger has two engines and the juicier
option is the 3.3 liter v6 that makes
365 horsepower and clucks a 0 to 60 mile
per hour time of 5.1 seconds now the kia
is no supercar it's not hitting anywhere
near 200 miles an hour but you certainly
can have fun going 167 miles per hour in
this twin turbocharged v6 kia is only
offering an 8-speed automatic
transmission and the singer is available
in both rear-wheel drive and all-wheel
drive of course driving enthusiasts will
go crazy for the rear-wheel drive option
for years Kia has said it would build a
rear-wheel drive sedan and now it's
doubling down in that promise in the
world of sports cars the sting is
usually associated with the iconic
Corvette Stingray certainly not kia the
south korean automaker but the game is
changing and as this is a date Auto Show
if you're looking for a car that has the
looks to capture the attention of a car
enthusiast Kia offers a welcome reprieve
to the fleet of crossovers and other
more utilitarian vehicles that are on
display we care a lot about the TUC
inside of the car but we have to admit
it sure is fun to see a car that has
some decent lines and a bit of wolf to
it and when you think of Kia you might
not think of it as a true luxury sports
sedan but Kia's aiming for big-time
competitors like the Audi a4 and the
mercedes-benz c-class
it's curious that Kia is also focusing
on the sports sedan market well so many
automakers are turning their attention
to cranking out the crossovers but this
is a new direction that we're actually
quite pleased with because
we like up for sedan coupe a if you're
going to get out in the open road and go
for a drive well we still actually drive
our cars we might as well enjoy the ride
along the way for more amazing car
concept content and what you actually
might drive this year please subscribe
