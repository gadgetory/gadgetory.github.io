has been bolstering its digital health
and fitness offerings by buying popular
apps like mat my run and the food
locking app my fitness pal but it's also
forged a partnership with HTC for
hardware products and this year at the
Consumer Electronics Show we're seeing
some of the results of that partnership
this is one of their newest products
it's called the health box you can buy
all the product separately but if you
buy the health box it's a little bit
cheaper and you get some added bonuses
as well all right let's get into the box
start with this thing right here no it
is not
a round hoverboard it's a wireless scale
it's you a wireless scale they pretty
much does what a lot of wireless scales
in the market do these days it measures
your weights and then it wirelessly
sends it to an app in this case it sends
it to the you a record app it also
measures your body fat percentage
it recognizes different members of the
household when they step on it if they
have varying weights dresses you by name
which is kind of cool so when I skip on
it it says hi Lauren at the top here and
an LED lights and then it tells me how
many pounds I have to go until I hit
whatever goal I've established yeah one
thing I will note about it is that
because it's round it can be kind of
difficult
usually I just shove a scale on the
corner somewhere and this obviously
isn't fitting in any corners takes up
some space but that is the UA Wireless
scale it costs one hundred and eighty
dollars on its own if you buy it outside
of the health box this over here
nothing's too exciting it's a heart rate
strap it costs eighty dollars on its own
measures your heart rate it is a little
bit less expensive than some of Under
Armour's previous heart rate straps but
you can find something like a Garmin for
less than $80 that's for sure but Under
Armour's trying to sort of pack
everything together into this health box
for you the third product in the box is
this it's the UA band it is in some ways
your standard risk based activity
tracker it has the triaxis accelerometer
so it will track your steps and other
activity throughout the day it tracks a
variety of workout activity
running cycling weightlifting walking it
does track risk face heart rate it
automatically tracks your sleep it is
not waterproof so it's not ideal for
swimming or really even showering and it
also does not have built-in GPS now if
you look at the form factor you might
not think something like this would
really have built-in GPS but it's worth
noting because earlier this year
HTC had announced another band called
the HTC grip which was supposed to have
built-in GPS that product was ultimately
shelved HTC and Under Armour decided
instead to focus on this so this is the
new UA band a lot of ways it's kind of a
standard commodity activity tracker but
once again Under Armour is hoping that
you'll use this in conjunction with the
other products it'll get you into their
app system the whole thing this costs
one hundred and eighty dollars on its
own just like the scale all of these
things together if you were to buy the
whole health box not useful visually
plus four hundred dollars so you are
getting a little bit of a deal if you
buy the box and you're also getting a
one-year subscription to the premium
versions of that my run and MyFitnessPal
there's also more though that we're
gonna see it CES outside of the box</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
