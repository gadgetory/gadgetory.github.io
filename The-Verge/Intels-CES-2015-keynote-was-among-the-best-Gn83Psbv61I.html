amazing experiences now possible because
of Technology Intel is bringing to life
we're going from a two-dimensional world
to a three-dimensional world this
additional dimension will change how we
experience computing perhaps you heard
or seen realsense technology it
understands us much more naturally
unlike most cameras real sense can see
and understand depth we integrated real
sense into the world's thinnest tablet
the Dell Venue 8 7000 took picture
earlier of my favorite gelato here and
again because real sense understands
depth we've left it black and white but
let's say we want to add color we want
to add color as we go along the length
of the gelato I simply scan along here
and as it goes further and further back
I add the color back in let's let's talk
to our cook Chuck here and have him show
us how realsense applies here hey Brian
how's it going good Jack how's it going
I brought my laptop I want to show you
well it looks like my daughter's laptop
half the time yes yeah this is what
happens is when you bring your laptop
into the kitchen and use it with yucky
fingers right up so real sense can take
care of that full thing for you let me
show you so you can see I've got my
chicken it's all marinated here you got
the dry rub growing but yeah so using
the realsense camera I can prevent that
see I was able to bring that recipe
right in right and if I wonder scroll to
the end I simply make that gesture and
it lets me scroll the 3d world is truly
here one of the best examples of
bringing the 3d vision to reality
comes from our friends at
P exactly that HP is bringing its
thirty-year print expertise to 3d this
chain-link was printed in under 30
minutes it weighs less than a quarter of
a pound and can lift up to 10,000 pounds
so what happens when you have a 3d input
combined with a 3d display well we've
been looking at different strategies of
bringing your display off of DIF flat
surface and up into 3d here we've
integrated to some custom optics from
our partners at Oscar net to create the
optical illusion of a display floating
out in mid-air almost like a
touch-sensitive hologram the camera on
the left is Jonathan playing the keys
not touching anything it's hands are in
mid-space I can tell you we integrated
realsense true key an ADT home security
pulse interactive alarm system into this
future solution and you can see it's
already green it's already detected that
megan is in the proximity of the door so
let's see Megan into the home so you can
see she walks up her phone is
authenticated she shows her face the
face is authenticated the arm is
disabled and the next step the door is
unlocked door is unlocked
the door is unlocked maybe I should let
Megan in oh there it goes you know it's
just when you get up robots of today can
improve our lives at home and at work
we've been collaborating with iRobot the
company that created Roomba for
consumers to show you what we've created
I'd like to introduce a friend of mine
from iRobot right now
Conoco for my robot thanks for inviting
me here today so thank you for having me
Brian
now there's something very unique about
these drones they also have an Intel
processor the help sees drones use the
information from real sense to see think
and adapt no more collisions guys why
don't you walk through the drones you
could see they put down their controls
the drones are adapting to them we'll
use this drone here and we're gonna play
a little drone ping pong simply moving
the drone between us you see the drone
continues to try and stay in one
position but keep it from going in the
audience
avoiding us at all times these students
can avoid obstacles and the fact is the
real world is filled with all kinds of
obstacles so we decided to build one
here at CES and we want to see if our
drones can safely navigate through it we
call it our very own game of drones what
you see is the drone takes off a day it
will put the controller up as he just
simply releases it and says go from
point A to point B being here
he puts the controller up and the drones
off on its own control you'll see it
moving left to ride but not only is it
moving left to right it's having to move
up and down as it avoids the obstacles
that we put in its place
the Joe's doing this all on its own we
could go in and change if somebody wants
to stand in front of that drone they're
welcome to but we made one last obstacle
to prove to you this is live we put a
set of doors at the end preventing the
drone from getting to its final hole so
let's say we let the drone go home and
we go ahead and open the doors
we knew we could make computers and
compute even smaller and I have to tell
you we've done it we've made them so
small they're like the button on this
jacket I'd like to introduce you to
curri curri is the next generation in
computing this module contains a quark
SOC bluetooth low energy radio sensors
its power efficient can run for extended
periods of time from a coin size battery
or a rechargeable battery the engineers
at Intel ask the question what problems
could we solve using wearables the first
such application was easy to imagine how
could we help the visually impaired I'd
like to show you this using this
mannequin the mannequin has real sense
technology and you can see it on the
side screens as well there's a real
sense camera in the front and these six
sensors around the body and as I
approach it you'll see a jolt from blue
to red as I get closer and there's also
vibration that looks the winner no you
see I'm approaching from the right I'm
approaching from the lap down and
American continues to see as I move
around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
