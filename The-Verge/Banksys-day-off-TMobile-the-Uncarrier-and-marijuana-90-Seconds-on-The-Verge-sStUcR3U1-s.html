robertson and i can control people with
my mind hmm I guess I need more practice
this is 90 seconds on the verge Banksy
is taking the day off after promising
one new piece in New York every day this
month the infamous graffiti artist
announced on Instagram that today's art
was quote cancelled due to police
activity well it's unclear what police
activity Banksy and company have
encountered Mayor Bloomberg has been
outspoken against the work calling it
quote a sign of decay and loss of
control one less work of art for people
to marvel at vandalized or otherwise
seal tmobile continues to prove its
uncarrier anus the company announced it
will now offer free data to tablet
owners including those who buy the
upcoming ipad air and ipad mini
beginning november first customers will
receive two hundred megabytes of data a
month of course you'll need to buy a
tablet that works on t-mobile's network
which is to say you probably won't be
able to switch to AT&amp;amp;T or verizon later
and finally a majority of Americans
marijuana legalized pot according to a
new poll by Gallup fifty-eight percent
of americans are in favor of legalizing
marijuana this number has been on the
rise since the late 60s when a mere 12%
one of the legalization while the shift
in public opinion is clear the political
divide is still there only thirty-five
percent of republicans support
legalization versus sixty-five percent
of democrats and sixty-two percent of
independence and that's it for today's
top stories coming up tomorrow my keep
working out this whole mind control
thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
