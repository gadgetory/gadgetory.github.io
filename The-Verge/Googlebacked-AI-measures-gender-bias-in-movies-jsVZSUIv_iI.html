smaller presence in films than men but a
new tool called GD IQ measures this
gender inequality on a large scale
especially for those who aren't yet
aware of it the software is able to
identify a character's gender and how
long they speak and appear on screen
it's made by machine learning engineers
from Google and the University of
Southern California one example of a GD
IQ calculation is that women got 27
percent of speaking time in 2015's
oscar-winning films that's no surprise
if you take a look at the winner of Best
Picture from that year bird man what do
you do she's my sister for sure
and does she talk and speak GD iq
studied the hundred highest grossing
domestic live-action US films from 2014
to 2016 it found that the only genre in
which women appear more than men is
horror that being said women speak less
than men even in that genre so women are
seen and not heard you could say also
does GD IQ detect this terrifying body
in the shadows as a woman anyway another
interesting future application of the GD
IQ tool could be the Bechdel test the
Bechdel test identifies films and works
of fiction in which two women who are
both named talk to each other about
something other than a man just one time
I was going to give it's estimated that
less than 60% of films passed the
Bechdel test using GD iq for this would
be tough because currently it doesn't
identify the content of speech I hung on
its head for like but it can at least
point to scenes in which two women are
talking to each other the GD IQ tool
uses fairly simple speech and object
recognition which isn't new but the
important distinction is the software's
intentions the GD IQ is being used by
the Geena Davis Institute on gender and
media which works to change bias in the
media and film industry if you haven't
guessed the g d stands for Geena Davis
according to Davis the founder and an
oscar-winning actress the ratio of male
to female characters in film has been
exactly
the same since 1946 that ratio she's
talking about is three to one but hey at
least it's better than the ratio for the
Oval Office right so yeah these kinds of
tools are helpful for calling attention
to the problem but they alone won't put
women on the screen or in the credits
your ass is great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
