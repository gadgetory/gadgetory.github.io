is a big rock formation behind us The
Verge logo and let's have of your tech
editor and this here is cock-crow chief
designer of next bit company that
produces a new cloud smartphone this is
the Robin we're seeing these are the
final versions of the Robin now on day
that's correct well pretty close you
know there's like a few weeks before in
mass production but yeah they're they're
99% there and this is what's a this is
what you showing up here at CES this is
a debut of the final Robins will have it
in black sort of graphite yeah we call
it Midnight's actually so it looks black
but when you put it up to a black
t-shirt it actually looks blue that's
very very deep kind of dark blue and we
have this Minton white combo the other
thing is you're running Android 6.0
marshmallow that's right and you've done
Kickstarter campaign and this is really
the thing we we have a whole bunch of
Android phones am I actually my first
question for you is why should people
care about your Android phone because we
have Android we have marshmallow but you
have something different so can you tell
us a bit about what's different about
the Robin sure well I think there's a
couple of things I think first of all
you know if we were to put the iphone
and every Android phone out here on this
this great verge table oh you mean this
huh that's right nothing really stands
out actually i think you know ever since
HTC to the m7 and apple kind of copied
that technology and then like you see
kind of the industry all kind of
bringing that quality level up you can
machine metal you can put chamfers on
make it shiny what that's left is kind
of a sea of sameness out there nothing's
really breaking out of the pack so from
an industrial design perspective we
wanted to create something for people
that was cool like a really cool android
phone which I don't think really exists
out there so it's very fresh design it
gets its premium nature kind of kind of
a kind of different value set and say
okay we're going to do the kind of
traditional like machining chamfers and
making it shiny and so I think that kind
of reduction in detail that kind of kind
of very fresh approach to kind of very
approachable you know a repeated motif
of the the circles that you see on the
product really creates something that's
kind of modern and very fresh that's
number one number two is this phone is
designed to never
on a space so it has 32 gigabytes of
on-board storage but we've integrated
100 gigabytes of cloud storage into it
and that basically when you
traditionally or you're at a concert or
you're at your friends your friends
house and you were taking a photo you're
recording a video you get that message
that says hey you know what you're out
of space you go delete some stuff you
know never believed to delete some
photos or delete some apps those are the
two primary things that people delete
well now actually because we actually
integrated the cloud in we can actually
my great stuff on and off the phone
dynamically yeah and allow you to
basically you know use that cloud kind
of supercharged the phone a lot of
Android has been kind of it hasn't been
cohesive mmm he's be kind of piecemeal
yep so how do how do you feel you've
done on that front have you managed to
do a Trudy cohesive OS and experience I
think so I think you know I think ever
since you know we had material design
come out with Android actually I think
that Andrew is actually a pretty good
spot right now it's actually much more
key see if that's and it's ever been
yeah and so really if you look at the
interactions i would say that 99% of the
interactions are stock Android you go to
how you add widget to the widget panel
its stock it's got a slight visual
design tweak that we have which is very
clean but its stock if you look at the
way notifications treated its stock if
you look at the settings area its stock
except for the storage tab where we have
integrated the cloud in and that just
because I don't think we need to
reinvent the wheel there Google's done
such a phenomenal job kind of bringing
that up to a kind of what I would say a
pretty good quality level now we don't
need to reinvent the wheel from a visual
design perspective we do want to create
something that feels fresh and that's
harmonious with the design and then
we've made that simple tweak to the to
the home screen because I think that
also speaks to the kind of simplicity
message number one number two is to help
people understand how we use the cloud
it actually provides a very available
feature for example I want to pin a nap
you know I can't actually do that in the
stock Google launcher to show that an
app is being restored from the cloud
can't show that sort of stuff in another
launcher so that sort of ability they're
doing a launcher allows us to kind of
help communicate people how a
cloud-first phone works now if you don't
like what we've done
this phone works with Google now
launcher you can download it you can
download any launch you want you just
arrived here as he s what are you
looking forward to most from the other
categories from the other yeah you know
it's funny we get asked that a lot and
to be super honest with you it's super
hard for me to actually get out on the
floor because our primary focus here is
to kind of tell people about Robin but
the things that I'm kind of most
interested in is there's a lot of stuff
on automotive there's a lot of stuff on
wearables that I'm kind of interested in
seeing I'm still kind of like I look at
wearables and I'm not quite convinced
you know that it's a real category and
so I'm kind of still looking well let me
take that back let me pull that back a
little bit I'm not sure it's a
mass-market product I think it could be
in the plea and like you know a
bluetooth headset where yeah fifteen
twenty percent people have them great
they love them and the you know the
another set of percentage actually don't
don't use them or don't have them but
there are kind of unique kind of
verticals that are very specific maybe
just particularly around sports like
having a wearable that's particularly
like you know what I want to measure how
much air i get when i go snowboarding
and i did a jump and stuff like that so
I think there are our kind of like I
think more niche kind of applications
which I think are very interesting just
recently I was you know looking at some
VR stuff and I'm like okay I get kind of
sick doing it so it's kind of hard for
me but I'm just trying to like beyond
gaming like what is it is it this VR
become the thing that you go to the mall
and actually experience or is actually
something that will drop and get to a
price point in the home that we're
actually all going to do and we're all
going to experience so I'm sounding kind
of curious to kind of see how these kind
of early technologies transform and move
into a place where they can be more
ubiquitous and I just want to bring that
back to the Robin what I know with
Samsung is they'll try something you
won't work and they'll leave it and
there won't be that much support so for
people who might be interested in
getting a Robin how do we know how can
we trust that the company will keep
supports yeah no I think that's you know
what I Mac I can promise you all day
long that we're committed to that stuff
we absolutely are you know one of the
benefits of not going to carriers it
allows us to basically move much faster
on doing Android updates we're launching
with marshmallow which is something that
we're super proud of and we're you know
we're already starting to work on six
point 0 point one
and and hopefully we'll be able to do
that in the latter half a first latter
part of first quarter so so I think that
you know the goal is that try to get
people's security updates and software
updates so they get the features and
functionality as they want as early as
possible and we're committed to doing
that but you know like the proof is in
the pudding again I'm not going to sit
here and promise you all day long let's
see how we do you know we're going to be
shipping pretty soon and you know we're
committed to delivering speakership
harder units yet can I squeeze out a
date from you yeah absolutely so you
know it we're Kickstarter campaign was
in September and what we told our early
bird our early backers which was limited
to a thousand people on the gsm side was
that we would ship it in january and
actually we're not actually going to hit
january however we are new there is good
news we're actually about two weeks late
so we will ship the early backers on
februari 16th we will ship all the other
gsm phones a couple days after that and
i think the last bit of news is right
now the phone is available for pre-order
we're actually going to close that
pre-ordering down on Feb on january 15
so just in about a week and whoever
whoever basically pre-orders the phone
by january fifteenth we're committed to
shipping that by the end of februari
understood thank you for much free time
