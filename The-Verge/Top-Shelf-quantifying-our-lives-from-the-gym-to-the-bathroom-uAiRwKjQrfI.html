Pearson this week we're talking about
self knowledge all the things we know
about ourselves and it turns out there's
a lot more than there used to be thanks
to our phones and apps and weird devices
throughout our house the question is do
we want to know all this data and if we
do what do we do with it all so before
we get too far let's start with what we
know now if you were committed to it
it's always been possible to track your
life you could count how many laps you
ran around the track how many sets you
did on the bench press or how much you
weigh but now that there's a smart phone
in your pocket and companies can build a
computer smaller than your thumbnail
there's almost nothing you can't track
most people still track what they always
did steps calories and wait but the same
devices that give you that information
now give you much more you can track
your sleep not only how much of it you
got but how much as it was deep sleep
and how much was restless and how many
times you woke up during a night you can
track your eating habits both what
you're eating and what it's doing to you
as well as how fast you're either are
you chewing enough there's actually a
gadget that will tell you there are also
gadgets and apps that will tell you how
you're spending your time whether or not
you're getting a work done and whether
or not you're meditating ever wondered
about your amino acids now you can know
more about them than you ever dreamed or
probably want it most of that other near
amino acids I guess it's just an easier
way to track data you could have
theoretically figured out before but it
gets crazier you can track when you last
bleeps how long your poops last and what
it all says about your eating habits
speaking of which you can figure out if
you're technically eating too much just
by using an iphone app it says your
stomach is stretching if you're
overfeeding yourself which is terrifying
you can even take a picture of a food
and figure out how many calories it has
so you won't stretch your stomach too
much if you're particularly clinical
there are devices for tracking your
heartbeat and your blood pressure some
track your surroundings in your moods
too so you can figure out that warm
humid rooms make you sleepy and cold
rooms make you mad some will even change
the temperature once they learn how you
feel you can chart your mood against
your diet too and I bet you'll learn a
lot about what makes you happy and what
doesn't the list really goes on and on
want to know how much time you waste on
Facebook down to the millisecond there's
an app for that want to take a picture
of your surroundings every 30 seconds so
you never forget anything you ever did
ever check wondering when you last
and how it was all you have to do is
download an app combine it with one of
the food crackers and you'll probably
figure out why it was or wasn't very
good all this data collection is
becoming more and more automatic just
strap a thing to your wrist or stick it
in your pocket and forget about it but
for now though there's still a lot you
have to input yourself and that's kind
of a lot of work so the big question the
next question all these companies and
manufacturers have to answer is what am
I supposed to do with all this data I
know how much I weigh I know how much I
mean I know how good my sex is I know
how good my poops are so what so there's
a lot of questions left and here to
answer all of them is Danberg our
reviews editor who you're kind of into
this stuff right I've a minimally I i
got the fitbit zip which is like the
most basic tracker you can possibly do
because this little guy yeah let's look
at that one and you you clip it that's
like that goes on your butt don't you
lose these I've lost all of the ones
that I have tried by see if I find him
six weeks later I'm like well this is
useful to me yeah if I slip it in my
pocket or something it will fall out but
I just keep it clipped to my belt and
all this one does is pretty much measure
steps and so it's basically like a
glorified pedometer you know and you can
have the app and you can see all the
different stuff but it doesn't do as
much as all of these other things so
what why that one that like what does
that do for you well i tried the up and
the the job went up and basically like I
just never remembered to like turn it on
to the sleep mode and like they're you
you're motivated for like a week or two
weeks so then all of a sudden it just
kind of fades and the information like
is in the background so what I want is
something that like I don't have to
think about and it just is there and
then I can view the information when I
want to and then it's there yes that's
the real question right is what how do
we make it so that much more than just
steps is tracked automatically and sort
of collated for you and stuff is done
with it and so you've done it you've
looked into some of the ways people are
trying to do this so what you found like
our people working on this they're
they're trying to the the real quest
like you are saying is to get the most
amount of data from the least amount of
user action right and it's interesting
how different people are approaching it
like the FuelBand the Nike Fuel band is
awesome because you wear it and it
abstracts things it's way too yeah it's
pretty and you don't ever have to think
about it it's not like you're tracking
your steps and your sleep like it just
gives you a number that it's like okay
do I hit that number or not right that's
the thing I like about this is it's
totally like abstract yes all you're
doing is better but that sort of defeats
the purpose of having all these cool
sensors and data and stuff right i don't
know but so but with all the all the
rest of this stuff people are trying to
do sort of more aggressive things than
nike nike seems to have just admitted
that they can't do it yeah i can even
try yeah but there's like the Fitbit
flex here collects a ton of data mm-hmm
but what's like how what do I do with it
what are people doing with this data I
mean that's up to the users right now
the the manufacturers are only able to
like present it and try to like
visualize it and they give you charts
and graphs and you can kind of see and
correlate different moods or activities
of different steps and feelings and
stuff and the actual meeting is up to
the user I guess there's no real like
this is good and this is bad but isn't
that isn't that like broken sort of
fundamentally where you're you're making
me do all of this extra work myself and
it's like you said getting the most data
from the least user interaction and
there's like jawbone is doing some some
interesting stuff with this yeah right
what's there what's there well their
land they're trying to track in the mood
and like how you're feeling versus your
activities right so that's really
interesting why things is also doing
something really interesting they've got
the pulse here and this even has like
little fingerprint thing on the back so
you can take your heart rate interesting
and their app is kind of unique because
they really focus on your overall
wellness and health they're like okay
well these are four quadrants it's like
activity and it's sleep and its weight
and like all these things and they're
trying to be overall healthy and the
pulse fits into it their weight tracker
fits into it you can use like a bunch of
other kind of apps and services to link
and do it to kind of get this as well
small to it it was just cool well so
okay so those other apps and services or
what I'm really curious about so this
does sort of one thing for me right and
with things makes other things with
things or why things I don't even know
but they do other things to where they
have the scale yeah that matches with
this too but isn't the dream to sort of
make all of this work together where I
can wear this I where the that wacky
headband when I'm sleeping I wear
something else
I'm you know just living my everyday
life or when I lose this is that ever
going to happen are we just totally
segmented and screwed here I think we're
going to get there the the Whiting's are
the withing uh they're the closest their
API is open so you can kind of connect
to it and kind of use the data and their
app can connect to like the Zeo headband
it connects to RunKeeper to track your
runs it connects to like all these
different services to like track your
food and everything else and they're
kind of bringing it all together but
their implementation is more okay here's
your steps and view your step activity
and here is your food view your food
activity rather than by day which is
what all the other apps are doing so
kind of segmenting it out they kind of
lose the daily history that you get the
value from all the other apps okay but
so we have all this other data now right
and even outside of sort of the the
fitness stuff there's all kinds of other
stuff were able to track yeah um and you
you're telling me before about this guy
who took video of his kid and was able
to figure out sort of like a lot of
scientific discoveries about his son or
daughter just by having all this data
yeah that he recorded his child I forget
like from like birth to two or five he
ended up collecting like 90,000 hours
worth of video like had a camera on his
kid at all times you know he put it in
his house so like in every single
individual room like nine different
rooms different cameras and collected
audio and video throughout this and then
he went through was able to analyze it
and what he was looking for was the
evolution of language so how does a
person learn how to talk based on their
interactions with people their
interactions with objects and kind of
the the way people actually learn and
think based on their interactions and it
was really interesting and he kind of
took that experience and related to okay
the dissemination of information were
like a presidential speech and everybody
watching it what's being absorbed what's
being learned and how does that kind of
shape society as a whole so he's able to
watch you know what's being said to his
child and how that sort of comes back
out of his child then or later or
whatever exactly and that's just a big
data play that he pulls together but so
then does he have to go through 90
thousand hours of video to try and put
all this together yes that sounds awful
yeah it's it's tear it was like 200
terabytes
of data so yeah there there needs to be
like an easier way to kind of bring a
meaning to this because that's
meaningful like understanding how
language and learning and information
works is meaningful but going through 90
thousand hours of one person to get it
is not anything like anybody can do so
what's going to take is it going to be
one company that's gonna have to just
sort of take over the ecosystem and
hopefully make everything that we need
for everybody or are there is it going
to be like a back-end that does it all
or what's how do you see this going
what's going to happen here first I
think there's going to be one company
that's going to do a lot of things
they're going to do it really well after
that I can see it kind of opening up as
other people are like okay here's how to
do it really well and then having like
one big back-end so like people can have
their own system or server just like you
have your own email box or something you
can collect information from everywhere
and make meaning of it or whatever is
meaningful to you right yeah I mean that
would be that seems like the dream right
as you can have all your different
devices and then they you know they're
sort of the dots and then there's
something living in the background just
connecting them all yeah and is that I
guess just a matter of them all these
companies Fitbit and weddings and Nike
and all them just working together and
sort of owning the fact that you know
more data is better yeah that I mean
working together or opening up so that
other people can get in there more but
it's also up to people to figure out
what the actual meaning that is
important like if I'm tracking my steps
that I'm not going to learn about the
evolution of language like it's finding
out okay why is that step count
important and it's interesting to me
because I can see okay well I'm not
really getting as many steps as I should
be I'm gonna start taking a walk in the
morning or do something like actionable
just because I like getting up to the
ten thousand daily recommended steps but
beyond that it's not too much meaning
yet I guess and in order to get like the
meaning like the sleep the food that
you're eating that that takes a lot more
work and there needs to be a way to not
do the work because I forget and people
forget like if you forget for two days
you go back and you have an incomplete
history your motivation to keep going
just decreases each time well and all
your data becomes sort of exactly messed
up right exactly okay so the one place I
think we've gotten this
right in a lot of ways and that makes me
excited for the rest of its running this
is like the big thing that people are
into yeah and so basically is did we
strap all of these things onto you I
think that's what happened every single
one of the sweetie all of these and more
on to Dan we send him running and we
want to figure out how accurate is this
data how good is it how interesting is
it and basically how sweaty can we make
Dan on camera the current trend in
Fitness says the more data that you have
the more fit you'll be so we took eight
different devices and apps from eight
different manufacturers who are
subjecting them to the same run down the
West Side Highway here in New York City
we're going to let you know what we
liked what we did I ran a total of 1.5
seven miles in an average pace of 10
minutes and 10 seconds per mile somewhat
surprisingly all of the different apps
and devices counted pretty much the same
number of steps the s4 is walking mate
was the lowest they counted only 2526
steps the jawbone up was next which is
2535 steps the Whiting's Polson counted
2539 steps the fitbit zip was 2540 steps
and the fitbit flex was 2546 steps in
total the run earned me 590 fuel points
on the nike+ fuelband which is about a
fifth of the activity that's recommended
for the average active day anything that
was strapped to my arm became
uncomfortable as I was running and
keeping things like pocket just kind of
moved around and weren't really secure
all the devices that i was using with
the exception of the runkeeper were
designed to give an overall sense of the
daily activity level the runkeeper app
on my iphone was the only product that
is not designed for constant all day use
and thus provided the best information
while I was running including distance
pace and time the only problem was I
couldn't really see it when it was
strapped to my arm and I didn't want to
hold it or put it in my pocket I was
able to slide bracelets like the Fitbit
flex the jawbone up and the nike+
fuelband higher up on my wrist they
wouldn't move around
I ran but over time they kind of became
sweaty underneath and it was
uncomfortable although not unbearable
the clip-on trackers like the Fitbit
flex and the Whiting's pulse width at
least noticeable but I lost the
Whiting's pulse on a previous run after
incorrectly returning it to the clip so
I was constantly paranoid that it was
going to fall out again I liked all the
information that was provided by the
runkeeper app but I wish that there was
some way to view it on my wrist because
that would be much easier to see while I
was running my ideal product still isn't
out there but I'm gonna keep looking
that's our show thanks so much for
watching thanks to Danberg for being
here and a very special thanks to the
good people of the West Side Highway
we'll be back next Monday and every
Monday we'll see you that</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
