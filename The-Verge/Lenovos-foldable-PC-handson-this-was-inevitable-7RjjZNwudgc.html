Verge and at this point,
you've probably heard of
the folding phone trend,
but this isn't a folding phone.
It's a folding PC.
(upbeat music)
This is a prototype folding PC
from Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 line of laptops,
and it's exactly what it sounds like.
It's a full Windows laptop
that you can also fold up.
Now what we're using here
is a really early prototype,
and a lot of the specs haven't
really been announced yet,
but here's what we do know.
It's a 13.3-inch, 4:3 folding display,
similar in size to a Huawei MateBook X Pro
when it's unfolded,
and it's about the size
of a hardcover book when it is folded up.
The hardware here is by no means final.
Lenovo has plans to add an
IR camera for Windows Hello
and video calls somewhere
on the top over here,
that's just not on this prototype yet.
And things like port placement
might get moved around
in the final design, too.
The idea, though, is the
ports will be arranged
so that there's always one handy
no matter where you're using the device.
Whether that's standing up on your desk,
lying flat like a tablet, or on your lap.
There's also going to be a SIM
card slot on the final version
somewhere for cellular connectivity,
but again, that's just not here yet.
Lenovo is promising, though,
that the folding ThinkPad
is going to be a true laptop-class device.
It's not meant to be like a tablet
or a companion device
that you take on the go
when you're away from your laptop,
like Lenovo's Yoga Book
or Microsoft Surface Go.
To that end, Lenovo will be
including a miniature keyboard
in the box with the folding laptop,
so that you won't have to rely
on a weird software keyboard
or pay extra for an accessory.
It'll also come with a Wacom stylus, too.
Unfortunately, there's just
not a lot we can show off here.
There is a functional version of Windows
running on this hardware, but the deeper
software integration from
the foldable display
just isn't ready yet.
There are a few mock-ups
that we can show, though,
of what it might be like to
use a device like this.
So you can browse the web
either using the entire display
as a touchscreen tablet,
or by using the attached
keyboard and trackpad like
you would with a laptop.
You can pull up documents,
so you can use it for
reading or consulting
like it's a kind of digital book.
You can split the screen in half,
using one half to take
notes with the stylus
or a digital keyboard, while
keeping your source material
on the top half.
The whole device is pretty
cleverly weighted, too.
It weighs less than two pounds,
but most of that weight
is with the battery
on one half of the device,
so it stays upright on your
lap without tipping over.
The hinge is pretty strong, too,
so it's easy to adjust to
whatever angle you'd like.
The stylus is attached to
the front of the device
and is part of the folding mechanism.
The front of the outside of the device
will actually slide
upward when you unfold it,
which moves the stylus
to the side over here
so that it's accessible to grab.
Using the device is nice, too.
It's a really good size.
It weighs about as much
as a hardcover copy
of one of the larger Harry
Potter books for comparison,
and the ability to hold it
partially folded like a book
makes it really comfortable
to hold in one hand
compared to, say, a rigid tablet,
despite the fact that
this has a larger display.
There's still a lot we don't know about
the folding ThinkPad laptop.
There's no word yet on battery life,
although Lenovo says that
it is targeting a full day.
And the company has been similarly
mum about internal specs,
like the processor or RAM,
although it will have an
Intel chip of some kind.
The screen isn't quite
finalized yet either.
As you can see, the prototype here
has really poor viewing angles
with these blue-shifted colors
when you're tilting the device,
which is especially problematic given that
if you're using it partially folded,
one of those screens is
going to be at an angle a lot.
To Lenovo's credit, though, the
crease is really hard to see
and feel, even on this prototype hardware,
which is good to see.
Although, there's obviously
big questions still
about the durability of foldable displays,
especially in the wake
of Samsung's Galaxy Fold.
Lenovo does say that it's adding
a reinforced protective
layer on top of the polymer
OLED panel for improved durability,
but we're going to have to wait
and see how that holds up
in the real world before
we make any judgements.
So yeah, there's still
a lot we don't know.
We still don't know availability
outside of that vague
&quot;first half of 2020&quot; window.
We don't know price.
We don't know what the
specs on this thing are,
but it's a PC and it
folds, which is really cool.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
