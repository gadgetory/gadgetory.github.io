at GDC 2013 in San Francisco we're here
any of bahar's design studio fuse
project one of the things he's been
working on lately is the Ouya console
we're going to talk to E as CEO Julie
Uhrman so this is our first real look at
the initial version of the Ouya console
interface that's going to be going out
to Kickstarter backers and it's really
minimalist yeah we wanted me to be
simple minimalistic we really thought
about gamers we wanted to be intuitive
for anybody that picked up a controller
and to get you into what's most
important to us it's about playing games
and making games and you'll see on our
home screen there's really only four
categories play is everything that
you've downloaded discover is where you
find great content and games to download
make is where you get to learn about
making games so you get to have a direct
relationship with developers if you're a
developer it's where you can upload
build so that you can test and try
things out before you launch them into
the Ouya store which is our discover and
manages just our settings and what about
things like streaming video booyah
supports streaming video streaming audio
we've already announced the
relationships with vivo and iHeartRadio
Flixter is coming oh yeah we support
XBMC in Plex so if you want to make new
your entertainment Media Center you can
tell me how the store works we call our
store discover it's where you'll go to
discover great games the way that you
will experience and find games it's
really based on two things one is we
will have content and games that we
feature so games that we love Kelly
Santiago who runs the developer
relations for us is curating the store
so today we've got three featured
channels that can grow on a daily by
weekly monthly basis we're also going to
look for external people to help us
curate the store so developer friends
and universities and we really want
people to discover great content we also
have our genre tags so you can find
games based on genre we dig deeper into
games then sort of the top level genres
so we want to be we want to qualify
these games as much as possible so in
addition to allowing a developer to tag
games we'll go in and tag games with
genres that are more representative of
what is really happening so you can see
the words like fight and short on time
and we really want to make it as
descriptive as possible and then the
last way that you find games is really
based on our algorithm which is based on
fun and what makes a fun game and to us
that is engagement so how long have you
played a game or how many times have you
played a game in a certain period of
time and we want those games to surface
and that's that's what the sandbox is
for right exactly every new game the
latest games goes into the sandbox you
can play all these games and download
them you can search by them by name but
for them to get out of the sandbox and
actually be discoverable within a jean
or a featured category they have to be
really like they have to be fun games
and so once they get a certain metric
they'll be ejected out and you'll be
able to you know discover them just
through basic navigation of the discover
store
we also think this is great for
developers because it really encourages
them to really promote their games and
let their audience know that this exists
and go ahead and find it and play it and
if you like it thumb it up and and get
it out of the sandbox and all these
games have some kind of free tier but
how do you tell what's going to how
you're supposed to pay after this every
game is free to try that's really the
only rule on you is that it has to be
for you to try but our games can be
micro transactionally based or you could
have a demo and then you have to unlock
the whole version I mean you already
have a game today that's donation based
so you'll learn about the monetization
elements when you're playing the game so
how much is actually in here right now
in the catalog and how much is that
going to change by law
the catalogue changes every single day
we have north of 60 titles already we
are seeing games from every different
type of developer from triple-a to
independents and newcomers we've never
even seen before
we've already had developers that have
iterated on their game multiple times
but as far as our launch in June it's
hard to tell I mean we think there could
be hundreds of games so who have you
been talking to when you're trying to
get developers to make and you mentioned
a lot of them at Isis one in five who
have not actually made a game yeah I
mean a lot of the developers were seeing
our experience game developers who never
built an Android game before and we're
seeing game developers that have never
built a game before but have aspired to
and now because they can bring games to
the television via now they're really
starting to build the games thanks for
talking to us Julie and once again we're
here with oh yeah its shipping out to
Kickstarter backers today and then it's
got its official launch on June 4th</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
