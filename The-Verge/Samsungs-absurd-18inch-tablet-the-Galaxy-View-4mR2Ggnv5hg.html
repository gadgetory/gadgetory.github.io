Verge and we're here looking at the
Samsung Galaxy view technically speaking
it's a ginormous huge tablet it's 18
inches so the screen is positively
massive this is a Galaxy Note 5 I have
here and it is dwarfed by the size of
this tablet Samsung has made this mostly
for video entertainment and consumption
you've got Netflix Hulu and you can
download HBO Go and lozano
HBO all the kind of stuff you'd usually
watch and so they've got this home
screen here it's a 1080p screen so it's
not super sharp resolution but I mean
most of the content that you would watch
on this is probably going to max out at
1080p for now anyway so aside from the
home screen here you can just kind of
swipe over and you've got your usual
Android home screen with folders apps
and all that stuff Google Play Store and
your app folder so from that perspective
it's a pretty common tablet at a very
uncommon size so for TV providers here
you can choose from Time Warner Cable
there's Comcast DIRECTV that's about it
for now samsung says they're going to
add more maybe switch them out over time
as is the case for this home screen
which you actually can't customize
yourself but they said its cloud-based
it'll change over time with new options
maybe slim TV hopefully it'll come there
HBO is actually not in this menu but you
can download it and run that separately
so if I swipe over there you've got HBO
right there as well so the point of the
galaxy view is to watch TV shows and
movies and it does that for a long time
Samsung that says it'll run for eight
hours on a charge and that's straight
video playback so that's pretty good for
binging on Netflix or ever taking it on
a trip you can just kind of hit play and
I'll keep going and going and going so
that's the very big samsung galaxy view
it'll be out pretty soon and you'll see
