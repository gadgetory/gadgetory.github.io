CES Nvidia announced what it called the
VR ready program which is a way to tell
if the computer you're buying will work
with the HTC vive or the oculus rift the
point of this program is that actually
very few computers right now can handle
these headsets so we want to check out
some ones the cam so why do you want a
PC instead of just the gear VR or Google
cardboard because you can actually do
some amazing things with the rift in the
vibe you can scale Everest by actually
climbing with your hands you can shoot
people by picking up real guns well they
look like real guns and firing them at
enemies and throwing grenades it's an
amazing experience that you can't get
anywhere else the computer that VR ready
now might seem hopelessly obsolete in a
couple of years you might like with PC
games just be constantly chasing better
and better specs are these VR already
PCs are they going to be for gamers are
they going to be for everyone are they
going to be for the very few who
absolutely want these single best VR
experience you can get we don't know but
for now there are a lot of fun if you
want to see everything else we're doing
at CES you can check this one on youtube
