homes businesses and city infrastructure
in the aftermath the Department of
Housing and Development set up a task
force to rebuild the city a Dutch water
management expert joined the force and
launched a contest called rebuild by
design to promote innovation and provide
resiliency with the hope that the
winning designs would make the city less
vulnerable in the face of the next
disaster
so water management is very complex
water does exactly what it wants it goes
everywhere so you can protect let's say
your own house but then the water just
goes to your neighbors when I started in
working in the US the first question I
got from our reporter was okay mister
ofing are you gonna you know save New
York by building a storm surge barrier
next to the Verrazano Bridge and that
idea is it was it I think it's exactly
the problem we all face all over the
world we want simple solutions we want
the silver bullets which is the wrong
approach because there is no silver
bullet when it comes to water if you
would embrace water as part of your life
as part of the economy in their culture
you will come up with a multitude of
solutions that all together form a
comprehensive plan the competition
invited designers scientists engineers
thinkers and leaders to reinvent
Solutions and safety measures for the
New York New Jersey region out of 148
entries the six winners balanced local
needs with aesthetic and functional
value the first thing we said to the
teams in their design phase was stop
designing the first thing you have to do
is build a coalition and don't design
for them but you know work with them to
get to a design that's inclusive of this
community that also builds in the needs
and the understanding and the capacity
of that of the neighborhood and informed
by the process your design one of the
most ambitious projects is the big you
effective system designed for Laura
Manhattan which was hit hard by the
hurricane the team proposes to shield
the low-lying region from floods and
future storms with elevated beams and
pavilions with folding doors the big you
will stretch across ten continuous miles
and provide social and environmental
benefits to a high risk region yes what
the idea is that the big you is almost
like a chameleon that it changes
character and color every time it
encounters a new neighborhood in the
East River Park it's really like the
pack terrain races towards the highway
protecting the pack from the noise of
the highway but also protecting the city
from from flooding then as you move down
and you get under the FDR the elevated
highway in some places we have placed
pavilions with galleries or marketplaces
inside them they've had these sleeves so
that they're always open there's always
space between the pavilions but in the
case of a flood out of these sleeves
giant doors can come out and and create
a continuous flood barrier through our
dialogue with the local communities that
even though the the big U is one
continuous effort it really changes
character all the time so you'll never
be able to see it as a big piece of
infrastructure rather it's the social
infrastructure of that community that
really changes its character in its in
its appearance we owe it to these
communities we owe it to ourselves and
our our next generations to make a
better place I think in the end if you
look at it what a city is all about is a
lot of different people from a lot of
different cultures a lot of definition a
let√≠'s coming together in a restricted
space to try to maximize the
possibilities for each and every
individual to unfold themselves to
express themselves and what we try to do
with the big U is to really in a way
turn this public participation process
into something that actually improve
the design something that generates
designs something that generates
diversity something that generates
surprises we are in a very intelligent
smart competitive region we have the
mines here we have the hearts here
if the understanding we don't have an
excuse not to create a better region ah
there's only one way forward</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
