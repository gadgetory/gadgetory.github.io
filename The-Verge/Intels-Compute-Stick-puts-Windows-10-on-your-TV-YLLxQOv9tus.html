verge and today we're checking out the
Intel compute stick the tiny little PC
that fits in your hand so as the name
suggests the Intel compute stick is $159
Windows PC the idea is to bring your own
display be that a TV or some old monitor
we've got sitting around plug it into
the HDMI port and what you end up with
is a full Windows machine now the
compute stick isn't a powerful PC it's
got a pretty slow Intel processor inside
just two gigabytes of memory so you can
rule out gaming or any really demanding
apps but for everything else you do with
Windows Office email web browsing this
little thing works great so it's got two
USB ports built in one of those is USB 3
so you can plug in any accessories that
you might have but you're probably gonna
want to use one of those or an external
hard drive
since the compute stick only has 32 gigs
of built-in storage that's not a lot but
there's also a microSD slot built-in so
you can add more room for your photos
music and whatever else that way to the
compute stick works with Bluetooth
keyboards and mice freeing up those USB
ports for other stuff and the Wi-Fi is
really fast
it's got 802 11 AC so that's good enough
for HD movies and even Xbox games so
remember how I said the compute stick
isn't powerful enough for playing games
it's pretty good at streaming those
games from an Xbox already in your house
so for 160 bucks you can use this as a
second gaming machine in a bedroom or
some other place in your house pretty
cool and way cheaper than buying a
second Xbox one the compute stick is
fantastic as a home theater PC for
Netflix Amazon Plex those kinds of apps
there are more expensive versions coming
on later this year those will play 4k
and they'll be a bit faster but even
this compute stick right now is cheap
and it's a fun way to carry windows with
you wherever you go just find the screen
plug it in and that's all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
