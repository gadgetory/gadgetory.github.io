being a nerd and clicking to watch the
extra footage from the hyperlapse video
this is oh I'm I'm Ryan Manning we
should say who's here
I'm Ryan Manning I'm John Locke oh mercy
no Tom Connors
I'm Jimmy Shelton Jimmy is the person
who was on the glidecam in this video
and I'm the one that was on the
hyperlapse so just want to talk about
how crazy hyperlapse is like the way
it's the way that hyperlapse stabilises
is like so like it knows my java scope
and my phone knows where my hand is
right now and then it's like oh so you
were kind of janky and written choppy
when you were moving around I'm just
gonna make that smooth for you because I
know where your hand should have moved
to be smooth as opposed to like warp
stabiliser or any other image stables
that stabilizer that like looks at the
planes in the image and sort of tries to
figure it out after the fact uh it's
pretty crazy it's only it only is exists
for like the phone right now you can see
what the saucer right I like to point
out that that shot it's like really hard
to do so they're really hard yeah so
Jimmy this is this is a glidecam and
Jimmy on the glidecam and then it was
warp stabilized and you can see it sort
of like pulsing there and that's
something you would never get in the
native kit when you're using yeah that's
something you'd never get when you're
using like hyperlapse
cuz you know actually yeah like when you
use warp stabiliser it can be tricked if
something so much it's so I think what I
was doing in that shot was actually
latching on to Sam's body instead of the
seam which messes up a bar yeah and that
happens all the time with warp
stabiliser where we were looking at it
that's Ryan by the way in the in the
blue Kia that to me guys um so you can
see like even this isn't low light at
all in the shot and like you can still
sort of see the weird blurry things from
when it's still like more passable than
what warp stabiliser will do to some
shots yeah which is like I would see
warp stabiliser
hey yeah so I'm just trying to show you
like what my hands did and then the shot
that came from it so that's how I moved
so like when you use hyperlapse you
still have to look like an idiot and
have a like a weird like it's not it's
not like you can just casually shoot but
you have to sort of still get into it
but like the results are pretty crazy
when you do get into an act you still
try to be as stable as your as you can
did you guys film this shot with the
c100 on the glidecam I'm pretty sure it
would fail really hard with all that
detail happening like there is no way
there are like lines to track on to but
I'm pretty sure the feet moving which
completely destroyed that job we're
gonna run up the stairs and then land
yeah hard shot to get anyway so like
yeah the fact that like warp stabiliser
could work in the dark
it doesn't need something to look at to
track on to all it needs is like the
like motion from your the gyroscope
which is crazy but like you were saying
the other day when it's in the dark it
also has to use a really wide shutter or
a slow shutter rather and what happens
then is when it does stabilize you get
motion blur that gets stabilized in so
it's like then of the telltale when you
see some blurriness happen and the frame
doesn't move
do you have any come on where it's like
locked-off shot and then it's just
blurry yeah ah maybe because that's the
stuff to me that's like a dead giveaway
but yeah and like what they're getting
so insane yeah it's insane the only
thing that like that ruins is for me is
that it's so deep if there was somehow
to make this somewhat shallow like you
can do on it like I see 300 or see 100
like oh well that's the thing it's like
the only reason this is a problem is
because like the phone's camera isn't
that great yeah you put this you put
this kind of stabilization technology
into any like see 100 or larger camera
and you're gonna get the same results
but a better camera I know and it's
gonna put me out of business just lazy
this shot when I saw this is like holy
 this technology is crazy so like I
was shaking so much on this shot before
it was like shaky as heck yeah I mean
these kind of shots you could do these
classic like you look like a creep oh
yeah I don't know if I've seen this I
don't think this wasn't a bit oh my god
right hitting this great that's insane
yeah this is weird too like if you have
shooting acquired something it's
actually it's stabilizing to like the
earth and not necessarily like the taxi
you're in so like the taxi jump like
whoa possibly stay stable so like that's
a crazy effect see you do some there's
because it's like a new kind of
stabilization there are lots of like
weird corks that we could people
couldn't figure out have any of the
videos that you shot though Havana
oh now yeah if you like if you lock onto
somebody's face like get really close to
them and focus on their face and then
just like just zoom in and out really
fast like with your arms just like push
it in out it looks really weird it's a
it's a weird thing
I mean maybe help
how's this gonna go I'll throw it in
after this oh yeah this is crazy so like
I was running full speed here this is
like the shaky version one point be
one-handed but we don't have an
alternate angle what I was running but I
was running full speed on this and I
think this is where you oh my god I mean
it's not great you see it breaking down
there are moments where it's like
password right there as a moment as
possible yeah there's like a not sure if
I would still use it I wouldn't use it
one of our videos put like sure but like
you can see what's going on this is your
kid riding like a motorized unit okay so
here's like well this is your kid
running a motorcycle I've questioned
your parent yeah I mean this is markedly
better oh yeah
yeah I think once you get to like high
speeds and very shaky a camera
especially when you go to like one hand
and you have to run they like tilting of
your hand affects it so much more
dramatically like oh I can't blow
bubbles is he doing this now this Angie
yes right um for the end then like like
kinda it was kind of shaky at her web
save either and it fixed it like so like
this even like warp stabiliser gives it
like this kind of surreal then to the
image which I don't think hyperlapse is
even doing like hyperlapse see it says
at times but it's more like sharp where
you'll notice that and feels like a
sharp twitch rather than like the
bending yeah like that might also have
to do with the file that winning smile
yeah this is crazy - like I'm anyway
listening to this go try this
it's wild just run really fast with it
putting in your face oh wow yeah that's
the man my mind it would I still don't
know what it's doing cuz like my mind is
so used to it
having to icon to track onto the image
so I don't even know why it's doing it
that way it's it just knows where it
isn't like imagine it we imagine the
phone moving like shitty
no this is actually you can see what
like hyperlapse will never like solve
all the problems and this one bells like
wow there's some weirdness on the fence
here watch when I the time
to like jump up and down yeah a little
bit but it's not now that's weird
weird but it's it's an effect I've been
seen before which i think is really
interesting about this um but like Jimmy
just imagine like you see all these webs
and stuff just imagine that your phone
knows how you how you moved through the
space but then it goes back through it
and sort of adds like does the
opposition right like I'm like have you
ever in Illustrator drawn like a crappy
janky line and then there's like the
thing that says like smooth it all out
like it just smoothes out your hand in
space it like imagine it going back
through the exact same shot but
smoothing out all of the point which is
actually like a much easier thing to
process that going through and analyzing
the footage yeah the speed which is also
amazing to me because of how long it
takes to stabilize footage in Premiere
to how quick hyperlapse is able to do it
i okay it doesn't if you image process
just like doing spacial taking the data
that is we should look this up before we
did this but we've heard about a thing
that goes into a little dongle that goes
into like the hot shoe on her
on a professional camera that would
collect the same kind of data and then
using software could correct say for
like one of our c100 right or something
so that that's super interesting
somebody's making a device that is just
like a gyroscope that would I guess I
have a third-party app that you plug the
data in to run and your footage and then
it would do the smoothing this way this
is wild
publish yet this is like this I was on a
bike I was riding really dangerously oh
yeah but that anyway that was crazy I
was riding on a bike and shooting and it
was really janky tears like I was like
there's like shitty like concert footage
and like you want to see my hand is
shaking I was doing like sort of a fake
tracking move like a fake jib man but
it's pretty it was pretty dark and
you'll see like there aren't a lot all
right it's crazy even for being this
dark where I don't see much of the
blurring you might see it every once in
a while and lamp light you can see like
it's sort of blurring but it's pretty
smooth guys I mean the unfortunate thing
though is that you're still using a
phone's camera so yeah that is the
inferno the motion looks great the
exposure just isn't good here right and
like that's gonna always be the problem
but like it's just it to me is like the
hope of this for the future is crazy
good we're gonna and like Jimmy said it
does feel like my job will get like
taken away soon because all of a sudden
this computer will take over what we did
what if GoPro had this built in yeah I
mean no joke
I had the contact to somebody at GoPro
and I was like why aren't you guys doing
this now like right now collection like
the biggest problem of GoPro is that
it's shaky and like how hard would it be
to put a gyroscope in a GoPro not hard
how hard would it be to put a gyroscope
in any camera like this this technology
is like the inevitable future of all
cameras the stabilization the way we
used to do it will still be around but
it'll be completely secondary this kind
of stables and you can get away with so
many more bumps and yeah it's great
basically well I guess the other thing
though is that you need to be rolling
then at a resolution that's much higher
than you don't do it well you need to be
like ah like the future of this is
really really high shutter speed this is
a good sort of platform stabilizer yeah
warp stabilizer up going in and
out like it's terrible or precise is web
stabilizer is cool but this is why warp
stabilizer is gonna die stuff like that
well alright I guess it's over
that wasn't ending but thanks for um
yeah Rhonda thank you hey thanks for
watching better
