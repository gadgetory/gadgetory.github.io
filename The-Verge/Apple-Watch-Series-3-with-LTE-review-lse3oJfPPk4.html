watch series 3 with LTE last week it
made a big deal about the fact that you
should be able to now send a message or
make a phone call right from your wrist
even when you don't have your phone in
fact the company showed a woman on a
surfboard in the middle of the ocean
getting a phone call on her Apple watch
series 3 so we decided to test before we
head out surfing let's run through some
of the basics first by now you've
probably noticed that this new series 3
Apple watch pretty much looks the same
as old Apple watches but there are a few
differences the crown of the watch now
has a red dot on it which is supposed to
differentiate LTE versions the Apple
watch from non-cellular versions for
whatever reason the series 3 watch also
has an antenna built directly into its
display it has a faster processor which
Apple Plains makes the watch 70% faster
and of course it has the electronic sim
for LTE the base price of this series 3
watch with LTE is 399 dollars there is a
non LTE version of the series 3 watch
and that cost just 329 dollar so it is a
little bit less and then there's the
series 1 watch which doesn't have LTE or
GPS and that's 249 dollars but if you
opt for the series 3 watch with LTE
you're gonna have to factor in a monthly
cell connection fee which is going to
cost you an extra $10 per month for
people who do decide to pay for that the
real value is probably going to come
from those rare instances when you want
to run out for coffee or go for a jog
without your phone and you just really
want the option to call or text message
to someone if you need to but based on
my personal experience I'm still not
convinced I need to upgrade from last
year's Apple watch Series 2 and this is
partly because the watch's connectivity
without the phone didn't work all that
well for me whether I was in a coffee
shop going for a walk in my neighborhood
or out in the middle of the ocean
Wow doesn't look like I've service out
here hey Siri call it turns out that
having an LTE equipped SmartWatch in the
middle of the ocean isn't really all
it's cracked up to be
I was able to call verge videographer
gear and pave one time from my wrist oh
wait now I either had no service or a
only had one bar of service it didn't
always work that well I tried using
series that didn't work all that well
series not working out here I have one
bar so yeah I mean I guess it's good in
case you really need it but it wasn't
super reliable okay let's talk about
battery life since that's really what's
going to be impacted the most by having
LTE and a SmartWatch I've had a really
mixed experience with the series 3 and
that's partly because the first review
unit I had there's something wrong with
it Jerry wasn't working it wasn't always
connecting to LT even it was supposed to
and a battery was draining really
quickly I mean it was it was dismal so
Apple sent me a second review unit and
that one I think has been working more
like it's supposed to if you're not
using LTE you can probably expect to get
a day to a day and a half out of the
watch per charge just like you would
with another Apple watch once you start
using LTE you will experience drainage
though we've been out here shooting for
a few hours now and around noon I hit
the 30% mark on the watch which isn't
terrible but once again not as good if
you're not using LTE I can probably get
a few more hours out of it at this point
but I'm definitely gonna have to charge
it again today
sorry for the interruption but we have
an update during the production of this
video Apple released an official
statement addressing some of the
connectivity issues with Apple watch
Series 3 and here's what they had to say
we had discovered that when Apple watch
series 3 joins unauthenticated Wi-Fi
networks without connectivity it may at
times prevent the watch from using
cellular the company also said it is
working on a fix that will be issued in
a future software update so that sort of
explains some of the issues I've been
having trying to get the watch to
connect to LTE but we still don't know
exactly
when this new software release is going
to be put out well how exactly it's
going to fix things okay back to our
regularly scheduled review so if you're
like me and you're not 100% sold on the
idea of LTE and the watch and you're
gonna want to know about the software
updates because these are the things
they're gonna roll out to all Apple
watches and change the experience for
everybody not just people who buy the
newest hardware I will say this Apple
has consistently made software updates
to the Apple watch over the past few
years that I've really made it a lot
easier to use this tiny touchscreen and
this year is no exception there are some
new watch faces like a Toy Story watch
face and a kaleidoscope watch face the
most significant of these is a dynamic
Theory watch face which changes to show
you things like calendar appointments
and stuff that pops up in your wallet
in fact Siri even talks back to you on
the Apple watch series 3 the app dock
has also been redesigned again now when
you press on the side button the app
dock is vertically oriented which means
you can not only swipe through it but
you can use the crown to scroll through
it and it's a little easier on the eyes
although it does feel like you're seeing
less at a glance if that's possible
honestly one of my favorite updates is
that the keys on the unlock screen are a
lot bigger it's the little things not
surprisingly some of the software
updates are around health and fitness
tracking since health and fitness
tracking is a big reason why people buy
and use something like an Apple watch
now when you go to start a workout it
goes to open goal by default rather than
making you go through the process of
choose distance or time or calories burn
just to start a workout and if you
happen to use one of those other metrics
regularly then it will default to that
instead when you finish a workout now
the watch just shows you a done button
that you can tap rather than showing you
save or discard because I get this sends
a lot of people will probably
accidentally discarding their workouts
after they were done there are new
swimming features it breaks it down into
what kind of stroke you used when you
were swimming laps there's a barometric
altimeter now which people who do
elevation sports like skiing or
snowboarding or hiking will appreciate
and there's now a multi sport mode so
you can
one workout and immediately start
another but the biggest changes are
undoubtedly around heart rate sensing
now with watch OS for the watch will
show you things like your resting heart
rate and if you opt into it it will also
show you spikes in your heart rate when
you're not working out which could
signal some type of irregularity or
issue all of this is part of a larger
effort to offer more value through the
existing hardware and software that
Apple has because honestly wearables
only have so much value and the
companies that make them know this they
have to keep adding in more software
features to make it just work better so
should you buy the Apple watch Series
three with LTE for $400 plus that $10
per month fee it really depends on how
much you're willing to pay for what I
think is a very rare convenience of
having LTE on your wrist without your
phone around personally I'm not buying
it I mean I just didn't find it to be
all that convenient it drained the
battery life and I even had some
instances like out in the ocean today
where it didn't always work but if you
really like the idea of having it for
running quick errands without your phone
going out for a run we're having it in
case of emergencies then that makes
sense but for me I'll stick to other
wearables
