before in fact you can't really call
vizio Snoopy series a TV at all
there's no tuner built in there's no
on-screen menu there are no built-in
apps for Netflix or Amazon or Hulu you
see this Android tablet is the brain of
everything it tells this nice looking
screen with HDR and Dolby vision what
you want to watch so the new P series is
unlike any TV you've seen before it's a
brand new approach and just maybe the
future and I'm going to during the 65
inch model which feels absolutely
massive in my living room the screen is
surrounded by some really nice metal
bezels they're silver though which some
people might find distracting but at
least they're small you get five HDMI
ports to work with and one of those is
especially good for gaming since there's
really no input lag at all but you'll
notice that there's no cable jack
anywhere you're going to need a separate
tuner if you want to watch over the air
channels on videos latest TVs as for the
TV itself it packs in just about every
modern feature in gwon mainly 4k and
high dynamic range also with Dolby
vision this 0 is full already
backlighting gives you great contrast
and deep uniform blacks and that's
pretty much out of the box you don't
even have to mess with picture settings
or anything like that these aren't quite
at OLED levels but this is up there with
the best picture quality I've seen from
Nelson D display 4k content is taxed
sharp and your 1080p blu-rays was
fantastic in their own right but I was a
little bit let down by my cable quality
and I was never quite sure if that was
the TV's fault or Cablevision's but now
we move on to the remote which is Vizio
staring experiment the 6 inch 1080p
Android tablet is what you'll use for a
lot changing picture settings or rename
your HDMI inputs but it's also what
you're going to use for pretty much
everything else see the p-series doesn't
really have an on-screen menu of any
sort it's all inside busy Oh smart past
app it's pretty easy to use but it's
also prone to bugs you're in there this
tablet even shows you what's on TV but
it can't control your cable box so if
you want to change channels you've got
to reach for that remote to the z/os P
series attired by Google past so just
like a chromecast you can open any app
and start beaming video or music to the
big screen there's some stuff here you
can't get with a chromecast like 4k and
HDR through Netflix Amazon or Vudu
that's something your Apple TV can't do
so that freedom of using your tablet or
your own smartphone to control
TV is definitely nice but I haven't told
you is Vizio also includes this dumb
remote in the box it's got your basic
controls for picture quality channel
changing volume inputs and stuff like
that and truth be told I found myself
reaching for this just as often probably
more so than the tablet that shouldn't
dissuade you from considering Vizio
Snoopy series or even the just updated M
series which is a bit less expensive but
shares most of these features if you've
been dreaming of a gorgeous screen
that's a canvas for you to use the way
you want it to well this is that Vizio
Google cast strategy won't be for
everyone some people won't have the
patience to learn it another is full of
Elders teams the dumb remote the whole
time but worst case you can just use
your Roku to stream this screen right
here the so-called home theater play is
an amazing centerpiece for your living
room based on picture quality alone
