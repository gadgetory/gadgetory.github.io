are you're thinking one of two things
maybe something like the iPad or
something like Microsoft Surface which
is virtually a full PC
well lenovo thinks that is something
different it's a new yoga book it's a
super thin device that features both a
full touchscreen on one side and a
touch-sensitive panel on the other you
can type on this you can write on it you
can even use real ink to take notes
lenovo says has been working on this for
two or three years now and the story of
how it came to be is almost as
interesting as the device itself we want
to hold true to this idea of a book the
book we call the product a book from
kind of day one joke around a lot
because when you say book it conjures up
an array of different ideas so you know
a book that resonates with me as my
favorite dr. Seuss book cat and a hat
that's the one that really yeah that's
the one that really mimics most closely
the dimensionality of this product so we
played around and said and when we say
book you know a Seuss book is always the
one that kind of comes to mind the most
unique part of the yoga book is its
touch sensitive side that's opposite the
10 inch full-color display it can switch
between a full QWERTY keyboard complete
with haptic feedback and a writing
surface they use Wacom technology in the
yoga books included pen to transcribe
writing or act as a drawing pad then
writing mode can even work with an
actual pad of paper and ink insert in
the pen and it can capture written input
when the main screen is off it doesn't
attach like many other tablet and
keyboard systems but instead you can
flip it all the way around behind the
main screen similar to lenovo's yoga
laptop line lenovo says it's spent the
most development time fine-tuning the
keyboards inputs like the virtual
keyboard that's on your phone it has
autocorrect and word suggestions and can
even adjust the size of tap areas based
on your typing patterns the company says
that some people can get comfortable
typing on it in as little as 40 minutes
but most will probably take a couple of
hours of use before it feels natural the
other half of the yoga book is a fairly
standard tablet with a 10.1 inch 1080p
display until Atom processor 64
gigabytes of storage 4 gigabytes of RAM
a battery that's good for up to 15 hours
of use and an 8 megapixel camera all of
that is housed in a thin metal shell
that's just nine point six millimeters
thick when closed
remarkably though certain details such
as a hinge changed over the course of
the yoga books development the overall
form factor stayed true to the original
size thickness and vision it's certainly
a different idea you know you know when
you say tablet you think slate form
factor hasn't changed in five years you
know a little bit boring you know I mean
honestly most tablet you go to the shelf
you know at a major retailer and there's
a bunch of them and they all kind of
look the same we have certainly
reinvented the idea of what a tablet is
and I don't know that I necessarily want
to even characterize it as a tablet
because of that yeah yeah this is the
start of a form factor and a line of
products that we think has a lot of legs
and we think there's certainly an
opportunity right now to be a little bit
more creative in the space you know in
the tablet notebook space combined space
Lenovo thinks that the yoga book will
appeal to a younger demographic someone
who might be a student now or just
recently got out of school
it'll be priced accordingly to starting
at just $499 when it hits shelves in
September there's going to be two
versions Android model and a Windows 10
version but they share the same specs
and form factor the company says that
the changes it made to Android were to
take advantage of the yoga books unique
form factor
I do enhance productivity so there's a
new multi window system and a taskbar
but the windows model has the usual
Windows 10 experience so we concept at
the product nearly three years ago now
so this is one that you know we're
typically nine months on a product
development cycle so for anything to go
three years it is really a long time for
us you know we we have clear aspirations
that we wanted to hit
the thinness the lightness the
simplicity of the form factor the
functionality of both handwriting and
typing capability but all of the
entertainment functionality that you you
know you know in a tablet so it took us
a while to get the the ID right we spent
quite a bit of time on the ID we did a
lot of testing actually just on
usability around the function of the of
the device you know our mobile use over
the last 10 years has changed a lot of
our mindsets and our behaviors so our
devices should really reflect that even
you know even the devices that we use
for productivity with the yoga book
lenovo is hoping that you want to use
your tablets same way you use your phone
and that you carry it everywhere with
you but it's also hoping that you get
some work done on it like you do with
your laptop but all of this depends on
whether or not the execution of the yoga
book is as good as the idea of the yoga
book and when it gets released in a few
weeks we'll find out how it came to be
is almost interesting it's the yoga book
it's a device that is supposed to be in
high ready 3 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
