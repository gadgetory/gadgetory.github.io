the Sony Alpha any xf3 that's a brand
new camera it's an update to last year's
NEX c3 and the NEX cameras are generally
great because they put DSLR sized aps-c
sensor into a much smaller more
inexpensive body the f3 is not a huge
physical change from the c3 it's
actually a little larger it weighs about
a pound with the kit lens on and it's
almost 2 inches thick it kind of feels
more like the NEX 7 then the NEX c3 it's
still small for a digital camera but
this is definitely not something you can
just drop into your pocket and carry
around with you there are some additions
that come with the bigger size though
you get a much bigger more usable grip
that actually makes the camera possible
to hold just in one hand and you get the
awesome pop-up flash from the NEX 7 you
can bounce it or move it down so it's a
much more useful flash than most there
aren't very many dials or buttons to
speak of on the camera you do almost
everything using the on-screen menu all
the menus help you get used to the
camera or tweak settings in ways that
make sense and it's just really simple
but if you've used a DSLR before it's
gonna feel really clunky and harder to
change settings the camera has a super
sharp 3-inch LCD and it's filled with
921,000 dots the screen is great it's
really accurate with really good colors
it's not necessarily very bright by
default and can be hard to see outdoors
but fortunately you can make it brighter
manually the screen also tilts so you
can shoot above your head or below your
waist while still being able to see the
screen which is cool but it doesn't
rotate quite enough down so if you're
holding the camera above your head it's
still a little hard to see unfortunately
the screens not a touchscreen like the
nex-5n but it's still pretty too easy to
navigate with the scroll wheel on the
back and there are few menus in there
really icon based so it's pretty easy to
navigate anyway we get lots of art
filters and scene modes on the camera
and a lot of really wide-ranging and
powerful auto modes the camera also
charges via micro USB instead of needing
a separate charger which is again just
designed to make it easier to use and
less cumbersome to carry which is pretty
great images shot with the NEX f3
generally look really good and there's
certainly a huge step up from a point
shoot camera images are really sharp
details are pretty good and there's
really accurate colors the biggest
problem is dynamic range anytime you
have spots in the image that are
particularly dark or particularly bright
whatever ends up being the brightest
spot in the image is going to get
totally blown out often to the point
where pictures look overexposed and just
bad anytime you have relatively uniform
or controlled brightness you'll get
photos that look great but outdoor photo
is almost
always look overexposed which is a
problem with a camera like this
low-light performance is pretty solid -
that has ISO range up to 16,000 and you
can shoot up to about ISO 3200 and
you'll still get great-looking photos
but things drop off way after that you
definitely get some noise once you start
cranking up the ISO levels the NEX f3
can also now shoot 1080p video at 24
frames per second or 1080i video at 60
frames per second the c3 couldn't shoot
1080p video at all so it's a nice
upgrade video looks pretty good it's a
little oversaturated and darks can be a
little too dark at some points but the
video still looks good the camera will
auto focus and zoom while recording
video but auto focus in particular isn't
particularly great it searches a lot and
focuses and refocus is really fast so
you get this kind of jarring experience
as you go in and out of focus and it
switches as you record video auto focus
in general is actually one of the
biggest weaknesses with the NEX f3 it's
just slow and not particularly precise
it takes a half second or more to find a
focus point even on still images and
will often go past the point of focus
and then try to come back otherwise the
camera is actually pretty fast it's it's
a bit slower than the nex-5n but it'll
shoot about five-and-a-half photos per
second in burst mode there's very little
shutter lag and it can turn on and start
shooting photos in just over two seconds
in general if you're coming from a
point-and-shoot camera the NEX f3 is a
great option especially at $599 so you
get a big sensor and a fast processor
and a lot of manual controls even though
the interface helps them feel more
accessible and less complicated anyone
looking to upgrade from a
point-and-shoot camera should definitely
consider one of the NEX models but which
one you buy will depend on which
features you really think you need and
how much you're willing to spend
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
