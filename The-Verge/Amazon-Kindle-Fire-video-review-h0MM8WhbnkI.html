Verge and I'm looking at the Kindle Fire
it's Amazon's first full-color tablet
which goes on sale for $200 which is a
pretty low price the hardware itself
should be somewhat familiar if you've
ever seen the BlackBerry PlayBook
apparently had used the playbooks
reference design and the two devices do
look nearly identical they have the same
size display it's a 7-inch 1024 by 600
LCD display the device is equipped with
eight gigs of storage Wi-Fi and 512
megabytes of RAM here you see the home
screen of the device this is pretty much
where you navigate to all of your
content in this scrolling list you see
your most recent content and that goes
backwards in time you can't actually
remove anything from that list so keep
it clean the fire is running a
customized version of Android 2.3 aka
Gingerbread it's actually a forked
version so there's no Google stuff on
this meaning no Gmail no Android Market
Amazon does provide their own app store
called the app store which has about
10,000 titles in it compared to Google's
360 thousand titles it doesn't seem like
that many but there are some fairly good
software selections if you dig deep
enough additionally and I think probably
the biggest feature of this is that it
ties into all of Amazon's music video
and book ecosystem so you get access to
prime videos and Amazon music and of
course the big bookstore and their
newsstand which is a magazine and
newspaper store and that's directly tied
in at the OS level so when you're in
your library you can quickly jump to the
store and start looking around for new
content it's a pretty painless process
to get it onto the device another big
feature that Amazon is touting is the
silk web browser it's a webkit-based
browser that is apparently doing some
server-side offloading to speed up
webpage loading in my testing I didn't
really notice any significant boost in
speed and in fact I think the browser is
kind of clunky in comparison to the iPad
2 or the honeycomb browser in all the
fire is a really great tablet for $200
but it is not an iPad killer it's I'm
not even sure if the honeycomb
killer I mean it's a great little
package it will make an awesome holiday
gift for a lot of people but it doesn't
have the app support right now to
warrant recommending this over something
like an iPad and frankly I'd be hesitant
to recommend it over a honeycomb tablet
given the fact that Amazon is asking
developers to split their loyalties and
work on an app for their ecosystem as
well as the standard Android ecosystem
but the price is great the content that
you have access to is great and I can
definitely recommend it for somebody who
just wants to lean back not mess with
apps too much and just enjoy books and
movies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
