we're looking at the Nokia Lumia 1520
this has been announced it's a six inch
1080p Windows Phone and as you can see
it's a giant windows phone and just for
a quick comparison before you jump into
the specs this is the 1020 beside out so
you can see is huge it literally Dwarfs
it in every way apart from the camera so
let's check out the cameras this is a 20
megapixel shooter it will shoot 5
megapixel images and 16 megapixel images
so it's kind of similar to the 1020 in
terms of the camera there and if we look
at the actual screen you got to 1080p or
Windows Phones pull here you got free
colonies so you can have multiple apps
pinned to the Start here and other sort
of improvements are in the built-in apps
so obviously this looks quite similar
but if we go into the mail application
we will notice is there sort of using
the whole screen rather than so it's
just scaling up up these applications
now it has a micro USB down the bottom
here and ceramic keys on the side it's
the usual sort keys that you'd expect
and then a headphone jack about their
back at the top there other than that
not too many hardware changes to a Lumia
and there's some look at the camera
software on here as well which is now
the nokia camera rather than the nokia
pro camera so you can switch between the
modes here to give a smart or you can
switch back to pro and so overall a sort
of improved camera application there and
that was a real quick look at the nokia
lumia 1520</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
