Paul Miller actually went to the new you
know the new Grand Central Apple so have
you been there no just uh just opened
today right yeah it opened today but
Paul Miller went a couple days ago they
had a press preview and he shot some
video so take a look at this and we'll
be right back thanks again right now
but I'm actually in an Apple Store and
you can see the hearts floating above my
head that's because I'm in love at the
Apple store the world's largest Apple
store here in Grand Central
they have 350 employees they took a
whole wing of Grand Central was pretty
wild they had to work with the city like
this is hallowed ground in New York and
they just
flashbulb so when you visit an apple
store it's always it's always important
to check with the playlist the current
playlist is on the music devices because
then you know what's cool right now
listen to you like I've never heard of
Sam Holley
but his album from night to the edge of
day sounds so it's really incredible
now that oh it's I think it's a girl is
that a girl it could be a man or a woman
but it's it's blowing my mind oh my gosh
this music
just working on a song about how much
you love the love the Apple stores
you're gonna need a little bit of vocals
so this is the accessory room and as
you'll notice there's a lot of non Apple
products which is why it's kind of it's
kind of hidden kind of way back here
there's no windows so nobody can see
what they're selling a lot of non Apple
products here which was left why does it
feel that someday these will all be
Apple accessories because Apple won't
everything a little prettier over here a
little less hidden like the accessories
room
this is Genius Bar land to genius bars
so the highest Genius Bar per store
capita ratio I have a Macintosh se it
has the dual floppy drives not the the
high-density floppy and I'm trying to
run cosmic Osmo which came on CD is
there a way to ask CD drive to the SME
No
so I have another phone okay I'm trying
to get um jetpack joyride on here but I
can't find it on the store I can tell
you I have little familiarity with this
phone itself it's the iPhone 3 I thought
is the iPhone 3G
I thought Samsung made the iPhone you
know I really feel like I'm coming
around to the 4s here if I'm learning
anything from picking your brain as a
genius
a certified genius so I should give the
iPhone 4s I are you are you guys in line
for the for the iPhone are you guys in
line for them for the new iPhone I just
think so I can just start right here so
you can get behind you guys start right
here okay all right thank you
here's some person line
adorable that Paul Miller is just
adorable isn't he you sort of put it in
your lap and hug em and maybe that's
just me I don't know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
