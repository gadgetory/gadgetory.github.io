my matrimony humor well you won't have
to hear it for much longer Oh Eddie how
so we were no we were in Chicago went to
the ice buddy where he wrote a horse
down a city block I wish I was kidding
but not of course there are photos on
the internet you can find them pretty
easily and but we've been partying a lot
but we've also had a crazy month of
events and also parties we went to III
out on the west coast where we had a
party it was a show some of the shots
from this here's me chris grant the
editor of polygons this is a joint party
with polygons are our sister video game
site and by the way we it was an
accident that we coordinated jackets
there no no it was also accidental plaid
from everybody here we are reading
something we did a raffle yeah I go it
went worse than well when as bad as any
raffle we've ever done and we are really
not good at raf wait it's a lot i
understand it anyhow i'm not gonna go
down but here's the outside of the
building where we did it it was very
cool it's very exciting here's some
people posing in front this huge screen
no we called the event polygon on the
verge and the whole point was it was
gonna be POV but we never made mention
of POV anywhere public oh what's a good
name for the party POV that's cool
polygon on the verge and then we just
let it go yeah let's never mention it
but i was great we had um special drinks
we had ice cubes that glow that glow
there really ought i still have like a
few of them do you yeah sure bring them
to the office anyhow but but we are
therefore III which is a big video game
show i don't know if you guys are aware
of III maybe you've heard of it maybe
not really
I really had to all Myers I really had a
Yank I relied to pull on that applause
uh but uh but you know it was a we saw a
bunch of stuff not a crazy year for
video games savia was it was a good year
it just wasn't exciting there wasn't a
lot of new console nails minutes xboxes
and playstations they're kind of like in
the retirement phase or go toward the
end there towards you want a farm and
the xbox our 40 than out to pasture
happen is it gonna be happy it's to be
very happy there be bouncing ring over
there going to a better place ah but but
we did see some cool things ubisoft head
again called watch dogs which is of
course which looks insane you can see
some of it right here and the the
prevailing theory was that what we're
seeing is next-gen graphics like this is
not gonna be on xbox or playstation like
this right cuz that Spock skin dude it's
certainly not for the wii right this
isn't coming out of the week this is a
wii u launch title is it ahhh no not no
chance okay the original weeds
originally yes yes look at that waggle
right there just I mean you can see with
the jacket animations clearly next-gen
stuff I like that people didn't know if
I was being serious or not I was being
serious it's not funny okay but this was
cool we also saw the new Quantic Dream's
game beyond two souls yeah it's just the
guys did heavy rain yeah ellen page
isn't it ellen page is in it okay that
game actually looks really gonna saying
that I like went out and bought heavy
rain it's a great interactive movie
about heavy rain before your wedding
right yeah then I played it throughout
the wedding yeah it's like hang on he
was like I know we're dancing right now
but I just have to finish this chapter
and my personal favor from III was last
the last of us which is a game that is a
post-apocalyptic nightmare world zombies
and it's part of it takes place in
Pittsburgh you wear it sure is where I'm
from you really could just said it's
Pittsburgh it's in Pittsburgh basically
oh so no but it looks really cool I mean
here you can see some killing going on
and actually killing was the theme of e3
yeah it was one of them I think it's
like the most violent III that I can
remember it's very it's mature both
technologically and creatively is the
very nice way of saying is that we think
it's matured it well you know in the
same way Tarantino has matured from
killing killing too I feel like massive
brutal killer kill bit more stylish yeah
it's more solid so we actually we
actually noticed a trend at e3 something
that we saw crop up you know all of the
companies do their keynotes they show a
bunch of game demos and we saw something
that just kept appearing that we thought
was a little weird which was the next
tab that's this has been absent in the
neck and they ship look repeatedly in
games we saw it I you must be like an ex
tab than a fountain of blood it's
impressive the particle effects of
arterial spray they're really really
pushing the grapples to their maximum
with the next step but we put together a
little video of e3 sort of some of you
know a couple just a couple of things we
saw at e3 just kind of illustrate what
was happening at the show so take a look
at this I think you'll I think you'll
enjoy
that's that is really charming we have
come a long way since cetera it's a
little taste of what you missed if you
didn't go to e3 I did it go hi I'm
surprises we are in rehearsal right how
do we come out of that there's no it's
no it's upsetting yeah it turns out when
we had the idea to do the video we're
like that would be hilarious but it
turns out when you watch people getting
stabbed in a creepy I do kind of want to
does actually feel a little upsetting is
more of the couches you know it's very
nice anyway anyhow let's move on folks
do you mind we've got a show to do uh so
there but there were a couple other
things at e3 SmartGlass have you guys
seen this microsoft's version of airplay
essentially yeah I mean it's like it's
the thing that you use to connect the
phone the tablet it's a little bit
beyond airplay lady like you can do
interactive stuff there's internet
explorer which everyone is constantly
dying for I they're gonna say that I was
going to say that internet explorer for
the xbox would you be waiting for
Microsoft's actually had a crazy month I
don't know if you guys are aware of this
they just announced windows phone 8
yesterday uh that's what it looks like
they made smaller tiles yeah get a load
of those tiles some of them longer to I
think longer tiles yeah what you've been
waiting for just waiting and and but but
more importantly their big announcement
this month i think is the surface if you
guys seen the surface it's microsoft's
ipad competitor basically it used to be
a table need used to be a table and now
it's not true the surface was a table
and now they've turned it into a tablet
it's actually kind of cool it's got a
kickstand it has this smart cover that
has a keyboard to it with two different
ones two different ones yeah I'm into it
I'll be the first to say how was the
keyboard you try it um they wouldn't let
us the keyboard they wouldn't let us try
but they we did do some hands-on stuff
but they wouldn't let us take photos
while we were holding it they would only
let us take photos when someone else
like one of their guys was holding it
but luckily this is actually interesting
an estonian newspaper took a picture of
me holding the surface this is uh I mean
thanks Estonia yeah you accomplish what
we could not with us thank you see look
the guy in the background he's like give
that back to me hahaha lucky he's like
okay that's enough please stop holding
that is that a cocktail up yeah there's
a cocktail app I was after the event I
was just trying to figure out where I
was going to go and get wasted wasted
drunk but but what's interesting about
the surface event is that Microsoft
ended it with this commercial for the
surface which had very hard heavy dubbed
dubstep can we have a set few seconds of
this commercial can we show it this is
what they showed when we finish with the
live blog it's really heavy right very
heavy stuff yeah but Microsoft has been
doing this a lot like they had the I
they have an IE at speaking of Internet
Explorer that has dubstep in it and we
actually been seeing dubstep in a lot of
ads and I saw something the other day
and I thought and I feel like it was
done by the same people who do the
microsoft stuff and I thought that's it
like dubstep and advertising has truly
jumped the shark net taiwan i wanted to
share this with you guys check out this
out i seriously couldn't believe it
growth phase everything looking good
hey go ahead planted I just feel
I guess that sperm yeah I mean it was
spur avoid it appear to be sperm
fertilizing today I can't be entirely
sure but Oh wishing big of Ovaltine dude
did you not think of sperm fertilizing
days I've never been thirsty I guess I'm
right I guess what is very different
people so yeah dubstep in advertising
maybe has passed a threshold that we
don't want to pass up okay finally on
the news side WWDC daily dub dub lub lub
dub c ya or what why job c5 that works
too mistress is terrible um Apple had
their big developers event iOS 6 was
announced maps are gone mm-hmm no more
google maps yeah but I built their own
they built their own mountain lion which
we saw yeah and finally a macbook right
the new with Retina display yeah there
it is right there you reviewed it you
liked it it's really nice it's thin it's
got a great screen for the most part for
the most part then what is that well I
mean like if you have a website there's
a lot of pictures it's still your
website like our website oh that's cool
just thanks Ross sorry anyhow uh alright
we've got to get on with the news I'm
sorry not on with the news on with the
show we're done with the news yeah um
but we have one more surprise for you
guys Paul as we said was in Chicago for
Neil eyes wedding and he filed a video
diary from Chicago and I think you can
see you can truly see a man unraveling
from not being on the internet in this
video so take a look at this and we'll
be back with LeVar Burton I'm Paul
Miller i'm in chicago and this is day
days like 30-45 of no internet you know
I stopped counting I could stop counting
everything when i left the internet so i
don't know but it's been a while since
i've used the internet and I've been in
Chicago for about a week I came to
Chicago for Neal eyes wedding and so
I've just been hanging out Chicago for a
few days before the wedding and then the
wedding was like a three-day
extravaganza at first I felt a little
out of place because a lot of cool
things would happen and everybody would
share them on Instagram or Facebook but
I think as the wedding progressed as
some people even like the verge editor
started like slowing down howdy pictures
they were taking how many tweets they
were doing and we all started living and
loving and laughing a lot
throughout the wedding I am I felt no
disadvantage dancing whines well without
the inner and I felt like I could pick
up all the moves here on the spot
nothing you had to look up on the
internet it was it was a good experience
I I didn't really think a lot about the
internet they either way because I was
just enjoy the wedding facebook
so it was blast is also ed yeah you know
everybody's tweeting I actually I forgot
my camera on this trip which is kind of
sucked but I got this yoshika electro 35
so I'm learning how to shoot film so
I've been shooting a little bit film my
big problem with film is that I forget
if I wounded or not I think I either
have a lot of blank frames on here I
have a lot of doubles but it's a pretty
cool camera I haven't developed any
phelps oh I don't know I'm taking
horrible pictures there are definitely a
few people here that uh know me from my
work might have no internet work because
like you know you somebody asks you what
do you do I still want to write about
technology and they like like phones
like yeah as I get phones and laptops
you know and a lot of times it like the
conversation should get in there but
it's fun for me because I get to say
yeah I write about technology right now
I'm living the year without the internet
but oh well you know so I'm like I'm
cool right I'm a pretty hot commodity
when it comes to conversations and
social gathering I don't want to toot my
own horn but I think I'm getting really
good at navigating cigs I just absorbed
them like sponge when I rented my bike
they gave me this map this is this map
is courtesy of Rahm Emanuel and this
thing's epic and so I can get I could
get anywhere in life
I don't even know what you called area
Chicago is a very large place i went to
wicker park i went to a camera store the
best buy my name how about two shirts
you wanna shake oh my gosh my life so
far what's still exciting stranger I
don't miss the Internet I don't dream
about it I don't yearn for it you know
every once a while somebody's like oh
there's this really funny thing a lot
happening on Twitter but I can't tell
you you know but I don't I don't care if
you know my biggest fear though is that
at the end of the year I don't want to
really go back to the internet full-bore
even though it's so awesome it's just a
cool thing I just I like myself a lot
better not on the internet so I feel
like doing a year of this is gonna be
like a piece of cake this is just this
is basically really easy right now
they're like there's tiny minor
inconveniences in exchange for having a
blast a total complete blast
yeah and then we actually we were
actually saying that it was like Eat
Pray Paul he's going on kind of a Vision
Quest dives in Mexico he may never come
back honestly I hope he does though so I
just want to briefly I don't need to
introduce our first guest but I'm going
to I mean you guys know who he is you
know ms Geordi LaForge from Star Trek
Kunta Kinte from roots which is you know
crazy that he's here doing this and
doing stuff like that and of course
reading from Reading Rainbow please
please welcome the amazing levar burton
very careful
thank you so much
these are live human beings yeah we have
real people Wow we've convinced humans
to come in here good job levar thank you
so much for coming mama uh I you've been
now I know you've been on a whirlwind
tour of New York yes Justin sightseeing
indeed no your bid you've been to like
everywhere you're on late night last
night you were at CNN today you get all
over the place and this is your last
stop in here this is my last stop on the
on the Reading Rainbow app launch press
tour and I wanted to spend it here with
y'all that is no sir I appreciate that I
appreciate that and work and we're very
glad that you did not so I mentioned
before you came out yeah you have some
very iconic roles in your history and
talking about the fantasy island i did
and fantasy eyelid I did Love Boat to
you know and of court well of course
loved up I mean no one no one can forget
the love boat I have no one but you but
but I was thinking I feel like you've
got these their roles are so iconic and
they have such a fan base around them
particularly Star Trek uh that you must
walk down the street people like hey
Jordy mm-hmm does that drive you crazy
no really no it really doesn't it
doesn't bother you it's not like my fans
are like Gary Busey fans you know what I
mean he's Gary Busey have fans yeah he
does and they tend to put cigarettes out
in his arm it's really yeah but he's
into that he loves he loves me yeah yeah
wow so so that doesn't bother you at all
so then that's great would you be
annoyed if I conducted the rest of the
interview as if you were Geordi and
beyond and before you answer at who we
get some mood music on for this you are
serious
well is this is the sound from the
bridge I don't know what that sound is
but actually at hold on but you would be
an engineering so it'd be a little
louder could we bring up the sound a
little bit more and uh that sounds about
right to me okay that's fine you cut I'm
not actually gonna do this I'm not gonna
subjection no no I was really getting in
time very you're ready to go in Jordan
right where I was I was almost in
character we were talking backstage the
whole time you were on Star Trek who the
visor you really couldn't see very well
in the month the visor actually took
away about eighty-five percent of my
vision when I put it on and there's a
tremendous irony of hair right because
the visor gave you on the show gave you
all kinds of extra abilities you could
like see what they what the makeup of
the room was and yet in reality you were
to die I was stumbling around that's uh
I didn't know that by the way and it was
brought up backstage and I was I was
shocked too shocked to find this fun
Star Trek facts to know and tell so so
besides being an actor your director you
hosted reading rainbow and obviously
still reading rainbow Watchers in the
house
I don't want to make you feel old but I
grew up on reading rainbow I'm lying I'm
actually I'm quite all of myself and no
but no reading rainbow was yes I mean
that was like a huge deal 26 years on
PBS 26 26 years and you you you want a
bunch of Emmys mm-hmm you won a Peabody
hmm um so 26 seasons yeah do you feel
the story's over no word you know like
there could be a movie in the office Oh
a movie a Reading Rainbow movie not like
a narrative film Wow have you were
considered that we could get some
butterflies go on maybe a sky yeah
that's probably pretty easy to do yeah
they have soundstages where they can
recreate a sky I understand in Hollywood
I would probably want to do it all CG I
though yeah absolutely um so we're gonna
I want to talk because you've an app you
have this happening yes we do it we all
heard about the Reading Rainbow app
that's out in the app store some it out
right now it's out now it's out now how
am i how much is it it's a free app 23
it's free what are you waiting for why
are you downloading the Wi-Fi in here is
pretty bad okay but um but but so so
before we talk about that I want talk
about your life on the internet you
become very active on you I love the
internet you you are you're on reddit
we've one of the cofounders of reddit
here you're not correct me if I'm wrong
your username on reddit is kunta in the
house is that correct it's absolutely
true okay that is true and true and
you're pretty active I mean you're
fairly active on there oh yeah yeah
little uh you're also a mean you're
aware of this that you've been mean I
have been yes well we had neil degrasse
tyson on who's also do you know he's
astrophysicists absolutely and he's been
meme heavily and we asked him about i
just want to kind of show you one of my
favorites here this is if you're having
Hall problems I feel bad for you son
I've got 99 problems but a breach ain't
one apologies to jay-z does this does
this weird you out as a strange for you
i love this stuff you just randomly
appear yes you're into it wouldn't you
ah yes I would yes I wish I wish people
did more creative memes with me I'm
going to put that out into the world
please do more creative memes so so
let's talk about the app okay I actually
have it here we do on an iPad let me see
if I can get this up so it has we get
this on on camera she's still talking
yes so check this out it's got islands
that you can fly through and we were
reading a book you have a backpack right
I thought was great reading pirate boy
one of my favorites and who is the
narrator of pirate boy I don't know no
you tell me i don't i don't know isn't
there one hundred and fifty percent
oxygen mom what if there are sea
monsters it's not you know that is Jim
mess common who is one of our
storytellers i read about twenty percent
of the titles in the app you know you
are reading the titles alone oh yeah
absolutely that's it seems like a lot of
time bigtime sink I work cheap for
myself okay but it's a cool app we were
playing around it it has interactive it
does it's got this you can see dragon
here can you can touch it and it starts
doing that it is like very much like a
pop-up book on an iPad dough I'm
incredibly proud of what we've been able
to do in terms of translating a
television show in to a nap experience
there are a lot of challenges involved
and I think we've we've overcome a lot
of them not the least of which is is the
fear of disappointing those who really
know and are familiar with the brand it
it can be dangerous to you know go to
the well too many times with the same
franchise just just ask paramount yeah
we're star trek is oh oh uh well but I
mean I don't know Star Trek's been
pretty successful has inherited and they
had to give it a long rest before you
know JJ rebooted the franchise do you
feel bummed that there's not gonna be
any more next generation movies I'm
tired Josh first contact was on TV last
night but was it completely random and I
had to watch it obviously and who had to
watch it well I mean it's really good
yeah wouldn't you wouldn't you stop and
watch it I whenever I maybe I start to
like who's that guy he is great uh no
but it's no good i miss the next
generation crew yeah do you keep in
touch with those guys do you think we
all keep in touch and this is the 25th
anniversary of next-gen coming on the
air so we are having sort of a reunion
tour of conventions we started a couple
of months ago
in Calgary and and we have others coming
up there's one in Austin in a couple of
months and so it's great Patrick lives
over in England now michael dorn is
spending his money his wharf money Worf
on next-gen he was Wharf on deep space
right God he had a long run Michael
Dorn's got more money than God really
yeah after the show can I get his
contact information yes I need you do we
did it to you know get some budget in
here oh yes yeah I know right you know
we try we know we're no CNN but we're
doing that we're doing the best we can
so let me ask you about that the the
Reading Rainbow out though it's clearly
for kids it is have you ever thought
about how are young at heart have you
thought about adding more adult titles
like 50 shades of grey or lolita would
be something you might put in there may
be some of the n rice novels people have
asked me for years about doing an adult
version of Reading Rainbow and III think
we should get around to that in in the
fullness of time because I not be a lot
of fun I mean adults need to read I
let's hope I mean what are one of the
goals for you with the app like what do
you want to do with this happen and
obviously you want to encourage people
to read yes but it does read for you
some way you're almost encouraging
people not read does that seem fair to
the kids seems a little
counterproductive it does are we raising
a generation of lazy kids who won't read
I think we're raising a generation of
overindulged kids and with iPad they
like that i don't know i mean you know
this is a generation that you know gets
rewarded for everything you know if
you're on a sports team everybody gets a
trophy you know whether you suck or not
and true
and it's just most people think about
yeah yeah you see professional sports
players they're really good mm-hmm most
people are not that good you should not
be getting an award if you're not really
good at sports I think that my
generation of parents in an effort to
really give our children the sort of of
childhood that we feel we ourselves
never had have really gone way overboard
in in terms of indulging this upcoming
generation and I just think they're
they're a little spoiled yeah yeah I
agree we should be hitting them a lot
more right spare the rod spoil the child
is my uh so so look I know I know your
hips let's regarded with our burn
advocates leading children's you heard
it here first heard it here levar says
hit your kids often more more yeah maybe
they had it coming frankly they had it
coming oh so silly I know you're very
tired I'm not gonna keep you too much
longer but I was thinking so they
rebooted the old Star Trek I'm sorry not
to keep going back to start no no but I
can just tell you I'm a little bit of a
fan I couldn't tell uh and so they
rebooted the original Star Trek they put
a bunch of new young actors in the roles
of that you know the chatter had and
right Leonard Nimoy right if they were
to reboot next generation which by the
way seems weird to reboot the next
generation but if they were to reboot

Ohanian from reddit levar thanks again
so much so on the verge of the show we
do once a month it's kind of a late
night tech talk show it's an incredible
experience we have a huge team that
works on it more than 30 people there
the day of the shoot we've got editors
and shooters working all month long on
segments and different pieces of the
show we get to have incredible guests
with celebrities and people from the
tech world who are fascinating and
brilliant and we do segments we get a
little weird it's actually our chance to
have a little bit of fun you know the
site is very much focused on news and
features and reviews the show is our
opportunity to to kind of loosen up and
it's it's really great and I love doing
it before it's been a great partner for
us calling Paul Miller on sale they
sponsored our CES coverage which is
insane can your command Pandora and it's
great to have them back supporting the
show you can tell they really get what
we're doing
yeah so
so so before we bring Alexis out while
we were shooting that we were shooting
some of the behind-the-scenes stuff in
Brooklyn and something happened it's not
scripted this is not planned I just want
to share this moment with you we happen
to catch it on video just take a look at
this and it's very odd
what the I'm here I mean just you
tell me that happened we were just
standing there it appears to be a
flatbed with a part of a wrecked
airplane on it you know we had Damon
Lindelof on the show last month and I
feel like it was kind of a weird karmic
moment I just wanted to share that with
you guys I thought you would appreciate
it anyhow moving on our next guest you
may not know him as a human being but
you certainly know his website where you
find all of your favourite memes and
animated cat gifts please welcome one of
the founders of reddit Alexis Ohanian
what is that
come on I love you you brought props I
like anybody who brings props hi uh I'll
taught me well use a carrot top taught
you as a prop comic please leave ah the
record for shortest interview ever yeah
now first up can I ask you anything yes
he's a reddit joke come on guys there
were 300 off only three redditors in the
audience yeah seriously very sad so
let's talk a little bit I want to talk
about the creation the ideation the
birth of reddit hmm you co-founded it in
2005 who are you who your partners Steve
Huffman this Steve yeah yeah me and
Steve Young together we got together an
apartment months about a month after we
graduated from UVA and got started
trying to create the front page of the
Internet and you know a lot of fortunate
things came together and here we are
today and here you are good can you
imagine that you could you have ever
thought you'd be sitting talking to me
uh-uh not in the middle is incredible
climb what a success story really my big
concern is I know it's only downhill
from here it really is everything will
seem boring and horrible after this
because I'm going to ruin it for you so
so what was your what was your thought
like when you were building reddit what
did you want to do you know in all
frankness Steve and I were friends since
the first day of college when he thought
i was a girl because of my name on the
door and we do have a lady's name well I
i was i was actually it was i was named
after he Nicaraguan boxer named Alexis
argüello who was a dude but you know at
a very early age realized I needed to
embrace my effeminate name so yes I am
awaiting your femininity uh-oh every day
yeah but so most importantly Stephen I
really just wanted to perpetuate our
college life we really loved being able
to eat pizza drink beer and work on fun
projects and we thought let's try to do
this by starting a company and you know
we didn't set out to do a lot of the
things that read it has done in the way
of philanthropic work or political work
I'd be lying if I said we did we just
wanted to create a place where we could
find what was known interesting online
that's really interesting you just
wanted a place to find hilarious stuff
and collected and informative as well
but
cats cats can be instructional no that's
true they can they can and and why do
you think it's why do you think it's
become you know you call the front page
of the Internet why do you think it has
actually you know really become the
front page within it I mean it has
turned into something that is I mean
based on what you're telling me maybe
you guys didn't even predict but it has
turned into something really big and
special what is that how did that happen
black magic we made we made deals does
it deals with rina farias individuals um
well you know what I you know we when we
started reading 2005 social media wasn't
even a phrase you know Facebook was
still sort of relegated to colleges and
many of the things we can't live without
today didn't exist and I think we just
hit oh goodness don't carry on I said
are you okay now obviously to drink but
it's alcohol so is mine okay it's
alcohol supposed to go into the lung I
it's all right not a duh okay we can
edit this right creek a timeless go
ahead carry on ah I was busy trying to
remember all my Heimlich training yes no
thanks for nothing ah i could have free
he died you just SAT there i was i was
ready to jump a nag ah sorry so I uh I
became well yes what it wasn't it I
think a lot of it was timing and here's
the thing i'm not to take anything of it
Steve did a brilliant job actually
building reading by the way we're open
source so take a look at his work um the
the work that went into it you know
there was a ton of it but the other day
we had a lot of really great timing and
we we came about at a time when people
were still starting they were just now
starting to realize that user-generated
content was a thing of value and it
turned out there are a lot of people
interested in submitting links and
voting on them and having discussions on
the internet far more than we'd ever
experienced then you know we caught
things at the right time and I think the
overarching ethos the spirit of reddit
that Steve and I knew we had to continue
was that the two of us sitting in
apartment we're never going to be able
to find the best stuff on the internet
there we tried for the first couple of
weeks because we were like submitting
things ourselves and there was no way
we'd be able to find it all so we needed
to be good to our users because if our
users weren't excited about submitting
to Reddit and providing good content
they never do it
we wouldn't have a site that was worth
anything so so being good to those users
i think is what helped right it
continued to grow for all these years
and you've had you've had a lot of
competition if a competition out there
at one point digg kind of seemed to
occupy the space that you guys occupied
maybe actually when I think about dig it
didn't seem to go as deep and maybe
that's just the way our culture is
moving but read it seems to go reach
deeper into not both the dark heart of
the internet and to outwardly to things
like policy but but but dig was at one
point very much on top and they made
some pretty substantial changes I feel
like you guys saw kind of a flood of
users who were looking for refuge what
did you learn from that what did you see
there and what were your takeaways from
you know we didn't we saw a significant
bump after dig version for it wasn't
world-changing reddit has always
steadily grown and I think what it did
was it really reinforced this belief we
had that we didn't need to care about
our competition we need to build the
best site we could for our users and
like I said do right by them and and the
real fatal flaw to dig for was taking
away user submission was taking the very
last bit of that democratic platform
away from the people who like I said
added all the value and as we moved
closer towards giving users more power I
feel like they moved further away until
it eventually undid them well part of
their thing was was they felt like some
users had too much power yes and what do
you do to combat I mean how are you
trying to fight super users we well we
work I mean there is a karma system on
reddit and I hope many of you work hard
to get lots of reddit karma but it
really means nothing it doesn't buy us
your votes every redditor all all red
rose are equal no redditors are more
equal than others that was something in
our FAQ from day 0 and we wanted to make
sure that we had a system where if you
wanted to come on for the very first
time and it happens every day on reddit
submit a post say I'm a blank ask me
anything you could be on the front page
that evening and the next morning on The
Today Show and that literally actually
happens now because we can let anyone
who doesn't have any clout on the
internet but who's got a good story or
has found some good content you know get
the fame internet fame that he or she's
idea dessert that's actually this is
actually leads in perfectly to my next
question so you recently banned some
publications and a lot of news stories
you've and the Atlantic some other guys
for abusing reddit
and you know we run a publication the
verge we are occasionally on reddit
which is wonderful and I wanted to get
some tips from you i feel like if
there's going to be a source on how not
to abuse read it as a publication that
you're the guy to ask so let me just a
couple of questions here all right how
many accounts is is normal for one
person to have would you say I'm gonna
give you a few ranging okay had between
20 and 40 between 40 and 60 mm where do
you feel is the comfort zone for one
individual to have accounts this is
gonna sound crazy but one I will say I
will make a loud and a half 100 and at
you then on the head it's it's things
like this we pay have always paid very
close attention to its kind of an arms
race we're always trying to keep one
step ahead of the cheaters but that's a
really obvious way to be bad on reddit
is to create lots of Shilla counts and
upvote your content you know I'll
certainly agree that everyone needs a
fake account so they can say the things
they may not be comfortable saying
racist penetrating stuff ah no no I
don't really nasty stuff I i was i was
thinking more like they ask me any
things where you know candor is sort of
required in being honest but the the the
fascinating thing is we we've always
tried really hard to keep that kind of
cheating down and you know we had
publications that disregarded it and and
i think partly because our predecessors
actually sort of encouraged it we've had
to sort of undo that mess okay when
using multiple accounts IP spoofing yes
or no no no don't don't don't do that oh
and and in general my final question in
this extremely serious line of
questioning how many verge links should
i be submitting on a daily basis again
i'll give you a range okay 20 to 40 40
to 60 or unlimited because it's all
really great stuff I I think in the
verjus case it should be that oh really
oh god no please don't hurt of yours I'm
submissions of verge content yeah in a
nutshell the best secret I tell
publishers is is and I think people
often forget this when they go on the
internet is just act like you would in
real life don't act like a jerk don't
act like yourself promoting your own
content don't do that because that
wouldn't fly in real life and it doesn't
fly on the internet so you know we could
stop we get word I mean honestly like
reddit I mean look we're a new site
right so we're growing and when we see
something on the front page of reddit
like the traffic is crazy and it's not
just that its new traffic i'll just get
a little serious with you for a second
even though i was clearly just as a
really serious center it is very serious
um but but it's not just that it's
traffic it's that it's a lot of new
traffic mmm you know a lot of people
who've never who never heard of the
verge before and so we're actually like
really i don't want to screw it up you
know and there are times when we're like
hey art stuff is you know it's got a
bunch of votes like go check it out like
vote it up if you're on reddit like and
I don't want to be the kind of guy who
abuses what you guys are doing because I
think what you're doing is really
special and really important and and and
I mean yes I'm going to continue to use
multiple accounts on spoof their ip's
but I'm gonna do in a way that is almost
undetectable to bring it and that's the
important thing um so okay so if you
guys are the front page of the Internet
mmm by the way you have a lot in common
with fortune if you're the front page or
they like the back door of the Internet
wow I like I can top that yeah I mean
are they I mean do you how do you
because I feel like there's like all
this like you know there's almost a you
feel like it could go fortune at any
moment not that would necessarily be a
bad thing but it would be a little bit
more character than what you have going
on now I mean the you know what the
moderation system that's in place the
pseudo anonymity so unlike 4chan your
rhetoric entities they're anonymous you
have a username it could be Alexis
Ohanian or it could be fluffy bunny 26
you still have an identity it's me that
was young spoiler and so I think that
has helped preserve it and what's been
really fascinating is you know reddit is
a platform like Twitter Tumblr like all
these others we use and communities form
and use this platform to share links
about everything from I subscribe to
redskins ready because I happen to get
tired skins fan and a masochist and that
community has its own culture it has its
own ethos it Smith certain type of links
has its own inside jokes and that's how
they choose to use the platform
and it's those moderation tools that I
think encourage that great behavior that
we see bubbling up and the great things
like the philanthropy and the political
work I mean are you doing this on
purpose your segwaying perfectly into my
next question I am rather broke so you
are so you are at very active me you
guys were very outspoken on SOPA you are
you were referred to as the mayor of the
internet as a landslide election you I
know but you you guys laugh but he had a
chief of staff here backstage but but
how do you take the kind of rage and
anger and disillusionment that you see
on reddit you know which I feel and I
think a lot of us do when you're like
watching these stupid pieces of
legislation getting pushed and people
kind of who don't get the internet
trying to legislate the internet how do
you take that rage and the stuff that
bubbles up the front page and turn it
into something that's that creates real
action how do you go from from reddit to
activism you know I am not entirely sure
we have your the mosari uh I and it took
a lot of chickens a ton of check-ins to
get that mayorship I get all over the
place on the internet i read i don't
know i think i think if you see if you
see any any of the stuff that starts out
as a reddit post and ends it with
real-world action again whether it's
activism or philanthropy um there's just
stuff that happens it's some person who
starts with a random idea and it starts
snowballing and what the internet does
such a great job of is sort of giving us
all ways to help i use the metaphor to
talk a little while back about everyone
getting the chance to be their own
Batman or Batwoman we know there are
lots of things screwed up that we want
to try and fix my create vigilantes take
to the streets at night I only deal
violently with criminal only if they're
wearing this mask what is this you
brought this one piece I because I want
to carry this metaphor in the real world
because we all have we all have our
little figurative Gotham's can we get it
right yet oh yes and this is not
promotion for the film although I highly
recommend you all see it have you seen
it no I really does get access oh no we
don't get accident i think the
entertainment industry does not do me
any favors
there goes my hair yes this is really
uncomfortable by the way i will seed in
my eyes is supposed to be in batman
batman have bad sight is that what sure
he's like I think you're the Joker stop
coming with the hyssop committee crimes
yeah here we go that's that's lovely but
that's is nice that is that i'll be
using the bedroom later to note uh is
law protecting the people the bedroom
obviously from josh Topolsky but that's
there is we talk there is this really
empowering thing it just suddenly became
a role play it really is going after
their it that that's the really
empowering thing is that you can be
sitting there you know just yesterday we
saw this video of this woman on a bus up
in queens new york being harassed by a
bunch of students and 24 hours later
after that story that video front pages
on reddit she has literally two hundred
thousand dollars donated to her from
people all over the world who simply
said this is wrong I want to do
something about I gotta get harassed by
it's a lucrative make sure it's
videotape yeah a long video obviously uh
Alexis I wish we had more time oh so
much more to talk about well you know
what I'm I was a little bummed I didn't
get to sit down with Lavar but you know
it I you can't disappoint a picture and
maybe it's better that is true to meet
them that's very mean you you say Alexis
thank you so much wrong thank you come
back thank you gotta come back um is
awesome this is awesome what is this
these are I'm sorry we need to get to
this this is a book publisher this
comeback started it's like a Newman's
Own for nerds called bread pig we are
goal or specified aims to make the world
suck less we could we get this on camera
on camera not and take a look and I'll
show this this is this area Saturn moni
breakfast cereal so zach weiner wrote
this it's a webcomic one of those
popular on the internet we published the
book for him he gets a majority of the
profits it's published under a Creative
Commons license and our profits all get
donated to donorschoose.org specifically
to classroom projects in math and
science now that's not totally
benevolent you know why because little
kids who don't learn about math and
science don't grow up into being the
geeks who will read this book so if we
can make more geeks will sell more books
it's just a long term I Foley's
or that go by this about you go by right
now thank you again on the on the we
have Tim Wu coming up to talk more about
activism and the internet and but but
Neil I went out on the street doesn't we
just scream uh very excited it was Tim
actually o Neill I went out on the
street and ask people if they knew what
net neutrality was and I'm sure you can
imagine the results were highly
entertaining to take a look at this we
write back with Tim will I think about
net neutrality every day because i'm a
huge nerd and tim was my hero but i'm
here in the flatiron district in New
York to ask these people would they
think about it if they even know what it
is and most importantly if they think
anything should be done about it what is
that neutrality what net neutrality I
have no idea I have no idea I have no
idea um I don't know so I've seen
various YouTube tutorials or you know
explanations of net neutrality and all
of them make sense once I finished
watching them but when you asked me what
it is it's fairly complicated to explain
so I asked you question who owns the
internet I won't say people on the
internet the people the data is owned by
the people that have the data on their
servers and the connections to the data
is owned by the ISPs the providers no
problem really is once is basically
impossible to explain I mean what can
you say do you want to pay more for you
too so do you think like Verizon could
sail you can go to every set in the air
at except for youtube if you know I
don't think that
things you want you see that splashed by
dollars no absolutely not students I
think that's the point of YouTube it
wouldn't be cool but it's business this
is awful nobody knows what net
neutrality is when they do find out they
didn't want to talk about it because
it's really political but in a spirit of
this election year I'm gonna get
desperate I'm calling Barack Obama and
I'm calling Mitt Romney let's see what
they have to say I'm gonna help you hi
um where does the president stand on net
neutrality on net neutrality yeah as you
know net neutrality is no i don't why
didn't you tell me a little bit about it
so who should have more regulatory power
over the internet the government or
verizon Brendan even a verizon sells
your product they should be the ones who
determine how that product was that
makes sense because if anything ever
goes wrong you know who to go to
captivating hi there I'm really
interested in voting for Mitt Romney um
but I have a policy question i'm just
wondering what his position on net
neutrality is I'm am a neutrality ah
let's see here
don't recall if it's come up as a major
issue on the campaign that I can recall
but I've got a source for you that you
can tell you all right all the policy
online on the lobbies of Lebanon County
headquarters you're calling the court
that if you'd like to leave a message
please be don't you send me back to a
 phone I gotta say man you can't
just keep on putting me into robot town
like this even happens you press the 0
when you call Romney headquarters it
tells you to wait for your call and then
it takes you to the top of the phone
finder robbing the president
headquartered so this has been the worst
day of my life nobody knows what net
neutrality is nobody cares about it
nobody even really wants to talk about
it with me not even the president permit
I thought it would be on my side so i'm
gonna go i'm gonna take a break here we
have a drink maybe throw myself in front
of a bus good night internet it was nice
knowing you
you
a an upsetting story one we hope will
find an end someday but you're in luck
we have the man who coined the term net
neutrality here please welcome Tim Wu
hike up I I have to say I realized now
after having three guests the most
guests we've ever had on the show up by
the way right that we have a lot of
obstacles to getting onto the couch well
that's what it means to be fancy yeah
just you got to put up you got to make
the barrier to entry very high Tim thank
you for coming tim is the author of a
book called the master switch it looks
like this it's available in stores
around the world and was it by the way
apparently very hard to find we went we
had some of our people go looking for
copies of this and even want to call
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble yeah it's almost like
it's almost like they don't want it to
be sold they don't want to hear the
truth of this book but um you coined the
term net neutrality what does it mean I
mean these people people on the street
don't know what it is what yeah you know
it was watching that video and I was
thinking you got a lot of taxis in this
video and it's exactly the principle
that applies when when you get into a
taxicab the taxicab has to take you
where you want to go you know imagine
get on you in the taxicab this actually
happens you know in some countries and
you say i want to go to little Brooklyn
and you end up in the gift store yeah
yeah that you know this country when I
want to go home from Manhattan you know
like I want to go to Brooklyn they're
like no I don't go too well there's that
problem too but essentially is the idea
that the taxi is supposed to take you
where you want to go and the basic
principle is the internet was built on
the principle that the carriers take
your data where you want it to go and
that people are allowed to communicate
over the internet without interference
by the people in the middle it's a
pretty profound principle and the fact
that people don't know about it is is
you know on the street doesn't mean it's
not important because I think some of
the you know most important principles
are just sometimes very subtle you know
they operate at the scent of
subterranean level like equals MC square
that's AG industry don't need it no no I
think it's a I need to know I'd sound
think it's that important well we can
debate about that but it a lot of these
things you know freedom is a kind of a
thing that you can't really you know
experience you just experienced its
absence right you know when you're not
free but you you don't notice when
you're able to go to internet sites when
you want to or say what you
12 because you just live in life can you
just live in and you're just doing what
you want it's when you aren't able to do
that suddenly you notice it and i think
that's that's that's why this is a
profound principle it was baked into the
original design of the internet it's
what made the internet so revolutionary
in so many ways I mean what made all
these companies able to grow without
asking somebody for permission the
companies like Google ebay amazon
whatever they just started their
businesses they didn't sort of have to
say you know AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon I got a
good idea you want to you know run my
service to you shot it felt like well
you know well you know check it out wait
for five years ten years see what
happens I mean it's a very profound
thing that as I said before you don't
notice freedom you notice its absence
and and and whose job is it to ensure
net neutrality is it is it the
government's job is it Verizon's job is
it the citizens job I think it's kind of
everybody's dammit i knew i knew i was
gonna say that but i'll tell you that in
a functioning system it's never
completely possible to allocate a
responsibility to you know one entity
when you talk about something like how
do you guarantee freedom of speech well
you could say well you just have to have
the government do that but you know the
government did I work for the government
sometimes they're they're lazy not
everything gets to them they're not
all-powerful but the government does but
the government did do a lot of stuff to
guarantee free speech but they knew
they'd mess with it so it you know
they're not completely reliable no one's
totally reliable it sound a little
paranoid although but the germs of free
speech but you have to admit like the US
government has done a relatively good
job of saying like we've got we need a
free speech and we're going to push that
on our citizens we're gonna say like you
can't just limit with somebody has so
the courts have said that right the
executive branch now and then is like
maybe we don't want so much free speech
maybe we'd like the New York Times to to
say that there's weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq or something I mean
like there's a for dance on freedom of
speech that's manipulation of the press
well that's true I'll just say that the
federal the executive branch hasn't been
exactly reliable the hell was the
executive you know they have their
moments but laws exist sorry I me not to
get off track but but they are but we
have let we have said nothing
legislation but we've said
we've got some basic rules here that we
believe in right one of those roses free
speech and we and people fought on both
sides of it but we have kind of pushed
this agenda of free speech is valuable
we need to protect it there has not been
a similar there's not been a similar
fight for the internet that's right
nobody has said the free internet the
open Internet is important and we need
to protect it what they have said is
with like things like SOPA right
the free internet we want to protect we
want to make sure we have money right
and there you've got people who are
backed by lobbyists right pushing laws
that will ultimately diminish the
openness of the Internet right you
notice elf a fan are you how would that
be possible I don't know you tell them I
like soap i don't like a fire so fat
that's great but but i mean so so so
what do we do I mean what's the obstacle
here how do we how do we combat I mean
it feels like we've got verizon and AT&amp;amp;T
mm-hmm largely controlling the pipes was
a few other players in there but not
that many right and they are dictating
in many ways what happens on the
internet or what happens with the
internet right you obviously have forces
you've got forces from places like
Hollywood which you talk about in your
book and you've talked about elsewhere I
ran into some Hollywood forces recently
that there were very psyched on on the
idea that you know that it's it's like
Verizon 1880s responsibility to block
things so that's a fairly scary concept
what are we supposed to do how do we how
do we how do we fix this you need two
things you need a norm and you know and
you need a law so first of all it has to
be a principle that Internet freedom is
sacred and fundamentally important to to
a civilized nation it has to be
understand stood at the level of free
speech just like we've you acquaintance
see you quit net neutrality with free
speech yeah I think it's the sort of the
flip side of it I mean free speech is I
can say whatever I want net neutrality
is I get to connect with whoever I want
you know unless was a really strong
reason not to free speech is an absolute
net neutrality is an absolute but as a
general rule i get to connect with you
and what are those reasons how do we
pick them how do we decide well that's
another story and and
you know there's obvious examples in
free speech you have principles like it
might send a very serious message to
assassinate the president but that
doesn't mean it should be legal right it
obviously needs to be prevented so
similarly with net neutrality you can
think of I think very narrow categories
but certain reasons that it might be
reasonable to influence with people can
connect to but they're rare they're sort
of like interfering with terrorists
efforts to sort of attack the United
States for the country's things like
this are a real pornography said child
pornography is probably another except
what about pirated movies no i mean
because what one man's pirated movie you
know one man's pirated movie is another
man's innovation what is exactly a
pirated movie is often not exactly clear
and I you know you say it as if we know
what a pirated movie is and sometimes
you do but so the copyright law is so
unclear that sometimes it's not legal
it's sometimes legal and the other issue
I have with with pirated movies is that
fundamentally I don't think it's
important to pass laws protect an
industry that is in decline and that you
know I think we go in a dangerous
direction when we have an industry which
is essentially in in decline and you
know it is has been in decline from some
time to try to use all the powers of
government to try to save them right
this has been an issue since the 16th
century is every time an industry is
dying it says I'm threatened by piracy
can you give us some examples the
booksellers in the 16th I can give you a
million examples my book is full of them
again the master switch by Tim Wu
available available in paperback 1595
very affordable available in ebook form
i would imagine yeah it's 10 it's I
think it's about nine dollars on nine
dollars on Amazon you were there taking
a cut of the profits but not hopefully
not too big no I let's go up but good
but so no so you have examples so you've
yet I have tons of examples you know if
you look as early as in 1920s for
example at that point sheep music
was the dominant industry for
distributing music and they said sheet
music she oh sheet she amazed I face it
did anybody else think he said sheet
music yeah I felt like the animal
thought I don't really know neither
heard of that sorry go on no but I got
way you made music in the 19th century
it was actually nice as you bought music
and then you took it home and played it
you know that was like that was the
recording industry and the day they were
the dominant way of distributing music
along came the record player and the
sheet music was suffering because people
listening to records easily and playing
yourself yes so what they say they said
the recording industry are a bunch of
pirates who are destroying American
culture they're just taking the sheet
music recording what's on it and then
selling is exactly like these guys are
destroying America because you know
America used to be placed where people
sing and dance and and now you know
people are listening these crazy
photographs and and player pianos and
we've lost our culture and its disaster
out of work everyone's out of work out
you see the hair the same thing every 20
years I mean it is what that is what the
entertainment industry is saying I mean
I mean Ari Emanuel said you can't make
curb your enthusiasm in any other way
than to have this big industry behind it
and if you don't if you don't have the 3
million dollars per episode there's a
hundred maybe 500 year old tradition of
making starving artists the the kind of
symbol of what is really an industry
that's dying that's being replaced by
different technology same thing Atma and
cable came out people are like cable and
I don't love cable but when it came out
as a new industry and they said these
cable guys are a bunch of pirates all
they want to do is loot Hollywood loot
TV I the same thing is said every single
time is this a bit you become what you
despise because I feel like you've got
the Cable guy's really hey we're
innovators and now they're the old guard
and you've got internet a television
sort of this whole IP you know
revolution right and the cable guys are
going like we got to do something about
this everyone becomes what they despise
you know that oh really but I don't know
I'm good to go something terrible in
that case just absolutely terrible so so
so obviously very complex lot to talk
about here we're not going to get to all
of it tonight but but but what I mean
how are we doing I mean
we've got verizon as i was saying
earlier they've got this monopoly how do
we regulate these guys I mean they own
the pipes they build the pipes there
doesn't seem to be a ton of regulation
there's a fear with government
regulation that you're going to end up
in this kind of down this rabbit hole of
right you know it can be like Brazil
nothing will ever get innovated on I
mean what how do you strike a balance
how do you do this I think you have to
have just very simple rules net
neutrality rules that say you must allow
people to connect with who they want to
connect with exactly what I said before
they have to be regulated basically like
New York taxi cabs and I know New York
taxi cabs don't always obey the rules
right but the basic rule when you get in
a taxi cab as it goes where you want to
go not where they want to go right and
as long as I understand that position I
think it's relatively straightforward
but that is it difficult because as you
pointed out there is a growth a return
of the power of the telephone and cable
monopoly you know for most of the
history the United States we had one
company AT&amp;amp;T running the show and things
have a way you know like the Terminator
robot if kind of going back to the way
they were and we have to be very careful
to see that our phone companies rise an
AT&amp;amp;T comcast I guess their cable company
don't end up HAP being essentially the
gatekeepers of the internet that's
extremely important so what do you what
do you say it like people here what's
the best thing you can do what is the
best thing you can do didn't know best
you can do is complain or get angry yes
when no problem yeah we got ready for
that but it read it helps you just need
to be not willing to accept it when your
cable company or your phone company says
we're going to decide what the internet
is you have to take possession of this
thing and say it is our network I mean
some of the people on there were like
who owns the internet people on the
internet and that's actually true right
it was not designed to be owned by
anyone but I've owned companies all
intents and purposes verizon on the
internet on you but UK I can't just go
get on the internet I have to go through
something so video I have to go through
something that somebody else home look
you have to take a taxi to go to
Brooklyn doesn't mean the taxi owns
broad but I can also buy it but I could
buy a car you got to go through the
Brooklyn Bridge and I can't drive and I
could drive that road is anybody can
drive on by the way this is a metaphor
more than apparently people who like
soap i hate but i mean you can but i can
go buy a car and drive myself to
brooklyn you can't drive yourself to the
internet to get to brooklyn you got a
cast pass I the brooklyn bridge or
manhattanville bridgeberg yeah those
guys earlier they don't own Brooklyn
right you know you got to go through
them if they had a policy like oh we're
only going to let so-and-so through that
would change you could get there but
doesn't mean they own Brooklyn and it's
very important not to convince to get
confused a gatekeeper with an owner
right they're completely different
people someone has a tollbooth does not
mean they own the thing but the
gatekeeper has a lot of hazards I
thought about our is the owner they have
a lot of power and that's why since
basically medieval times there's been a
series of laws designed to guard the
gate keepers so you think violent
revolution is the only way to solve this
maybe I'm paraphrasing all right we just
arrived but you're working on a new book
II just how many questions right you
know I'm interested basically what
technology should do next I think we're
starting to solve some the problems of
scarcity that have obsessed humanity for
500 years or so and I think we're
starting doing at this question of what
do we do now now that we have a lot of
things enough food enough information
what's next that's my next book I think
huge party it'll be the answer Tim thank
