here with a live home system and this
device is solely dedicated to storing
your photos and video on it's this
little white box and that's only
hardware it also has this mobile app as
well what you do is you swipe through on
the screen and you can see how many
photos you have where they're being kept
and the cool thing about it is that
seems all across all your devices that
you have connected to it so if you have
an iPad if you have another tablet if
you have a smartphone or computer all of
your photos in all of your video will be
synced across all of those devices
automatically as you take them this can
store several million photos and you
also don't ever have to worry about
moving photos to add more space to this
because it already comes with a lot of
space about two terabytes it constantly
shuffles your data so you can take a
million photos you know on your on your
smartphone or with your tablet and
depending on how much swords you have on
those devices it will switch all that
data around and make sure that you're
never without space on any of those
devices so it kind of keeps track of
where you take photos how many photos
you take and a lots enough space for
on-demand whichever advice that you have
once again this is the live home device
