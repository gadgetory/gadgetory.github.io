verge and this is the history of Nexus
five years ago Google tried a daring
experiment it was going to sell
smartphones direct to consumers
bypassing the carriers altogether that
experiment largely failed but it did
birds the line of Google designed Nexus
smartphones and tablets we know today if
you want Android the way Google designed
it you're going to want a Nexus
smartphone the first Nexus device is the
Nexus One designed by Google built by
HTC and running Android 2.1 Eclair it
was a watershed moment for Android
hardware finally giving Android fans
something that could compete with
Apple's iPhone at the time less than a
year later Google followed up with the
Nexus S switching hardware partners from
HTC to Samsung it launched with Android
2.3 Gingerbread and featured a curved
design then in late 2011 the Galaxy
Nexus came along with an even more
dramatically curved design and Android
4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich and tongue the
Galaxy Nexus was the first Nexus phone
with LTE now you had to buy the poorly
supported Verizon version to get that
Google's next big attempt at changing
the smartphone industry came with 2012's
Nexus 4 which featured high-end specs
and a remarkably low price tag the LG
Bilt Nexus 4 didn't have LTE like so
many other phones at the time did but
it's three hundred dollar price tag
meant many people were willing to forget
that perhaps the most loved Nexus phones
2013's Nexus 5 which blends the Nexus
4's low price with even better specs and
performance and through an LTE two years
later the Nexus 5 still holds his own
against many smartphones and is often
referred to as the pinnacle of Google's
Nexus program then in 2014 Google took a
different approach
it went big big in size big in specs and
big in price the six-inch Nexus 6 was
made by Motorola and still Dwarfs many
other smart phones it also heralded
Android 5.0 lollipop the first major
design update to the system since 2011
the Nexus 6 and $650 price put off many
longtime Nexus fans however which we're
hoping the company would return to its
low price high performance strategy that
brings us to today where Google has
launched not one but two Nexus
smartphones at the same time the Nexus
5x is a spiritual successor to the Nexus
5 built by LG has a smaller display and
is priced under $400 the Huawei made
Nexus 6p is like the Nexus 6 big brawny
powerful and priced higher both run
Android 6.0 marshmallow and will beacon
the flagships of the android world for
the foreseeable future Google didn't
kill the carriers in the Nexus program
they're still alive and well but it did
create something for the fans the
diehards the Android nerds that want the
best with no compromises if you want to
live fully in Google's world there's no
better way to start than with a Nexus
phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
