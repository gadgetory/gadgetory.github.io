here at the PlayStation VR announcement
we got the price $399 in a general
release date of October 2016 there are
some caveats the actual PlayStation VR
headset will not come with the
PlayStation Move and you will need a
PlayStation Move camera to make the
entire thing work
but overall we gotta take a nice look at
the finished product how is it
well overall it feels pretty nice it's a
Weiser headset which means that it kind
of clamps onto the top of your head
dangling the screen in front of you
which is a little bit more comfortable
so far than having it clamped around the
circumference of your head to align the
actual headset with your face there is a
flimsy almost cheap of plastic that laps
right here and sits on the bridge here
knows and feels a bit like when you're
in school and you had glasses and you
always push them up when it was sweaty
it's not especially the best feeling
it's also connected to moving the
headset forward and backward that's how
you're finding their focus it's not
ideal but it definitely works the screen
itself is overall pretty good I enjoy it
more than the gear VR and definitely
more than the older models of the oculus
rift but some of these games are quite
beautiful and I do wish they were in
slightly higher resolution especially
when I was looking out into the distance
I noticed that looked a little bit fuzzy
when I was expecting something a little
bit more crisp especially when you're
used to playing a PlayStation 4 on
high-definition television paired with
the controller and headset though it's a
pretty good VR option especially if
you're not planning on buying an
expensive computer any time soon
being actually in the virtual reality
experience it feels very
all-encompassing some early VR headsets
and kind of a windowed effect but you
definitely feel surrounded while you're
wearing the PlayStation VR and there are
the games of which there are many and
they are good sony has Reds infinite
coming which is a return of somewhat
nice game that a lot of hardcore people
really love in the
was good in VR but what I am
legitimately enthusiastic about is a
game called dumper which is also a
rhythm game set any black void in space
it's kind of like going into the devil's
tummy by way of a bass drop and I think
that people are going to really really
like it or be absolutely horrified by it
which is nice right overall that's it
we're still gonna go and check out a lot
more games we'll have all that and more
on the verge comm or if you want more
