at Google i/o taking a look at the new
maps it's completely redone it goes full
screen and it's all written in this
WebGL technology which means that it's a
super fast and can feel like a native
app and they're using vectors instead of
tiles but all that nerdery aside what's
really amazing here is they've done a
really good job with just making the map
look cleaner they switch to a Roboto
font and they've added you know all
these little icons and interesting
things happen when you tap on them so I
tapped on this one the roads I might
actually want to use stay highlighted
and everything else kind of gets dimmed
out because I'm probably not going to
want to go on those routes you can see
also when I tapped on it there's an
information card here that lets us to
jump right into Street View there's a
cool little zoom in animation there and
we can look around in Street View we can
hop back out a street view look at
photos you can you got photos inside the
thing and of course you can get
directions so if we tend tap on get
directions we can say we want to get
there from say San Jose just like that
and it not only gives us our driving
directions but it also shows right next
to it transit directions so you can
choose which way you want to do it and
if you do something crazy like if we go
from San Jose to say Los Angeles it will
also give you driving directions but
it'll also show you that flying is
faster than driving maybe you want to do
that which is pretty slick and there's
also some actually super cool transit
directions here so say we want to get to
the Randall Museum and say we want to
get there from this fake home that we've
got here which is Mountain View and say
we select the transit information you
can see that they've simplified how it
displays the transit information so you
can see it leaves every 60 minutes
instead of having only getting what the
next trains going to be and then you can
click on the departure to open up this
really detailed view that shows you all
the different routes how often you have
to walk when you have to change trains
and you can just you know scroll through
to see a bunch of them and then they've
give you the full excellent
of how the transit stuff works at the
bottom the other thing that's incredibly
cool with this is they have integrated
Google Earth completely so in addition
to your more traditional satellite view
or you can go in once you zoom in close
enough you kind of switch over to a
classic Google Earth move so it's very
fast it feels very fluid and they've out
they've just added a whole lot of nice
features to make the map more usable but
also some whiz-bang features we're now
looking at the planet these clouds that
are on the planet are rendered in real
time this is what the clouds actually
look like on the earth right now and if
we zoom out a little bit further we can
see the stars in the background those
stars are in their accurate position as
is the Sun which is pretty cool all this
is done directly in the web browser no
third-party apps to add on it's going to
be compatible with Chrome Safari with I
think you need to get WebGL support and
it should be available in Firefox as
well with IE 11 coming soon so if you
want to try the new maps on desktop you
just need to go to maps.google.com slash
preview and punch in your email address
to sign up it's still a preview it's not
even really a beta product yet so
there's gonna be bugs and Google is
looking for your feedback but it's
definitely worth checking out because
it's pretty cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
