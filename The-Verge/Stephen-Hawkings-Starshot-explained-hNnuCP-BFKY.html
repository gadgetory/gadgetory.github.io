scientists including Stephen Hawking
want to send a tiny spacecraft to the
next closest star using a giant laser
Russian billionaire Yuri Milner has
already invested a hundred million
dollars into the project called star
shot to see if this type of technology
can actually work so let's break this
idea down a bit it's known as laser
propulsion and works exactly how it
sounds a laser beam is used to propel a
vehicle very rapidly through space it's
kind of like using a hose to push a ball
forward the lasers light carries
momentum just like the water from the
hose though it's nowhere near as
powerful but if you have a big enough
laser and a small enough space craft you
can potentially transmit enough force to
the probe so that it moves very very
fast
that's what Hawking and Milner want to
do the idea is to create a tiny wafer
size spacecraft connected to a
reflective sail that stretches a few
metres wide but is only a few atoms
thick it's kind of like the Planetary
Society solar sail concept which uses
the sun's light to move through space
the wafer is also meant to hold a number
of miniaturized instruments including a
power supply cameras and a communication
system once the spacecraft is positioned
in orbit then it's time to turn on the
laser or actually lasers first that
involves building an array of laser
amplifiers on earth that take up about
one square kilometre one laser is fed
into these amplifiers which break the
light apart into thousands of beams the
directions of those beams can be
adjusted to form one giant beam of light
that travels up out of Earth's
atmosphere and hits the spacecraft sail
the lasers will be turned on for about
three to five minutes sending the probe
through space at one-fifth the speed of
light at that pace the spacecraft should
get to Alpha Centauri in a mere 20 years
that may seem like a long time but you
have to remember that Alpha Centauri is
four light years away that's 25 trillion
miles for comparison NASA's Voyager 1
spacecraft has been traveling to Alpha
Centauri at 40,000 miles per hour since
1977 and it's only point zero zero five
percent of the way their star shot
sounds really cool but there's still a
lot of work to be done before this idea
can become a reality the array of lasers
needed for propulsion has
ever been built before and scientists
still need to figure out how to
miniaturize all the instruments onboard
the spacecraft that includes
miniaturizing a communication system
that can span four light-years of space
the sail also poses an engineering
challenge it needs to be made extra
robust so that it can withstand the
intense accelerations through space and
it must be as reflective as possible if
it absorbs too much laser light the sail
can melt
additionally the path between Earth and
Alpha Centauri isn't exactly empty the
chances of hitting something big like an
asteroid are small but lots of
interstellar dust still stands in the
way and with a spacecraft moving at 1/5
the speed of light hitting just a tiny
speck of dust will pack a big punch
engineers will have to build a
redundancy system for the sail so that
it can withstand a few high speed dust
collisions along the way and of course
there's always money to consider the
hundred million dollars from yuri milner
will help jump-start some of the
research and development needed to prove
this technology actually works but a
project like this is comparable to cern
or the apollo program it's going to need
billions of dollars to succeed that
means it could be many years before we
see the spacecraft even start its
journey to Alpha Centauri interested in
a much slower form of space
transportation check out our video on
the ExoMars mission or if planets are
more your jam we break down if there is
a mysterious planet 9 at the edge of our
solar system</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
