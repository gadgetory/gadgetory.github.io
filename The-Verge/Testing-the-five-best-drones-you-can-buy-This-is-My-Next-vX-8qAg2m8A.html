nobody needs a drum but you shouldn't
let that stop you
drones are the coolest toy modern-day
gadget lover canal and if you're
interested in photography or filmmaking
drones are going to let you get shots
that just wouldn't be possible otherwise
if you're just getting started out the
most important thing is to get one that
can take a licking and keep on ticking
because getting good enough to have fun
and shoot great footage requires
patience and a budget for repairs for
the first time drone owner the best
overall combination of simplicity
performance and video is the DJI phantom
2 it's beautifully designed very well
built and offers an advanced autopilot
that will let it fly and film in
conditions other drones simply can't
handle for most people the phantom 2
vision which clocks in at $999 will be
more than up to the task if you've
already got a GoPro handy you can stick
with the Phantom 2 and save yourself
around 230 bucks
the Phantom's battery is neatly packaged
and locks into place easily without
loose wires you need to fiddle around
with the rotors attached in under ten
minutes without any extra nuts bolts or
tools and the flight controller has just
four switches which means it isn't
overwhelming to new pilots the best
feature of the DJI phantom is the
powerful GPS software this allows it to
hover in one place and it will even
compensate for strong wind you can set a
home position and the Phantom will
return to you if it wanders out of range
the phantom vision - also comes with a
gimbal which means that the camera will
adjust as you move helping to center the
picture and produce better footage the
iris a quadcopter from 3d robotics is
the most clear-cut competitor to the
Phantom in terms of its flight
capabilities and GPS software it doesn't
come with a camera but does have a GoPro
mount built in at $750 it's roughly the
same price if you add in your own video
equipment like the Phantom it's meant to
be flown right out of the box with
minimal assembly and setup but the
experience is far more frustrating the
build quality is poor beginning with the
plastic rings you need to attach the
rotors they're not well molded and it
took three of us nearly 20 minutes
before we figured out how to jam
place the batteries come with the
warning that they might explode and a
special bag to contain the acid spread
and fire that might result they also
leave the wires exposed and a ton of
wrangling is required to get it inside
the battery tray the learning curve on
the iris is much steeper than the
Phantom I couldn't get it to calibrate
properly nor could the experienced drone
pilot I brought along it back up to give
you a simple comparison the DJI phantom
controller has four switches on the iris
has 13 and an LCD screen with additional
info I spent a few days playing with the
iris and I never managed to get it off
the ground for more than a few seconds
even when I did it crashed right away
for something simpler there's the parrot
AR 2 it comes fully assembled has a
stylish camo exterior and only needs a
charged battery to be flight ready you
pilot it with an iPhone app which makes
takeoff and landing a simple tap of the
screen it's GPS allows it to auto
stabilize a bit
although it's much more affected by wind
than the Phantom the big plus of the
parrot is durability I crashed it a
dozen times and it never lost a rotor
the downside was the iPhone app as
controller which made piloting it feel
really mushy and haphazard and the
built-in camera shot decent but not
great video on the cheaper end of the
spectrum are the hubsan x4 mini drone
and the proto X Micro drone which clock
in at under 60 bucks both are pretty
much ready to fly right out of the box
neither one can handle serious wind and
are best used indoors but despite a lack
of GPS both handled really well in calm
conditions the hubsan also packs a
built-in camera which can record videos
stored on a microSD card
these are great drones for learning the
basics of piloting and for horsing
around inside without causing too much
damage overall there is a really
exciting range of drones available on
the market right now and if you can
afford it the DJI phantom is the one to
go with right now oh and one more thing
the four thousand dollar DJI S 1000 is a
high-end octocopter that is far too
dangerous for the average civilian to
control that's why we called in a little
professional help from the folks at
intelligent UAS to fly these things for
a living it's aimed at serious hobbyists
and cinematographers looking to use
heavy equipment this is not your next
maybe your next next next but we
couldn't resist showing you a little of
what it can do</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
