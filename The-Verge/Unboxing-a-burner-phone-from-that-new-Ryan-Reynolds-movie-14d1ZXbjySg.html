name is Emily Ishida I'm the
entertainment editor for The Verge here
at The Verge we get a lot of phones
every day for review and it's not too
often that one arrives that lands in my
area of expertise which is entertainment
and the magic of movies if my
calculations are correct it appears to
be a marketing scheme for the film
selfless starring Ryan Reynolds use this
time to get your affairs in order and
they sent me a phone I have been told by
those who are in a position to know is
an LG tribute and as you can see we've
got a beautiful graphic here of a man's
face wrapped in some kind of plastic it
does this cool stretching effect it did
not come charge hey so there's an update
available
apparently I'm using an old version of a
toolbar all right we're ready
welcome to the lumen toolbar right away
immediately stands out to me is as
slotto mania this phone helpfully start
has a home screen at at WAP vision dot
Sprint PCS com one of my favorite sites
my contacts list also came populated
well that's probably because it's a six
digit phone number they sent us this
which is not a link they didn't send us
a link so I'm gonna copy this text and
make sure I take out the part that isn't
the URL all right so we've got the
selfless official tumbler of selfless
the movie this picture of Ben Kingsley
with the what appears to be fishnet over
his face so to wrap up the elegy tribute
great phone for your next overpriced
marketing campaign
showed me some content had some
messaging capabilities and give it a
solid be regular</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
