nothing to you but this man deke Sharon
has built one
he's the musical force behind NBC's the
sing-off and both pitch-perfect films
and soon he'll be starring in an
acappella reality show on lifetime it's
not an exaggeration to say that deke is
responsible for much of the modern
acapella scene and sure that's a pretty
specific scene but that doesn't seem to
bother him when you look at the the sort
of like fictional representations of
acapella the ones that have been really
big zip it's perfect and Glee like the
attitude of those works toward the
acapella itself like consuming part of
an acapella singing group right like the
commentators and pitch-perfect are mean
yeah totally yeah so so first time we
were sitting around that table with Liz
Banks I turned to her and I said look I
know this movie is a comedy first you
need to make fun of a cappella I want
you to like make fun of us every joke no
limits however if at the end of the
movie people are not out of their seats
cheering for this group you don't have a
movie and and American culture has
changed in a major way I know you cover
a lot of tech stories as well
the fact of the matter is what used to
be seen as dorky is now now respected a
lot more in fact the whole idea of nerds
I think was Neil Gaiman who came up with
this whole idea of someone who's a nerd
in high school is someone who has a deep
love of of something in a great
knowledge of and for it like a lot of
entrepreneurs deke found a niche market
and built an industry around it
unlike most tech entrepreneurs however
it's a decidedly analog niche acappella
as a word if you set acapella people
thought classical music church music
maybe doo-wop or barbershop but I wanted
to sing songs that were on the radio I
wanted to sing current pop music and in
fact there was a college acapella group
that came to my high school the Tufts
Beelzebub's
zing right up here and they performed
for the whole student body and I was
like shaft of light
wham hit me and I was like this is
amazing deke would go on to attend Tufts
and after auditioning three times
finally made it into the Beelzebub's
himself it was there he developed a
musical
that would define contemporary acapella
instead of the coral and doo-wop sounds
of the past he used the human voice to
emulate a modern rock band alright so
take us through the anatomy of an
acapella arrangement how how do you make
one so what we have right here is
lollipop which is the Treblemakers like
stand out moment in the movie so what
we've got here is a little bit of the
verse and you can see you've got Jessie
and Benji here singing and harmony
together take a look at the girl next
door she's uh playing around down at Bom
Jesus loves you she wants more Oh bad
girls get down the beps are being sung
almost like they're like a skank guitar
take a look doodoos are very like
classic acapella dudu then the bass line
starts to low for me to sing they'll see
what I can do take a look and then
little vocal percussion along with the
whole thing you end up with the demo
recording that I did with my partner in
crime and boy what you're hearing right
now is 100% my voice and Edwards voice
and we just layered ourselves in all
these parts to try to give a picture
like what's this arrangement gonna sound
like the music itself is just one
ingredient in the success of this
movement deke is a savvy businessman and
an acapella evangelist and that started
right out of college are you saying
there's something I'm gonna find a way
that just make this my job when I
graduate and move back home to San
Francisco I filed a non-profit paper
work for the contemporary acapella
Society of America how are you able to
like pay your bills like running a
non-profit acapella awareness Society
other colleges heard my arrangements and
they called me and said would you do
arrangements for us so by the time I
graduated I already had a full-fledged
arranging business happening and then in
2009 acapella had its 21st century big
break with a sing-off a music
competition show a la American Idol
totally devoted to acapella acts did you
know how how how they knew you were how
did you know those folks so I got this
phone call right before production
started casting it already happened and
I walked on set and it was it was an
absolute full TV show but I have to say
that people didn't know what they didn't
know on my first day I asked like so
when a sound checks for all the group's
hustle sound checks there aren't gonna
be any sound checks I was like we're
dead so I literally just ran around and
did whatever it took to try to make that
show happen and by the end of the first
season they made me a producer this is
our one this was our one opportunity
it wasn't like we're gonna get another
chance oh if this reality show about
acapella falls on its face it's not like
anybody's ever gonna take another chance
on this for the next 30 years so this
was it
work though the sing-off has become a
holiday tradition on NBC and groups like
pentatonics have gone on a huge success
acapella oddly enough is having its pop
culture moment what what was the process
of working on pitch perfect the Barden
Bellas
they've been cast to be as diverse a
group of people as possible it's like
the Bad News Bears
and when they came in that first day sat
in a circle and I was like how many of
you guys have sung a cappella before we
knew Kelly had because she was our one
ring or we like can we have one octave
fellow singer please and for the rest of
them it was like I sang for a semester
in junior high school does that count
and I was like this movie's over it's
not gonna happen it'd be as if like okay
go out and get ten different actresses
right and like they all like oh I can
swim I can swim great turn them into a
synchronized swimming squad where
they'll pick the exact same way and
their arms go up exact same way it's the
same kind of idea I can't believe I just
used synchronized swimming as another
for a cappella yeah totally I'm gonna
give so many letters looking at the
landscape now how do you feel about sort
of like where a cappella was when you
like finally got onto the Beelzebub's
and and where it is now so everyone used
to sing all of our ancestors at the end
of the day into the hunt and the they
gather around the fire and they'd sing
together and they tell stories there was
a sense of community even a hundred
years ago if you wanted to make music
you had to make it yourself there's no
recording the the act of music was
something that everyone had inside of
them and they knew that but for some
reason once recordings got out there
once people decided Pavarotti goes on
stage and everybody else sits in the
audience once American Idol hit the
airwaves and they started lambasted
weren't as good at singing people are
afraid to sing III can't tell you how
many people I've heard say I'm tone-deaf
you're not tone-deaf they're like three
people on the planet you were tone-deaf
what I hope we're able to do through
this entire thing to this entire
movement is to convince more people to
get back into singing groups get off the
couch because people sing in their car
people sing in the shower people get
drunk and sing karaoke but they're not
singing with other people and having
that experience connecting
but the human voice is the most very the
most versatile instrument and the most
powerful instrument I mean no
synthesized no piano can make you laugh
or cry within three seconds like that's
what we have inside of ourselves what
can we do how can we use our voices in
different ways and stretch and expand
the sound of what acapella can be</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
