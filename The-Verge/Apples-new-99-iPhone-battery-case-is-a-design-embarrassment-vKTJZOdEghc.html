up all possible product announcements
for 2015 the company decided to release
its one more thing for the year a
product that nobody was expecting and
it's a battery case a stocking stuffer
that they'll probably sell a ton of
because it's something everybody needs
so what can you expect from Apple's own
battery case this is Apple's new smart
battery case for iPhone 6 and 6s why did
app will make a battery case well that
depends on how you look at it on the one
hand Apple is looking to give iPhone 6
and 6s users a battery life experience
that's comparable to the one you might
get with a larger phone like the 6 plus
but this is also an acknowledgment that
the iPhone 6 and 6s is battery life has
been a serious pain point for power
users the first thing you're going to
notice about this is its design and I'm
not even sure design is the right word
here it looks like my iPhone 8 and iPod
it does feel nice at least other cases
are hard plastic shells this is an
iteration on Apple's regular silicone
cases for iPhone the top part of the
case is flexible here you're supposed to
bend this top part back and Surt the
phone there and then slide it in to meet
the lightning prong Apple has even
included an instruction booklet in case
you can't figure this out thanks Apple
looks aside how well does it work well I
can tell you this right away even though
the Apple's smart case costs more than
the incipio off-grid Express and the
same as mo fees juice pack air it
doesn't offer as much juice as the other
battery cases do in fact apple smart
case won't even get you a full charge
from 0 to 100% one of Apple's feature
boasts with this is that there are extra
passive coupled antennas placed
throughout the case to amplify cellular
performance just in case the battery
case were to impact that I can't say
that over this weekend I didn't have any
issues at all with cell phone
performance while using the case the
smart battery case can also be charged
with a lightning cable which means one
less microUSB cable to carry around if
you're already carrying around a
lightning cable and there is some
integration between the battery case
hardware and iPhone software basically
the battery level of the case can be
seen on the phone either from the locks
or when you swipe down from the top of
the iPhones homescreen and it's a good
thing too because for some reason Apple
has built the smart battery case with a
tiny LED indicator light inside the case
not on the exterior
another strange design decision you
can't control when the case starts or
stops charging the iPhone unlike a
Mophie which has a standby button so you
can save juice for later if you need it
once you slip your iPhone into the smart
battery case it just starts charging is
it great to have some extra battery life
on the iPhone using the smart battery
case of course I got through a good part
of a weekend from Saturday morning to
Sunday evening without having to charge
my iPhone 6s and even if the case does
have some junk in its trunk
I can definitely appreciate that the
battery case doesn't look or feel like
some sort of combat-ready case but even
from a pure performance perspective is
this the best iPhone battery case you
can get for $99 I'd have to say no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
