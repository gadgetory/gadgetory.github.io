Siri Google has Google now and Microsoft
finally has Cortana Cortana is a
personal digital system for Windows
Phone 8.1 a big update to Microsoft's
mobile operating system
she takes the form of a circular icon
and you can talk or type to Cortana to
get her attention she's like your very
own assistant and she even has a
notebook just like a real one
the notebook feature is designed so that
only you can share information with
Cortana but she'll be learning about
your habits and interests all the time
before asking you to store anything she
learns about you like Google now and
Siri Cortana will answer basic web
searches using natural voice commands
you can ask things like how tall is
Britney Spears or what's the nearest
restaurant the difference here is that
once you completed a query there's a
multi-step element with Cortana where
you can also say call it and she will
understand you meant the nearby
restaurant you can also say show me
directions
Cortana also has a personality and
Microsoft has brought in the voice of
Cortana from Halo Jen Taylor to answer
some queries whether it's you asking who
is your father and getting this reply do
you like Siri and getting an equally
witty result as good toner as a personal
assistant she'll also notify you of
things like sports calls or flight
information but you can also ask her to
remind you in clever ways remind me when
I next speak to my girlfriend that I
need to discuss Kevin Cortana will then
create a reminder that triggers when you
neck speak to your girlfriend that's
useful and super powerful other commands
include the ability to ask Hulu to find
the latest episode of a TV show or just
ways to turn off airplane mode and other
system settings Kitana is always review
in your pocket and learning about you
but the real trick for Microsoft will be
when it can offer this type of digital
system everywhere in your living room
car at work and on every device you own
Cortana is powered by being in it simple
possible to imagine her existing without
my croissants clever search work and
servers crunching data in the background
Microsoft is rolling out Cortana to
Windows Phone and Bing calm initially
one day you'll be able to ask Cortana to
sing you a song and a voice will be
everywhere</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
