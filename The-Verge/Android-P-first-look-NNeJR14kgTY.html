Well, sort of.
Google released the developer
preview for Android P today.
An early look at the
next version of Android.
Now, it's very early on
in the process still.
We don't know what P stands for.
There's a lot of new
features that, presumably,
Google hasn't shown off yet
but if you want an early
look at Google's OS,
this is it.
Just to be clear, this is a
very early developer preview.
If you're not a developer,
and even if you are,
if you don't have a
spare test device around
you probably shouldn't go
installing this on your main device
but if you got a test device lying around,
like, say this Pixel,
then you can give it a go and we have
and here's some of the
new stuff we've noticed.
So one of the biggest
features coming to Android P
is support for a notch.
Just like on the iPhone X
and the whole bunch of
other clones that we saw,
the Essential phone,
Android is adding native
support for notches
so P is gonna have better
support for notches overall.
You can see it actually
truncates notifications
after a few, with a little dot over here
so you can see you have more
and if you're running
the developer preview
you can actually simulate
the notch on your device
like this Pixel, which doesn't
usually have that cutout
so that you can start developing your apps
appropriately for it.
You'll also be able to
simulate different shapes
and size of notches using the P beta
so you'll be able to design
for a whole hosts of things,
whether it's a wide and
flat one like the iPhone X
or taller, thinner one like you saw
in the Essential phone.
Imma make sure that no
matter what shape and size
your notch looks like
P should be able to handle it.
Google's also updating how
messaging works in Android P.
You'll be able to see
the last few messsages
in a conversation directly
from the notifications
so you can remember what
you were talking about
and you'll be able to
respond directly in line
in the notification.
Google's also adding
support for smart replies
like the ones that is
featured on Allo or Gmail
directly from the notification shade
so couple of responses will pop up,
you'll be able to tap on and go
directly from the notification
as well as stickers and
images directly in line.
Android P will also be able to identify
if your phone is trying to
play wide-screen video content
and automatically play it in wide-screen
even if rotation lock is on,
which is something that
I've, at least, been
waiting for for years.
Lastly, we're starting to see hints
of what could be a new
overall design for Android P.
There were rumors a couple weeks back
that Google was planning
on overhauling the design
and while there's not
too much to see here yet
there are some bits and pieces.
The setting menu's been
updated, it's now more colorful,
different color icons
for each setting thing
and there's an overall theme
of more rounded design going around.
The notification bubbles
have rounded edges,
the dock has rounded edges,
and there seems to be
some new font stuff too.
It's a very early preview
so there's no way to
know if this is final,
if this will be indicative
of larger changes to the OS
or just a couple tweaks, but,
if you've been holding out
for a new version of Android
that looks completely different
there's at least some hope for you.
There's some smaller here stuff too.
Google's blocking access
to the microphone, camera,
and other sensors to
apps that are inactive,
which should finally put
to rest, once and for all,
all of the conspiracies out there
that Facebook is secretly listening
to your conversation in
order to serve you ads.
It probably won't but it really should.
There's support for some new
video and image codecs too
like the HEIF format
that Apple started using
in iOS 11 and Mac OS High Sierra.
There's some indoor positioning stuff
which uses multiple wi-fi hot spots
to better locate your phone indoors
and some auto-fill stuff that works better
with password managers.
These are all great features
but there's also the unfortunate reality
that the Android phone you
have in your pocket right now
probably won't ever get Android P.
As of February 2018, only
1.1% of all Android devices
have been updated to Android Oreo
and unless you're phone the
word &amp;quot;Pixel&amp;quot; in the name
the odds of it getting
P when it comes out,
presumably some time next
fall, feels kind of slim.
Maybe things will be different this year
but I would not get
your hopes up just yet.
Don't expect a whole lot.
We don't even know it's called,
although my money's on
Pi, for what it's worth.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
