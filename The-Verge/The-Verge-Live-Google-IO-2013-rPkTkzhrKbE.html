google i/o 2013 i'm josh Topolsky and
I'm Chris yeah Chris you gonna throw I
don't know I didn't know either it's
happened we're we're live here actually
at the verge Tuvok studios and we've got
a lot of news to discuss a big day of
google news too much literally hours out
of theirs or ours like like three and a
half straight hours of non-stop google
news some would say too much news no one
would disagree with them others would
not disagree but we've a lot to talk
about a lot of news to get to we have
people a bunch of people on the ground
at i/o right now will be speaking to
them later in the show but Chris and I
are going to run down what happened to
the biggest announcements talk about
talk through some of these announcements
discuss whether or not we think they
were totally bunk or super awesome and
by the way that's the only space that
they can exist in very binary bunker
awesome very bad so what's what happened
it was it was I thinking maybe you'll
disagree with me but I don't think so
tables going to follow it quickly is
actually on it the literally the most
important announcement of this event was
the galaxy s4 Google edition yeah well I
don't know what the most important kind
of the most important so it was somewhat
important so this is a galaxy s4 that is
bootloader unlocked yeah running stock
Android no carrier control runs on AT&amp;amp;T
mobile with LTE 649 16 gig with my
crusties not cheap not cheap blotchy
product not cheap but I think about
think about the alternatives right the
HTC one developer edition is the same
price yeah iphone 5 the same price I
just wish it was the HTC one right
that's my that's my number one but i
will say i'm buying one of these there's
no question yeah like I'm all set yeah
its LTE unlocked 18t 1080p screen good
camera this is the dream I think this is
the phone that we've all wanted we've
been asking right this is the dream up
until
this point literally every time Google's
announced a phone itself a Nexus device
there's been some ridiculous horrible
soul-crushing compromise and this is the
first time that the uncompromising Scott
kind of like that hardware well yeah but
yes but it I mean it's like a half step
of the battle was the battery on the
2600 milliamp hour oh really yeah that's
encouraging well no it's not because
it's got it not agree because that is a
1080p display yeah but but but but
comparatively to the 2300 in the one
yeah your battery and it's in that it's
a super amoled that's true that's true
it's like a new way that's due to hell
um yeah so what else is in uh that's not
the old Abbey that's a big deal what we
should get into that more but I shall
run down the news items one of the other
big stories from today so we have the
google play music all access it's just
the rumored we broke this story yeah we
actually broke it last night greg
sandoval had a had a big piece that went
up hours before anybody else had the
story literally hours I'm just psyched I
mean he had a really great story yeah
and he basically said that this was
scripture subscription service was
coming today that all three of the major
labels had signed on and as we
discovered today at the announcement
that's true i've actually just signed up
for the trial because you get it at a
discount it's 7i 0 second because i'm a
google employee um no I get it is it an
i/o thing no it's until if you saw I was
just for people who sign up the first
until june thirtieth if you sign up then
you get it for 799 sent the normal 999
which is well so now i know i'm not
paying for our do spotify google all
access at Netflix Hulu you are you are a
hog of the music industry I mean I've
know but like across the spirited
services up spending it easily another
seventy dollars a month and talk about
gable bill which i think is what they
want that's the goal well the question
is would you spend more than seventy
dollars a month on new albums no no you
want no way seven dollars a month on
albums so you're you're a cog I'm using
it
is it taking me for everything that I
happen I getting my computer I don't
want to miss any important news so after
that we had out we're not going
necessarily in chronological order the
keynote but that's about that's big
that's big for the s4's big that all
accesses is pretty huge Google+ Hangouts
their kind of redefining so we did and
we have if you guys go on the side right
now we have an exclusive look I know
that word exclusive I know can be
overused we actually try to avoid that
word unless absolutely necessary
worthwhile but we do have yet we do have
an exclusive in-depth look we went out
to Google I didn't but people did went
out to google and got kind of the
backstory on hangouts why it exists some
design stuff you know all their new
emoji several hundred several hundred
new emoji is it 800 I think something
like that seven or eight hundred yeah
and and so we did and so that there was
that which is a big deal which is kind
of integrated messaging except for the
fact that it doesn't integrate SMS and
it doesn't integrate google voice right
so to me those are like two massive
failures on their part yeah you know
like if you're going to integrate your
messaging integrate all of your message
because SMS is the least common
denominator right that's the one thing
that can reach everybody and yeah
they're not doing yeah I mean why not
say like hey you know you're using a
samsung here's a river a replacement you
know for your SMS app or whatever right
you know not happening um so so there's
that there's they spent a long time
talking about the photo features plus in
in the Google+ redesign did a bunch of
Google+ stuff they did a redesign which
several people have tweeted me and I
haven't had a chance to play with it but
several people tweeted me they think it
looks like the verge which I take it as
a compliment to me it looks like a more
complicated version of Google now it's
the same style we have the car yeah yeah
yeah where I thought it's very cool so
they have this thing with hashtags right
where you can use if you use a hashtag
you can flip the card over and look at
other content that's in that hashtag I
think it's a really cool idea I got to
say I think it's a really cool idea yeah
but but so google plus they're like
trying it's like okay look seriously
like we're trying to do google plus we
really are serious about it we're not
abandoning it right here's a new
business not a spring-cleaning two
things but do you think this is gonna be
this this is encourage you to use it
more
well I think they're getting to the
point in fact another thing that we'll
talk about later on is this this
educational push yeah and they're going
to get to the point where but you know
when you're born you're going to have a
google account yeah and you're just
going to get this orb de ser is written
about in in a revelation book of
Revelation you know the devil will he'll
sign you up for google plus now who's
the devil in this case it is we're gonna
meet Larry Page where I write it I was
ready to go there um no so they have but
they have a interesting about Google+ is
that i use it for basically for photo
back up like I I'm when I take pictures
on my phone they go they upload
immediately to Google+ yeah and
privately which is be Picasso yeah which
is I guess have they phased out picasa
sounds like they haven't actually phased
applica if you go to picasaweb google
com it redirects to google+ right right
so so i actually find that hugely
convenient i think the place is where
they're gonna make google+ useful is in
the places where they like trick you
into using it but yeah that's exactly
right I don't know why I level keeps
going up and down in my ear but please
do not deaf enough whoever's controlling
in the control room you still have one
year left it's all good one year when he
gets all I have left that's all you dare
you that's all yeah alright what else
the big maps overhaul big maps which has
a lot of Earth integration there in a
really cool Big Macs you want fries with
that sorry honey Big Mac um you lost me
you know what it's been a long day i'm
very tired no no one of my shittiest
jokes of all time not gonna lie to you i
feel really bad for the people in my
keno by the way I mean can you imagine
people physically that yeah i mean our
team is our team is in a lot of physical
cigarettes physical distress right now
yeah they haven't gone to the bathroom
an hour no they have not eaten they have
soil themselves so hotels they are there
they're looking around it's like it's
kind of like that um Catrina the
Superdome oh yes sorry at this point the
google i/o session that took place again
is super there's who they're kind of
like banding together yeah they're be
helping the guys like roving packs of
wild dogs
that gags happen uh that was very long
yes I was extremely long so we had yeah
maps and then finally and this was at
this actually goes back to the very
beginning of the keynote where Hugo
Barra talked about this sort of get
cohesive gaming experience which is
something that Android has been lacking
forever yeah and I'm sorry sean
hollister about this little earlier and
i think that he is not buying into my
conspiracy theory but I do find it very
interesting that literally it was
yesterday right the project shield got a
release date and a price yeah and today
we get this story about this cohesive
gaming experience I mean I'm just saying
you really think that's a that you think
that's linked I think I I think that in
VA well it's it's not necessarily linked
from google to nvidia but i think that
nvidia may have been informed you know
clearly they have some level per view
into the Android roadmap they need to
they ready yet right so maybe they said
okay this is the iron's hot now is when
we're gonna strike do you think do you
think that Google has any designs on
getting into living room gaming through
this RIA certainly does well Leah does
but they're not that's not part of the
same ecosystem right well so Google TV
show who's ODB was was conspicuously
absent from this keynote yeah and if
they're gonna do it and you know what I
didn't see uh no updates on the queue
yeah the Nexus Q that's right is that
what's happening with that and that
would be a perfect product for all
access right yes the great pride for all
access but that didn't happen so big
maps overhaul gaming i'm looking through
a list here is that everything that
cannot be everything no developer stuff
yeah there's like it was solid hour
which is not we're not gonna spend time
talking about it because if you're a
developer you're in a session right now
like you don't need to hear us talk so
i'd like to share a little anecdote
about this keynote but you know i was
listening to the entire thing and
normally when we're live blogging an
event like this in when you're in our
shoes you're sort of keyed into when
people start screaming shouting and
getting really excited you're like oh
something really important just happened
i need to find out what it was you know
you can't trust those instincts at an
event like this because the thing
is that people were screaming shouting
at were like a a picture of code right
the country mean you get the stream
running you hear that yeah the the
fanfare yeah you're like oh cuz I was
doing the same thing I'm like what's
going on you know we're typing we're in
our chat room and stuff and then you and
it's like oh they you know it's a new
it's some yes ago the comedy a player
standard right which is cool by the way
actually they showed off what is the
name of the of the new image format what
was it called Oh wet p is a web page
yeah web p which they basically are like
replaces jpegs PNG's and gifts and has
animated gif functionality what do you
call them though what are these no I
know their web peas but like a gift is a
gift you say like oh look at this gif
you mean a jet they look at this orgy is
it look at this P look at this babe
Charla's ph that's a lot of pretty low
brow that jokes for coming full circle
because i feel like we use that a lot
when sony announced the vaio p and now
we have another opportunity another
cycle for the GOP Joe yeah I don't know
I just think it's like there's not an
inconvenient you know there's not a
convenient word or phrasing for that
animated I don't know it's gonna be
tough to take on gifts I think it would
help if they are smaller if they're
smaller in size that's a big deal other
than the new they also showed out the
new video sorry I really am psycho tech
the new video codec thank you which is
which is which is what is it called uh
this one I don't have God were terribly
at four but but i will say i want to
remind you it was a
three-and-a-half-hour rehab yeah this
rate a half hour Abby that's sofa never
yeah baby I mean it feels like something
that happened at in different not just a
different day but a different era of
humanity right like the bin medieval it
was like an evil time like in the in the
meta crawler days is when this happened
yeah and yeah they introduced this new
video platform right first and by the
way early can get to be clear though
these codecs aren't new and they were
every once in a while we see Google
really pushed these
new generation codex because they're
obviously great in many ways they're
more efficient they can you can do more
with them but none of the Codex they
showed today are actually knew they've
been around for a while I think that web
he was introduced last year right if not
oh that's right but they did show it off
yeah somebody's just I'm just reading
Twitter and sometimes like if give me
more booze or take it away honestly if
somebody want to bring me a drink I
wouldn't stop you at this point but so
let's talk about some of it let's get
specific on some of these and by the way
at some point in the near future we're
going to have David Pierce I believe
joining us from New I I think first
O'Neill I first yep Neela is going to
join us live from IO where they're on
the ground with our video team mad mad
scrambling to get finally use the
bathroom and eat food and by the way
literally half of the company is on the
ground in san francisco right now which
is the only reason that I'm sitting next
to you I should clarify you're wondering
why I'm at this desk it's because the
first 18 choices were in 10 Francisco
were several options that we entertained
several several great people yeah and we
ended up with you but no I'm glad
because you are probably more mentally
with it than I am i should say i
actually have having extremely i'm
having any acute back pain right now and
I've been taking tons of ibuprofen all
day just lean back just a mean I'll
certainly give me one of the eating bags
after the problem so I am a little
distracted by the every time I shift my
weight I have like an incredible Syrian
back pain but don't let that don't let
that worry you as we're going through
the topics of today's google news and
announcements so let's start with the
let's actually deep dive on a couple
these names let's start with the galaxy
s4 yeah so you know we are all very
bullish on the one as a phone uh it
seems and there's been a lot of talk
about Google sort of losing its its
voice its Android voice in in in no pun
intended with Larry's voice loss but
this kind of lost its voice in terms of
like what Samsung talks about right you
know there really doesn't feel like
there's a google presence when you see a
samsung announcement and and a lot of
these announcements where it's an
android power
device you don't hear Android very much
right so it seems like in some way uh
you know they're saying look we're
buddies with these guys we're having
audio problems we're being told to stand
by we're having audio problems with us
or audio problems with Neil I Oh with me
that's what I thought I'm sorry what is
that these guys can unfortunately hear
us fine but but I thought it was
interesting there kind of saying I felt
like they're kind of saying like look
samsung isn't we're not at odds with
Samsung we're buddies with Samsung we
you know look we're doing a phone
together but I also think it's really
strange why not say we're going to do
the galaxy s4 we're going to do the one
and we're going to do you know pick
another flagship phone like a motorola
flagship or something let me just
materal even have a flagship at this
moment they will assume they will
present a will assume but but I got
there's a little strange they didn't go
broader yeah maybe it's just too much
effort for them the nice thing is though
I am a somewhat excited about the ass I
mean this completely changes like my the
s4 is like not even a consideration
because i hate TouchWiz oh my yeah and
it definitely is now uh this to me seems
like the phone that I want well
literally is it take almost no
compromise yeah the only thing that you
have to overlook is our target area but
everything else is kind of like really
only are they only doing them in white
that I don't I really don't want a white
phone like that's the other thing oh
you're over white white is played
everybody knows that cuz it at one time
white was when white was cool but now
White's been everybody does white and
it's boring right you know it's cool
green I was gonna say fuchsia like a
fuchsia gs4 would play very well I'd
love a green gs4 like a Beverly aurora
green emerald green yeah sort of a
bright green sure royal green yeah it's
not a color but um so so I'm just been
told via ghost that Neil I is ready
nilay patel to join us live can we get
Neil I up on the on the on the news for
joining you as a giant rock walk spot
yes the alive first off can you hear me
hello can you hear me I can hear you
good how I want to tell you something I
don't want to talk about news I don't
want to talk about product announcements
I don't want to talk about Google now or
surge formats all I want to talk about
is the last experience I just had in a
room with 6,000 people or Larry Page was
just quietly talking about the future
and like the place he wants to go to
where there are no laws and he can just
experiment on running the world he does
that was insane I think it changed me
emotion did say he made a comment I
actually tweeted which was something
like you know there are places like
burning man where you can experiment you
can try anything people got me got to be
a sound like like you we yeah you would
believe what we get away with it birdie
it's hot no it sounded like the island
that the island of dr. Moreau yeah he
wants like build human-animal hybrids
and just see if people are okay with
that yeah okay now you don't have to go
this right place and just a certain your
own regulated country right sir this
space we're just going to try it out
certain people will want to go there and
if you don't want to go there it's no
big deal but but don't forgot sake ask
about what's going on there because it's
bad it's nice date was what was the mood
in the room just set the stage share a
little bit on what we're talking about
like because I was trying to convey it
in the live vlog and I it maybe came
through if you're watching the stream
but the experience of being in the bus
Moscone Center when Larry Page walked
out there's a huge everyone sort of
cheering and whooping those big surprise
nobody knew was coming he doesn't make a
lot of public appearances he just did a
story yesterday you released some
information that you know he's vocal
cords are paralyzed and nobody was
expecting him like people started
rushing up to the front to take pictures
and then he started talking you know
just about google it was like really
unstructured it was obviously ad lib dan
drift he was like I just you know I hate
the negativity I want everybody be
positive let's build awesome things and
I'm gonna do QA and for this entire time
the room was totally totally silent but
i I've never been in a press conference
keynote situation where it was so silent
and everyone was just accepting what was
being said without any like reaction
whatsoever yeah so when he got to the
line maybe we need a place where we can
just experiment and see how things go
there was no reaction have
I was like huh maybe that's a good idea
what what to me that was the most insane
thing it's what I've ever been around
what is your impression of I mean what
do you think he actually meant by that
is he talking about seasteading or I
mean what was he talking about no I mean
David looked at me he's like I think
Larry Page wants us all to go to Burning
Man with him I mean it was it was very
much like you know he was talking about
Google Health and he was like you know
the problems there were regulatory for
us we wanted to do something with
healthcare and we couldn't because
there's all these regulations in place
and we didn't have enough leverage with
technology to get those things change
anyone into this riff about why do we
keep our medical information private
it's probably because insurance
companies want us to keep it private
yeah I don't think that's true i mean
like i don't think people are yearning
to share their medical situation with
everyone else insurance companies have
created some false norm of keeping that
a secret I think people just don't want
to talk about their medical problems it
yeah just there's a disconnect between
everything he was saying about the world
and how it works and how you would like
it to work together is great stuff I
think the stuff he was saying about it
not being a zero-sum game about wanting
more interoperability I think the stuff
you're saying they're really
nuts-and-bolts technology stuff you know
how he's sad that the development of the
web has slowed because we're not focused
on much an interoperability in platforms
all of that was really interesting it
was just one layer deeper where I was
like are we listening to a crazy person
or a genius right and I honestly could
not tell for most of there is always
this thing where the Google guys say
something really that feels really
invasive and scary like you didn't have
like you know talking about medical
records like it's just you just don't
this just doesn't seem like the right
forum where you want to hear Larry talk
about how you know you think it's weird
that are usually a Schmidt game right
now yeah but but but these guys just
have a tendency right you to say things
that make people uncomfortable which I
get to some extent adjust do you think
they would learn after if you go rounds
they be right you know I'm gonna we
might do some things in medical records
but I'm not gonna like go up on stage
and offhandedly talk about how we'd like
to do things to your medical records
just like a weird play to me so so Neil
I flip switch gears from from Larry for
a second what in the room what was the
biggest announcement today what was the
thing that you felt was most exciting or
interesting either from your perspective
or from the rooms perspective I'm
curious to know like what was the thing
that got the biggest sort of like booze
and odds so here's there were two parts
right there the first part was all
really developer heavy and there are a
lot of big cheers for developer stuff
from the huge developer community that
was in the room right so the cloud
saving stuff syncing notifications got
this like massive cheer you know it's
like really simple stuff that's going to
improve the experience of using this
stuff then when they got to the consumer
announcements they showed off hangouts
like working across devices they showed
off the auto filters on photos that got
a big shear you know what I thought the
two so that mean that settings really
obviously the big features we obviously
we have big stories about some of that
stuff on the site right now to me the
two things that I thought were really
interesting and we're very subtle but
very direct jabs at Apple I thought they
spent a lot of time talking about maps
and how dominant they are in maps and
other you're using all the data they've
collected and created to create even
more data and make the maps better and
build a new user interface and like a
million sites or using google maps I
thought that was a really direct shot at
Apple and what Apple is doing the maps
space and then that transition right
into search right and the search stuff
was they are basically building Syrian a
cloud that works for all of your devices
and all the stuff they showed with hot
wording with contextual search with
voice recognition all that stuff is I
mean in comparison i think Siri looks
very very dated and kind of useless and
then Google stuff where you just have a
Google tab open and you're just talking
to the computer I think that stuff is
incredibly powerful but I think that
will be the legacy of this i/o as
opposed to just API changes for Android
but doesn't that isn't that I mean call
me crazy but the idea of people
constantly talking to their browser for
search
it does seem a little bit not natural
right am I crazy unnatural rather mean
does it did it strike you as yeah that
would be exact but I've of that behavior
will well either that behavior will like
take on or alone right now that's how
you enter the keywords i think is you
know it's up for debate i think a lot of
people might like talking I like talking
to my phone I think that's useful 1 i'm
in a car and stop right what i think is
more interesting is that they're they're
starting to rope in your personal data
so you can say what time is a restaurant
reservation and google as a service will
know across devices as opposed to Syria
right now which is very much on your
device very local and very not backed by
like a big cloud service but I think
Google's really flexing its muscle in
okay we put a computer in your hand we
put it on your pocket you've got tablets
now we're going to start interconnecting
that with our cloud and like much more
significant ways i think the photo stuff
is not a really good example like in my
life it doesn't occur to me to take 600
photos on vacation and send them all the
google and let some computer select the
best shots do whatever processing it
wants and then present me an album of
finished photos but i think a lot of
people are really interested in stuff
like that and i can't think of another
company that can do it at the scale that
google's doing it and i think that's
where they're they're pushing their
platforms forward right so Sony let me
ask you a few things conspicuously
missing today right no Android 4.3 or
5.0 or whatever it's going to be called
no new hardware and no real glass talk
to speak of what surprised you the most
I think a lack of I mean Android 4.3
we've been it with the sixth I oh right
night and now it's the new version of
Android then nobody can get it for
another year so that to me is great so
they didn't they didn't announce it I
think that's a wash I think they've got
to get everybody on 4.2 anyway I think
that the one big Android hardware
announcement that was really interesting
to me is the gs4 was stopped Android
yeah I don't know where that came from i
saw the leaks a couple days ago and i
thought they were fake like legitimately
thought they were fake i'm very curious
as to what that device means for the
nexus program what it means for Android
other Android hardware vendors there's a
truck going by excuse me whether or not
anybody is even going to buy it like I'm
imagine I'm definitely gonna buy that
gs4 stock Android I imagine you guys are
too oh yeah the question is like is it
going to make an impact in the world do
and then the glass stuff it really just
got started I don't think there's much
for them to say about it you know we
shipped a thousand units of glass most
the nerds are shipped into our in this
room looking uncomfortably at each other
I saw there's a really funny moment
right before it started who did Joanna
run into it who's also wearing glass
who's somebody join around in his
dresser is wearing her white glass
headset she ran into somebody else think
was mat Honan from wired and he looked
at each other and both of them said
something should happen now and like you
know nothing happened they were both so
wearing like the basic glass so I don't
know that there's much for google to say
the glass should become aware of the
presence of another glass and react is
that what they were such as yeah it's it
yeah i mean like they were literally
like this feels weird something should
be happening with this technology will
ring on a face that's looking out at the
world and seeing somebody else wearing
the same you know we're unique we're
unique people because we have this thing
and I think that's where glasses in a
state right now people have them nobody
knows what to do with them Larry Page
even said you know we're just want to
make happy customers and you can figure
it out which i think is a pretty bizarre
thing for a company to try to do
especially the product like glass but if
anyone's going to do it it's going to be
google so i would say for me the most
surprising emissions here were any
explanations of what's going on with
that gs4 and then the lack of a new
Nexus
with a higher-resolution display I
thought was almost kind of a wop and
just didn't show up yeah that is a that
is an unusual a mission that's a good
point I didn't even think about that
while the keynote was going on and after
three and a half hours I just kind of
wanted it to be over i didn't want any
more announcements and i'm sure that you
felt the same way i hope you've had an
opportunity but no I'm painful for you
right Chris yes she was typing for three
and a half hours yes guy you know it's
something I just I just looks like a
meal I you tweeted her sorry you tweeted
our story on Larry Page talking about
the setting apart the part of the world
for reg you know without regulation for
irritation and somebody posted an image
of rapture from bioshock which is
exactly what he's describing it's
literally much like they wouldn't let us
do what we wanted to do on the surface
so we built an underground you know an
underwater city where we could
experiment and create what do they call
everything is called in rapture in
BioShock we need it we need us to tell
us yeah Ross does it go into her ear
what is the name of the powers that you
can get anybody ross miller i know
you're there any other point is that's
kind of what he's doc yeah and it does
have completely nuts right plasmids
they're called plasmids yeah how do you
make that work yeah how do you how do
you create a country and like half
people live there and be like let's try
out this system of regulations for
medical care oh it's three months later
it didn't work let's try another set of
regulations for medical care like how in
what way do you like to make that all
work at once I I mean it's just I I
think it says if the CEO of a company
sets the culture at the top I think what
we learned about google today is they
literally don't think the ideas and
notions are the rest of the world like
really apply to them and they're trying
to create some other alternate world
where they've made everything better and
i think it's great i think there should
be more companies like you're ready
together it's also Google anyways terra
feels like listen what we want to do is
it is it you know Darren yes is it
experimental yes is it illegal
definitely does it violate the laws of
humanity and all and good and right in
the world without question should we do
it yeah absolutely we just need a place
to do it yeah it's right right it's like
okay well there's a family there a
Verity of that odd care take
notion to all their announcements right
all their announcements are about other
people putting data into Google so they
can make some sense of it for you right
so you are going to upload all 700 of
your vacation photos and allow like the
the photo enhancement service you can
turn it on or off but you're not allowed
to make any tweaks to what it actually
does either you trust Google or you
don't the restaurant reviews like it's a
great idea that you know the maps you I
will change based on what your friends
like but all of your friends has to be
using google plus and they have to be
feeding it information about restaurants
they like and I think there's this
notion inside of Google that if they
could just get more of your stuff they
could get more information they would
run the world as perfectly as possible
and it there will be no problems and no
crime and everyone be happy and I you
know I think that's it's lovable it's
like adorable but it's also like scary
if they're it's a weird vision of the
world where you want to put all the
information you can get into your server
so you can do the work for other Google
could just have access to all of your
data they could they could find a way to
reprogram your body and mind to only do
good and I don't think that's too much
to ask you know they're searching for
the good they're searching for the good
in the world and if they have to if they
have to hook you up to some sort of
bizarre contraption glass know if they
have to hook you up to a contraption
that's more bizarre than glass you know
like glass for all free all of your body
yeah then so be it I think we let them
give it give it give him a couple of
years and see what happens will we have
a race of mutants a race of Google
enhanced mutant yes they hadn't had
another feature that was amazing right
it was a in Google+ the new new stream
like Auto hashtag stuff for you yeah
which is crazy like I don't want
everything I said to be categorized but
the way they can do it right they show
the demo was you put up a picture of the
Eiffel Tower you don't tell Google
anything that it's the Eiffel Tower and
they're like image algorithm can
recognize the structure and begin
sorting and categorizing it for you and
the way they set it and the way they
talked about the other photo features
like in any other context I think would
be scare
like our you know machine brain
recognized your photos and immediately
categorize this part of your life and
then told showed you some other stuff
that you might be interested about it we
can when we can look at a photo and
identify all the skin in it and then
soften that skin to make it look better
whoa is that a normal thing for anyone I
did developers in costume I did fine I
don't know I found the repeated use of
the phrase skin softening to be slightly
unsettling everybody think about like
Larry page's eyelid you know like and
they're like doing you know he's like we
found a better way to do skin softening
physical skin softening using a for an
acid bath you know like I don't know I
mean who knows what they're gonna come
up with but hey you know I do think like
I'm into the idea these guys are like a
little bit crazy yeah i just wish that
like who else would have done the
self-driving cars this early I just wish
you know I wish they had a way to better
manage the the publicity side of their
craziness like somebody there should be
like all right Larry when you go up
don't say you want to have a place where
there are no laws and you want to get
people's medical records it's like you
know say one or the other but not both
at the same time because it seems like
kind of a bad thing yeah I was actually
happy to see you know there's been this
controversy about his voice there was an
article in Bloomberg that we wrote about
about Larry losing his voice and then
getting it back and clearly he's gotten
it back and it's not maybe we'll never
be what it was it's better than its been
on earnings calls lately oh yeah I mean
on earnings calls you could barely talk
you know it's interesting to see after
watching you know what happened with
Steve Jobs and you know one of the
things about that was really interesting
about jobs is that we watched him go
from a healthy guy on stage you know we
look at every one of these events and we
watched him go from a healthy guy on
stage to like is there something wrong
with him to yes there's definitely
something wrong with him in this whole
drama of his situation did you feel like
you know there was a mood of relief to
see him come out and seem healthy and
you know he's soft-spoken but to me I
was kind of like okay he doesn't seem
sick or anything and it was sort of a
relief having gone through or watched
the whole jobs thing play out did that
there a sense
that in the room at all did you did you
even talk about it yeah I don't when he
came out I mean it was just absolutely
for you I mean like I'm saying like
people were getting out of their chairs
and running down the central always to
take a photo of him and like be closer
to him I mean I think there's a real
sense that like you know there is it a
Steve Jobs figure in the industry and
page could be that person he runs google
which was arguably you know pushing a
lot of things farther than Apple ever
did or could at this moment I think that
was really very in the tone in the room
the absolute pin drop reverent silence
as he spoke I think reflected that as
well but then it's you know it I can't
separate that from like the content of
what he was saying and I think there are
very few people can who can talk about
an island or we keep calling island talk
about a space where the laws don't apply
we can try new things and get away with
it in a room full of relatively like
skeptical like engineers and journalists
and he pulled it off so i think his
command of the room and the front of the
environment was like total he looks very
often very healthy i just spoke very
quietly and you know the tone of his
voice definitely went him an air of like
like like mystical like quality yeah i
think we're just gonna have to get used
to his voice I'm glad he seemed totally
fine somebody tweeted I forget who it
was that he had kind of a michael cera
vibe going on and i have to say he does
kind of look like an older michael cera
and now he sort of sounds like him as
well he has a cameo in the new season
the rest he's Michael Cera at the future
um Sonia I know that that I think that
we need to let you go you've got stuff
to do but we're gonna speak to either
dieter or David or both of them at some
point we we actually wait a second to me
or David we're not sure if we're gonna
be speaking oh we're not Slater we're
not know David we're gonna it's David's
right here okay we're not sure now
David's giving a thumbs down look you
guys do what everybody how we're gonna
lemonade alive long enough yeah we know
you've got a lot of stuff to do thanks
for joining us great job today by the
way like you guys killed it i thought
you were way ahead of the stream I was
watching boat and I was like seeing news
pop in the blood the live blog a lot
faster than there
if you earned a bathroom break your
friend you can now relieve yourself in
your pants or not eating up your lady's
choice but what are you doing I've been
doing this whole time I think Robin is
from up here really i mean really Oh any
honey life thanks at all and will love
my general see you in your back in New
York okay that was fun it was good yeah
it was fun yeah it was a nice product I
thought we mostly just kind of um uh
made up cool ideas about what Larry
page's fantasy experimentation world
will be you know I think you missed it
you may have been looking down at your
computer at the time but there's this
moment where Neal I was talking and this
giant red Android slowly right behind
him really yeah it was a really smooth
yeah but do we have a shot of that do we
have a steel frame of that yes let's see
if we do any Zapruder footage of of the
giant Android walking path it was a
really special moment so um alright so
we should go talk you through a few more
I feel so burnt out from today's news I
mean I just like I have to say in
previous iOS last year in the year
before and I think a year before that
they last year's was bonkers too I
divers yeah but they did two different
keynotes righted a two day or they did a
nandroid focus keynote and they did like
a Chrome Google ecosystem sort of
focused kena that was right one was for
what's going on in the Android hardware
you know I think the queue right was
last year they kind of showed out that
stuff and then the other was here's what
we're doing in chrome here's we're doing
surge here's what we're doing I think
there was more of a developer slant to
that stuff yeah I they should have kept
them as two I mean three and a half
hours is too much to ask of people I
think and also when you look at the
stack of news that you deal with in one
day you know there are stories that they
were talking about early on like some of
these new standards of the developer
stuff that it's just like well that's
lost in the shuffle right you know
people aren't going to see that news
they're only gonna see like a couple of
the biggest stories of the day I think
they should split it i don't know why
they didn't what was for you though i'm
curious i mean was the s4 the most
surprising part of the news I think so
yeah a weave I think that collectively
we've all just been holding our breath
so long for this kind of phone a phone
that is very close to being a
no-compromise device and what is bonus
mean that they're selling it for six
hundred fifty dollars what it is not
geared towards an average consumer no
way the Nexus is the nice is definitely
priced for write a regular consumer who
might want to buy an unlocked device
right this is not in the vicinity yeah
the nexus 4 is a device where Google I
think they made a very conscientious
decision to push a certain type of
message and that they were willing to
subsidize that message and they did it
right for better or worse whereas the
gs4 the Google gs4 i think is more of a
reactionary thing where they said okay
well there are clearly enough people who
are interested in this kind of device
it's a very very low cost for us to work
with Samsung to develop in samsung will
work with anybody for any reason it's
not a verb stepson right exactly now so
it was very very low effort for them to
do that and they don't have to subsidize
it 650 is effectively full price right I
think that dumb I think the music
announcement was really interesting
today yes I mean what I wonder is you
know to me this is kind of the the best
of both worlds you know where you've got
you know our do and Spotify are both
kind of islands in the sense that if you
want to buy something you have to go
somewhere else to buy and its pot if I
does some limited purchasing don't they
they don't have the full catalog I
forget our nap I've never tried with
maybe it's yeah but i but i think that
like it's interesting that you know one
of the things like for instance the new
vampire weekend record is out and you
know of course i want to listen to it
you know when you when you when you're
live in brooklyn you can't you have to
listen to all the new vampire weekend
records that matter its obligatory it's
a bit well it's just something you sign
a waiver when you get into the Burrow
but you know i wanted to listen to it
yesterday it was you could buy it you
couldn't stream it to me it's like to
have to go and find it somewhere was
really annoying you know zo i can't
stream at osan Spotify son our newest on
Spotify i guess i'll go by tonight right
this to me is like the perfect solution
for that it's like okay if you want it
right now you can buy it if you want to
wait you can wait there's you can stream
if it's available at the same time but
is it is this enough for google to make
a dent and i think it's like a big
threat to RT on spotify at least from up
from a business
standpoint from just a straight up like
Google is a jug or not they are very
serious about building their content
offerings this is a YouTube you know the
these deals are spanning YouTube which
means the YouTube can now has some
license to stream these music videos or
songs you know if I'm Spotify Rdio I
feel like this is a threat but do
consumers care you can see our consumers
going to go onto their phone and say you
know I mean you'd Spotify a household
name now right nobody cares about Google
Play that's exactly it i think that
spotify and rdio have both been smart
enough about proactively getting their
brands out there that they may have
gotten ahead of the curve and it no
longer matters that Google is the
juggernaut right I see you know in
Chicago I see giant are do billboards
everywhere here job yeah and Spotify
everybody knows right i mean they're
they're pushing hard and one of the
things it's like you know google play
all access doesn't roll off the tongue
right that's not like oh yeah google
play all access i want to get that you
know right why not just brand the thing
as a separate you know it could be tied
to google play but why don't just call
it play well they'll remove all play
that would be great do a service already
having no just like all access is really
bad but you know i think they have i'm
saying i think they have like a branding
and discoverability issue with this
service it's interesting reusing name
brands inside companies is like the new
like hot trope right like first with
microsoft surface get out with google
google hangout yeah yeah why not play
why not you reuse it just call it google
play play google google play with a
little superscript to google play play
play squared or like a new lot over the
a how would you pronounce how does
anybody now ply ply i don't think that's
probably what else what are the other
the other important things that we
haven't talked about yet well so one
thing that that i kind of thought about
while this was going on this 3 a half
hour nightmare yeah nightmares that was
about it was early there was just two
hours we're good solid they had a nice
flow to it the only thing about it there
was a nightmare was the duration the Q&amp;amp;A
I thought really killing it no it was
great ya seen Gary out of three and a
half hours I wish Larry had come out
said a few words in call of the day
I don't think the QA served any purpose
he had some really interesting except he
got he got to talk about his fantasy I
think it's where you write experiment on
but it is great to see like a
super-healthy Larry Page out on stage
and and and they interspersed some
really important announcements
throughout the entire three hours uh but
if you compare this to WWDC wouldn't be
at in just a few weeks now same place
exact same room right and it is also a
developer focused event but guess what
the kid that day one keynote is going to
be very consumer-focused I can guarantee
you that yeah it's all it's all consumer
and it's not gonna be three nights out I
mean they'll talk about developer stuff
they they they typically downplay that
right I mean I don't see why they why
Google couldn't have done that we're
gonna do the consumer-facing stuff on
day one we're gonna develop a faith and
stuff on day tune call today yeah um
call it call two days yeah they're just
very different philosophy yes yeah I
mean I actually I actually thought that
that it was fairly entertaining for the
most part right uh so we have David
David Pierce David Pierce David on
Twitter he's going to join us now and
let's get him punched up on the
vidscreen David are you with us oh this
is exciting I'm still sorry about my
twitter handle by the way Josh David
there's no there's no excuse okay then
you made the mistake it's your twitter
handle and you just have to have to live
with it and I'm gonna have to live with
it as well for up David David what was
your take on today's well today's event
lat uh it was it was sort of weird it
was like I feel like there was an hour
at least as a consumer somebody who
isn't an Android developer or a chrome
developer there was like an hour of
really interesting stuff in there the
google now stuff they showed was super
interesting the Hangout stuff is really
exciting though it's not quite what i
was hoping it would be but then they
interspersed it with all this stuff they
spent a lot of time talking about like
how to sell your tablet app now and how
to make more money from your app and
obviously the audience is this funny mix
of you know regular people and press who
identify more as regular people and
these developers who and so it's like
half the crowd is cheering for each
individual thing over the course of
three and a half hours I mean while I'm
sitting there taking I think I took two
thousand pictures like
please dad and my camera's dead and my
hyper Mac is dead and can we address
something that I'm very concerned about
right now are you and I wearing the same
shirt no I think we are I hope seems
very simple I've been waiting for this
day look I saw that shirt I was like
wait a second what's going on um are is
your computer actually is your battery
dead yeah Oh everything right like right
at the end of the event I everything
just started to kind of died and it just
cascaded down and now i have just
nothing so David you bring up a really
good at Cornell phone and that's all I
am you bring you bring up a really good
point about the the focus on tablets in
the first half of the keynote which I
thought was really interesting because
here we all anticipated this next-gen
nexus 7 that didn't happen so now
they're left with this renewed focus for
developers on developing for tablets and
like they have a special tablet section
in the in the Play Store and whatnot but
we don't have new hardware do you think
that's a problem can the nexus 7 last
another year well I will say I was
convinced at that point that they were
going to come out with the Nexus 7 it
was such a like easy obvious ramp up
they were like you know we have ways for
you to make money and one of them is
designed for tablets and one of the best
ways about designing for tablets is that
we have this new section of the app
store and then it's such an obvious
thing to be like and we have this new
great time right that people will use em
by your apps on yeah just wasn't there
and it wound up sort of awkward and like
I use the nexus 7 now and it's it feels
old yeah feels sort it slow and it just
hasn't really kept up over a year and
like I'm shocked there wasn't a new I
mean look apple updates and stuff every
year it's unusual Mike Mike and I'm just
totally wildly speculating but it feels
like there's going to be a separate
there they have to do a new tablet right
I'm is here they have you know it just
seems like there's no like strong tablet
presence in for Google right now the
Nexus 7 is just old you know I feel like
they're do something new and you know i
don't know maybe they didn't want to
crowd this event which is weird because
can we show sorry hang on David can we
just get a shot of our live blog page
somebody in the control room can you
just get a shot of the live blog
age at the top of the page so we pin
were able to pin all of the kind of
breakout interesting stories from an
event while we're doing a live blog and
I would just like you to see what the
wall of news that is on I don't know if
our guys can bring it up or not just the
wall of news that is that was from
today's event and we actually took some
of the stories out it's all in it this
is not all of the news at some point I'm
sure somebody in the control room is
going to get an image of the live blog
up but David while that's happening what
to you was the biggest what was the
biggest announcement today our biggest
surprise to you when you were sitting
there well so first of all first of all
I should tell you that this just as an
indication of how it's saying this event
actually was we stood up at the end of
the event and Neal eyes stuff is just
everywhere like he's just strewn all
over the ground and he was like yeah my
wrist started swelling I was typing so
much so I had to take off like he had
the cuff and the watch and just had to
fling them off and just keep typing and
like this that was what we just SAT
through well me like biggest daily has
attended to do to wear very chunky wrist
the jewelry as we know that's a fact and
when it's really done with it is oh it's
a kid's it needs to be in a fight it's
his own fault if his wrists were
swelling due to his uh you know spiky
pumped fashions oh here we go so this is
that's fair this should wear loose are
we learn the junk up the of the live
blog page there's just like a wall of
stories there's like 20 stories here
maybe more from today's today's event
but David you never answer my question
what was the one that surprised you the
most or that you were most interested in
or that you didn't see coming
well so my favorite moment was Larry
Page telling Robert Scoble that he
really didn't like that picture of him
wearing glass and shower which was just
like he said it like a joke but it's
definitely not a joke and it was it was
wonderful I think what I thought I will
say this in but I think the thing when
when Larry Page thinks about how he
wants glass to be represented in the
media i'm gonna guess i'm gonna go ahead
and guess that he doesn't want the
enduring image of glass to be a somewhat
overweight guy nude in the shower
red-faced and screaming with glass on
I'm just gonna go ahead and throw that
out there by the way or maybe it is
thanks go on Big Scoble fan don't get me
wrong but that picture is you know
disgusting on everyone every job ah and
I get where Larry Page is coming from
yeah but to actually answer a question I
think the thing that most interested me
was all the google now stuff and I was
watching guys talked to Neil I and you
know that it is sort of awkward these
weird ways you have to like she was
leaning over her computer being like ok
Google which is just sort of weird and
awkward to like yell at your computer to
make it do something um but it's also it
wildly powerful and she got up there and
like this might have been a line but she
was talking about how she'd never done
it in front of a crowd or in a space
this big or whatever and it just worked
every time and she was like show me my
flight it's not you know there's no
weird syntax there's no odd way you have
to go about it and it didn't just
default to doing Google searches for
like a buzz word it pulled out of what
she said right it was actually like
answering her questions with either
information or a super relevant super
specific google search right and if they
can actually like pull that out and
refine it so it's more than just like
how tall do you have to be the ride on
this roller coaster it could get really
cool really fast right and that's I'm
excited about that so so David I know
that you've got to get going you guys
only have a little bit of time there
I've been told by our producers that
we're to move on to a very important
topic which more batteries dying yeah
yeah I know um so anyhow thanks for
joining us and then
covering it and I assume that we'll be
seeing more from you guys from IO at
some point today maybe not yeah I'm just
gonna go keep taking pictures of random
people and or less that's like my past
the people in floppy a droid costume
yeah well thank you David for joining us
and give exact give me a lie a big kiss
for us for both of us when you see him
so there's actually there's actually a
news topic that we want to discuss
that's just come up while we've been
broadcasting and that is and I want to
get the story right so let me look at
the front page that's our site the long
story short is that Google has demanded
that Microsoft pull its new windows
phone you too bad yea which was a pretty
hotly anticipated at because Google has
never made an official YouTube after
windows phone that's right and the
original one was just a wrapper for
YouTube's mobile site and it was frankly
terrible and so what's really amazing
about this is that Larry Page literally
just minutes ago got done talking about
how there's too much negativity in the
business and when we all just get along
and we have a great thing there was a
lot in fact on stage today a lot of
people were like I think Vic Gundotra
said something about it i think sundar
said something about it it was like clat
forget about platforms we want to talk
about people you know we don't care
about you know where you get the stuff
as long as it's all you know it's google
and it works and it makes your life
easier and blah blah blah so they've
demanded that that Microsoft remove its
YouTube Windows Phone app because it's
not displaying ads and look I get the
argument yeah but how is it that this is
happening today why today the tummy just
isn't great it is it's a little weird
also what is this what is this and we by
the way we have the this is our story we
have the letter from google to microsoft
and and you guys should go look at this
if you're watching now it's on the front
page of the sites and our hero which is
what we call the top part of the site in
case you're wondering and it's actually
really not shocking but you know there's
been clearly a kind of a cold war
between Google Apple and Microsoft
you know particularly Google microscope
we type of this in the verge cast
recently is that you know Apple and
Microsoft are now sort of like partners
in crime when it comes to trying to
battle google google is like the shared
enemy you know it's one of those the
enemy of my enemy is my friend rosette
it is that what it is yeah my the enemy
of my enemy is my friend right so in
this case Apple and Microsoft we're
friends you have technically they've
been enemies right historically right I
know they have like a lot of
partnerships but you know it's really
interesting clearly apple doesn't see
Microsoft as a threat anymore right in
any real way and obviously Microsoft
sees Google is a big threat on many
fronts right whether its operating
systems mobile search which Microsoft
has tried to get into a Productivity
stuff the productivity stuff probably
being the biggest one for them so you
know do you think this is a is this just
is this letter this move just a scare
tactic I mean obviously they want them
to pull it but is this just like hey get
get ads in there or do you think there's
something that you think this is a is a
more meaningful you can't help but feel
looking back over the past six months to
a year that Google is just kind of like
getting a kick out of throwing banana
peels in front of Microsoft as they go
and and clearly there are very real
business reasons for all these decisions
but I just feel like if if Windows Phone
really is the non threat that it seems
to be to Android and to iOS this is a
weird I get that this needed to happen I
just don't know if why it needed to
happen to see me let me read you some of
the the letter actually this is from
Francisco Varela of array up the
director of global platform partnerships
at YouTube miss dear mr. bricks this is
to Todd Brix general manager Windows
Phone apps in store we recently became
aware of a microsoft authored YouTube
application for windows phone 8
available at and has a link now it
appears the application one allows you
to download videos from youtube to
prevents the display of advertisements
in YouTube video playback sand three
plays videos that are partners have
restricted from playback on certain
platform
eg mobile devices with limited feature
says this is really interesting by the
way because Google YouTube has it makes
a big deal out of if there's copyright
violations in a video they will
immediately restrict playback of that
video from mobile that's the first thing
they do is like you can't play it on a
device you can't play it on a TV it's
like they restricted from thirties like
third party playback places now third
party but but second screen I guess I
mean to they're not web not native web
these features directly harm our content
creators and clearly violate our terms
of service honest let's go ahead content
creators make money on youtube I
monetizing their contents or
advertisement unfortunately by blocking
advertising and allowing downloads of
videos your application cuts off a
valuable ongoing revenue source for
creators and causes harm to the thriving
content ecosystem on YouTube in addition
your application overrides specific
decisions made by some content creators
to keep the content from displaying on
certain types of devices which in many
cases are due to exclusive distribution
arrangements those content creators have
with third parties so I think what's
really notable about this is that google
is there is no interplay here between
Google and Microsoft in terms of this
app being created and my understanding
actually my understanding about this app
was that there was some conversation and
collaboration this feels like a weird
like weirdly amateur for Microsoft I
feel like you know has actively gone out
of its way to participate as little as
possible in Windows Phone right but I
mean but Microsoft knows they're
violating there's no way their legal
department looked at this in writing say
like well we're not we're not going to
show their ads we're not gonna do XY and
z so do you think this is Microsoft
poking Google with minik and if it's
poking them I don't see what they have
to gain and they clearly are in
violation of their of their terms of
service and and and the polling this is
obviously going to happen they can't
keep it up right you know and they go to
court over it I don't know where where
Microsoft can stand no I i think my
guess is what'll end up happening is
Microsoft will resubmit this app that's
compliance you know and in the meantime
they've gotten a nice bump in in
visibility because of this little
spamming can they be here
the question did they not make it
compliant because they didn't care or
were stupid about it or is it not
compliant because there's some technical
reason that but adds won't run and that
so certain settings won't work on a
Windows Phone device it I think it's
that in combination with the calculation
that if they submit a violated app they
will get this conversation started and
now Google is going to look a little
silly if they don't help Microsoft make
a comply nap well that means I think
Google's I think Google's attitude to
Windows Phone if they had cared at all
about when its own they would make their
own app right side people decide they
don't want people to view right YouTube
content I mean their job YouTube's job
is to make sure the max amount of people
see their content right that's how they
make money but it's clear they didn't
make Windows Phone a priority and
there's been a lot of back and forth
over YouTube yeah the whole Cal damn
thing and yeah it's yeah over YouTube
and my sorry and Google services right
yeah right so anyhow this is a story
that won't stop unfolding probably and I
would like to read you this this direct
quote from from Larry Page that the TC
just fed me here this is from his Q&amp;amp;A
session and I think it's very very
appropriate considering the
circumstances page said I think just
this week Microsoft took advantage of
that by interoperating with us but not
doing the reverse which is really sad
right and that's not the way to make
progress you need to actually have
interoperation not just people milking
off one company for their own benefit so
I think Google's always stood for that
we certainly struggle with people like
Microsoft right so that's a very very
telling statement it's it's uh there
were a number of there were some subtle
comments today you know one thing about
google that they don't do where Apple is
sort of notorious for doing it is like
taking straight up shots at people on
stage and Google is tends to be a little
bit less aggressive and frankly I don't
know if they have a position to be more
aggressive you know in some ways it's
like look you guys for a long time we're
kind of screwing up in a variety of ways
certainly with mobile it took them
longer to get a foothold yeah and to
convince people that Android was a
platform they wanted to be on and so I
did think today though they were lacing
these kind of subtle
at Microsoft and Apple throughout the
presentation which I take you know it's
fine it's a little childish but it's
funny to see like what is a subtle dig
or a offhand comment get turned into a
real situation right which is this is a
real legal situation they now have
between between Microsoft and Google
anyhow up so we're getting close to
wrapping up there's two things I want to
do first off if you have any if there's
any like questions that you need answer
that we didn't cover I feel like we
glossed over a lot of stuff because
there was just a lot of stuff we have
every major story and even some smaller
stories from today's Google a keynote on
the verge we've got a big story stream
where we've collected all of the content
we have two big feet we didn't really
even talk about these but we have two
big features what we did a little bit
the beginning where we got a chance to
go to do sort of an inside look at the
new hangouts and in the Google+ revamp
with the emphasis on photos and sort of
utilizing data to be smarter about
content that's displayed and you should
read both of those they have amazing
videos that our video team put together
we send a crew out of reporters out to
Google's campus to sort of like get the
story on these products and you know
figure out if you know one of the things
we're really interested in is we just
covered Facebook's messaging we did a
similar sort of feature story on their
their new messenger app and chat heads
and this is sort of like in a way
hangouts is very much response to that
so it's interesting to see the
juxtaposition between those two stories
so I highly recommend that you read
those no chat heads here though no chat
heads I'm actually really disappointed
that chat heads is the only app it's
using that I think it's a brilliant
interface yeah and I really think
somebody should somebody besides
Facebook should pick up on it Google
maybe it is your platform maybe think
about utilizing some of the
functionality of it but so so before we
go I'm checking my Twitter to see if oh
somebody just tweeted at me there was by
the way there was an HTC employ the
tweeted today about a sort of seemed to
be hinting at an unlocked
stock HTC one well in not so many words
it was like you might just want to wait
yeah it was something to that effect
yeah I I think that somebody just
tweeted at me about it I don't think
that it's a it's certainly not happening
today no I don't think it's happening at
i/o and if it is happening i'll take one
please we all will he send it to Vaughn
we all will the Vox offices in midtown
Manhattan so so but the things we want
to do is first off we have footage of
earlier we were speaking to Neil I there
was an Android that walked past him yeah
and we have footage of it now and I'd
like to know if it's possible for us to
get the footage of the Android up on the
screen for our viewers because you
pointed it out to me and I was very
interested in seeing it and somebody
actually took the time out to cut that
together and Ross I don't know if you
are on top of this in the control room
they're working on it actually quite
it's actually quite complicated to get
this up on the screen but so I want to
show you guys that and then we have a
supercut of the entire three and a half
hour keynote that is three and a half
minutes which is excited that is the the
correct length of time fire an event
like that yeah so so we're going to give
you after we get the android app which
maybe we can't do maybe we'll have to
wait till after the Rost you want us to
wait till after we show the supercut one
more second well there's your second
yeah come and gone there we go ah here
it is here's the Android and by the way
this Android seems to be in casual
conversation with another person am I
crazy but they're just like talking what
an odd world we live also vandroid is
clothed yeah the androids wearing it
like a karate outfit or a race like a
toga a jogging oh so it is or not no
it's not a toga toga it looks like a
jogging outfit to me yeah you be we may
never know that's the Android that
walked past Neil I certainly worth the
wait oh actually this this HTC employee
just responded on Twitter she said we
already have a developer addition to
selling
quite well too yeah but do you have a
black developer edition too by the way I
by the way black HTC One now available
at ATT really yeah indoors yes in store
well in online I forgot I was gonna
mention it to you when we were doing the
news I it's probably a little news hit
for us if you'll excuse me I need to go
to an AT&amp;amp;T store okay that's pretty much
our show but we want to show you we want
to leave you with this it's all three
and a half hours of the keynote of
Google's keynote from i/o 2013 in three
and a half minutes brought to you by the
lovely minds at verge video so take a
look at this and move back for some kind
of weird sign off that makes you
physically uncomfortable
well a good morning in hello let's get
this keynote started I think we are in
the middle of one of the most pivotal
moments these are two pictures in the
same location when you look at the one
on the right a fee of phones capturing
that moment 900 million we couldn't have
gotten there without the help of a lot
of you in the audience and people around
the world developers around the world
but you have to remember there are over
7 billion people on this planet so we
have a long way to go and we think the
journey is just getting started we
recently launched a redesigned version
of the Google Play Store you know in the
run through we didn't put a picture of a
more handsome man behind me up on the
screen but I guess that's fine we set
out to build a music service that didn't
just give you access to a world of music
but also helped guide you through it
what if we gave you access to millions
of tracks from our store your personal
library blended with ours that's all
access we talked about 900 million
androids 48 billion app installs a bunch
of new tools and developer services that
help you build awesome apps this is a
samsung galaxy s4 running Android 4.2
jelly bean with the same software
experience that we ship on our Nexus
devices it's google's take on android
this version of the samsung galaxy s4 it
works on both AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile with LTE
support it is bootloader unlocked it
will be on sale starting on jun 26 on
google play for six hundred and
forty-nine dollars we're gonna give each
and every one of you a brand new pixel
I've been asked to say it's not ready
till 2pm so please don't leave in the
middle of the keynote
I'm really excited to announce a new
initiative which will make it easy and
affordable for schools to put android
tablets in the hands of all their kids
you've already been doing this with
Chromebooks Chromebooks are really
ideally suited for education because
this literally no setup no
administration you open the device
you're good to go you have the power of
web within you we're going to switch now
and talk about what we are doing on
Google today we're introducing 41 new
features across three major areas of
Google+ first a new newly designed
stream a new hangouts application and a
fundamentally new photos experience we
have a point of view about software and
technology namely that it should get out
of the way and allow people to do what
they do best let's live learn and love
frankly even Google's own services have
been fragmented and and confused at
times so we're introducing today a new
application hangouts group video at no
charge isn't that fantastic now this is
really hot we just took it off the press
this morning and I've actually never
tried hot wording in a room with so much
ambient noise show me things to do in
Santa Cruz you are popular attractions
instead
is absolutely amazing you know he's
tablets phones laptops and you know even
the Google glass all those things were
using I'm tremendously excited about all
the innovation that you're bringing it
to life technology should do the hard
work so that people can get out of doing
the things to make them the happiest in
life kind of somber note there at the
end sombra hasting Larry Page can't say
anything doesn't sound very serious and
soft that's true like he's so softly
spoken no matter what he says he could
say the most outrageous nasty thing in
the world but you're gonna feel like
it's really heartfelt and touching but
still a little evil but also somebody's
a little bit at some points let me said
he was did somebody make a joke about
him stroking a cat yeah Cat a nude nude
cat anyhow I think we need to wrap up
we're like pretty much a drink o'clock
yes red beer o'clock here at the verge I
just would like to thank I just like to
say before we go I want to thank our
team who did an amazing job today for
the coverage i mean the coverage they
did today was crazy like the teams on
the ground the video crew on the ground
our reporters and writers that were
actually there everybody who's here in
the office and remote working overseas
or in it in locations around America and
around the world just there really
incredible to work with and and we you
know we had some issues with the site
today I'm sure some of you guys saw we
were getting like these 500 errors and
having some comment loading issues and
we were also having issues in our
back-end and you know back-end issues
and ironic that we have back-end issues
in the day when my back is hurting
coincidence uh but but everybody kind of
plowed through it and did an amazing job
and you know the teams that went and did
these long reports I thought it really
could work I like a huge thank you to
our video team for putting the stuff
