science fiction I'm Walt Mossberg I have
been reviewing tech gadgets since the
early 90s and collecting them since the
80s and I wanted to show you some of my
collection this was a very popular dumb
phone I guess you would call it the
Motorola StarTAC
it came out in 1996 11 years before the
iPhone and it was widely believed to
have been inspired by the Star Trek
communicator which Captain Kirk and mr.
Spock would whip open on some planet or
gender brush I'm gonna kick back with
the ship and that's what this did except
on only one planet planet a or a lot of
the success of tech over the last 40
years have been these things are objects
of desire carrying this at that time
major cool you spy sure have some cool
toys how did you fuck check out the
Motorola StarTAC fela phone the smokes -
fela phone in the world I think the
design is now obsolete in the sense that
consumers don't seem to want flip phones
instead they were giant tablets but for
many many years of lip phones were the
thing and lots of other people made them
this isn't the only thing which at least
in design was inspired by Star Trek and
other science fiction I don't believe
you could actually transport yourself to
the planet the alien planet with it but
maybe someday</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
