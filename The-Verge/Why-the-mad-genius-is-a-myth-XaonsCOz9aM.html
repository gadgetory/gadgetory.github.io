composer Robert Schumann and painter
Vincent van Gogh embody these concepts
but they may have had something else in
common some scholars think that they
both had bipolar disorder a mental
illness is characterized by an usual
shifts in mood and activity levels and
some scientists suggests that their
mental health disorder was intimately
linked to their genius that the same
genes that code for creativity also code
for bipolar disorder hence the concept
of the mad genius there is some support
for the idea of the mad genius in the
scientific world in 2013 for instance
researchers in Sweden found that writers
were more likely to be diagnosed with
either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia
and more recently geneticists in Iceland
found a genetic link between both these
disorders and creativity I mean just
look at these headlines researchers
don't know sorry to burst your bubble
but that study isn't as conclusive as
those headlines suggest so the author's
building on previous work have shown
that if you take a collection of
variants throughout the entire human
genome you can show that this collection
of variants explains about five or six
percent of schizophrenia those exact
same variants throughout the entire
human genome also explain about a
quarter percent of the variance in
whether or not someone grows up to be a
professional artist this is David Cutler
I'm a human geneticist from Emory
University he has another way of
interpreting the study that brings us
closer to what the findings actually
mean let's imagine that the difference
between the sort of least schizophrenic
person in the most gets a frantic person
is a mile these variants together for
schizophrenia explain about 300 feet so
you can sort of think of 300 feet out of
a mile as you know a start but it's not
telling you most of the story when
looking at these same variants for
whether or not you grow up to be a
professional artist they explain about
13 feet out of the mile 13 feet is
probably a lot less than taking a good
art class rejection I suspect that one
art class would move me a lot closer to
being a professional artist than if I
had been born these thirteen feet closer
but
there's another reason to question those
headlines the definition for creativity
that was used in this study was only
based on whether somebody belonged to an
artistic profession or society I think I
think we all know that some people are
creative outside of an artistic society
there are probably plenty of people that
don't have them as a professional artist
by title so it's bacon defining
creativity by profession might be the
best definition that we have but it's
also a really bad one some artists
aren't all that creative and some coders
are super inventive and none of that was
captured in this study this kind of
demystifies the whole idea of the mad
genius you say well for some believing
in this myth means avoiding treatment
for their mental illness because they
think it might jeopardize their
creativity and in general it just
perpetuates stigma either relating to
being a creative individual or to having
a mental illness it's just another way
of other ring people because they
deviate from the norm so the next time
you look at starry night or listen to
pep yawn think of these creators and
people like them as geniuses in their
own right their mental health was
probably unrelated to their creativity</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
