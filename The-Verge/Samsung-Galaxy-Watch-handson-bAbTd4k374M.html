the Barclays Center in Brooklyn looking
at the brand new Galaxy watches they're
pretty good alternatives to anyone who
might want an Apple watch but has a
Samsung or Android device but they also
come with their own unique interesting
features so from an aesthetic standpoint
I have to say that the Galaxy watch has
definitely matured since I last saw it
so looking at the larger version of the
watch we have two physical buttons one
which takes you to home and another
button which you basically can use to
program and do just about anything the
crown of the watch which is this
rotating circle right here is your main
navigational tool besides the screen
itself so from here you can get to the
different home screens the different
scenarios that you would set up like
music notifications regarding news
barometer and you can also add different
widgets so we could add an alarm at a
shortcut a calendar contacts Samsung
health notifications pretty much just
everything that the Galaxy watch can do
you can add as a separate screen
I appreciate that whence you reach the
limits of a given menu that it vibrates
and it gives you a sort of tactile
response so you're not just aiming
around different menus with their
navigational crown and you're not
swiping around everywhere and forgetting
where you are
so Samsung is touting three primary
features for the new Galaxy walk is
first and foremost the my day feature
which is sort of a daily summary of wat
face which shows you how much time you
have allotted through the day and what
appointments you have and how to balance
both second is the all-day battery life
specifically four days worth of
purported battery life and last but not
least activity tracking for up to 40
different activities which are seamless
and simultaneous meaning that if you
switch from say for example running to
cycling the watch will pick up on that
and calculate results in a different
manner so GAAP see what comes in two
different sizes and three different
variations of 42 millimeters smaller
version which
in this pink rose gold version and a 46
millimeter a larger version so basically
this particular color only comes in the
smaller version presumably because this
would be the woman's size because it's a
smaller watch SiC thickness compared to
a real watch is about the same and it's
a pretty surprising it's not that much
thicker than the real thing
and I appreciate that it's also
relatively lightweight the casing is
metal which I appreciate from a quality
standpoint and this uses an or comes
rather would default rubber sports bands
but you can turn it over and see that
you can actually remove these with a
little latch right here and pretty much
use any wrist band that will fit into
the casing of the watch so the galaxy
watches do come with LTE you can get at
the carrier in the United States that
supports them right now we don't have
carrier availability but Samsung has
claimed that they've partnered with more
than a dozen carriers worldwide to
provide LT capability for the gap see
watch with LT capability you can receive
calls send them top to people listen to
Spotify pretty much do everything you
would with the galaxy watch normally
that's paired to your phone but just
independently without needing a phone or
look around I really do like the watch
it has a quality feel to it I wouldn't
use this default band however but the
metal casing the use of a crown is a
navigational of device I think those are
really novel things but Samsung has done
well here battery life I haven't been
able to test we'll have to figure that
out with a long run but overall this
seems like a pretty promising android
wearable if the galaxy watches are using
Qualcomm's new Snapdragon chip for
smartwatches then this might be very
promising Samsung reportedly says if the
battery will last up to four days and
considering how slim the watches are
that's pretty impressive especially
since you can charge them all wirelessly
regarding pricing and availability those
are still TBD we don't know those yet
but keep it locked to the verge and keep
it locked to youtube.com forward slash
the verge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
