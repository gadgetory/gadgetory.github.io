put out its new microbus concept the ID
buzz here in Detroit and as you can see
it's a total blast from the past so the
ID buzz is an all-electric fully
autonomous micro bus that's meant to
harken back to Volkswagens glory days
you know peace signs and flower power it
wouldn't be the fastest electric vehicle
out there with the top speed of only 99
miles per hour and with a 200 kilowatt
electric motor and a charging range of
only 270 miles it also wouldn't be the
most powerful evening but it does have
however is the ability to make a direct
appeal to two demographic groups the
stal j'avais be boomers and tech
obsessed Millennials it's a brilliant
marketing strategy but the question is
will Volkswagen ever make this thing
Volkswagen says the microbus could make
it into production by 2025 but that
seems overly optimistic the German
automaker released a different micro bus
concept last year the buddy
and neither of these cars seem to really
have any basis in reality that doesn't
make them any less fun to obsess over
especially with futuristic features like
mood lighting
retractable steering wheels and driver
seats that can swivel 180 degrees
another suite add-on is Volkswagens ID
pass a cloud-based User Profile that
stores specific settings for both
drivers and passengers that means every
time you get in the car will
automatically adjust everything to your
liking seat position air conditioning
music you name it but it's important not
to let cool concepts like these distract
from the overall problem which is
Volkswagens ongoing diesel emissions
cheating scandal right before Detroit
kicked off a senior executive was
arrested by the FBI on charges of
conspiring to defraud US customers it's
a really big problem for the company
they have billions of dollars tied up in
settlements but in the meantime we've
got cool concepts like these to look at
anyway Volkswagen will always have a
place in America's cultural identity
vehicles like the bug the beetle and the
micro bus or icons and it's really cool
to see the company continuing to play
around with these classic models as it
looks further into the future German
automaker released a different micro bus
concept last flesh
this is awesome I've never rotated in a
bus before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
