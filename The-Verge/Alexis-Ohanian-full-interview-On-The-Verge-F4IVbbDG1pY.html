human being but you certainly know his
website where you find all of your
favorite memes and animated cat gifts
please welcome one of the founders of
Reddit Alexis Ohanian
I love you you brought props I like
anybody who brings props
uh-uh-uh-uh-uh taught me well use a
carrot top taught use a prop comic
please leave the record for shortest
interview ever
yeah now first up can I ask you anything
yes he's ready joke come on guys there
were three a bit off only three
redditors in the audience yes seriously
very sad so let's talk a little bit I
want to talk about the creation the
ideation the birth of Reddit hmm you've
co-founded it in 2005 who are you who
your partner's Steve Huffman just Steve
yeah yeah me and Steve done each other
we got together in an apartment months
about a month after we graduated from
UVA and got started trying to create the
front page of the internet and you know
a lot of fortunate things came together
and here we are today and here you are
could you can you imagine that you could
you have ever thought you'd be sitting
talking to me incredible climb what a
success story really my big concern is I
know it's only downhill from here
it really is everything will seem boring
and horrible after this because I'm
going to ruin it for you
so so what was your what was your
thought like when you were building
right what did you want to do you know
in all frankness Steve and I were
friends since the first day of college
when he thought I was a girl because of
my name on the door and you have a
lady's name I was I was actually it was
I was named after he Nicaraguan boxer
named Alexis Arguello
who was a dude but you know at a very
early age realized I needed to embrace
my effeminate name so yes I am
eliminated uh-oh
every day but so most importantly Steven
I really just wanted to perpetuate our
college life we really loved being able
to eat pizza drink beer and work on fun
projects and we thought let's try to do
this by starting a company and you know
we didn't set out to do a lot of the
things that reddit has done in the way
of philanthropic work or political work
I'd be lying if I said we did we just
wanted to create a place where we could
find what was new and interesting online
that's really interesting you just
wanted a place to find hilarious stuff
and collected and informative as well
but oh come on cats so cats can be
instruct
no no that's true they can they can and
and why do you think it's why do you
think it's become you know you call the
front page of the Internet
why do you think it has actually you
know really become the front pages in it
I mean it has turned into something that
is I mean based on what you're telling
me maybe you guys didn't even predict
but it has turned into something really
big and special what is that how did
that happen
black magic we made we made deals it
deals with various individuals um
well you know what I you know we when we
started read in 2005 social media wasn't
even a phrase you know Facebook was
still sort of relegated to colleges and
many of the things we can't live without
today didn't exist and we just hit
oh goodness are you okay now obviously
to drink but it's alcohol so is mine
it's alcohol supposed to go into the
lung I all right not a duck okay we can
edit this right I was busy trying to
remember all my Heimlich training yes I
could have read he died you just sat
there I was I was ready to jump an axe
sorry so I became yes what it was Nick I
think a lot of it was timing and here's
the thing I'm not to take anything of it
Steve did a brilliant job actually
building reading by the way we're open
source so take a look at his work the
the work that went into it you know
there was a ton of it but the other day
we had a lot of really great timing and
we we came about at a time when people
were still starting they were just now
starting to realize that user-generated
content was a thing of value and it
turned out there were a lot of people
interested in submitting links and
voting on them and having discussions on
the Internet
far more than we'd ever experienced then
you know we caught things at the right
time and I think the overarching ethos
the spirit of Reddit that Steve and I
knew we had to continue was that the two
of us sitting in an apartment we're
never gonna be able to find the best
stuff on the internet there we tried for
the first couple of weeks because we
were like submitting things ourselves
and there was no way we'd be able to
find it all so we needed to be good to
our users because if our users weren't
excited about submitting to Reddit and
in providing good content they'd never
do it and we wouldn't have a site that
was worth anything so
so being good to those users I think is
what helped reddit continue to grow for
all these years and you've had you've
had a lot of competition you've had
competition out there at one point Digg
kind of seemed to occupy the space that
you guys occupy maybe actually when I
think about dig it didn't seem to go as
deep and maybe that's just the way our
culture is moving but reddit seems to go
reach deeper into not both the dark
heart of the internet and outwardly to
things like policy but but but Digg was
at one point very much on top and they
made some pretty substantial changes I
feel like you guys saw kind of a flood
of users who were looking for refuge
what did you learn from that what did
you see there and what were your
takeaways from it you know we didn't we
saw a significant bump after Digg
version 4 it wasn't world-changing
reddit has always steadily grown and I
think what it did was it really
reinforced this belief we had that we
didn't need to care about our
competition we need to build the best
site we could for our users and like I
said do right by them and and the real
fatal flaw to dig for was taking away
user submission was taking the very last
bit of that democratic platform away
from the people who like I said added
all the value and as we moved closer
towards giving users more power I feel
like they moved further away until it
eventually undid them well part of their
thing was was they felt like some users
had too much power yes and what are you
do to combat I mean how are you trying
to fight super users we well we work I
mean there is a karma system on Reddit
and I hope many of you work hard to get
lots of reddit Karma but it really means
nothing it doesn't bias your votes every
redditor all all Reds are equal no
redditors are more equal than others
that was something in our FAQ from day
zero and we wanted to make sure that we
had a system where if you wanted to come
on for the very first time and it
happens every day on reddit submit a
post say I am a blank ask for anything
you could be on the front page that
evening and the next morning on the
Today Show and that literally actually
happens now because we can let anyone
who doesn't have any clout on the
internet but who's got a good story or
has found some good content you know get
the fame internet fame that he or she's
idea dessert that's actually this is
actually leads in perfectly to my next
question
so you recently banned some publications
a lot of news stories you banned the
Atlantic some other guys for abusing
reddit
and you know we run a publication The
Verge we are occasionally on reddit
which is wonderful and I wanted to get
some tips from you I feel like if
there's gonna be a source on how not to
abuse read it as a publication that
you're the guy to ask so let me just
have a couple of questions here all
right how many accounts is is normal for
one person to have would you say I'm
gonna give you a few ranges okay had
between 20 and 40 between 40 and 60 mmm
where do you feel is the comfort zone
for one individual to have a count this
is gonna sound crazy but one I will say
I will make I'll add in a 100 and you
hit the nail on the head it's it's
things like this we pay have always paid
very close attention to it's kind of an
arms race we're always trying to keep
one step ahead of the cheaters but
that's a really obvious way to be bad on
reddit is to create lots of shill
accounts and up vote your content you
know I'll I'll certainly agree that
everyone needs a fake account so they
can say the things they may not be
comfortable saying the stuff no no I
don't really nasty stuff I I was I was
thinking more like they asked me any
things where you know candor's sort of
required in being honest but the the the
the fascinating thing is we we've always
tried really hard to keep that kind of
cheating down and you know we had
publications that disregarded it and and
I think partly because our predecessors
actually sort of encouraged it we've had
to sort of undo that mess okay when
using multiple accounts IP spoofing yes
or no no no don't don't don't do that oh
and and in general my final question in
this extremely serious line of
questioning how many verge links should
I be submitting on a daily basis again
I'll give you a range okay
20 to 40 40 to 60 or unlimited because
it's all really great stuff I I think in
the Verge's case it should be that
submissions of verge content yeah in a
nutshell the best secret I tell
publishers is is and I think people
often forget this when they go on the
Internet is just act like you would in
real life don't act like a jerk don't
act like yourself promoting your own
content don't do that because that
wouldn't fly in real life and it doesn't
fly on the internet so you know we could
stop we get worried I mean honestly like
Reddit I mean look we're a new site
right so we're growing and when we see
something on the front page of Reddit
like the traffic is crazy and it's not
just that it's new traffic I'll just get
a little serious with you for a second
even though I was clearly just a really
serious sinner it is very serious um but
but it's not just that it's traffic it's
that it's a lot of new traffic mhm
you know a lot of people who've never
who never heard of The Verge before and
so we're actually like really I don't
want to screw it up you know there are
times when we're like hey art stuff is
you know it's got a bunch of votes like
go check it out like vote it up if
you're on Reddit like and I don't want
to be the kind of guy who abuses what
you guys are doing because I think what
you're doing is really special and
really important and and and I mean yes
I'm going to continue to use multiple
accounts and spoof their ip's but I'm
gonna do it in a way that is almost
undetectable to bring it and that's the
important thing so okay so if you guys
are the front page of the internet mmm
and by the way you have a lot in common
with 4chan if you're the front page or
they like the back door of the Internet
Wow I mean are they I mean do you how do
you cuz I feel like there's like always
you know there's almost a you feel like
it could go for Chan at any moment not
that that would necessarily be a bad
thing but it would be a little bit more
chaotic than what you have going on now
I mean the you know what the the
moderation system that's in place the
pseudo anonymity so unlike 4chan you're
renters have identities they're
anonymous you you have a username it
could be Alexis Ohanian or it could be
fluffy bunny 26 you still have an
identity that's me that was yeah spoiler
and so I think that has helped preserve
it and and what's been really
fascinating is you know reddit is a
platform like Twitter like tumblr like
all these others we use and communities
form and use this platform to share
links about everything from I subscribe
to Redskins read it cuz I happen to be a
die-hard skins fan and a masochist and
and that community has its own culture
it has its own ethos it submits a
certain type of links has its own inside
jokes and that's how they choose to use
the platform
and it's those moderation tools that I
think encourage that great behavior that
we see bubbling up into great things
like the philanthropy and the political
work I mean are you doing this on
purpose your segue and perfectly into my
next question I am so so you are so you
are
very active me you guys were very
outspoken on SOPA you are you were
referred to as the mayor of the internet
and as a landslide election you I don't
know but you you guys laugh but he had a
chief of staff here backstage but but
how do you take the kind of rage and
anger and disillusionment that you see
on reddit you know which I feel and I
think a lot of us do when you're like
watching these stupid piece of the
legislation getting pushed and people
kind of who don't get the internet
trying to legislate the internet how do
you take that rage and the stuff that
bubbles up to the front page and turn it
into something that's that they creates
real action how do you go from from
reddit to to activism you know I am not
entirely sure we have your the my sorry
and it took a lot of chickens a ton of
chickens to get that mayorship I all
over the internet I read I don't know I
think I think if you see if you see any
any of the stuff that starts out as a
reddit post and ends it with real world
action again whether it's activism or
philanthropy there's just stuff that
happens it's some person who starts with
a random idea and it starts snowballing
and what the internet does such a great
job of is sort of giving us all ways to
help I use the metaphor to talk a little
all back about everyone getting the
chance to be their own Batman or bat
woman we know there are lots of things
screwed up that we want to try and fix I
create vigilantes take to the streets at
night I only deal violently with
criminal only if they're wearing this
mask what is this you brought this along
because I because I want to carry this
metaphor in the real world because we
all have we all have our little figure
to have Gotham's can we get it yeah oh
yes and this is not promotion for the
film although I highly recommend you all
see it have you seen it no I really no
we don't get accident I think the
entertainment industry does not do me
any favors
there goes my hair yes this is really
comfortable by the way I will say my
eyes supposed to be in Batman's Batman
have bad sight is that what he's like I
think you're the Joker stop me without
committing crimes nice that is that I'll
be using the bedroom later to note is
law protecting the people at the bedroom
obviously from Josh Topolsky but that's
there is no there is this really
empowering thing it just suddenly became
a role play it really is there it that's
the really empowering thing is that you
can be sitting there you know just
yesterday we saw this video of this
woman on a bus up in Queens Newark being
harassed by a bunch of students and 24
hours later after that story that video
front pages on reddit she has literally
two hundred thousand dollars donated to
her from people all over the world who
simply said this is wrong I want to do
something about I got to get harassed is
a lucrative make sure it's videotape
yeah I like this I wish we had more time
oh so much more to talk about well you
know what I'm I was a little bummed I
didn't get to sit down with Lavar but
you know it I you can't disappoint a
picture and maybe it's better that is
fear to meet them that's very mean you
you say Alexis thank you so much thank
you thank you gonna come back is awesome
this is awesome what is this I'm sorry
we need to get to this this is a I'm a
book publisher this this come on started
it's like a Newman's Own foreigner it's
called breadpig we our goal or specified
aims to make the world suck less we
could we get this on camera on camera
and in table show this this is this area
ceremony breakfast cereals so Zack
Wiener wrote this it's a webcomic one
was popular on the Internet we published
the book for him he gets a majority of
the profits it's published under a
Creative Commons license and our profits
all get donated to donorschoose.org
specifically to classroom projects in
math and science now that's not totally
benevolent you know why because little
kids who don't learn about math and
science don't grow up into being the
geeks who will read this book so we can
make more geeks we'll sell more books
it's just the long term I fully support
that go buy this about you right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
