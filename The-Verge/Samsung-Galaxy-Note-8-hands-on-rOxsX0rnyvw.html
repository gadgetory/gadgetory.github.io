back the note so here it is this is the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 coming out very
very soon and I know you're wondering
why did they bring out another note the
last one exploded
well samsung says that they're fans of
the note that are very very passionate
about it and they love them some s-pen
so even though the specs on this phone
are very similar to the Galaxy S 8 plus
there are a few differences with the
s-pen that we need to talk about but
before we get into that there's a bunch
of like standard phone stuff to get into
so let's break this phone down so the
big thing with every single note is that
it has a gigantic screen and on the note
8 it is gigantic
it is 6.3 inches but it's basically the
same tech as you'll see in the galaxy s
8 at si plus so it's 20 960 by 1440 and
18 by 5 by 9 aspect ratio so it's very
very tall but Samsung did a couple of
things differently here if you look at
the curved screen and of course there is
a curved screen it curves a little bit
less than it does on the galaxy s 8 and
si plus and that's so that you have more
writing surface Samsung says they've
also added some better multitasking so
one of the things you could do is you
can launch two apps and pair them
together so in your launcher you will
have like two app icons next to each
other so if you always launch I don't
know messaging and memos you can always
have those pop up at the same time which
is pretty nice not a lot of people do as
much multitasking as they could on these
big phones but having the S 10 to drag
the window size it makes it more
convenient and as long as we're talking
about the S Pen let's show you some of
the other new stuff that you can do so
my favorite new feature is they have
this thing called a live message so
you've happened this some little pop-up
that comes up from the S Pen and you can
start drawing on it but when you draw
the message you can then save it as a
standard animated gif so when you send
it out by you know text message a lo if
you're crazy or whatever messenger
service you're using it will work with
this thing and when it gets received on
the other end
actually get to watch the animation
happen it's kind of similar to what you
can do with an iPhone an iMessage but it
works across basically every single app
and of course the S Pen Stylus does what
sfii have always done if you pull it out
the screen off you can take a note
directly on the off screen although now
on the note eight you can add up to a
hundred pages to your meeting note if
you want which is nice the slightly
larger screen and the S Pen aren't the
only reasons to pick the note eight over
the Galaxy S a plus or the galaxy s 8
the other big reason are the cameras
Samsung is putting dual cameras inside
the note 8 without having a big old
camera bump on them and they're doing a
lot of really cool stuff with these two
lenses so first of all they're both 12
megapixel one is a wide-angle lens and
one is a telephoto lens so you can turn
on dual capture and what that does is it
takes a live focus you can see it got a
blur and everything else going on here
but it also takes both of the wide angle
and the telephoto so you've got
different options so it's Samsung's
flagship phone so you expect flagship
specs and flagship right now means a few
really straightforward things it means
the Snapdragon 835 processor in the US
will use on external stuff out pulse for
in the world it means six gigabytes of
RAM and a default of 64 gigs of storage
in the US but it's expandable with micro
sd on your own it also means that it has
a 3300 milliamp battery we don't know
how long that's going to cause this
thing to last I'm sure that Samsung
would tell you all day we do know that
that battery has gone through Samsung's
brand-new super safe eight step process
to keep explosions from happening and I
do to make explosion jokes and of course
I'm doing it cuz I like doing easy
things but the s8 and the s8 plus
haven't had any problems and so it's
probably safe to assume that this new
Note will not have any problems either
last but not least both the phone and
you know the stylus our ip68 which means
that it is resistant to water and dust
when you drop this thing in the toilet
or you drop the stylus in the toilet
you'll be fine
one more thing that's super interesting
to me because I'm a super nerd Samsung
has updated decks which is this phone
dock that you can plug it into and then
it turns the phone into a computer
you can use it on your monitor with a
keyboard and a mouse it's way faster now
to switching between phone and desktop
is bam bam it used to take them like up
to a minute to make that switch happen
it is basically like a like a Chromebook
or running Android it feels really good
to use you will see there's an extra
button underneath the volume buttons
that is for bixby Samsung's personal
assistant that is designed to help you
figure out how to do stuff on the phone
and not compete directly with Siri and
Google assistant and whatever you can
hold it down to launch pixie voice you
probably can't remap it because you
definitely can't do that on the SA and
the SI plus it's there Samsung's trying
to build an ecosystem and we'll see how
they do with that so what do we know
about the note 8 well we know it's big
it's a note they're really big we know
that it has good performance we know
that it has some really intriguing
cameras that I'm very excited to test
out against current generation iPhones
and even the next generation iPhone we
know it has an S Pen and we know that
it's coming soon and last but not least
in the u.s. we know that it's only
coming in black and gray we may get some
other options in the future but we don't
know yet is a release date or a price
but I anticipate the release date is
very soon and the price is very high are
you done have I moved out of focus I
moved to know a lot of focus ok so if
you pull it out the screen up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
