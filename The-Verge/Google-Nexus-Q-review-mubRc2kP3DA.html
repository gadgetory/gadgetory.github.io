this is Google's Nexus Q set tops fear
thing if I don't sound certain about
what exactly to call it the
functionality isn't much better Google
calls it a social media streamer and
it's an actually powerful device with
very very limited use inside we've got
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich 1
gigabyte RAM 16 gig storage memory and
Wi-Fi and the back to device we have a
optical audio out we've got an Ethernet
port micro HDMI micro USB which we
haven't quite figured out what to do
with yet and a quartet of banana jack
speaker outputs so under the right
conditions setups actually not too bad
all set up and all input actually is
done through an Android device you can
download the Nexus Q remote app in the
Google Play Store however if you have
NFC you can also rub the key with the
device and get a direct link to it not
necessary but kind of fun so here's how
it works once you get the Nexus Q setup
from your Android device what you can do
is you can go to the Google Play Music
Google Play video or YouTube pick a song
pick a video and basically what you're
going to do is you're going to be
telling the Nexus Q to play that video
or audio track here's the catch so with
the Nexus Q is actually doing is
actually going back out into the
internet and grabbing the audio video
file either from YouTube or the Google
Play Store and streaming it afresh you
can still control we're in the time
track the video audio is or you can
adjust the volume but there is actually
no device-to-device media transfer has
all been done on the internet your
Android device is essentially a
glorified remote control for dedicated
media streamer we're actually pretty
disappointed with the quality of the
video itself despite having HD video
sources it looked closer to standard
definition to our eyes and actually did
HD which for $3 fear it's pretty
disappointing as for the audio we're
actually pretty impressed with the
performance the Nexus Q has a 25 watt
amp that's twelve and a half watts per
speaker we plugged in a few unpowered
speaker to see how old we could actually
get the Nexus Q we got to say it's
pretty impressive audio with multiple
Android devices you can actually build
an audio playlist together Google X a
call is something of a party still only
one account can control visualization
settings but everyone guest in master
control within range can add google play
music tracks to a cue with google TV in
the course Samsung's chrome box
Google actually has a couple of other
more compelling set-top box options
the next queue itself is in kind of a
confusing place not really doing that
much and not even doing that much very
well at $209 it's hard to justify a
purchase except for only the most
hardcore of Android fans and even then
their friends all better be Android
phone users as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
