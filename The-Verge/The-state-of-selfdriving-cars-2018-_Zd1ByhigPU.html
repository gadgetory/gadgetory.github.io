right around the corner right
self-driving car technology that sounded
like science fiction just a couple of
years ago is now a reality well not
exactly
every year at CES in Detroit automakers
flock to show us all of their cool weird
self-driving car concepts and this year
wasn't any different we saw weird cars
from Mercedes from Nissan from Toyota
and while the cars are definitely
getting smarter and the technology is
undoubtedly getting better and better
the day when you'll be able to buy one
of these cars or even write in one it's
a lot farther out than you think
so it's 2018 where are we in the world
of self-driving cars the big takeaway
from CES in Detroit that automakers have
stopped talking about demonstrating the
technology or how good the technology is
and started talking about how this
technology is going to be used and how
it's going to make them money and that's
a big deal but it might lead people to
think that they're gonna start seeing
driverless cars rolling down Main Street
any day now they're gonna be very
expensive initially you know especially
you know vehicles that have really
robust systems with redundant computing
systems full sensor Suites of camera
radar and lidar and all the other
features that are going to be part of
these vehicles so there's there's the
cost factor and then there's also
concerns about liability with the
vehicle if something goes wrong and it
almost certainly will I mean we've
already just seen the first lawsuit
filed against the company testing one of
these in San Francisco so there's the
liability concerns and then longer term
you know if you if you look at you know
the traditional model of a manufacturer
sells a car to a consumer or sells it to
a dealer who sells it to a consumer and
then they're basically done with it
except for selling service parts that's
gonna change and we've already seen that
happen with with Tesla with doing
over-the-air software updates that's
gonna be happening with all of these
vehicles going forward and and the whole
model of
support for these vehicles is going to
shift to one of basically lifetime
support for the vehicles because they
are gonna require software updates and
particularly security updates and if you
are just selling the vehicle and getting
revenue for at one time then it's hard
to work out how you gonna how are you
gonna pay for that ongoing support of
the vehicle it's a quick glance at the
show floor here should be a huge wake-up
call to anyone who thinks that this
shift to autonomous cars isn't going to
be incredibly messy its SUVs and trucks
and crossovers as far as the eye can see
Americans are still addicted to giant
gas guzzlers and who can blame them gas
prices are super low right now I mean
car companies are talking about things
like mobility and smart cities and
autonomous cars but it's the Ford f-150s
and the Chevy Silverados that make the
money so I guess the silver lining to
the reality that we live in today where
trucks and SUVs dominate our car culture
is that car companies then take those
profits from these vehicles and pump
them into mobility projects for
autonomous cars and connected cars which
is a good day
so in 2019 we're gonna start to see some
of these projects move into more cities
and then by 2020 we're gonna start
seeing cars without steering wheels or
pedals hit the road fully driverless
cars and that's gonna be a really really
big deal but again it's important not to
get ahead of ourselves it's probably
gonna be primarily urban areas where
there's a high density of travelers San
Francisco will almost certainly be one
of the first markets especially for GM
wouldn't be surprised to see the Phoenix
area be one of way Mo's first markets so
those sorts of environments where you've
got a high density of ridership and that
can operate both as point to point and
first mile last mile services for riders
and then also start to incorporate some
other services that can be used with
these vehicles building these business
models bringing in other partners to
utilize these vehicles when they're not
carrying passengers you you want them
doing some sort of revenue generating
work so Toyota announced they're a
pallette alliance Ford is partnering
with Domino's post mates and lyft and
we'll probably see other similar
when it's coming from the other
companies over the next few months so
that the the vehicles are always doing
something productive and hopefully
revenue generating so meanwhile while
that's happening the cars that we buy
and drive every day are about to get
crazy smart I'm thinking Tesla with
autopilot or Cadillac with supercruise
these highly automated driver assist
systems that basically let people take
their hands off the wheel and their feet
off the pedal and the cars for all
intents and purposes drive themselves
now this is gonna help pave the way to
fully driverless cars the idea being
that as we're driving these really smart
cars we're gonna get more comfortable
with turning over control to our
vehicles and that's gonna help us to get
to a point where hey it's okay to drive
in a completely driverless car because I
feel comfortable at a in this car drive
and so now these are systems that are
only available in pretty high-end luxury
vehicles and the hope is that eventually
they'll start to make their way into
more affordable mass-market vehicles or
else it's only really gonna be available
to rich people and that would suck cars
are an integral part of our society but
they're also really dangerous and it
doesn't hurt to approach this whole
technological shift a little bit more
conservatively look I like self-driving
cars as much as anybody else the idea of
less traffic fewer deaths and less
congestion is I think a great idea but
this is still a long ways away even if
we're just now starting to see what this
huge technology is going to look like
yeah it's just looking for a volume
button could we turn it down a little
bit we're just gonna try to shoot a
video right here and we just want to
maybe a look a little quiet for a sec
that's at all possible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
