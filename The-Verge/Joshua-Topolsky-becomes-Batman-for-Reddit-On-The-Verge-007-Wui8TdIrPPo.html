stuff that starts out as a reddit post
and ends it with real-world action again
whether it's activism or philanthropy
there's just stuff that happens it's
some person who starts at the random
idea and it starts snowballing and what
the internet does such a great job of is
sort of giving us all ways to help I use
the metaphor to talk a little back about
everyone getting the chance to be their
own Batman or Batwoman we know there are
lots of things screwed up that we want
to try and fix like create vigilantes
look take to the streets at night I only
deal violently with criminal only if
they're wearing this mask what is this
you brought this over one piece I
because I want to carry this metaphor in
the real world because we all have we
all have our little figurative Gotham's
can we get it right yet oh yes yes and
this is not promotion for the film
although I highly recommend you all see
it have you seen it no I really does get
access oh no we don't get actually i
think the entertainment industry does
not do me any favors there goes my hair
yes this is really uncomfortable by the
way I will shoot in my eyes it's
supposed to be in that man's Batman have
bad sight is that what's going he's like
I think you're the Joker stock to me
we're always on committee crime</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
