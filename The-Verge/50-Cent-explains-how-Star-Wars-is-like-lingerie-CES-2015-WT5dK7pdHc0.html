here with 50 cent - we're here to talk
about star wars actually thanks for
doing this with us and how this kind of
came about how this new Star Wars lineup
oh I mean the first one they approached
me with the idea of what you know
executives involved with SMS Audio of
going after the license right I was like
that that'd be interesting you know
because I was like it's like 50 cent and
then the geeks g-unit gig doing it all
come together and then what ended up
happening is we was able to work out and
do the due diligence going back and
forth with each other and we did a deal
prior to that with Disney is this
exclusive thing is if we're talking a
headphone star wars is gonna be SMS well
with Disney and all theme parks anything
by Disney related the audio products are
produced by SMS and then because they
have such an extensive search of the
companies that they affiliate themselves
with it was easier for us to do the
license deal with the Lucasfilm film
that's awesome sorry how long ago did
you guys start this process when did
this was a hero's right here
yeah this is the first generation of the
Star Wars okay headsets and then we'll
be eject it for the first quarter okay
we ended up selling in two days just
sold out it yes it's hard to kind of
explain what the kind of passion is
connected to that brand I mean it's been
in since 1975 and the people that people
teach their kids to enjoy it the way
they enjoyed it right now actually let
me ask you about that so uh are you a
big fan of Star Wars I do I join it
what's your favorite Star Wars my
favorite characters movies are later
really always thought waiting why is
that I was a bad guy like that that
energy comes from the bad guy so when
your kid grows up are you gonna make him
watch a Star Wars trilogy is this a
thing it's like look in watches this is
exciting you wanna see this
it's gonna be good I don't like the kids
like they didn't grow up with it so like
it's like do you want that culture part
of theirs like do you want the divorce
around right I think I think did you see
it's the point it's like it's like
buying lingerie
right for women our wars in laundering
the same sentence but I'm I'm gonna hear
you out on glass this metaphor all right
it's a little sophisticated right let's
go from hip-hop we do things a little
different all right all right
Star Wars lingerie lingerie is the thing
that you would buy some a woman for her
tits really feel yeah Star Wars I'm
gonna take you to have a good time and
watch it for him what he's really good
yeah so it doesn't punish me to have to
watch the kid film all right actually
we're gonna wrap up I just want talk
about the headset so these are the first
models some of these right here you get
your r2 you've got your you got your
Vader model right there but when you
feel the difference even in the texture
it's been done completely different to
try and feel like the character the way
people perceive the characters though
yes so how much it is right now how much
he's gonna go for some 199 109 all for
and all these are gonna come out yeah
and we've been able to do some real cool
collaborations as far as like working
with other companies and stuff we got we
got with Intel to create the bio sports
headsets and these these this is without
making it any difference in size they
got 12 millimeter drivers it allows them
to record your heart rate I was easier
these are Fitness ones real time that's
awesome do you use these when you go for
a run
I haven't yet I know I do I really like
over over here right it says on my ear
so it doesn't disappoint for the court
we got a wireless version of this also
to prevent you from pulling the cord off
why you running all right man well
what's next what's next for SMS and
what's next for you when's your next
album big things man I got the BCP
coming out of g-unit the group album and
that we will got back in the record
studio started recording him because it
was five of us it was so the process was
so easy it was so much coming out that I
said we got to put this like this out we
can't like sit on it until we are not
excited about it anymore because that's
how artists the new ideas the good idea
well I guess I said y'all wouldn't sit
here together it wasn't like three all
came in today and everybody there
everyone to get every collaborator I'm
ready ready I gotta put this out like
it's been a long time if you want to
walk out with the I will listen to it
