reporter with the verge and we're here
at the Verge's lounge here in the Las
Vegas Convention Center welcome
everybody we have a very special guest
here this is the CEO of livestream Jesse
Hertzberg
Jesse thanks for coming good morning you
guys had a pretty cool announcement this
week that you basically kicked CES off
with and that was that you guys made a
commercial product a camera that's
actually doing some really cool stuff
and one that I'm really excited to play
with later this year this is the mobi
and why don't you tell me a little bit
how it works
sure so movies the first video camera
from livestream you can use it for
recording or streaming or both
simultaneously
it's a 4k device that is controlled by
an iOS app and what it allows you to do
is from the 4k picture crop up to nine
virtual HD cameras so if the two of us
were say shooting a video clip for the
web instead of having a three camera set
up with a production crew we could use
one movie camera and have someone on the
iOS app and they'd be able to cut to you
cut to me cut wide zoom in on the
product as if there were three cameras
in front of us so you're telling me that
this camera like theoretically you could
take all of my co-workers job someday it
won't take their jobs it obviously isn't
gonna replicate the production quality
right but you have about $70,000 of
equipment here and for most folks that's
out of reach or two rented about five
thousand dollars to rent it for the week
and what this does is put that kind of
power and multi camera storytelling into
the hands of people who can't
necessarily afford it every day so you
take this thing and you can set it on
the table you can put it on a tripod you
can put it on this battery extender here
and you just let it run and then you use
the iPhone or iPad app to just live
direct right correct you hit the record
button or the go live button and then
you just direct live the camera also
will detect faces detect voices and
detect motion so if you want you can put
the app down and the app will auto
direct for you
and it does a pretty good job it'll cut
to whoever's talking if I have a big
reaction it'll cut to me if you talk for
too long it will cut wide if you keep
talking it will cut back to you so you
say low-cost give us an idea how much
it's gonna cost and when people are
gonna be able to go out buy it sure so
the camera is gonna sell for 399 when it
ships in April it's currently available
for pre-order on get movie comm for 199
so that's 50% off during them during the
pre order while supplies last
and then the black device that you see
next to you is the movie boost accessory
the movie boost accessory takes the one
hour battery life of the camera and
extends it to over ten hours so I've
heard you say the word 4k a bunch and
we're here at the Consumer Electronics
Show where a lot of little cameras a lot
of action cameras to or announce always
like 4k there's someone 360-degree video
is there something coming after this are
you guys looking to get in like the
action camera game something with 360
degree or like you focus on events we're
very focused on events were very focused
on those moments when you need your
camera to run for a long time when you
need to capture 30 minutes that 3 hours
of footage in a single the lock shot is
just gonna be really boring to watch for
three hours when you watch TV or when
you watch sports the director uses
multiple cameras to bring you into the
story and to make you feel like you're
at the event and a single lock shot even
when we talked about the Little League
game a single lock shot doesn't
accomplish that
so with movi whether it's an event or a
stage performance or whatnot you can use
those multiple camera shots those
different angles to really bring that
story to life and that's very much what
we're focused on we love our GoPros we
love our iPhone they all have different
purposes and our focus is on events cool
well the camera is called the movie it's
gonna be out later this year
thanks so much to take some time to come
talk to us I can't wait to play around
with it
we get one into the office but thanks
for coming thank you
