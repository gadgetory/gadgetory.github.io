shrine expo hall in Los Angeles
as someone who loves cars I can tell you
this next game is stunning but enough
for me let's check out the return of
need for speed inspired by some of the
most beloved games in the series from
the customization of underground to the
world of carbon cuz the narrative style
our most wanted to the innovation and
vishals of rivals we are bringing 20
years of history together for the
definitive Need for Speed experience
coming over ember third this is the new
need for speed Star Wars the older
public offers RPG gamers the chance to
step into the center of their own Star
Wars saga our fans have told us exactly
what they want in the future more story
Bioware style story with a player driven
arc where choices matter and we've been
listening today I'm proud to announce
that we are taking star wars the old
republic back to the roots of bioware
style storytelling with the release of
our new expansions Knights of the Fallen
Empire it's a puzzle platformer where
you play us a little character made of
yarn which unravels as you move and the
yarn it represents love and the bonds
that we make I need unravels because
that's what happens when we were
separated from what we love in this game
you are the red thread that runs through
someone's life trying to tie all their
missing pieces back together
this is plants vs. zombies garden
warfare 2
team is at the heart of hockey and this
year is at the heart of NHL 16 and
nowhere is that more true than in our
all-new EA Sports hockey league for the
ultimate in team competition this year
we spent more time listening and working
with fans than ever before and that
feedback is helping us create innovation
throughout NHL 16 NBA Live 16 is rooted
in self-expression this comes to life to
both how you look and how you play so
that your entire in-game journey is all
about you now let's take a look at the
beautiful day in FIFA 16
whether you're new to FIFA or play every
season FIFA trainer will help dial up
your game no matter your level the
controller language you see here on
screen will change as you move around
the pitch and bring you options sure to
help you play better defense make better
passes and hopefully score more goals
and this year finally we're giving you
an amazing new way to play for the first
time ever in the fifa franchise women's
teams are in the game let's talk about
mobile it's the single biggest gaming
platform in the world we're delivering
the amazing franchises you love most I'm
excited to announce that later this year
we're bringing you a brand new dcg
role-playing game Star Wars galaxy of
Heroes minions paradise is a builder
game that introduces you to fill a sweet
yet subversive minion whose exclusive to
the game welcome to Mirror's Edge
catalyst this is a revolutionary action
adventure game where you will experience
the origin story of our heroine faith
there are story missions activities like
time trials and races and an
environmental puzzles most importantly
there are no levels there are no loading
screens you are truly free roaming 40
million fantasy sports fans out there
would say that their favorite part of
playing fantasy football is the ability
to draft their own teams okay well we've
got something really exciting for those
fantasy fans it's called draft champions
and it's a brand new way to get the
fantasy draft experience every day
similar to mad mobile and ultimate team
you'll build a current team of a team of
current and legendary players it's all
about interesting decisions and how you
choose to build your team you play with
your team solo or go online that
challenge other players to see how
you're drafting your game stack up
today's NFL is a passing league so we've
overhauled the entire passing game so we
focused on three key positions
quarterbacks receivers and
vendors in coverage today by far the
best place to truly lose yourself and
interact with Star Wars is video games
we will give you the chance to live out
the Star Wars battle fantasies you've
always dreamed of and we can't wait to
see all of the new memories you will
create on your own we have a great
amount of depth a variety of multiplayer
modes that range from large-scale
battles between 40 players all the way
down to 8 player modes that deliver a
more intimate experience and if you're
not in the mood for multiplayer we have
Star Wars bastrop missions where you can
jump in and play against AI alone or
with a friend including split-screen
co-op and one-on-one Parker's star wars
battlefront coming of ember 17 that's
