has facetime video calling and they're
going to enable it over the carrier's
right they're going to Nabal so you can
do it over attn verizon's like mobile
networks and there's rumors that a CT is
going to like charge you for it right as
an additional feature but it's just the
same data yes why that's wrong that's so
that's in your opinion just completely
wrong yeah is there anywhere oh yeah I
agree with you i'm asking is there any
way i think that you that you have a
thing called network management as I
what we call it you have right to do
that and if you're overloading and
crashing because people are using
something that is making that happen you
have right to say you can't do that yeah
we're gonna have to charge you for that
to incentivize not using it also the
deans descent of eyes right but so
listen Simon disincentive your we're
going to punish you ATT should slap you
on the rest and say well for for doing
something that would make our network
crash if everybody did it I could see
that that's network management that I
can I can understand that but that's not
what this is that if this is like tears
and service yes and I that that is not
that's wrong</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
