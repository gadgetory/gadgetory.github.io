we're here at CES unveiled this is the
preview event for the Big Show and
generally we see lots of fun and really
weird stuff here it's kind of like a
smaller event for the rest of CES and
just now I think I saw the weirdest
thing that I could possibly see and that
is the ability to have nilay patel face
printed on my fingernails this is the I
nail intelligent mail system it looks
like a 3d printer it kind of acts like a
3d printer basically you would send a
photo in whenever you want it can be a
Virgil fo could be your cat it could be
at OSU like your favorite sports team
whatever it is and it sends it to the
system
stick your hand in and it starts to
print out basically a custom mail onto
your nails that I couldn't actually
print something out as my nails because
they're already done and you have to
have clean nails to do it but I think
Mila is trying it right now with the
verge logo so we'll have to check out
and see how that looks this is mostly
made for professional nail salons but
there is a consumer version of the
system coming to market at some point
the company says should ship sometime
later this year and we don't have
pricing for you for our CES video
