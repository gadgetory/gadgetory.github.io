Queens at the Museum of the moving image
I'm gonna meet Masi oka from hero's he
was hero in heroes which should give you
a clue about how awesome he was in that
show and he's basically the best human
being on the planet Earth so just know
no big deal oh okay you were involved
with like during the prequels Mother's
Day I was doing other people's as well
yes what software were you making for
them then well you know our main our
main platform was Maya so I wrote a lot
on Maya plugins you know a specific
example might be like we're both at
chases in the asteroids sequence so
basically the production that said and
we need to be able to destroy this
asteroid in a million pieces
but we won't be able to control which
way everything goes you know because an
animator needs to be able to have all
that fine control and when you know when
in ILM when in visual effects you want
to be able to do it so that it's
visually accurate but that's not
necessarily physically active it has to
be physically accurate enough so there's
a lot of communication back and forth
where they want to make something look
you just have to amaze yeah I remember
one shot where we had to be breast
enhancement it's good yeah so say there
was a shot of a breast and the director
wanted it bigger so we had to like wow
digitally enhanced it sounds like really
hard work yes
you I think you right after ILM yeah you
got the job with tears that's like why
you left right
well actually what I started was I went
to San Francisco was their headquarters
I was there and I finished my first big
show there on perfect songs on there
like two or three years okay and I said
you know I loved working here I could
I'm a life I could stay here so that
meant that was a sign for me to leave so
I came down to LA and you know I ran out
money very quickly right sounds like oh
 yeah I got to do something about my
financial situation but then my mom said
you know what if you're gonna look for
jobs elsewhere want you to stay working
for us you could kalakeya for us in that
way Wow so that was that was very nice
to them and then but I had to sign at
this contract saying if I didn't get a
recurring role on a pilot or a
supporting role in a film they my first
year in LA I would have to move back up
to San Francisco
I feel like heroes was this realization
that you could do movie level effects
now on a TV show
I was that pretty big leap forward but I
actually think you know before that you
know lost did a great job of making come
bring something cinematic yeah
especially when you tell a serie live
show it goes that but with that always
comes budget you know I think right now
if we did heroes you know we could do it
on a but you a slightly cheaper budget
and if you get you know it's going to
get better and better
do you have any of these growing up I
actually didn't have a lot of the
figures you know I only wanna how does
that do it at the Cape I don't even know
it's great because there's all these
fans of that world you know and and to
have people who are so passionate about
it but it's also you know it's it's upon
the filmmakers you know my former boss
George you know he if he needs to take
care of that pan you know these days is
getting to a point that I feel like
she's milking every cent the possible
which is uh yeah I get it's a business
you know
you know he's he was a Great Creator
when he created the the first Star Wars
you know we create something
revolutionary if you see the original
original Star Wars yeah there's a lot of
interesting mistakes he saw all these
mistakes when he when he first created
right so he had ILM
through an entire path at the movie
right and makes little changes so were
you there at the time yeah they're like
those projects like just like simple
things like putting their badges here
here you know there's actually a fan
project to restore the original cut
because you can't buy in high-definition
and original cuts of the movie so
they're like they're tried to undo you
they're reverse engineering your work
you know is there's a reason why it was
a classic of that yeah yeah I think you
need to embrace him mistakes as well
yeah there's always gonna be minted even
this shoot right now like I was wearing
a watch do you have action figures of
yourself
well no my action figure was like really
you know loosely made so the head would
always come off oh there's like oh
that's kind of a like a disc I have a
confession I bought the first two cen
the first two seasons and I saw the
first episode of the third Isis I walked
away I totally understand okay with that
I think so I think the first season of
that show was absolutely insane you know
as a fan myself I was a fan of the show
yeah we were so proud and yet everybody
around the world you know there was a
phenomenal without yeah I'm very proud
of the work we can receive do you do you
think there's something to that where
you get a back lot Lego Star Wars
because the first season or the first
movie was so good and fans just expect
that greatness throughout and they get
mad when that's not met yes I mean it's
a little bit difficult at the same time
that's our job you know I think unique
you take a bowl
you know choice make a bold choice in a
c50 and sometimes it works and sometimes
it didn't did you play emulated game I
play melee games yeah absolutely
I spent so much Porter's are like
gauntlet so I kind of
go back oh that's I played some gauntlet
that thing is designed it to make so
much money I realize that but each other
yeah where do you see yourself going
you're direct
uh yeah I think ultimately I left at the
wreck I love the collaborative nature
behind the scenes I also like being in
front of camera so I think direction
directing seems to be a natural kind of
weird
culminating all the experience that I've
had I mean you know you've got sort of
all angles of the craft I try it you
have a you thing you have a blind spot
you got you all I have so many flies
buzz I you know this life this is a
continuing education you can always be
one yeah I could be like nine years old
and I could still be learning stuff yeah
and that's what's kind of fun I enjoy
knowledge I can I create new stuff I
love exploration in it you know it's
constant learning something new every
game which is great that's cool thank
you so much oh thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
