it's a cruise ship one of the biggest in
the world it's called quantum of the
Seas and the five-year project to build
it had one explicit goal to create the
most advanced most impressive most
insanely futuristic cruise ship ever
cruises are a battered industry with a
reputation for only catering to retirees
with gray hair and an unquenchable
thirst for shuffleboard and bingo but
Royal Caribbean the company behind
quantum of the Seas has other ideas
it thinks it can build a cruise ship for
a new connected generation
welcome to the cruise of the future the
most important thing about quantum of
the Seas the place Royal Caribbean
started isn't the Xbox arcade or the
Jamie Oliver restaurant it's the Wi-Fi
that's what chief information officer
Bill Martin's been thinking about for
five years the game was over in terms of
building the largest so that's not the
game anymore what we want is
technological advancement we want the
most energy-efficient ship on the planet
we're building an infrastructure a
foundation a base if you will that
allows the guests to experience the
vacation in a much more seamless way
whether that be the cruise planner in
advance what does that be getting on the
ship right away being online and sharing
with friends because that's what you're
used to doing getting into a dining
restaurant you know when you head don't
have a reservation all of these things
just add to the experience and make it
that much easier one of the things I
think about what this boat is is getting
new people and that seems like people
what people are talking about people who
might not otherwise think about cruises
is an option for a vacation so is that
like what it is one big piece of it but
that millennial generation doesn't know
what it's like to be disconnected they
share everything they want to be online
so on board the ship we have three
antennas and one is tracking across the
sky the closest satellite that is
currently overhead and about every hour
we switch we do what we do a hop we
refer to it as fiber from the sky and
because it's a concentrated beam we're
getting more than 600 megabits of
capacity in our industry we have always
had to overcharge for Internet access
because we had so little capacity and so
much demand that we had to find a way to
manage that
the man down you have to price because
we have to price it out that's exactly
right but now we can charge what a hotel
charges I was in the North Star two days
ago there were three people holding
their phone up talking to someone back
home facetiming Wow and this is for me
this is the coup de Gras of the
broadband access I'm particularly
curious about the virtual about games
which seem like to me one of those
things that somebody would bring up in a
meeting at the very beginning of the
process and somebody would go that'll
never work and then you just never even
try it we got the idea of an 80 inch
high-definition screen tilt it up on its
side put it in a false wall put some
curtains around it and stitch in it on
its way to the cabin the balcony railing
position just right with the glass and
the floor of the balcony the key to
making it work it's about the motion
just like a ship's move and if what
you're looking at doesn't match the
motion you're feeling it doesn't work
but you can't do anything else with it
because if you do anything else on that
screen you lose the illusion for Royal
Caribbean to be able to offer a
week-long cruise in which you'll never
be out of touch is a big deal if Bill
Martin did it right passengers are going
to have all sorts of new free time on
this ship but they're on a ship what are
they supposed to do on quantum of the
Seas there are hundreds of answers to
that question the longest lines on the
ship during our cruise were for the
North Star a little bulb of a room that
gets lifted 300 feet above sea level
then casually swings out over the water
it's more of an observation deck than a
ride but the views are outrageous
there's also no other cruise ship in the
world that lets you sky dive in a wind
tunnel
that's what ripcord by iFly lets you do
on the fifteenth deck of quantum of the
Seas as it's done many times before
Royal Caribbean took something that's
cool on land and made it insane on a
ship so I put on a big blue suit that
really made me look very cool put on
earplugs and goggles and got into a
chute with 75 mile-per-hour winds and
incredible ocean views I would have
taken a selfie but then I would have
crashed into something and probably died
this whole ship is beautiful it's new
and it's shiny there are restaurants
shops a basketball court a big pink bear
named Felicia one attraction in
particular though had
talking and taking selfies it was the
Bionic bar bars are obviously important
to a cruise but the Bionic bar has a lot
more going on than just liquor service
it started as a project at MIT with this
man
Michael Lewis and a team of people who
actually weren't thinking about alcohol
at all the initial conception of the
project wasn't necessarily let's make a
bar correct right
so the group does work and how emerging
technology changed everyday life so the
point of doing this was to introduce
industrial manufacturing to the masses
you basically go to a digital device and
create something in the digital world
that comes to life in the material world
it's more like a 3d printer than like
anything to do with the bar so you could
have done anything but you picked
alcohol cuz everybody likes something
basically yep these same kinds of robots
are the ones that design cars and
factories so how do you go about taking
those robots and turning them into
something that can like shake and pour
your drinks the robots have very refined
motions these particular ones have one
millimeter degree of accuracy promotion
and they're done in all kinds of
environments upside down sideways one
element of their motion is based on the
motions of the events of all day he's
one of the world's leading ballet
dancers we recorded his motion and that
motion has been programmed into the
robotic arm it gives them more of a
human crew attitude to the motion is the
Tom Cruise cocktail of the shake so
there's more to this than just the
robots oh yes thank you sort of the
whole story of the process here so the
process begins on a tablet if you scan
your RFID like that about it
so that first asks for your birth year
this is both to verify your age being
over 21 and also to authenticate who you
are
in case someone were to steal your your
ID badge he couldn't just order a drink
or anything else on the ship and you and
there's two options you can choose from
a preset menu or do create your own
drinks let's choose one we don't have a
Cosmo I'm into it
so you Add to Cart okay then you order
so this sends it into the network
the robots retrieve the order tell your
waiting time
the robots know how to assemble the
ingredients for the drink they shake or
stir per your request there are
therefore conveyer belts and there's a
display that shows both where you are in
the queue and which drink is being made
you tap your RFID to which conveyor
you're on and the drink comes out to you
what have you learned from being part of
this whole process one is that the
future really is here is it go more into
the 21st century this sort of technology
is becoming more and more commonplace
things that we saw in the Jetsons
decades ago now are commonplace in the
real world so you're saying I will have
one of these in my living wills a
mexican-themed promise dress here's what
quantum of the Seas gets really crazy
the robot bar isn't even the most
futuristic thing about this ship that
distinction belongs to 270 a two-story
room at the apse of the ship that kind
of defies description
Royal Caribbean's VP of entertainment is
Nick Weir and he's been working on 270
since he started at the company it has
well it has everything
what's this sort of grand vision for
this room so 270 is designed to be the
ultimate multi-purpose menu by day it is
a living room but inside that we have
all this theatricality like a robotic
animated entertainment this image right
now behind us is made up of 18 images
and they're all overlapped and you get
one big large shot these 18 projectors
need to be controlled by one central
brain and that's what the cool Lux does
we can also open the whole thing up and
look at the view of the Atlantic that's
also pretty cool what was the goal with
the robots like you started anyway we
want to build a robot
well I mean the idea actually came from
believe it or not the people who make
our propellers somewhere in some bar in
some town a conversation was had between
people who build our ships and ABB and
they said we've got this idea for
robotics that we can put animation on so
that they move you know robot normally
goes from A to B as fast as it can
what these robots do is they see 30
frames of animation so we use the same
program that DreamWorks use Maya
and so when a robot moves in a second it
actually has 30 30 moves in a second
okay and so you get this organic flow is
there anything you could like learn from
or lean on to get inspiration for this
or were you just really kind of
inventing it and every bending it at
every step so normally you just your
task is to do it and in this case you've
got to create the science for getting it
done first so we had to figure out of
the whole thing how do you move a robot
in 3d how do you put a payload on it
that's a video screen and then on top of
the screen you put custom content so the
idea is when you move the robot this way
you create content that's also moving
and that creates the illusion of this
fluid motion this theaters closer to
NASA than Broadway by using the robotics
and the high-definition screen we're
going to try and create an experience
that's pretty much the same as life yeah
or better wow that's that's a that's a
big goal why not
the holy grail is can we have a room
full of people listening and dancing to
an orchestra that aren't actually on
board and you know that's that's kind of
the beginning of a whole new world I've
only been on a cruise once before a few
years ago it was cold and windy and
there really wasn't anything to do
except go to the casino and lose a
blackjack while drinking overpriced beer
quantum of the Seas isn't like that
we were on the ship for two full days
and hardly even scratched the surface of
what there is to do it's like a mall and
a five-star hotel all in one except
everything's moving a little all the
time and the rooms are really small but
none of that really matters because
you're not going to be spending any time
in your room while you're on classmen
that sees you are going to be skydiving
