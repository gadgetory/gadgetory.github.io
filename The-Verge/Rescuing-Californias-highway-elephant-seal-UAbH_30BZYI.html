to cross the road?
Honestly no one knows. There was nothing
but a hay field on the other side.
The female elephant seal  swam up the San
Francisco Bay to the San Pablo Bay and
and from there
up Tolay Creek and it was around highway
37 and Sonoma County under which the
creek passes that she decided to cross
the road. The seal was dubbed Tolay by rescue
workers and Bathsheba after the
biblical bathing beauty by local Twitter
users. We' ll split the difference and
call her Bathsheba de Tolay. The rescue
effort started on Monday December 29
when the California Highway Patrol
received reports of a seal blocking a
lane of traffic on Highway 37.
The elephant seals appearance and refusal to
leave the road caused a sensation on
social media. Elephant seals are
relatively docile but stubborn.
Nine hundred-pound animals pretty much do
what they want. Maybe that's what people
like. She couldn't stay: no food, no shelter,
and a highway nearby. So rescue workers
from the Marine Mammal Center tried to
shoo her down the creek towards open water
using a kayak but she was having none
of it and bit the boat. It wasn't clear
what she was up to or why she was there
said Barbie Halaska of the Marine Mammal
Center. Perhaps she was looking for a
place to give birth,
maybe she was just confused.
Late Tuesday around 2:30 p.m. the seal
swim under the highway
using a viaduct to get to the other side
of the road there she flopped onto land
where rescuers were finally able to
corner her and poke her with the pole
mounted tranquilizer. At first it didn't
seem to faze her then she collapsed. That's
when rescuers were able to take blood
and tissue samples which confirmed she
was pregnant.Then they loaded her onto a
truck and drove her to Point Reyes National
Seashore to be released. So long Bathsheba de Tolay.
Good luck with the other tide.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
