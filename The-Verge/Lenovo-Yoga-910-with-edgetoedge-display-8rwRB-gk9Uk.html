we're here at Lenovo Aoife in Berlin and
they've just announced the yoga 910
essentially this is the upgrade and the
successor to the yoga 904 last year and
we all notice immediately is the screen
and so it's gone up it used to be a 13.3
inch display now it's the thirteen point
nine inch display and because of that
you've now got a five mil bezel all
around the outer edges of this laptop
what that means is it's essentially
lenovo trying to sort of take on the XPS
13 really and they'll did that last year
and lenovo has gone a little bit thin on
the bezels and it looks just as stunning
and you get this screen it's thirteen
point nine inch and you can get it in a
4k option or Full HD and that those sort
of the two models that are lenovo really
going with here and apart from that it's
pretty much the same sort of yoga you
can obviously go flat turn it over into
tablet mode or into what they call tent
mode all the same stuff as you'd expect
on any any yoga really so the only other
sort of major change is the webcams
position down here and on the Dell
they've got a position in the bottom
left if we open up the camera app real
quick you can see you still get like
kind of unsightly angles up your
nostrils but you also get like a really
thick bezel along here but that's kind
of a choice that Lenovo made just as a
trade-off really one more sort of major
edition and it's the fingerprint reader
it supports Windows hello so let you
login from the lock screen just by
swiping your finger like so maybe also
be excusing websites apps anything else
that windows for those supported on
Windows 10 there it also got a USB
type-c on the side here and we still got
the USBs on e on either side and so not
much has changed there it's going to
come with the latest Intel KB late
processor you get to a core i7 up to 16
gig of ram and up to one terabyte of SSD
inside and that's a real quick look at
Lenovo yoga 9 10 if you want to check
