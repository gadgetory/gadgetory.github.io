joining us we are an important
inflection point in computing and it's
exciting to be driving technology
forward and very excited about how we
can approach our mission with renewed
vigor thanks to the progress we see in
AI Healthcare is one of the most
important fields AI is going to
transform if you go and analyze over
hundred thousand data points per patient
more than any single doctor could
analyze we can actually quantitatively
predict the chance of readmission 24 to
48 hours before earlier than traditional
methods
it gives doctors more time to have
another example of a one of our core
products which we are redesigning with
AI is Gmail we call it smart compose so
as the name suggests we use machine
learning to start suggesting phrases for
you as you type all you need to do is to
hit tab and keep order completing
we are rolling out smart composed to all
our users this month and hope you enjoy
using it as well so we are bringing a
new feature called suggested actions say
for example you went to a wedding and
you're looking through those pictures we
understand your friend Lisa is in the
picture and we offer to share the three
photos with Lisa and with one click
those photos can be sent to her by the
way I can also deliver unexpected
moments so for example if you have this
picture cute picture of your kid we can
make it better we can drop the
background color pop the color and make
the kid even cuter or if you happen to
have a very special memory something in
black and white maybe of your mother and
grandmother we can recreate that moment
in color and make that moment even more
real all these features are going to be
rolling out to Google photos uses in the
next couple of months and today I'm
excited to announce our next generation
TPU 3.0 these chips are so powerful that
for the first time we've had to
introduce liquid cooling in our data
centers so we both Harvard wavenet and
we are adding as of today six new voices
to the Google assistant let's have them
say hello
good morning everyone I'm your Google
assistant
welcome to Shoreline Amphitheatre we
hope you'll enjoy Google i/o back to you
sundar let's be honest it gets a little
annoying to say hey Google everytime I
want to get my assistants attention now
you won't have to say hey Google every
time we call this continued conversation
and it's been a top feature request our
kids learning to be bossy and demanding
when they can just say hey Google to ask
for anything they need now we've been
consulting with families and child
development experts and we plan to offer
pretty please as an option for families
later this year let's say you want to
ask Google to make you a haircut
appointment on Tuesday between 10:00 and
noon what happens is the Google
assistant makes the call seamlessly in
the background for you the amazing thing
is the assistant can actually understand
the nuances of conversation we've been
working on this technology for many
years it's called Google duplex it
brings together all our investments over
the years and natural language
understanding deep learning
text-to-speech by the way when we are
done the assistant can give you a
confirmation notification saying your
appointment has been taken care of we
gave you an early look at our new smart
displays at CES in January we're working
with some of the best consumer
electronic brands and today I'm excited
to announce that the first smart
displays will go on sale in July from
staying in touch with family with
broadcasts and do a video colleague to
keeping an eye on your home with all of
our other smart home partners to seeing
in advance what the morning commutes
like with Google map
we're thoughtfully integrating the best
of Google and working with developers
and partners all around the world to
bring boys and visuals together in a
completely new way for the home with the
new Google News we set out to help you
do three things first keep up with the
news you care about second understand
the full story and finally enjoy and
support the sources you love we're
rolling out on Android iOS and the web
in a hundred and twenty seven countries
starting today Android p AI underpins
the first of three themes in this
release which are intelligence
simplicity and digital wellbeing what
Android P we partnered with deep mind to
work on a new feature we call adaptive
battery it's designed to give you a more
consistent battery experience and then
with this understanding the operating
system adapts to your usage patterns so
that it spends battery only on the
absent services that you care about
adaptive brightness learns how you like
to set the brightness slider given the
ambient lighting and then does it for
you in a power efficient way what
Android P we're going beyond simply
predicting the next act to launch to
predicting the next action you want to
take we call this feature after actions
slices are a new API for developers to
define interactive snippets of the wrap
UI that can be surfaced in different
places in the OS if I type lift into the
Google Search app I now see a slice from
the lift app installed on my phone lift
is using the slice api's rich array of
UI templates to render a slice of their
app in the context of search and then
lift is able to give me the price for my
trip to work and the slice is
interactive so I can order the ride
directly from it pretty nice I'm really
excited to announce ml kit a new set of
API is available through firebase with
ml kit you get on device api's to text
recognition face detection image
labeling and a lot more and ml kit also
supports the ability to
to Google's cloud-based ml technologies
we think we can help users with their
digital well-being in four ways we want
to help you understand your habits focus
on what matters switch off when you need
to and above all find balance with your
family in Android we actually give you
we're going to give you full visibility
into how you're spending your time the
apps where you're spending your time the
number of times you unlock your phone on
a given day the number of notifications
you God and we're gonna really help you
deal with this better Android P we'll
show you a dashboard of how you're
spending time on your device we're
making improvements to do not disturb
mode to silence not just the phone calls
and texts but also the visual
interruptions that pop up on your screen
we've created a new gesture that we've
affectionately codenamed
shush if you turn your phone over on the
table it automatically enters do not
disturb so you can focus on being
present no pings vibrations or other
distractions Android P will help you set
up a list of contacts that can always
get through to you with a phone call
even if Do Not Disturb is turned on so
we created wine download you can tell
the Google assistant what time you aim
to go to bed and when that time arrives
it will switch on do not disturb and
fade the screen to grayscale today we're
announcing Android P beta and with
efforts in Android or EO to make OS
upgrades easier Android P beta is
available on Google pixel and seven more
manufacturer flagship devices today
Maps was built to assist everyone
wherever they are in the world we're now
able to automatically add new addresses
businesses and buildings that we extract
from street view and satellite imagery
directly to the map this is critical in
rural areas in places without formal
addresses and in fast changing cities
like Lagos here where we've literally
changed the face of the map in the last
few years we're adding a new tab to maps
called for you it's designed to tell you
what you need to know about the
neighborhood's you care about new places
that are opening what's trending now and
personal recommendations we've created a
score called your mash to help you find
more places that you'll love your match
use machine learning to combine what
Google knows about hundreds and millions
of places with the information that I've
added restaurants I've rated cuisines
I've liked and places that I've been to
share the list with your friends to get
their input too you can easily share
with just a couple of taps on any
platform that you prefer then my friends
can add more places if they want to or
just vote with one simple click so we
can quickly choose a group favorite so
now instead of copying and pasting a
bunch of links and sending text back and
forth decisions can be quick easy and
fun what if the cameras can help us
answer questions questions like where am
I going
or what's that in front of me our teams
have been working really hard to combine
the power of the camera the computer
vision with street video and maps to
reimagine walking navigation you can
start to see nearby places so you see
what's around you
and just for fun our team's been playing
with an idea of adding a helpful guide
like that there so that you can show you
the way
VPS visual positioning system that can
estimate precise positioning and
orientation we think the camera can also
help you do more with what you see
that's why we started working on google
lens oh that cute dog in the park
that's a labradoodle lens can now
recognize and understand words with
smart text selection you can now connect
the words you see with the answers and
actions you need so you can do things
like copy and paste from the real world
directly into your phone the next
feature I want to talk about is called
style match and the idea is this
sometimes your question is not what's
that exact thing instead your question
is what are things like it you're at
your friend's place you check out this
trendy looking lamp and you want to know
things that match that style and now
lens can help you so the last thing I
want to tell you about today is how
we're making lens work in real time so
as you saw in the style match example
you start to see you open the camera and
you start to see lens surface
proactively all the information
instantly and it even anchors that
information to the things that you see
but we're very excited that starting
next week lens will be integrated right
inside the camera app on the pixel the
new LG g g7 and a lot more devices today
wham-o is the only company in the world
with a fleet of fully self-driving cars
with no one in the driver's seat on
public roads Phoenix will be the first
stop for way Mo's driverless
transportation service which is
launching later this year soon everyone
will be able to call way mo using our
app and a fully self-driving car will
pull up with no one in the driver's seat
to whisk them away to their destination
and within a matter of months we reduce
the error rate for detecting pedestrians
by 100x that's right not a hundred
percent but a hundred times now at way
mo AI touches every part of our system
from perception to prediction to
decision-making to mapping and so much
more now to be a capable and safe driver
our cars need a deep semantic
understanding of the world around them
our vehicles need to understand and
classify objects interpret their
movements reason about intent and
predict what they will do in the future
and today I want to tell you about two
areas where AI has made a huge impact
perception and prediction a
traditionally in computer vision neural
networks are used just on camera images
and video but our cars have a lot more
than just cameras we also have lasers to
measure distance and shapes of objects
and radars to measure their speed and by
applying machine learning to this
combination of sensor data we can
accurately detect pedestrians in all
forms in real time our fleet has
self-driven more than 6 million miles
and public roads and at Weymouth
we use the tensorflow ecosystem and
Google's data centers including TP use
to train our neural networks and with
GPUs we can now train our nets up to 15
times more efficiently I can't wait to
make our self-driving cars available to
more people moving us closer to a future
where roads are safer easier and more
accessible for everyone thanks everyone
it's a great reminder of how AI can play
a role in helping people in new ways all
the time and I hope you all find some
inspiration in the next few days to keep
building good things for everyone thank
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
