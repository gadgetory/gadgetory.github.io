flagship smartphone it's got a familiar
name but the new Moto X promises to be
everything last year's device was and
more a new Moto X available later this
month for $99 on contract or $4.99
unlocked is instantly recognizable
echoing the look of last year's model
and the Moto G and E but virtually
everything has been improved this time
around from the design to the materials
to the specs inside the phone last
year's phone at a 720p 4.7 inch display
but this year motorola has stepped up to
a 5.2 inch full 1080p panel it's bigger
brighter sharper and just overall better
than last year's screen colors are
bright and punchy and viewing angles are
great it's also easy to see outdoors in
sunlight above and below the screen our
new grills for the earpiece and speaker
and now on the front of the phone it's
not the dual speaker stereo setup of HD
sees one but the front speaker is loud
and easy to hear the speakers are
flanked by a series of light sensors a
front facing camera and a new set of IR
sensors but like last year the front of
the phone is mostly display allowing
Motorola to fit a larger screen in a
smaller size frame than other phone it's
not quite the one-handed ergonomic
miracle that last year's Moto X was but
the new phone doesn't feel nearly as
large as I expected it to along the
entire edge of the Moto X is an all-new
metal band it looks great feels great
and actually serve the purpose Motorola
is using it to enhance reception and
signal quality sure enough I found it
grabbed on to 18 T's LTE network better
than other phones in the same area but
most importantly the new metal rim makes
the Moto X feel much more like the
flagship phone it should be and it's a
great improvement over last year's
plastic the volume rocker and power
button are still a little too small but
the power key is now textured making it
easier to find by feel the back of the
phone has the same sloped curvature as
motor oil as other phones making it
comfortable to hold its thinner at the
edge and the trademark dimpled finger
rest is much larger and more prominent
my review as an optional bamboo finish
which is grippy organic and just plain
cool-looking and Motorola is offering a
number of other customizable options
including all-new leather backs to its
Moto maker program above the dimple is a
new 13 megapixel camera with a dual LED
flash in a mock ring flash configuration
but that's the hardware story it looks
familiar but it's been improved in a
number of ways and makes the new Moto X
an attractive and comfortable phone to
use despite its much bigger display the
Moto X is shipping with Android 4.4
KitKat and Motorola's promise it will be
updated to Android L when that's
released like last year this is about as
pure an Android experience as you can
get outside of Google's own Nexus phones
that's fine by me it's clean easy to use
and fast it's really how I wish most
Android phones were
Motorola's own software features are now
combined into one single app for
management the always listening voice
feature is now called moto voice and it
lets you set your own command to
activate it instead of requiring you to
use it okay Google you could do more
with your voice like send whatsapp
messages or post a Twitter and Facebook
and The Voice Actions are much faster
than a last year's phone but it's still
kind of trouble hearing me if it's noisy
in my environment active notifications
is now called moto display and it uses
the new IR sensors on the front of the
phone to let you peek at the time or
notifications by just waving your hand
over the screen
it's a neat trick similar to Nokia's
glance feature but since a moto display
lights up on its own with every incoming
notification or whenever I pick up the
phone I really didn't find much use for
it last year's Moto X had an older
slower processor but that's not the case
this year motorola is using the same
snapdragon 801 processor found in the
HTC One m8 and Galaxy s5 and the new
Moto X just flies it's snappy responsive
and has little to no visible lag
Motorola claims it can maintain a
consistent 60 frames per second in the
interface and while I'm not really sure
that's entirely true this is definitely
one of the fastest and smoothest Android
phones I've ever used the new 13
megapixel camera is better than last
year's 10 megapixel model but it's not a
giant leap forward it's really fast
almost as fast as my iPhone 5s but the
images are still grainy and blurry and
medium to low light and the focus can be
unreliable even in good light I didn't
find the ring flash to be much better or
different than any other smartphone
flash either battery life was a bit of
concern last year it was good but not
great and it's slightly better this year
the battery's a little bigger 2300
versus 2200 milliamp hours and Motorola
says it will last a normal day of use
the Moto X isn't quite as long lasting
as the LG g3 the one mA or galaxy s5 but
I was able to get a full day out of it
between charges last year's Moto X was a
well received phone but it wasn't a
great seller this time around motorola
has an even better phone a phone that
can go toe-to-toe on paper and in
practice with the best from Samsung HTC
and even Apple it's the best Android
phone and one of the best smartphones
I've ever used
now Motorola just has to get people to
buy it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
