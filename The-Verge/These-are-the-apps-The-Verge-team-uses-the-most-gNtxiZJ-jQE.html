that one must-have, save-your-life app,
whether it's for the weather, for music,
for making sure you have something
to read or listen to on
the train, you need it.
Let's talk about those apps.
I grabbed bunch of my friends
around The Verge office
and we're going to tell you about our app
that one you can't live without
and think everyone else ought to have.
(upbeat music)
- The one app I recommend to
almost everyone is &quot;Hopper&quot;
and it's a must have if
you travel a lot like me.
It's a free app on iOS and Android
for finding the cheapest flights
to your favorite vacation spots.
Using &quot;Hopper&quot;, I was able
to book a 333 dollar trip
to Paris in February and
a 575 dollar trip to China
in September while being sure
that there were no other flights out there
that are better deals.
The quality of the flights weren't bad,
even though they were certainly
on airlines I had never heard of before.
It's also difficult to cancel your flights
and there's often a fee involved,
so it's definitely
something to be aware of.
I recommend using the app
to monitor flights you have your eye on
and keep notifications on
so you won't miss your
chance to snag the deals.
Friends often ask me how much I flew for
and they're always shocked at the price,
so it's a great conversation starter too.
- The app I recommend for
everyone is &quot;Google Photos&quot;.
I needed to free up
some space on my iPhone
because my photos and videos
were taking up too much room,
so &quot;Google Photos&quot; was the answer.
The app automatically
imported over three years
of photos and videos to Google's
Cloud when I downloaded it,
and now I have a ton of space on my phone.
It's free for iOS and Android users
and I highly recommend using it for iPhone
so that you don't have to
pay for extra iCloud storage.
You can make albums and
edit photos from the app
and it automatically scans your photos
and figures out what's in them
and then you can search
for a specific thing
and pull up all the photos of that thing.
I kind of hate that Google
knows everything about me,
my friends, my family, basically
everything I've ever seen
or taken a photo of in my entire life,
but it's really convenient and it's free,
so really it does everything
I'd ever need a photo app
to do, just, please Google,
don't ever charge me.
- Like probably everyone watching,
I use my phone to take a lot of photos
and your default camera app is great
if you want to take
photos quickly and easily
but using a third-party alternative
gives you a lot more control.
My favorite of these is called &quot;Halide&quot;.
It's got a great interface
that lets you swipe up and down
to quickly change exposure levels
and swipe left and right to manually focus
and it also has a number of
helpful little UI features
that let you frame your shots just so.
Now if you want to take
your smartphone photography
to the next level then
&quot;Halide&quot; can also be set
to take raw files, which
retain a lot more data
than their jpeg
counterparts that's perfect
if you want to get into photo editing.
I've been using &quot;Halide&quot; for
about 8 months or so now,
and I've taken some shots
that I'm pretty happy with.
- My favorite app is &quot;Splitwise&quot;
which tracks and splits expenses
between roommates and friends.
I tend to be the roommate who restocks
all the cleaning supplies
or household items,
so I use &quot;Splitwise&quot; all of the time.
And it's super easy to use.
First, you create a group with
your friends or roommates,
then whenever someone in the
group makes a related purchase,
like paying the gas bill,
they just add the expense
to the group and &quot;Splitwise&quot;
automatically divvies it up
between everyone in the group.
As more people add different expenses,
the app will add or subtract the amount
each individual owes or is owed.
And say you don't want
to split the expense
with everyone in the group?
There's an option for selecting
who in the group you want
to split the expense with.
You can also link it to your Venmo account
so paying someone is super easy.
But &quot;Splitwise&quot; doesn't let you request
Venmo payments via the app.
&quot;Splitwise&quot; is free and it's available
on both Android and iOS and
I would highly recommend it
to everyone, especially
if you're the person
always paying down your card.
- All right, so for me
that one app is &quot;Dark Sky&quot;
and I feel like a broken record
because I've already
told everyone in my life,
like five times that they
have to use this thing
but I'm gonna say it again
because it's so good.
&quot;Dark Sky&quot; is a tiny little weather app
that emerged from a Kickstarter campaign
and it does one thing way, way better
than any other weather app out there.
Tell you when it's going to rain.
And I mean way better.
It tells you the time, down to the minute.
It's able to do this by
determining the speed
and direction of a storm
and then projecting where its going
to move in the minutes ahead.
So let's open it up and check it out.
Right up top here, first thing,
it shows you the current temperature.
But what's important
is right in the middle,
this wobbly blue chart.
This is a projection
of how much it's going
to rain during the next hour.
You can see if it's going
to drizzle or downpour
and you can see if it's about
to ramp up or trail off.
The app will explain below
when it expects the rain
to start and stop, telling
you down to the minute.
But I think it's this graph
that's truly a lifesaver.
Sometimes you're just stuck in a storm,
maybe it just starts to drizzle,
and you're wondering,
&quot;Do I book it out of here
or do I wait it out?&quot;
Well, even if it's not
going to stop raining,
you might see a spot where
it's slowing down enough
that you can make a dash out to your car.
The app can also send you
a reminder in the morning
to bring your umbrella right
before you leave for work
if it sees that it's likely to rain.
It can send you a heads up
just before a storm is about
to start at any time during the day too.
I have it set to warn me
any time there's going
to be a moderate amount of rain.
If you really want to get nerdy,
the app lets you dive
in and use storm systems
and wind patterns too, so
you can kind of feel out
how your area's going to be affected.
The app is available for
both iOS and Android.
On iOS it's a flat four-dollar fee.
On Android, you can try
it for free for two weeks
and after that it's three dollars a year.
I often feel like I've gotten
more practical utility out
of &quot;Dark Sky&quot; than out of
any other app on my phone
and that might be an exaggeration,
but the point is every
time I open this app,
it's actually helping me out,
and that's pretty awesome.
(upbeat music)
I want to thank Shannon,
Jon, Ashley and Mariya
for sharing all these apps with me.
If you have a must-have, must-share app,
let us know down below
because we definitely want
to hear more and let us
know if you have any tips
for the apps that we're already into,
since there's always more to find.
And, if you haven't already, be sure
to subscribe to The Verge
because we're gonna have a ton
more tech videos coming out.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
