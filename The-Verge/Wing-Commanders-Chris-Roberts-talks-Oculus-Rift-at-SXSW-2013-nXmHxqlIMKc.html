at South by Southwest and I am here with
chris Roberts he's the mastermind behind
the wing commander series he just got
done with the oculus rift panel
basically talked about how Burt rally
will make space exploration in the
future in the fantasy setting even
better so how did you get involved with
the oculus basically the project uh well
essentially I mean I got involved like I
think that a lot of the other people
back to I mean I was sort of tracking it
because John Carmack was talking about
VR and he thought that this one
particular prototype headset where he
was working with this young kid dallin
in California that had developed this
thing and it was really cool and he was
raving about it and you know he's
generally not so on that raves about
something else it's good and so you
project came out and I'm like this looks
great and I from what I was building in
star citizen I like yeah I absolutely
want to sit in the cockpit and turn my
head around and feel it and have it all
be there in full stereoscopic 3d how was
it we made that visit what was it like
to meet Palmer for the first time great
he just so enthusiastic him and he loves
this stuff I mean you could die he's up
like you know I've got a lot of passion
for like making great games or great
space games especially and you know he
definitely has the same passion for you
know vr and making this this experience
that is going to just be taking you to
other worlds and places which is a big
thing for me I mean I hold my whole
career it's always been about building
worlds and environments are going and
you know when I took a break and we'll
see movies for a while that was all
about going to different worlds so there
was my old company origin was we create
worlds and that's I think with the
oculus rift it makes it easier to much
more immersive world yes exactly so it's
going to be compatible with star susan
on day one yeah first question I'd ask
always when it starts isn't coming out
well so star systems going to come out
the final version will probably go live
at the end of two thousand fourteen or
the very beginning 2015 the end of this
year there's going to be the dogfighting
module where you can fly the ships that
you've backed and it'll just be a bit
more death match in space it won't have
the persistent universe you won't have
the story but we'll use that to sort of
balance the different ships get the
feedback from the community what's fun
you know do things like maybe we'll have
oculus rift running by then you'll be in
the cockpit and and so we're constantly
going to be sort of sharing builds of
components of the game during the next
two years and then when we finally
release it it sort of like we've been
taking these components that we've
hopefully battle-tested and maybe gotten
some of the kinks out and some of the
bugs and hopefully the final sort of
full live release will be maybe more
polished and stable than it would
normally be I don't know we'll see it's
the theory I'm doing it I speak a few is
one of the hypothetical game designs you
kind of talked about in the panel was
the conversation actually I never look
we don't really thought about like where
you have to focus i gaze like at a
person they know you're what picketed it
is that something specially gonna be in
star citizen I actually yeah so that was
actually a conversation method I've been
thinking about for quite a while because
I've sort of for me I did a lot of
things in the old Wing Commanders
because that's what I could do with the
technology the technology has changed so
much now that I sort of feel in a 3d
environment I can render like really you
know great-looking not lifelike but
pretty cinematic characters and so I I
want to keep you in that moment I don't
want to be cutting away you know like
your wing 3 we had full motion video
because that was the best way to be able
tell the story in that kind of thing but
and now I want to sort of put you in the
moment and I want it to be very much
like it's right now my my experience
talking to you I'm looking you in the
eyes talking to you and you know if I
just sort of look the way you be like
hey are you ignoring me just losing
points right now it's Liz exactly also
so the way I'm thinking about the
conversations and stutters and squadron
42 which will have more of it because
squadron always uses a single player
more Wing Commander style component of
star citizen is your sort of managing a
relationship with someone so it's not so
much about quizzing them about a B C or
D it's sort of your managing you know
like a guy like you pay attention to
yeah and also you know yeah you know
like I want to hang out with you I think
you're funny or I don't like you at all
and you sort of manage that relation and
big how you manage them will depend on
how they fly with you and depend on how
they will interact an axe with you so if
you start to blow someone off though
you're
to someone several times later out you
know on the arm they're not going to
help you if you're getting the pickle in
space and they'll be like you know get
lost so they won't you know they'll just
walk past you on the corridor whereas if
you're friendly with them maybe there's
a wingman that has no it's great sense
of humor and has all these jokes and if
you engage with that wingman and you sit
down with them so you get new jokes as
the game goes on oh thank you so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
