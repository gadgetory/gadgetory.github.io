2015 game developers conference and I'm
here with mine mazes mindly platform
which is a body tracking and brain
tracking VR headset system what I'm
wearing right now seems like a pretty
typical VR headset and it's got a kind
of connect like set of sensors on the
front here so I actually can't see you
right now and I'm looking at some fire
that's on my hand it's tracking my
fingers pretty accurately actually
considering that this is a difficult
technology to get right the thing that's
interesting about this isn't just that
it's able to talk my hand
it's that ideally although it's not
doing it right this minute it can also
tell how I'm feeling so if I'm able to
calm down enough this fire is going to
turn into ice so this is the sort of
medical technology that you can use to
control Bionic arms but they're using
ultimately a version that's going to be
sort of simplified so it can tell sort
of basic stress levels it might be able
to tell things like facial expressions
or motion so right now I'm in a
combination of virtual and augmented
reality if I look to the right here I
see some fire on my hands and I can also
see whatever is going on and then I turn
my head and now I'm in the void of space
and instead it's tracking my fingers as
some blue dots this combination of VR
and air isn't unique to this but it's an
interesting fairly seamless setup
there's also just a headband that they
have that has four sensors and it's able
to track whether you're frowning or
whether you're calm and so you can play
a fighting game like this if you frown
at somebody you'll shoot at them and if
you just relax you block I'm not wearing
a full neural mesh it would involve
putting a lot of glue on my head and
fitting some sensors down here but
ultimately it's going to look a lot more
like that headband it'll just have
strips across here and it will be able
to track some fairly simple functions so
this is going to be something you'll be
able to buy in stores they're actually
trying to make partnerships so they can
license this technology and put it into
other VR headsets or other motion
tracking devices but for right now it's
a really interesting setup
combination of a lot of technology that
could be part of the future of gaming</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
