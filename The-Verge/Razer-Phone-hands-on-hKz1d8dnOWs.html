are looking at the new razor phone which
is the first smartphone from Razer which
you may know more of as a gaming laptop
and peripheral company that makes mice
and laptops and headsets and all this
kind of stuff for gaming but this is a
smart phone and it's the result of
razors acquisition of next bit earlier
this year if you remember back in 2016
next bit released the phone called the
Robin which looks pretty similar to this
phone there's a little bit differences
and we'll go into them but basically you
can see the DNA of next bits phone here
in the razor phone it's a very sharp
angular design you can see it's really
hard edges and hard corners and calling
it extremely rectangular as compared to
some other phones I might have softer
edges but it's a very distinct design
it's got a 5.7 inch display it's 2k
resolution and really the display is one
of the main features here it's a sharp
XO panel so it's an LCD panel it's the
same kind of displays that Razer uses on
its gaming laptops and what they've done
here is they've put in 120 Hertz refresh
cycles on it which if you're familiar
with the iPad pro that came out earlier
this year that had a 120 Hertz display
this is the first phone to have it which
means that scrolling on it is super fast
and super smooth everything is really
slick and smooth it's the kind of thing
that it's a little bit hard to see in
the video so you kind of have to take my
word for it but when you're using the
phone it's really quite remarkable
experience in terms of just how
responsive the screen is a razor has
developed this technology to actually
adjust itself so if you are playing a
game or watching a video that's not
running at 120 Hertz the display will
scale down to the appropriate frames per
second for a video if you're watching a
movie at 24 frames per second so things
don't look weird but most of the time
you're gonna be seeing this at 120
frames per second which is super fast
it's definitely not something we're used
to seeing on Android phones the iPhone
doesn't even run at this kind of frame
rate so it's pretty cool
now what's powering that is a Snapdragon
835 processor there's a bunch of tech
specs inside of this including eight
gigabytes of RAM a giant 4,000 milliamp
hour battery and two front-facing
speakers so it's got stereo speakers
each with their own amp and the thing
that's really loud so when you
playing music we're playing a game it's
really designed to be held in landscape
mode when you're playing a game and that
the sound just kind of like barks at you
across there you've got a power button
with a fingerprint scanner on the side
some volume rockers here on the side as
well and if you see on the bottom here
there's a USB C charging port this is
also gonna be your headphone jack
despite the size of this phone there is
no headphone jack on it so Razer is
including an adapter to use 3.5
milimeter headphones that adapter is T
check certified which is cool it would
be cooler to have a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and alongside of it for
now at least though on the back side you
can see the kind of the design you got
razors signature snake head logo here
which is the three snakes here there's
going to be a limited edition version of
this that's comes in that familiar Razer
green but most of the models are the
silver chrome color then above that is a
dual camera system it's two 12 megapixel
cameras one of them is a standard lens
the other is a telephoto lens one of the
things that Razer has done with these
cameras is enable the smooth zoom
function so that it will switch between
the two lenses
smoothly without having to push a button
to switch between wide or telephoto you
just pinch your fingers and zoom in and
zoom out as you want and it will switch
to whichever lens is appropriate for it
aside from that cameras app that's
really the only software that Razer has
developed for the phone it's actually
using Nova Launcher here there's a
little a partnership to enable Nova
prime on the razor phone so it's a Nova
Launcher is very fast and customizable
and it's Android 7.1.1 under the hood
here and Razer says there's going to be
an update to Android audio coming in the
first quarter of next year but otherwise
it's basically a stock Android
experience there's no customized UI or
anything like that
all of razors work has been done under
the hood to optimize performance enable
the 120 Hertz display and things like
that as opposed to UI changes now that
big display is five point seven inches
across as I mentioned it's a sixteen by
nine display and it means that the razor
phone is a big phone there's no really
getting around it it also has a huge
battery inside of its 4,000 milliamp
hours and it's pretty big in your hand
and the square design is really designed
for two-handed use
is not a small phone at all and if you
compare it to other phones of this
calibre you'll see that it is quite a
bit bigger the build quality is very
good though it's a metal finish it's the
same metal that raisers using on its
laptops and it's really nice and well
built
it's a bit step up from the Robins
plastic finish that we saw a couple
years ago Razer is going to be launching
the razor phone in the middle of
November in the US and Europe so it cost
about six hundred and ninety nine
dollars you can buy an unlock direct
from Razer and it will work on ATT and
t-mobile for more on the razor phone and
