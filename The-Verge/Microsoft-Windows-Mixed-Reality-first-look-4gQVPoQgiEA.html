I'm checking out Microsoft's Windows
mixed reality experience now I've heard
a bunch about this over the past year
and I don't know about you but I've been
pretty confused by it simply because of
the mixed reality name so kind of what
is mixed reality I guess my trying to
explain it as a platform that sits in
between so you're gonna have the winds
mented reality on the Left virtual
reality on the right and they're trying
to aim for something that's going to
blend and sit sort of in the middle
these devices are coming in October
they're gonna come from a soos Acer HP
and of course Dell and even Lenovo so
all the PC makers you'd expect so this
jump into Windows mixed reality and see
what sort of apps and games you're
really gonna get here okay so just like
the oculus rift there's a tiny little
bit set up where you're gonna have to
mark out your physical play area apart
from that you just plug in the HDMI and
USB and you're good to go and because of
the sensors on the actual headset track
in these motion controllers so the
motion control is you've got you've got
these these basically represent your
hands within the games and within this
environment this is like a cliff house
environment it's like the home
essentially your virtual home and you
can see there's apps like pinned to the
wall I can grab those for the triggers
and move them if I want to resize and
bring them right into my view and all
that sort of stuff and there's also a
start menu and sort of thing you'd
expect on anything Windows really and
you can control apps um here you can
actually pin them into your environment
you can just start like literally start
off a copy of edge and use it like you
would in Windows 10 so I can navigate to
my favorite website load up stuff
browser and you can bring that also into
your view a little bit more so you can
lose really inspector closely or you
know pop it in the background get myself
up towards the superhot and will launch
that and just to show you this is
obviously a VR experience and although
this is mixed reality and much let's
call it mixed reality and the actual
experience is very much like VR even
down to the motion controllers and down
to just the headset itself so I'm in
stewpot now on a Dodge a few of these
bullets and punch people in the face and
stuff and if I'm gonna be able to grab
grab this bottle yeah as you can see I
know if you can read scenes very well
because it's really hard for us to show
you exactly how VR works but it's a
pretty standard VR
so the key con a difference between the
oculus rift and the the vibe and stuff
like that and these headsets is that the
sensors and cameras are actually at the
front so they're tracking your motion
controllers from the front of the
headset rather than having to place
sensors throughout your room there's a
really quick setup process you just put
the headset on and plug it in and you're
good to go it's home to the actual
headset and adjustments pretty standard
and you can actually flick this one up
the visor so if you're in a room and I
don't know your partner or your family
walking you when I talk to them
you flip heads up and you start talking
to them and at the back you've got an
adjustment here so let's see we're gonna
tighten it or loosen it and in terms of
the fit and feel and it feels pretty
good it doesn't feel too weighty it
feels pretty reasonably balanced on this
particular unit and I haven't tried all
of the different units so I can't speak
about exactly how the design and the fit
is across all of them it doesn't have
integrated headphones like you would get
on the rift but you've obviously got a
cord here you can just plug in your own
headphones so that's kind of useful in
its own way as well so one of the key
things about the windows mixed reality
platform is these new motion controllers
now every headset will support these and
they're all going to be exactly the same
it's just a reference design and each
OAM so that HP or Dell in this case and
will put their own sort of markings on
them but they're going to be the same
physical actual devices and what I found
is that they're a little bit
uncomfortable and they're not very
ergonomic compared to sort of like the
oculus rift but it's a very like square
and flat piece of plastic here so it
doesn't really rest all that comfortably
in my hands but in terms of buttons and
stuff it pretty well and they're pretty
well positioned and what's really
interesting about these also is that
they've got these tiny little white LED
lights that are constantly on so when
the actual devices are powered up and
connected via bluetooth these will
actually track to you the cameras at the
front of these headsets so like I said
earlier this is this different tracking
to what you see on the rift which
requires the sensors and the visor which
also requires sensors this will need
these controllers to sit in front of you
when you've got the headset on okay so
there's a real quick look at Microsoft's
Windows mixed reality experience
obviously we've been using the Dell
visors here today and there's a bunch
more from over here OMS but this one is
going to retail in October for three
hundred fifty nine dollars and for four
hundred and $59 you actually get the
motion controllers as well I would
recommend that and just for the extra
hundred dollars for the package you can
probably get more out of the VR games
and
experiences with these actual
controllers and for more on AR or any of
the virtual reality headsets check out
the verge calm that was a real quick oh
are you ready
that's the second TiVo ok so that was a
really quick look at the Microsoft weeks
but that was dinner because that was a
real quick look at the Microsoft Whip</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
