balloon airplane helicopter and what the
hell even a hovercraft
this is the airlander the world's
largest aircraft think of it as three
airships in one which means the hull
itself can generate lift like a plane
and it's over 300 feet long it has a max
speed of 80 knots or nearly 100 miles
per hour originally developed by British
company hybrid air vehicles in
partnership with Northrop Grumman in
June 2010 the air Lander was chosen over
Lockheed Martin's p7 9:1 for the United
States long endurance multi telogen s--
vehicle project the goal to create an
aircraft capable of staying aloft at
20,000 feet for three weeks without
landing here it is in August 2012 when
the project was cancelled following US
defense budget cuts hybrid air vehicles
bought the aircraft back for $300,000
the air Lander is currently being built
or rather rebuilt in Britain's
historical royal air force carting
tenango with our 101 airship was built
nearly a century ago the first British
flight is scheduled for later this year
or early next already the company has
plans for an even larger airship that
will be nearly 400 feet long and 200
feet wide with the ability to land on
water and room for up to 50 passengers
that's right
luxury airship cruises think about it
