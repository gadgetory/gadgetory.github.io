tested the iPhone 10 the pixel to excel
the Samsung Note 8 the HTC you 11 and
the LG v 30 to find out I didn't love
the HTC u 11 or the LG v 30 the selfies
just didn't compare to Samsung Google or
Apple's devices for me the best selfie
comes down to the pixel to excel and the
iPhone 10 but you might prefer the note
8 if you like using beauty filters to
smooth your skin I tend to prefer a
natural look so Samsung's extra smooth
skin doesn't really work for me with
that said Apple doesn't build any beauty
filters into its camera and Google only
has a feature called face retouching on
and face retouching off which seem to
kind of do nothing so if you like beauty
filters you should go with the no date
but if you're choosing between the
iPhone 10 and the pixel to excel you
should consider the color temperature of
the photos they take and how they handle
low lighting situations the pixel to
excel captures more detail in low-light
while the iPhone tends low-light photos
tend to look a little bit flat I prefer
the details of the pixel although the
iPhone tends photos always look ready
for an immediate Instagram without any
editing the pixel to excel photos could
use some filters but they seem to
capture the most realistic photo the
color temperature is always a little bit
cooler which can immediately see but I
prefer that crispness and cool feeling
this probably isn't Universal oh it's
also worth noting that the pixels to
excel and the iPhone 10 can do selfies
in portrait mode the node 8 doesn't have
that capability you'll be happy with any
of these three phones though it just
depends on your preferences particularly
if you like those beauty filters or not
hey thanks for watching this video if
