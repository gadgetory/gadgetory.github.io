think it's great but I also think it
kind of needs a case and for me the best
case even though it's a little bit
overpriced is the official Apple iPhone
10 the leather case I think it's a
really nice balance of protection and
usability it feels pretty good but I
think it also looks kind of ugly out of
the box look how I don't yellow it is
now if you use this for a few months you
eventually get something like this which
i think is lovely it's got this nice
patina and it just feels really personal
to me but I don't want to wait a few
months so I'm gonna show you later on in
this video how I went from this to this
with sandpaper and oil and a whole bunch
of crazy work but here's a question why
do I care this much about cases turns
out the best person to answer that
question isn't me it's the Verge's
resident case expert Ashley Carmen so
let's go talk to her last summer I
reviewed this phone case pompom phone
case and I was so excited when I opened
it I was like this is the cutest thing
I've ever seen in my whole life and then
within three weeks it was literally like
a torture device because these little
hairs kept showing up everywhere like in
my food
seriously in my food like there was a
random Bowl like a bull it wasn't even
near my phone I was like your food would
be in there the hair drinks yeah you
have one now they stick everywhere I
have like shunned this but I brought it
out just for this occasion would I buy a
phone case I'm the first thing I'm
thinking about is like okay I'm gonna
protect my phone so when I drop it it
will smash none of these cases are that
like basic and functional so like what
are you looking for with a case well
yeah I'm not really looking for
protection which is probably a mistake
i'm auram just trying to find the
weirdest case well I mean the reason I
wanted to talk to you is like so this is
the after of my iPhone 10 points
and so the Apple case on its own is like
really like yellow and tan yeah and I
wanted it to look cool and weathered so
I just started thinking about why I am
carrying this much about the way a case
looks come when I know up to now I just
thought about it as like protection if
everyone has the same looking phone
everything looks the same
right how are you gonna differentiate it
how are you gonna express your own
personal style right applying the term
fashion in cases seems I don't know
frivolous but it actually like it makes
perfect sense you think it's fashion as
clothes like clothes need to have like
primary function they need to keep you
from dying in like the cold weather
whatever like they're functional but
like it's how you present yourself to
the world but I also think it's like how
you present yourself to yourself you
feel different than what you're wearing
and there's no reason that shouldn't
also apply to fun I totally agree like I
think there's people out there who buys
you know unique Android phones and
really not just not like the mainstream
ones because they're like I want to be
able to show that I am into one bus or
something right yeah
with iPhones they all they're all the
same yeah you are giving away like your
like fashion sense to Johnny yeah if he
got great fashion sense I guess he wears
like the t-shirts and the weird pants
yeah yeah I'm not Johnny I have I'm
super not it's good design but I want to
be it's hard though I mean there's a lot
of cool cases but eventually start
running into the same things like this
glitter falling case you see a ton of
these now liquid so it's hard to find
these more unique styles okay so what do
we learn well first of all we learned
Ashley is amazing
Thank You Ashley now I feel way better
about this project that I'm about to
embark on tools cardboard of course I
have the unsullied Apple case I went to
Walgreens and I got some sandpaper
blocks and also coconut oil 100% extra
virgin with shea butter and of course
paper towel so if you know anything
about leather working what I'm about to
do to this case is going to horrify you
but you know what I don't care it's my
case I want to make it feel more like my
case and so to make it better I'm gonna
destroy a little bit first let me show
you how so there are four basic steps to
get from this to
this the first step is that this case
has a protective coating on it you need
to get that off I'm gonna sand it off
but you could also use like nail polish
remover the second step is you need
something to darken the leather once
you've got that coating off I'm going to
use coconut oil but some people use shoe
polish I mean you can you could spit on
the thing if you want to the third step
is leave it out preferably outside in
the Sun because it's gonna smell bad and
also it the Sun helps speed up the
darkening process and then the final
step and this is kind of important as
one sits back on your phone you just
kind of have to worry out a little bit
to smooth it out and just sort of get
all the little weird bits that happen in
the whole process some without looking
better okay so here we go I'm starting
with a pretty heavy grit and then I'm
gonna go to a lighter grit but you could
just use whatever you got sitting around
the house and immediately you're gonna
see this is this is a really scary thing
I'm doing you know just be careful don't
over sand it and end up just completely
ruining the case but I'm just kind of
hitting all the corners hitting all the
edges another thing to be aware of is
you don't have to hit the edges quite as
much as you do like the back and the
Apple logo simply because that's where
the natural oils from your hand are
gonna be hitting the phone the most
anyway and so they're gonna get darker
on their own this case is gonna be
sitting around my house it's gonna be
sitting around me all the time and
there's a lot of stuff that sits around
my house that's wrong the other time
that I want to be nice and I want to
feel like it's mine so Ashley and I
talked a lot about cases in terms of
fashion but it's also a thing that's
just around I have a favorite chair I
have a favorite blanket I've got kind of
nice plates and looking at this case
every day I can look at it and I will be
able to feel better about this thing
that I helped make oh yeah I think this
thing is ready for oil alright so as I'm
spraying this thing it's pretty intense
it smells really bad sorry about that
and then I do need to work it in a
little bit just to make sure it hits all
the different parts of the phone so I
was inspired to do this by this thread
over on the MacRumors forums called
patina proud which is just a whole bunch
of people who have this case that we're
showing off how they managed to get a
really nice patina on their case and
they talked about their different
methods for forgetting there and you end
up with something that looks like this
and I think this looks awesome it looks
just
just and cool and mine and that's the
point it looks like it's mine
whether you do what Ashley does and you
buy a bunch of weird cases that are
unique to her or you do what I do and
you literally destroy a phone case you
want it to feel like it's yours
technology can be alienating and it can
feel generic everybody has the same
thing and so customizing your case can
make technology be what it's supposed to
be it's supposed to belong to you hey
everybody thanks so much for watching my
weird science experiment if you want to
see actual real science you should check
