verge and this is the massive gargantuan
huge iPad pro it has a 12 point 9 inch
screen look at this dimension of it it's
actually the same height as an iPad air
which means that you can run iPad apps
and they're full you know glory while
still having something over here on the
side so the resolution on this thing is
2732 by 2048 that it's retina infra
Sarah beautiful it's a very good screen
Apple also claims it's a wicked fast it
has an a 9 X processor which they say is
you know laptop grade very very fast and
also you can get a keyboard this
keyboard is 169 bucks and it has this
tiny little magnetic connector on the
bottom which matches up with these tiny
little dots on the bottom of the iPad
and you just connect them in and you
have the keyboard it thinks I said hey
Siri I'm not sure why the keyboard is it
feels good it feels about the same as
the new MacBook keyboard you can see
everything banging away on it it also
supports a stylus it's called the Apple
pencil and I don't have one here but it
can handle pressure it can also detect
tilt so you can do really really
detailed drives on it Apple plans for
this thing to be designed for
professionals and it makes sense the
base model with 32 gigs is $7.99 but if
you get more memory if you get LTE if
you buy the keyboard if you buy the
Apple pencil you are very quickly
getting into a price range that is more
or at least equal to a macbook so here's
a 13-inch MacBook Air compared to this
Apple thinks that it it can become your
only device it can become a tablet and
you don't need to worry about having a
laptop and maybe the right but we'll
need to spend a little more time with
the same here in any case if you wanted
to see a huge iPad now you have</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
