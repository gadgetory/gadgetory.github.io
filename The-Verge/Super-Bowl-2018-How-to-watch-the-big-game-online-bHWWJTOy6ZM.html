you're like millions of Americans don't
have cable anymore
this is your guide to streaming the big
game if you've got cable satellite or
over-the-air antenna you're already set
just turn on the game it's 6:30 p.m.
Eastern turn to your local NBC affiliate
which in New York City is channel 4 and
you're good to go
NBC is streaming the game for free
through the NBC app and NBC sports apps
so if you've got a set-top box like an
Apple TV or Roku a fire TV or chromecast
just download the NBC app it's free and
then on Sunday
there'll be a free stream to watch just
the Super Bowl no cable login required
there also be all the regular
commercials that you get if you had a
normal stream which is good if you don't
particularly like football the stream is
usually a couple seconds behind
broadcast TV so if you don't want any
big moments spoiled for you maybe stay
off Twitter if you don't have a string
box or Smart TV just pull up the NBC or
NBC Sports websites on your computer
plug in your HDMI cable and you'll still
be able to watch the game on your TV
again it's free no cable login required
just for the super if you want to watch
on your phone in the past few years
you've only been able to watch over
cellular if you had Verizon that
exclusivity deal is over which means
that you'll be able to watch on data
through the NFL mobile or Yahoo sports
apps lastly you should always have a
backup so just in case NBC's app goes
down you can set up an over-the-top
streaming service like who lose live
service YouTube TV sling TV or DirecTV
now which all have free trials and you
have that ready to go just in case
something goes wrong no matter how
you're watching though NBC's only airing
the game in 1080p so if you're hoping to
take advantage of your 4k TV you're
gonna be a little disappointed that said
some of the Olympics will be in 4k next
week which is not so helpful to you and
when we understand that football is
largely an American affair if you live
in England and we're hoping to catch the
game you'll be able to do so on the
BBC's apps and websites just remember
that it doesn't actually air until 11:30
p.m. in London and if you live north of
the border in Canada and want to catch
up you'll be able to do so on CTV TSN
and the CTV going thanks for watching
and whether you're rooting for the
Eagles the Patriots or Justin Timberlake
a halftime show let us know in the
comments who you're hoping to win the
Super Bowl
