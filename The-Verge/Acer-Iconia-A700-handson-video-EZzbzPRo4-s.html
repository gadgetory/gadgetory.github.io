quad-core processor 1.3 give herceg
referring and it runs android for ice
cream sandwich as you can see the home
screen is looking pretty snappy pretty
quick which are going to take a quick
look around the device it measures nine
point eight millimeters in thickness as
a couple of speakers flip it around one
day and one day as micro USB ports which
is used for charging and for data
transfers w digital plus audio it has
this pattern back it's actually very
smooth to the touch it also kind of
actually feels lighter in the hand then

has I believe a five megapixel camera on
the back it has a 720p HD front-facing
camera over here on the side has a
orientation lock button and right here
this is the power button and three and a
half maybe headphone jack just taking it
around to the other side if we open it
up and first thing is this is an hdmi
port here and you've got space for micro
SD card right there so if we actually
go and take a look here let's try and
find a video you can play back
perfect so as you can see this is a
1080p trailer that we're looking all
right now all right so this is the acer
iconia tab a700 you should be shipping
in the second quarter of 2012 and it is
only one basis quad-core tablet there
