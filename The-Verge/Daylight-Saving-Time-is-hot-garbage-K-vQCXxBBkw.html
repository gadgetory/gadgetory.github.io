time is a load of garbage and I think
it's time we stop doing it
daylight saving time is the practice of
shifting clocks up by one hour during
summer months so that evening daylight
lasts an hour longer this messes with
sunrise times and almost guarantees
you'll be late for something at least
once in March and November back in 1780
for Benjamin Franklin woke up probably
out of a drunken stupor because he was
that kind of guy around 6:00 a.m. and
found the Sun was already up amazed you
wrote a letter to the journal of Paris
proposing among other things cannon fire
to awaken / sleepers and candle taxes to
ensure everyone was using a glorious
free morning sunlight he discovered
other people including a German bug
collector have had similar ideas and
some of their arguments were compelling
Franklin wrote about saving candle wax
an energy that eventually led to the
u.s. enacting daylight saving time in
1918 with world war 1 taking up a lot of
resources the u.s. temporarily enacted a
time shift using this logic since people
tend to be more active in the evenings
they'll use less energy and resources if
you change all the clocks just apply
extra daylight note changing clocks
doesn't actually make the Sun Shine
longer but it does shift everyone's
workday so it feels like the Sun is out
later after the war farmers lobbied is
Allah repealed which is weird because I
distinctly remember being told that all
this nonsense was for the farmers
benefit turns out it's easy to do farm
work when the rest of the world is on
the Sun schedule and not just jumping
all over the clock but in the US
daylight savings time came back in 1942
for World War 2 and then again
infuriatingly permanently in 1966 it's a
federal law but whether or not it's
observed is up to the states Arizona and
Hawaii don't even observe daylight
saving time because they're logical and
want people to be happy also if you want
something especially confusing to wrap
your head around here are all the
different time zone and daylight saving
time rules across the globe but saving
energy isn't bad right it's not it's
great it's a shame daylight saving time
doesn't technically save energy anymore
yeah in the 1970s a study found a 1%
benefit to energy used but a few things
have changed in the last 40 some years
we have LED bulbs more efficient
appliances and a smarter electric grid
more recent research shows note a little
difference in energy uses between places
observing daylight savings time and
those that don't and some research even
says changing your clocks results in
more energy use a 2008 paper that looks
at Southern Indiana found that daylight
saving time actually increase the energy
demand by nine million dollars a year in
Indiana alone and we aren't just paying
for this with our wallets studies
support that switching into daylight
saving time is actually detrimental to
our health the Journal of Applied
Psychology found that workplace injuries
spike the Monday after we spring ahead a
paper presented at the American Economic
Association showed that traffic
accidents rise by about six percent
nationally for the next six days after
we move our clocks forward sleep
deprivation is already a huge issue and
while one hour less sleep a night might
not seem like a lot it makes a big
difference
so the concept of daylight saving time
was introduced as a joke doesn't really
save energy isn't great for our health
and not everyone even doesn't what the
heck are we doing losing sleep and
confusing ourselves with our unchanged
microwave clocks personally I'd rather
we just have daylight saving time all
year in the u.s. it already last eight
months why not just swing in the last
four plus there are definite benefits of
the day starting later and having more
sunlight in the evenings especially as
you move further from the equator but
whether we stick with daylight saving
time or standard time I don't care just
pick one no more of this switching back
and forth what are other fun things to
say I mean time time daylight saving
time time it's all made-up notions
anyway unless you get into like
