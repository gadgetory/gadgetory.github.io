pierce and this is the world according
to me 90 seconds on the verge surprise
surprise the highly anticipated google
maps for iphone is highly popular google
senior vice president Jeff Huber
announced the Maps app has surpassed 10
million downloads in just 48 hours it's
currently the number one free app in
nearly 50 countries on the iOS App Store
none of this is surprising of course the
worst Apple map stories have also served
as the best Google Maps advertising TV
ratings powerhouse Nielsen has found a
new bedfellow in Twitter the so-called
Nielsen Twitter TV rating will be
available starting with the fall 2013 TV
season and will measure engagement data
the new rating will go hand in hand with
Nielsen's current system and will help
advertisers figure out not only who's
watching a show but what they're saying
about it while they watch as for what
people actually use the data for that
remains to be seen one thing's for sure
though the revolution will be hashtagged
and by revolution we mean the show on

reports that Twitter even-handed
Instagram a term sheet during
negotiations before CEO Kevin Systrom
and company decided to quote remain
independent this revelation could anger
investors who may no longer be convinced
that the Facebook deal is made with
their best interests in mind the New
York Times also says there might be
perjury risks for Systrom who claimed
under oath that Instagram had never
received any formal offers that's it for
today's top story coming up tomorrow new
revelations on why two probes crashed
into the moon plus what we found among
the wreckage</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
