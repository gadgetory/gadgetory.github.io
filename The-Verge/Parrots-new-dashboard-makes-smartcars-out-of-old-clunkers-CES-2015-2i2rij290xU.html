a weird name but it's kind of a weird
device this is an aftermarket unit that
could go in parrot says 90% of cars and
what it's trying to do is be the smart
dashboard no matter what kind of device
or operating system you're working with
so one of the big sells is that it
connects to both Android auto and apple
carplay regardless of what phone you
have this is going to be a high def
screen that will display all of your
apps in a way that's safe and easy to
use while you're driving in the car it
also comes with its own dash cam and
parrot says it can do some interesting
things with that dash cam you've got a
mode here for capturing hyper time-lapse
videos you've got a mode here that can
help you with Lane Assist
to stop you from drifting and one here
to let you know if you're getting too
close to the car in front of you parent
has also done a lot of stuff in the
world of audio and on this they have
some pretty cool Audio FX controls
you've got an equaliser like you would
in your standard car but also some
really nice balance in fading depending
on where you are sitting and who wants
to listen to the music a little audience
selector here so you can decide exactly
who's going to be jamming out and who's
not and then just some you know very
detailed stuff in terms of face and
dynamic range all that one of the other
cool things that we've got on here is a
driver diagnostic so this connects to
the OBD port in your car it can tell you
all sorts of things about how your
braking and accelerating to keep track
of your gas mileage over time if you
take a long trip you can sort of dig
into a diagnostic of that and see what
your gas mileage was per mile how fast
you were going and then over here on the
last screen if you get a check engine
light the OBD port can actually tell you
what that's about so before you go to
the mechanic you have some sense of what
the problem might be how much you know
it should cost to fix it each year at
CES it becomes more clear that cars are
just giant gadgets on the road and this
is one of the things that's going to tie
it in even closer with your phone for
more cool videos about what's happening
