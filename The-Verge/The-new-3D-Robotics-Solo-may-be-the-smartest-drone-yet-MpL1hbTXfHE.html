honestly I didn't think I could take
offs and landings are hard to figure out
when you're just starting and that's to
say nothing of power lines trees and
every other obstacle out there any one
of which would destroy my thousand
dollar investment in an instant and
that's the biggest reason that like most
people I don't own a drone 3d robotics
here's this kind of thing a lot it's a
problem they set out to solve with solo
the quadcopter drone they're announcing
today and sure enough the software they
built was smart enough to handle
anything I threw at it even if you crash
solo wolves solo is a thousand dollar
quadcopter designed to capture Hollywood
style movie footage with just a couple
taps it takes off in lands with a button
press the battery which takes an hour to
charge gets you about 20 minutes in the
air if you have a GoPro attached either
via the basic frame or a separately sold
gimbal you can stream live video to your
phone or tablet
the video shows up on the solo app which
is also where you set up your shots and
because solo is the first drone to fully
integrate with GoPro you have total
access to GoPros camera controls that
means you can remotely start and stop
recordings and change your frame rate
and other settings all while you're in
the air it's all possible because of
twin Linux computers one in the drone
and one in your controller that work
together to make solo smarter than your
average consumer UAV the first era of
our industry was getting robust to fly
it was super hard but we got there the
next era was making them easier to fly
more autonomy more you know more GPS
even simpler controls the next era I
think is not flying them at all you know
making it so that as the product gets
more sophisticated the users can become
less sophisticated now when you're ready
to fly then I am ready to fly ok this is
also ready to fly apparently so I'm
gonna go make sure my settings I can go
to my vehicle settings I can check which
color I want my LED lights to be in case
my friends out there flying too I can
check my performance so it's nice and
chill right now
good what I'm gonna do is just like the
screen tells me tap and hold to spend
the props good props are spinning press
fly to take off so I have exactly press
two buttons right armed and then I press
upon to take off almost everything about
flying this drone has been automated
this is a machine that just works
independently of my mistakes when I need
an emergency break I just hit the pause
button forcing the drone to stop and
hover while it waits for my instructions
I had no idea what the buttons and knobs
of the controller actually did while I
was flying but it thinks of the
autopilot I never really worried that a
wrong move on my part would cause a
crash the autopilot is the hard thing of
a drone right the plastics the motors
the props that's not that hard the
brains of the operation the autopilot
that's what takes years of time to
develop well the problem was that it was
developed by a team of very accomplished
engineers and for them like okay you
just load the list of parameters you
find this weird code name for this
parameter and change a from point zero
two three to 0.0037 and you know submit
that to the drone and re-upload it and
you're gonna feel it flies better ok
well that needs to become settings solo
vehicle agility bar apply right and so
it was all a matter of taking this
foundation of the most advanced
autopilot code in the world and then
kind of like automating it but flying is
it the only thing that Silla does
automatically it also sets up your shots
for you controls the gimbal and smoothly
moves the camera to get the shot you
want using a mode called cable cam I set
a start and end position for the drone
in space the drone can then move back
and forth along a virtual cable while
the gimbal smoothly tilts up without me
even having to touch the controller or
maybe you'd rather take your next big
selfie with a flying machine so let's go
here to GPS flight let's hit selfie that
looks good press right arrow to start
the selfie
and do a selfie from right there so this
nice pull away tilt down reveal the
dramatic selfie so it gets to the end
now it's gonna automatically turn right
back around I can click this little
record button so I can record this right
here in the app there it is swooping in
on us swooping in
not afraid of you
we want to be part of what I think is
the Golden Age of storytelling and as
you know people have insatiable appetite
for telling their their own story the
only thing you're missing is perspective
the oh one thing you can't do is go
beyond arm's length while there's a
selfie stick so you can go slightly
beyond arm's length but basically you
know we've been telling our own story
within the limits of our reach and you
know if Hollywood is telling your story
they'd go beyond the limits of your
region the idea is is that you know
rather than you being behind the camera
rather than you being the director maybe
you should be the actor and that's
really 3d arse bet that they can create
the best drone platform not just for
drone pilots and filmmakers but for
anyone who wants to capture aerial
footage of themselves with a GoPro it's
easy to imagine taking in solo with me
on a hike putting it in the air letting
it follow me around and getting some
cool footage of me and the most
important thing is I can just kind of
forget it's up there I can focus on my
feet so I wouldn't trip like I did
earlier in the day competition in the
drone market is getting more intense
DJI just announced the phantom three the
latest in a line of products that has
defined what a drone looks like in the
popular imagination how big of a moment
is this for 3d are like big you know
based on what I've read you guys are
sort of like third place in sales right
now is there is there a sense of that
you're sort of the underdog at this this
moment absolutely yeah I mean we're we
are a player but we are the underdog
player right and you know how big of a
defining moment is I mean it is the
moment I don't think that many many
people in the world know who 3d are is
right an order of magnitude less than
our bigger competitors out there but I
think that's all going to change very
soon
