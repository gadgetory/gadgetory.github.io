where we have a hard time knowing what
if we started this is episode 33 it's a
week of january fourteenth 2012 we have
a skeletal crew we're missing Chris
Ziegler but our other three anchors are
here and I feel really good about that
if you don't know who we are will
introduce ourselves because that's how
we do I am dieter bohn how I'm flats MO
and i'm dan seifert and we're back from
CES I'm still feeling it I was really
good and then I wasn't so good and
that's where i'm at right now and I need
to get good because I want to see my
three month old two month old I have no
idea how many months old nice uh this
weekend and if I can't get healthy than
I can't do it because she's too young to
get immunized against anything how you
guys feeling I was feeling great up
until like three hours ago and all of a
sudden I just got like hit with this
congestion and kind of a sore throat
going on so i was i was actually making
fun of the rest of our team who happened
to be like pretty much laid out with
everybody is sick so Chris eclairs sec
he's he's still working cuz he's a
madman but he he literally if we had him
on the show it would it would be
coughing and phlegm and he's probably in
fact people just over to pro cast is
that bad ya debe me on the other hand
I've actually been a very good and
punctual human being and I haven't done
the whole Posse yes staying out into a
60m and catching a flight 630am know
that ocean oh no that madness well I
mean the thing is it's a cause and
effect right people do crazy things that
and they complain when the bodies can
take him I only went out one night and I
got plenty of sleep afterwards and I
feel like I was a very responsible
person at CES as was i most of the time
that I was losing sleep at CES is
because i was working not partying like
I went at once so yeah I think we're
over responsible um but other that
doesn't change the fact that we're all
kind of under the weather or the moment
but at the same time needs to describe
the accrues being skeletal add topics of
conversation actually pretty skeletal to
there hasn't been that much going on
possi yes no there really hasn't but
we've got we've got a few things to
discuss but I can't promise that we're
gonna be here for an hour and a half in
fact I promise you that we won't be here
for an hour to have um by the way the
Sun looking drag this out yeah I just I
just sounded the the challenge going for
me now it's like did you guys know that
I worked my way through college at a
place called 33-minute photo really but
we developed we developed photos in 33
minutes or less wow that's where I
learned how to color correct I got
pretty good at it when i was in college
we stuck to the one hour limit on our
photo developing oh man gotta do it fast
when you work at the lungs grocery store
you can't screw around anyway so
seriously mobile things what's happenin
since we had a get together so I guess
let's talk about rim and blackberry 10
for a while the announcements coming up
on the 30th and two weeks like every
single thing has leaked like is like I
don't know what they have left in the
hopper right you know I talked to them
at CES recent at least eight price real
estate and like a couple of surprises
probably I'm still guessing it's going
to be related to like how they're you
know showing video and movie purchases
and music purchases we one of the many
many many things that leaked was like a
training manual i think for rogers
employees that looked like it was
produced by rim and they had said there
that they're definitely going to be
selling music movies i think it said
they're targeting 70,000 apps for launch
which is a pretty respectable number
there was there was one bit in the slide
that was crazy hilarious i don't think
we posted on because everything in there
we kind of are
no but it was something like I gotta
find it now it was um remember what it
was that it was like yeah facebook and
rim hey I can google I gotta find it
while other platforms like Facebook and
Google are harvesting information about
you and what you're doing online we have
built a platform that protects what's
important to you like wow that's hard
man I mean it's all related to you know
their security and blah blah blah but
it's like that's a that's a bigot
android right there but to be honest
that actually sounds almost exactly to
the word the same as well the chinese
government is saying about perfect it's
a case of if you get online with a
mobile or desktop you need to disclose
your real identity to your isp and then
the chinese government will protect that
identity for you yeah so yeah I mean to
me this whole phrasing of rim will
protect your information the most
protective thing room can do is not to
collect my information leave it alone
yeah I mean they're there the way that
the doing email is direct over I map we
know that it's going to support CalDAV
and carddav directly for talking to to
google so I mean unless you sign up for
BBM and you sign up for like the
blackberry come from wiped out the other
thing is definitely a small remote wipe
you saw that in the manual I suppose you
don't have to give your information room
to use a blackberry 10 device well then
yeah then that is great then it's
protect my information it's not it's not
being too nosy but I mean we saw the z10
leak again there's like a 10 or 12
minute walk through of everything on the
phone and it's all you know it's stuff
we've seen it's the hub it's you know
it's everything uh you know I don't know
I don't know what's left it's just
everything is leaked it everything I it
looks fine it looks fast I'm excited to
try it I know I'm the only one
no no no I'm excited to play with it at
least well I hope that they can get you
know some android apps legitimately into
the blackberry app world if you know my
legitimately joke was there was a doobie
truck do we talk about this there was a
drama where Android developers were
seeing our apps show up in blackberry
app world and in a couple of cases it
was because somebody had actually
pirated it and then submitted it and was
trying to make money off of selling it I
talked the robot at CES and like look
this is this is a very very tiny problem
and of course we've got to try and stop
this stuff and if something gets through
a killer right away so I don't think
it's a huge drama but they did point out
one interesting thing which was a lot of
Android developers you know they make
the rap but they don't necessarily
distribute it they let some other
companies sort of handle that and to get
you know submitting it to the market
submitting it to marketers and other
things and sometimes those third party
distributors end up submitting it to app
world and the developers don't know
about it but you know if that stuff gets
pulled to but i'm really interested to
see just how well this this these
android apps work on blackberry 10
because if it works really well i could
force a situation where i would want to
you know somehow hackett so even if it's
not in the blackberry app world i would
still find a way to grab it off I
Android and stick it on there sticking
on a blackberry which isn't I suppose
technically you know legal I'm honey
up-and-up will say right but it would it
would be an easy way to solve the app
problem if in fact they haven't that
problem um I do yeah Welch everybody is
in that program well everybody but Apple
big natural tunics then Google yeah now
Apple's App problem i mean i mentioned
this in last week's podcast to me is a
really big one which is that it's wholly
dependent on third-party developers
right none of those guys are going to
run away i mean nobody's going to
abandon a big revenue source such as iOS
but it's still the case that like I've
just been using nexus 7 that you so
kindly hands off to me data and I look
at the first applications that are put
on my home screen google owns every
single one of them chrome Gmail play
store youtube right those are just the
first few apps that I've slept on home
screen if I go and look at an iOS device
as nice as they are as nice as the ipad
the ipad mini of the iphone are well the
first thing i do the first publication
is stick them in a folder and instinct
that folder on a separate home screen so
it's not in my face yeah it's funny that
you mentioned that on android google
owns the main apps that you use because
for me on iOS google owns like ninety
percent of the main apps that I use so
the right so use the same situation i'm
still using chrome i'm still using
google maps on iOS so in terms of the
future i actually think google and
android is the most secure platform on
the app front which at the moment is the
most important thing with devices yeah
so I mean rhythm is really really like a
bully uh on having enough apps there
like that the I asked him you know do
you have the apps you need for a
successful launch and it wasn't like
yeah it was like yes we do whatever
everyone said that everyone said I
wasn't it wasn't just like we think so
were we hope so or we've got a good plan
or anything it was yes but I mean
Microsoft add to record having this
conversation with them just before the
launch of windows phone 7 some two and a
half years ago however long it's been
and they were like you know what
everybody keeps talking about numbers of
apps what we're going to do is we're
going to improve discoverability and
we're going to focus on quality of apps
so it honestly is just marketing talk
until you get a device out until you
actually give people apps that they want
to use and they don't need to be the big
brand name once they just need to be
good ones if they're unique if they're
ones that you don't already have on
android iOS that's even better that
makes it interesting well i don't know i
feel like you know a lot of times
especially people that are going to be
running out and buying say a blackberry
10 within its first month or on ice
running it up running out lining up our
people that are going to be already
owning smartphones or are you going to
have apps that they're using services
that they're using prime smartphones are
core blackberries Wow Lord black but
hopefully rim hopes that people who are
using iOS devices and Android devices
etc are going to be interested in buying
a blackberry 10 platform and if you know
you get there and say
there's no Dropbox app or say there's no
way that I can control my google voice
account or there's no there is a Dropbox
app that was one of the one of the I
think the video leaked the video Tyga so
we have dropbox cool yeah so I mean but
if those apps aren't there then it's a
problem and even if there's like an
alternative version if you're already
bought into a system and say you own
storage or you're paying for cloud
storage you can't access it through a
third-party knockoff app or because the
official app isn't there then it's kind
of a disappointment and you know we're
seeing the same thing on Windows Phone
there's a third party apps for a long
time there's a third party Dropbox app
that you had to pay for and it offered
like up crappy or experience that you
get on the other platforms and so it's
just like kind of just a crappy
experience all around if those you know
core apps or key apps aren't there
available for you by the way then I love
that condescending thumbs up when he
heard this girl set for blackberry
10 just like yeah yeah now he needs to
do that only for 2999 to go well I mean
on the subject it was just recently
announced last reveal that room got
15,000 app submitted with his poor two
thumbs so I had a couple of porta phones
which is math and coding sessions to
port your apps I'm guessing it's just a
cheesy cheesy name um but in any case
there's everybody well I mean that's
actually that's encouraging but it's
also it's important for these developers
to get in at app launch I remember I
mean watching Windows Phone launch and
even watching webos launch there's a
there's a real chance for somebody that
hasn't been able to get traction on
another platform to something attraction
on a brand new platform because they're
the only app that does X or Y and people
are looking for it and they just happen
to find it so it makes a lot of sense to
be there for that initial wave whether
or not you know it matters in six months
and you know that's a whole other story
but it makes sense but really
incentivize this is what I think there's
a hundred dollars as a bonus if your app
is approved to get into the store and
then I forget exactly what the
conditions are but you can be entered in
to a drawer to get a blackberry 10 dev
alpha device well there's also the
guarantee that if you may if you get
sell certain number of our apps but
don't make a certain number amount of
money that they're going to guarantee
you ten thousand dollars I forget
exactly the terms are there yeah you
have to you have to make a thousand
dollars with your app but if you don't
make like 10,000 and they'll give you
the rest or something like that if I'm
correctly guys that guarantee was issue
something like 6-8 months ago not even
even longer yeah that's ancient yeah
yeah I never said it was new man the
point is rubys just gonna be like what
guarantee yeah we don't have archives
that stretch that far back forget about
it but I also mean that it's actually
like look at these numbers actually find
them kind of stupid frankly because well
I mean look the really serious and
committed app developers are they really
going to be tempted by a 100-dollar
incentive now and then if their app is
moderately successful getting entered
into a drawer to get a dev alpha device
it's kind of like you just rub your
shoulders and it also reminds me of what
microsoft recently did around the world
is for an 8 launch where they lowered
the entry level price t no sign up for
dev account Microsoft's problem wasn't
getting 16 year old teenage boys from
India to put together apps that's
exactly what has been happening right
what I mean look at it look at it this
way like honestly what else can rim be
doing to support developers good stuff i
mean we're assuming they're doing all
the biz dev talks i said you know we're
talking to everybody we can and with
PowerPoint presentations of a show if
it's a technical problem we'll fix that
and if it's a business problem we'll fix
that so they're doing it they can for
the big name stuff they're doing what
they can for the little guys like all
the only the only other thing that I can
think of that they need to do is launch
the damn phones and cell devices and
look like a chicken and egg problem
because right you know if you don't have
the apps the odds of selling the devices
are much lower and if they don't sell
the devices the interest in developers
from developers much lower so yeah but
really it just needs to be you got to
get these devices in people's hands
people got to be like I want this app
yeah I'll
for this end of its year one thing that
actually surprised me is the big four
carriers in the US verizon 18t t-mobile
and Sprint have all said yeah we're
going to carry blackberry 10 and I
expected one of them to sort of sit back
kind of but I mean rims got blong
histories with all of these carriers
obviously and we know it's going to be
on everything in Canada we know it's
going to be you know a worldwide launch
so you know they've I know people are
tired of like the webos comparison but
they appear to have solved a couple of
those problems it's faster and it's
going to be on all the carriers to
people are they're not going to have to
wait and be stuck in an exclusive with
somebody hopefully for very long so like
as in so far as we've seen somebody try
to take on that android/ios duopoly we
saw Windows Phone take a crack at it a
couple of times now and you know for
various reasons that hasn't had a huge
impact and I'm sure that our Windows
Phone loving readers are going to be
sending me emails hi guys but it's true
and I don't know that blackberry 10 is
either but it seems like they've managed
to avoid the biggest and most obvious
pitfalls we'll see what the app
situation is really like on the 30th but
in terms of like possibility of like
setting themselves up to have a
successful launch like they're doing
most of the obvious things the question
is will be enough and I just don't know
it just been bez mentioning here would
respect to the US carriers this is
something that lesson tweeted on Twitter
at lesson bina as opposed to carry on
google+ or to yeah okay for treating
them facebook social graph we need to
talk about that graph search which is
just bonkers to me sure um but I mean
this is a very good point rim is
essentially being used as a dummy room
is desperate to do exactly what you are
saying be you ubiquitously available so
I'm sure room is bending a knee in
negotiations with verizon everybody else
but older carriers are using it as a
dummy
a third option quotation marks a fourth
option guess whatever to iOS and Android
so that when they go to talk to Samson
when they go to talk to Apple about the
next device they can say well you know
what room is coming out with its devices
so I think that's the major stimulus for
all the carriers to carry blackberry 10
to because they need that extra option
like a saying da windows phone has been
tepid like it hasn't taken it off it
hasn't been a legitimate competitor to
the big tube so the fact that blackberry
10 is unknown actually plays in the
carrier's favor like maybe in five hours
time we'll know the blackberry 10 is a
flop and or or success or a success but
we also know that like just as with
Android and with Samsung at least early
Samsung maybe not so much now rim is
more willing to play ball with carrier
requests and demands than Apple is and
so the carriers are might be more
interested in pushing BlackBerry devices
themselves because they know that they
can get you know whatever little sweet
kickbacks and sweetheart deals and extra
apps on the phone or whatever from rim
and then they know they're not going to
get it off of the iphone yeah but I mean
how much how much does that really
matter but in line ma'am I think what
does affect their bottom line is if the
amount of subsidies that they have to
pay on each phone the iphone is
definitely the highest subsidized device
on any carriers lineup so if a carrier
is able to push another device that they
don't have to shell out four hundred
fifty dollars for upfront um when they
sign up a person up then certainly with
yeah but be appealing to them yeah and I
mean not to knock the z10 before i've
actually played with it for real I mean
let's be honest it's it's basically
commodity hardware the screen is pretty
good you know it's using it I think one
of these we saw was a Snapdragon s4
processor you know it's it's basically
as we can see all these Android
manufacturers kick-out Android devices
and there's no reason that RIM couldn't
do the same with blackberry 10 devices
because they're using the same parts
one of the things at CES some some
executive popped off and said that
they're going to have six blackberry 10
devices in multiple price points in 2013
which is more than the two we had you
know new known for sure um and that's
hilarious it's important because it
could be different SKUs maybe but I
don't know because we know that there's
gonna be different LTE SKUs for the
different LTE markets right but he said
a different price points so right I mean
that's kind of a big deal because up
until that statement we had understood
that blackberry 10 would be for the
higher end devices and then rim was
still gonna be selling blackberry 7 and
7.1 like it just launched what was that
thing it just launched on a t-mobile a
week ago just before see yes with 7.1 on
it uh and that was going to be the entry
level but now with different price
points maybe rim is intending to bring
blackberry 10 down down market a lot
sooner than we had expected so again
that's that's another point in his favor
as far as getting it out there as much
as possible just like being on all the
carriers or all the main carriers in the
US getting it across multiple price
points I think Dida just dropped the mic
and was about ready to walk away you
didn't want to talk about the 93 20 or
whatever the heck that thing is uh uh
wait wait but seriously how bad is it
that this is the verge mobile show and
we're like just riffing and referencing
whatever the hell that weird blackberry
thing was it is I mean we're so
disinterested in rims current quotes
ranges lessons differentiated at all you
know I know I don't end it and it's just
so dire it's such a dire situation i I
mean I can't help but feel that what we
have right now the situation we're all
facing right now is basically a
situation that us take the journalists
face when we get a bag swag right so you
don't want it you know like you're not
even allowed to take it because it's wag
right yeah but the thing is at the same
time you're curious you want to know
what these people put together
to try and seduce you into writing good
things about it so it's like curiosity
is the overwhelming thing you want to
see and then ultimately just like a bag
of slag you're horribly horribly
disappointed by and it's exactly what
you expected even though your eternal
optimism kept you going and made you
open the bag and I know what you do is
you take that bag of swag from somebody
like Samsung you walk over a few proofs
and hand it over to something like
fujifilm yeah I'm cracking up because uh
flat and I were walking around the
Florida last day of CES and but eggs did
exactly that and this is this is not
such a hypothetical yeah I mean Samsung
have okay first of all create to samsung
for having a dedicated area for
journalists and bloggers like just
giving people a place to sit down have a
reliable fast connection and have a
drink is go they were serving this like
blue hypnotic type of drink that I
couldn't find this lounge by the way I
was that Samsung's boot for like an hour
and a half i watch netflix right outside
the samsung cube like I walks the cube
was outside the key balls inside the
cube yeah it's like there's the Borg
cube thats painted white and then
outside of that it was it was the dress
looks like it isn't you discuss that a
little bit because Samsung is really
working hard to make itself stand out
and to insulate itself from his
competition and the way it did that I
see yes by making it out yeah well
sometimes always had a big booth well at
least for the past four years when I
better see so sad a big poof it's always
competed with LG for how much real
estate it occupies and Sony but this
year it actually built a cue around this
brief so that you you couldn't make any
mistake about when you're in Samsung's
territory when you're out of it right
everybody else you can kind of just walk
through their boobs and into somebody
else's it's kind of its kind of
communist in that respect baby there's
no walls you can just walk 40 G's phrase
straight into panel
make it and stumbling to show with
Samson there's a big-ass key I mean
humongous cube where the whole thing is
contained and it's no Samson and and
it's just not only that but what are the
entrances to the cube had their giant
85-inch easel for ktv m and so not only
could you only go in one way there are
two entrances one of the entrances was
the entire show mobbed with people so
you had to fight your way in and fight
your way out it was it was it was crazy
which is either attempts at once it
won't get crowds and it wants to crush
people if there are def stairs Sam say
would be like yes achievement we have so
many people coming that they can't even
survive entry internally someone gets
promoted while Samsung pushes out a PR
saying they're pretty oh that's so
terrible i'm sorry you said but you said
you had something to say about graph
search facebook's graph search i mean i
was there at the event I mean it looks
fine I don't know we've got a couple of
reports up on it work I think there's
another one I'm sorry I couldn't be more
bored by that I was so looking forward
to something vaguely mobile related it
wasn't alone yeah there was no phone and
there was no bubble product so like uh
even all the way at the whole event not
a single thing with mobile was mentioned
until the Q&amp;amp;A section with somebody got
up and was like when I can I use this on
my phone and suck was like ah we're
working on it hey I don't know okay well
thankfully I've had enough time to
censor my question which is what the
funk is this garbage Wow like Facebook
has been such a data mining operation
for such a long time and now they're
giving us a social search which is in
order for it to quote unquote work way
to get facebook even more data and we
need to create I mean this is a stimulus
to make us create even more connections
and have even more barely you know
Bailey acquaintances turned into quote
unquote friends it's just
I mean I see listen for Facebook's
perspective this graph search it's
perfect idea of it it's like a
supermarket loyalty card like minimal
expense for them maximum ceiling in
terms of obtaining even more stuff which
is valuable for them what does this help
me I mean it helps us gather the picture
search is really great I mean look I
look at it this way people are analyzing
this through the the same lens that
people analyze the change in instagrams
terms of service we and you'll I make
this point really well like we
fundamentally mistrust Facebook and
everything that Facebook does we look at
it through that lens of distrust if you
can step back from that lens of distrust
and be like well Facebook needs better
search so Facebook is going to build
good search what's the natural search
for facebook content that like makes
sense in the context of Facebook and I
think it's pretty close to what they
built the interesting thing to me is
like how influential is this kind of
searching going to be in the future I
mean you don't search for that this kind
of stuff on Google right you search for
a different kind of thing on google and
you search for a different kind of thing
on facebook and so will those two worlds
kind of colliding some point like Google
like Google did search plus your world
and stuck Google+ stuff into its core
search people got pissed facebook is
kind of like their big stuff is kind of
like an ad on its way at the bottom it's
pretty terrible but neither one of them
are like neither one of them are
colliding and so the big question for me
is like it's fine that Facebook is added
search and I hope it gets on mobile soon
and that's great but what happens in two
years when you know the stuff that I
want to search for is an amalgam of the
stuff that's on facebook and the stuff
that Google can find and for the audio
podcast this is DITA just did a dance
yeah that was amalgamation dance it's my
I need to stay awake and I'm standing up
automation dance well I mean I should
caveat you jazz hands to any any
impressions i have about it by the fact
that i don't have it yet so i haven't
used it and end eaters i think the only
one is the three of us it's actually
used it so yeah you guys signed up it
sits up on my count I I signed up but uh
I'm on the waitlist I think get led into
cool kid party yet ya know I got I think
I think they let people at the event get
on the waitlist early and so we went and
shot a video Ellis Ellis hamburger and I
right away and the video was terrible
because I was like I was tired now shaky
and I forgot my little tent pole tripod
which I feel stupid about and so it was
a terrible video and so I go back and I
start cutting the video and like this is
really bad and then I checked and I had
it and so um I gave my Facebook
credentials to Thomas you so I was like
don't look at my junk have fun I do real
hands-on with a proper video producer
and worked out great he did a great job
the video please yourself see that's the
kind of trust at facebook wants yeah the
kind of trust you had in Thomas you
stood not to totally destroy your
facebook world yeah which he totally
could have and the rest of my world too
because my world is completely on
facebook but there's a point I think
dance point is very at least a very
important thing which is that Facebook
is increasingly being designed for
people who use it in a really committed
way I mean for example what I did
recently was i just trimmed them a
facebook friend list to 18 yeah i've
been trying to i try to trick me on my
facebook friendless I like go in I've
got you know because there was a while
where I was adding everybody like when I
started at the record I was like oh yeah
sure come on in right be able to talk to
you guys but now I'm trying to trim it
down and I only managed to last about 15
minutes before I get tired of it because
there's so much scrolling and waiting
and clicking and waiting check your king
and yeah blah blah blah it's really hard
to just like defriend everybody or just
like I don't quickly get rid of people
there's lots of clicks that's super
aggravating anyways I'm not sure dude
don't think about Facebook is really
hard and frustrating I I post sometimes
I posed verse stories to the verge
Facebook stream and I will click like
today I will click post it will not show
up it will seem like it's still loading
but I will know is posted and you know
if i go back to the facebook page it's
there so it's it's like the whole
interface
kind of busted I gotta be honest with me
i cannot avoid all right like I think
our generation or our demographic has a
version to facebook that is not shared
by the rest of the world or the like
people older and people younger I feel
like like we came on it was early it was
hip it was cool way better than myspace
and now it's kind of like all of our own
you know college friends and all their
friends are there and some family stuff
but you know the majority of people are
like still lovin life playing words with
friends hooked up to Facebook they're
still posting photos um so there's
there's a bit of a you know it's it's
hard to it's hard to like get a sense of
how do the vast majority of people
really feel about Facebook because the
vast majority people are just using it
and just fine with it it's the internet
for them I mean I don't mean to sound
like an elitist but I feel her that's
just lag perpetual lag between the guys
who tack on to the more useful and more
functional things first and then the
guys who catch up later lag is the
reason that a was to exists all right no
the reason that AOL still exists is
because have you ever tried to cancel a
dial-up a well-planned its heart it's
harder than unfriending every single
person on Facebook individually oh oh 1
billion is what you say yes all 1
billion so you want a friend all 1
billion and then go ahead and unfriend
all of them you'd have an easier time
than trying to cancel your dial up uh
subscription with a twill that you've
had since 1995 yeah well that's good to
know keep in mind and try to stay clear
of a well services but also less a job a
quick mention for myspace because they
just this week launched their new
service yeah I shoulda like baby I
haven't listened to the song yet no it's
terrible what what's what's his nickname
what do we how do we how to refer to
justin timberlake and with only like
four or five letters I've no idea what
do you mean like isn't it JT JT just
calm JT so I was so does JT comedy but
too many syllables in his name work on
yeah exactly
I mean pecan goes in that effort when I
do the verge mobile show everybody wear
your favorite mobile editors display
just how out of touch with pop culture
they are and how sad and ancient their
music tastes are and how much they're
not like you because there doesent hey
hey haina even Justin Timberlake is
getting a bit ancient now mean he's been
around for over a day okay so so this is
really funny because just last week at
CES I think I was complaining to a bunch
of coworkers and dieter you were
probably in the car at the time about
how justin timberlake hadn't released
anything since 2006 and I was like
what's he doing and then like Monday his
new song comes out and I'm like what is
this this is not a sport so so I'm on
the up-and-up I'm sure Dan youyou asked
for more justin timberlake in I like
last album is great so okay we're a goal
it will leave that for Dennis weird
podcast what's move ok now okay they did
this cross promotional thing where he
launched a song and they launched the
new myspace to the public it was really
accessible via invites I jumped into it
I got into it it's really bare bones I
think the whole idea is for your content
to be highlighted in to be permanent it
tries to have a more modern UI if you if
you just start typing it does this
massive screen dominating search which I
should can enjoy I find it fun
interesting but it's just bare so I rent
I've had a beta invite for months now
and when I first got it I like clicked
in an 8a invite yes abita yeah uh I
clicked in and I think I filled out like
half of my profile and then I just was
like I give up I don't want to go
through this anymore like there's like
nothing drawing me there to like you
right everything what makes you guys
happy because when all the stuff is
there you complain that all the stuff is
there Pete and Facebook's trying to pull
your junk in and like make you feel
stuff out like half content like oh
that's creepy I don't want all that
stuff but then when nothing is there and
it's you know an empty think what what's
your perfect happy medium where I got
out about of social now I've got two
points to raise first I just said
facebook is trying to pull your junkie
well they did at least they did release
a snapchat clone I mean I'm just saying
all right uh where's with my space fair
point I mean listen if you if you force
me to pick between Facebook and MySpace
'as interfaces it's an easy easy win for
my space granted but dense point is with
a new myspace what essentially doing is
oh here we go another new social service
in order to me to make this useful I
need to hook up with other people i'm
already hooked up with via twitter and
then start sending myspace messages
between us which is what i already do on
twitter unless Assad who doesn't follow
anybody in Twitter hey I follow 78
people I think that's plenty how many of
them are a number i'm not gonna I was
gonna make a carrot joke but it's mean
it's it's played its tired um no but
dude just diversify you used like yellow
turnips hail o yalter Wow what else it
ever got parsnips pauses good today yo
he also likes cauliflower and broccoli
oh yes I know how people live a
cauliflower I'm not even joking why it's
it's like it's like that it's like a
non-food like whatever what could you do
with cauliflower except like soak it in
butter like and like there's this it's i
mean that's kind of how i feel about
every vegetable if it's not soaking
butter or cheese or slept well i don't
know i could appreciate vegetables like
cauliflower it's it's like it's just
like a I don't know that's terrible you
know and you know the worst though is
the worst is watercress watercress is I
hate it I hate it so much there's
nothing good about watercress dude with
cauliflower is the texture first of all
and secondly you do have to refine you
put palate and not you know destroy it
every weekend we like in and out burgers
and salty freaky stuff like that right
now Eddie in-n-out burgers in vegas and
i was actually quite mad I was really
hoping for an in-n-out burger and I have
to tell you I have to tell you this is
a little side one of us that's a little
anymore well a little side to the
digression okay but one of our UK
writers was crazy enough and I know
who's been talking to him but I will
find out but he was crazy enough on the
last day in Las Vegas to walk 45 minutes
to the nearest in and out joint to have
one of those burgers yeah because he was
towed that is so very good he couldn't
miss out on it I'm waiting for the part
that sounds unreasonable yeah okay all i
know is that i have to be back in vegas
for ctia in May so Oh God whoo into now
it's gonna be like top of my list yesyes
him uh but i was thinking of any i go
back to stuff we're we're gonna be back
in barcelona for mobile world congress
all new venue at siena finality that is
exciting yeah I am I leaks are starting
to come out and the HTC m7 flagship we
had a it was basically it was like a
render from a demo video or something
and I've got a link wrong in our show
notes so I can't look at it right now
but it looks like like take the back of
an iphone add an extra grill to it and
like may get the front of the all right
I don't get how people I guess because
of the two-tone design people are saying
it looks like an iphone it doesn't look
anything like an iPhone to me it does oh
I'm looking at it again look at the look
at the ridge look at how it's like just
a square with the round right over it
looks like it looks like an EVO flank
able to eat you know it looks like it
looks like an iphone uh yeah it does
then it is two-tone and it's also the
proportions of the bits which are to
each other the shape is an EVO 4G LTE to
me you're trying too hard man just just
look at it how big is we supposed to be
on this m7 device 4.7 I think 1080p ahhh
kill me kill me now I give up you know
listen if glad did you know that you got
a shout-out on John goobers last podcast
talking about why nobody seems to want
to make a flagship four-inch screen
phone yeah somebody tweeted at me about
that on Twitter
absolutely say that anyways looking at
this render uh okay you know I phone
look like or not if the final product is
anything like that that would imply that
is a really small border around the
display and a really small bezel and
that could be really cool right yeah so
a small footprint maybe now i can't wait
for HTC to release another piece of
awesome hardware hobli with middling
software and have nobody care because
Samsung spends almost a billion dollars
on well not matter how much I actually
spend they spend millions upon millions
upon millions of dollars on marketing
like I don't know how HTC wins at this
point I mean if they keep I mean that
the One X was great the one XL was a
nice spec bump and this thing looks like
it's going to be cool and compelling an
awesome and I i mean i'm sorry i wish
that it would make it a dent but i'm
afraid it's not gonna how many HTC
commercials was DC on TV 0 he's i see
you know you see a couple here and there
like when a device first hits the market
but you see samsung commercials all the
time all day long for like all of their
flagship devices so you guys don't need
to worry about that because peter chao
is promised he's gonna spend more
marketing because he's convinced that
human markets a 4.7 inch foam which
sends hard enough people are going to
bite other than germs people would do
this wrong but oh that's a lot right
well if he's right then it's time to
bring out the napalm because people ok
seriously I'm giving HTC advanced
warning if I'm the guy who gets his
hands on this 4.7 inch device the first
thing I'm going to say is he is HTS
latest phone is too big end of story it
just is no and you know what I'm gonna
go Eagles remarkably small what if like
they manage to you won't plays a 4.7
inch display it just fits physics right
it is the same reason we don't have you
know an f 1.4 lens which is the size of
a coin right it's physics you can't get
around it is it a and I will completely
avoid sounding like a fanboy for any
other
and I'll give you guys the perfect
counter example the HTC one sv yeah like
first of all because of HTC's still
confused branding you don't know what
the device looks like because you're not
really sure which of the 1-series it is
but what I can tell you I mean come on
be honest you don't like maybe you guys
do but most people be like one sv let me
look that up and then I'll know what's
up yeah um it's a 4.3 inch Super LCD to
display its supposed recent one yet it
just came out on ee with LTE here in the
UK and this imagine it's on cricket here
Lee was right and it has a flame red
back cover and smacks it looks so good
it looks so good and you know eric lin
who works at HTC one of our good friends
he was saying now that you guys have the
one as we in your hands you can tell
what i mean about it being the best
design HD since the nexus one that's
what he recently tweeted on Twitter and
I think I think he has a point I don't
know that I necessary with him a hundred
percent but it feels good in the hand it
feels like it's the right size sense
feels like sense which is bad but the
size of it is right okay the 4.3 inch
size the form factor is right it could
be slimmer it could be you know it could
have high quality materials you could
have more things that can play a
flagship device but it's so much better
like it does remind me of the One X in
terms of its as I say here in UK it's
white is the matte white recover and you
remastered the One X but it feels like
the One X in you know much more
palatable proportions yeah it just fits
it so it makes so much more sense to me
it's as if I expect that it's wvga right
i mean that i do also feel as much as as
much grief as i'm getting to these
companies i do you feel like if they
want a headline-grabbing display they
have to go to 4.7 inches because they
can't get those 720p
days that well i was at something that's
sitting back at the point that i'm a
library yes it's that well yeah it's
they're doing a pretty decent job of it
it's not quite 720p is a little over or
something it was making us we ended up
giving we need to stop giving these
companies credit engineering credit for
building big ass phones because it's
easier I think at this game than
building something that's directly
competitive with the iPhone the iPhone
ism a marvel of design and packing stuff
into a tiny form factor and you know
it's just like you can build a big huge
phone with a big huge screen well of
course you can because you've got more
space to work with try and do it smaller
see what see what you can do and then
exactly HTC is capable of it if you look
at the the the original ones though or
the windows phone 8x has a 4.3 inch 720p
display it's not a massive bulky count
it's a little too square it could be a
little more ergonomic but it's thin it's
light you know I would love to see an
android phone and HTC's line up with
those that hardware but and this episode
the resound which also has no point for
you 720p right now you're just rollin
man yeah have you held the recipe oh
those like you're tough each other The
Rose money i'm totally on board with
what he just said like if you're going
for yet another big phone you're playing
it safe and if HTC looks around guys
like nokia and blackberry the one thing
it shouldn't be doing is playing it safe
because that's what Nucky and blackberry
did for years okay i know this for a
fact because years and years ago 23
years ago when i was to writing for a
gadget it was the case that every single
article that criticizes nokia being
sluggish in embracing touch screens no
keep being slow in rolling out an
updated touch-friendly symbian people
like look at nokia's market share their
fine right nokia took way too long
played it way too safe rim mike
lazaridis jim balsillie they're way too
cocky and arrogant about their market
share to wait too long still taking way
too long until this freak
blackberry 10 thing happens right played
it way too safe until now that when a
desperate I don't think HTC should carry
on waiting like this and other thing is
you just carry on doing the same thing
because it isn't working out so just
freaking do it like if HTC needs to make
a loss on displays but give us an
amazing 4.3 inch device I think you
should do it just to get some of that
competitors back against answer because
at the moment the way things are shaping
up I mean Samsung and selling phones
like crazy yes building up a brand
cachet it's making itself insular from
the rest of the other brands and people
are starting to really associate with
the Samsung brand more so than with
Android nowadays I mean not entirely
good you know people like it's a samsung
phone which messes you know and they
anticipate an ex galaxy they're
everywhere I just love a loved one one
of us makes a point and the other people
have nothing to disagree with we just
kind of weight from the trail off
because we have nothing to jump in and
say no no you're wrong yeah well just to
add to his point seems like did announce
I think just this week that there's they
sold 100 billion galaxies family phones
and twice as many galaxies threes as 22
so you know they're out there and and
every time I travel I always notice you
know on the plane say what people are
using and what or if I want to train
what look the ways they're using and
like it used to be years ago is all
blackberrys on a plane then it's all
iphones and now it's like as many
iphones as i see i see various samsung
devices and different colors and stuff
like that so the one thing i don't see
our HTC devices oh yeah so yeah I mean
Samsung has been just not how how the
Galaxy Note became a success I still
don't know and now the guys you know to
is just yet another success it's just
kind of crazy just exactly what I'm
saying the only way you can counter that
the only way you can counter that is to
be as aggressive and is bonkers as
Samson like HTC tried I mean before the
Galaxy Note do something very close in
the HD file just that he was so crazy
first you mention the Razon now you
bring up the flyer you're really
bringing up all of HTC's hits uh so the
thing is that goes back to we were
talking about rim how it's it's
appearing that rim is going to be able
to get its device on all four carriers
at the same time HTC has not done that
yet it has yet to have a similar device
or very close device on all four
carriers at the same time samsung
started that with the galaxy s2 with
minor variants and then the galaxy s3
blew it out and then the note 2 blew it
out where every carrier a major carry in
the u.s. pretty much wants to have that
device on their phone their their lineup
and they're not insisting on dry
dramatically altering it if you look at
hcc in say twenty twelve they had the 1x
come out on 18 teen but then it was a
totally different device on sprint
verizon still doesn't really have
anything except it until the droid DNA
which was again a totally different
device later in the year um and so
there's a lot of things that HTC has to
do if it wants to mimic samsung and
that's just one one part of it as I
trail off man we'd we're we don't even
need to talk about the other crap that
we've got on our list I mean uh we'll
see what HTC mobile world congress is
HTC show right I don't know like I don't
I don't know if it's like it's a show
that HTC doesn't speak stuff I don't
know HTC owns overruled Congress they
did the 1x last year so yeah and one
series actually I don't think we're
gonna see Samsung try and do anything
huge there I think there are people just
gonna let HTC have their have their day
in the Sun and hopefully they'll manage
to eeka a couple of weeks out of it once
they do I don't I mean we've had a bunch
of t mobile news that you know the CEO
said that the subsidies are going to end
in three or four months and just amazing
quotes about him going after 80s crap
network in New York and even like even
making fun of horizon um you know will
you know will track and see how tmobile
does but basically at this point I'm
just super excited that t-mobile has a
rap arouser in charge
they just love saying crazy stuff
totally i'm totally in agreement with
that yes and also i didn't know what
this guy looked like until i saw some
pictures from our coverage of CES
appearance he's amazing and the way he
was dressed in that series together like
he dresses like jimmy iovine yeah i mean
i'd like sequins on his jacket and then
there was this brightly brightly colored
big tee t-shirt underneath I was like
that's the CEO is the cap yeah yeah to
do was out there but uh listen compared
to previously yeses where we were like
which CEO has a best mustache and we'll
the verizon agency competition in the
chat sparkling cyanide says he looks a
little bit like Willem Dafoe he's like a
crazy CEO version of Willem Dafoe I
totally see it yeah I got he's like he's
like the Green Goblin from the first
spider-man movies but large of a company
so like as far as like the scale of CEOs
you've got you've got a Dan Meade from
verizon who's like super straight-laced
suit and tie every appearance and ralph
de la Vega and ETTs again super straight
lace and then then you step down to dan
hesse from sprint who will you notate
loosen his tie and well you dress please
step down because even when dan hesse is
on a lower step he's still towers above
the other guys because 18 feet tall yeah
yeah he's he's physically tall but like
he'll take his jacket off and he's known
to open his shirt up and loosen up and
though and then you've got t-mobile
who's just like III don't even know how
to describe straight cash permanently
inebriated that might be a good one who
actually is it isn't it fun though that
the way that I got I got the way they
covered those Dust Bowl stage with LTE i
think is admirable like man I'm so
actually it is admirable that they that
you can go in the middle of nowhere in
America and get LTE on horizon like
that's actually like I I honestly think
he was complimenting verizon there like
like he went between this like flip flop
you would like say that it's a beautiful
work and it's really great and he loves
it and then he would say something like
uh once you start to watch porn on your
phone your your shared data plans just
gonna go evaporate so i think i think
the Dust Bowl comment was on the flip of
the positive I saw more honesty on a
match com ad than 18 tease coverage maps
Wow come on how'd you down love this guy
yeah I was just gonna say is it's kind
of amusing and fun that the two underdog
networks in the US actually have the two
most likable CEOs yeah among carries and
actually among even if you include the
Vice way because nobody's as amusing as
you know dan has he and this crazy new
tmobile guy I mean honestly like from
among the CEOs I would say Jensen Kwan
from Nvidia is the only one who comment
always always CEOs is a bunch of fun he
he just he doesn't care he lets it rip I
meetings piece on China nobody matches
monster CEO so oh my god don't even so I
should get connect can I put us back to
mwc because a little way too early i'm
not even healthy from CES yeah yeah go
ahead no I mean doesn't think we're way
too early to be previewing mwc but I do
you feel like now that he'll say yes
it's also kind of a relatively timely
time to assess how companies are going
to strategize i mean i agree with you GT
insofar as i think samsung is going to
repeat a strategy from last year which
is pull back from mwc with flagship
announcements do its own event and again
repeat the successful strategy of having
no connectivity wherever that event
happens so then you have me sitting in
the front row having spent three hours
trying to get into the event and time
and just getting to g and texting ppl
updates about the magician on stage and
samsung's crazy crazy presentations but
you know aside from those guys yes HTC
is going to try and blow out the event
LG didn't really bring anything special
to see you so they're gonna try and have
something major and LG said beautybaby
during its gonna be the view too I'm
telling you right now well they said
during their the presidency yes where
they're like trotting out the intuition
and talking about how great it was
consumed any people love that they
specifically said stay tuned at mwc
we'll have our big moment they already
had the optimus G like they they they
completely dominated what was even there
at the last UK and like it's at the base
of the nexus 4 like if they are gonna
try and like out Optimus G the optimus g
one I don't know what specs they put in
there wouldn't be completely ridiculous
and to like you know they didn't nail
the optimus G what I don't have a whole
lot of faith that they're going to nail
the next thing I mean don't get me wrong
compared to LG from a couple years ago
they're hitting they're firing on all
cylinders right but it's still I mean
that's damning with faint praise because
we're comparing to what they used to be
firing on all cylinders and moving
backwards well I mean lot last year
whatever G did and I know you remember
this fondly dita is they did a deluge of
phones mm-hmm and I remember fondly
because you had to take pics affirmative
as the l3 l5 II l7 vol.9 the online and
like there there there were four other
4x HD you forgot about that one and then
there was a 3d phone as well whatever
that was that was the the optimus 3d too
right yeah yeah thanks like I basically
like had a spreadsheet and life like you
know what gets grouped together what is
with an actual flagship it was it was a
huge pain yeah I mean big carbon bombed
the show with phones it was nuts I i
hope i'm not i'm not sure it's a hope
that we justify but I hope they try and
streamline that and they focus in on a
couple of devices I mean even if they do
three but they segmenting properly so
you have an entry-level phone mid-range
at a high end and I am that is just just
like that's it or the HTC one strategy
that they did last year right yeah right
I mean it just makes more sense to me I
don't India at the same time I can
saying that but then Samsung successful
strategy has been the carpet bombing
approach as well you know when they say
hundred million Galaxy devices that's
galaxy s one galaxy s doing what Samsung
dodos I mean they carpet bomb but they
only put their muscle behind the gs3 and
a little bit of note right yeah yeah and
then the rest is trickle down it's
trickle-down economics man yeah I mean
who knew economics I'm just wondering
like it kind of feels like this is a
limited number of companies who will
make a big splash at mwc because Sony
made a special experience Z 0 z all
right your zebra what I hopefully I mean
if we don't hear anything before at mwc
hopefully uh Sony will announce some
carrier partnerships for that but I
can't imagine them to announce another
flagship device right so it kind of
stuck motorola doesn't ever do anything
at mwc yeah it'd be nice if that changed
yeah i don't know if i see that
happening i really don't ok there's no k
i guess i guess if there's one thing to
be intrigued about yeah so HTC will do
obviously an android flagship they'll
probably do yet another Windows Phone
device I'm guessing but Nokia there has
been the Lumia 920 replacement rumor way
down aluminum or aluminium baton on a
minion construction so that could be
interesting you know going back to the
n8 / e7 designs way back in the day will
be fresh hardware could be good yeah I
can see no I i I'm betting that Nokia
wants to save something super flagship
for a separate on their own event but I
don't know we'll see I'm running out of
steam how about you guys I don't think
I've got the energy to talk about
ridiculous Apple China rumors that it
came out and then were immediately
debunked yeah no can yeah I say cheese
yea though there's Billy something maybe
who knows who cares still some kind
phone china I mean who knows okay well
if okay if we can dedicate like a couple
of minutes to Apple I just want to make
mention of the ipod touch and I was
really random but I I played around with
my probably my foots ipod touch he's got
he's got one of those most obscure
device in the world go 64 gigabyte ipod
touch ah he still feels really good
about buying you should it's great most
people think is crazy they double-fist
with it he uses whatever phone which i
think he usually uses a windows phone
and then he actually liked for apps he
carry around his ipod touch that's right
he's going to Lumia 920 so uses Lumia
920 foots phone and the ipod touch for
what is absent apple stuff but the thing
is I actually really love the design of
that freaking thing is great yeah
gorgeous I feel like that you can click
in and out which is what I did one
afternoon in the trailer to just SAT
there pressing the button on Sam's ipod
touch I was in front of the iphone no no
for the loop the the button on the back
of it that's like right there that was
like to open to put the loop in you know
you like double click it I don't know
it's just very satisfying to click OK
did I didn't know about that I didn't
notice it but I seriously this is new
design and the curvature of the back and
in the sides is so much friendlier for
holding it in the hand I mean the first
thing is is thinner than the iphone
right in the air phone but the curvature
of it and the feel of it in the hand is
just much better in my opinion and I was
thinking if apple's next big redesign
for the iphone is to bring it in line
with our design maybe notice then
because he has have a bigger battery has
have LTE and those things uh i would be
quite content with that like i'll
consider that significant upgrade what
do you guys think i agree sorry i got
distracted by links not your fault but I
completely agree with everything you
just said you give me the thumbs-up been
nice
yes well anyway and that now that Apple
has our design ideas I'm sure they're
listening as well Tim Cook has emerged
yes Knesset its know that they watched
the virtual show yeah I mean it's
awesome under the apple podcasts app
came out just for the Virgin Mobile show
say God that app is the worst I hate it
so hard and and also it's known that if
you want to find a village Bhogle show
on iTunes you have to look in the blue
genre I think that was a mistake for CES
we don't know that we're sorry sorry
about that I think that was appropriate
weight we tend to lose most of the time
anyway you know I think I think it was
appropriate for that show that we shot
because we were enjoying some libations
and just jamming to some blues yeah that
friends is the ridge mobile show thank
you so much for watching to listening
those talk about vegetables and two
trailing off so that we can crash and
