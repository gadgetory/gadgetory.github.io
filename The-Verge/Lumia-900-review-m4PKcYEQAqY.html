we're taking a look at the Nokia Lumia
900 a Windows Phone device that's being
sold here in America on AT&amp;amp;T and
utilizes ATT's new LTE network and in my
opinion this is the most unique looking
device on the market in fact I think
it's one of the most beautiful gadgets
ever designed the body of it is made
from this high-test plastic it's a
polycarbonate material
it feels really solid in your hand and
very thick and seems like it could
withstand a drop without getting too
banged up in comparison to the other
phones that are on the market it just is
in a league of its own as far as design
is concerned the only thing that really
comes close to it at this point is HTC's
new 1x which uses a very similar build
but I think in terms of artistry the
Lumia 900 beats it out there are a
couple of interesting things of note
about the design you can see at the top
here there's a little door you can open
up using a paper clip or a tool that
Nokia actually gives you to put a sim in
I had a little trouble with popping this
up and then putting it back down it
eventually goes flush with the device
but it feels like it's never quite in
there perfectly I'm probably nitpicking
but it's something I noticed the buttons
on the side of the phone feel relatively
good I'm not crazy about the silver
material used for them the display of
the device is an AMOLED screen it's 4.3
inches and has a resolution of 800 by
480 so it's not that high of a
resolution it utilizes the technology
that Nokia calls clear black they've
been using this for a little while on
their devices and it's not really
notable except for the fact that it's a
little bit less reflective than other
displays out there as I mentioned the
resolution is not that high on this
device and coupled with its size you
really can see some pixels and jagged
edges in the Windows Phone interface the
white on black text in particular looks
bad to my eyes as with many AMOLED
displays the colors also seem
oversaturated to me and that can be
somewhat jarring on the back of the
phone there's an 8 megapixel camera with
Carl Zeiss optics and a dual LED flash I
had pretty mixed results with this
camera it takes a decent photo in terms
of focus and image quality but I felt
colors seemed really wah
out and there was also this annoying
pink spot that I've seen on other phones
I don't know why it's there it's clearly
an issue with the sensor and it was a
little bit depressing to discover
performance on the phone was perfectly
in line if not better than every other
Windows Phone device I've used the
performance was snappy getting into and
out of apps was easy and I saw no
hiccups no stuttering webpages loaded
relatively quickly it feels like a very
fast device it's only when you start
digging a little bit deeper into Windows
Phone that problems arise there are
certainly lots of ways in Windows Phone
to accomplish the tasks that you need to
get done and you know there's games you
can play and a few third-party apps that
are decent but overall I found the
interface and the time it takes to do
things and the way you do them to be
rather clunky and I think at this point
we kind of have to stop giving Windows
Phone a pass it's just not up to snuff
in comparison to its nearest competitors
and that's a real problem I wanted to
love this phone I wanted to love the
operation of it but the second I started
using it for any length of time
I just felt constrained by what Windows
Phone was capable of and in some of the
ways it carried out tasks you know the
Lumia 900 is just an OK phone
I think Nokia and Microsoft are really
hoping this is going to be the device
that puts them back on the map and gets
people to take notice of what they're
doing and based on the design of the
phone I do believe that people will
notice unfortunately I think they're
gonna be a little bit disappointed when
they see what's under the covers
