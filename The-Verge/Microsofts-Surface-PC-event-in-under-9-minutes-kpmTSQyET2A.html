today so today I'm so excited to
announce the next release of Windows 10
that will ship this coming spring for
free to every Windows 10 device whether
you own one now but buy a great new one
this holiday we have named this release
the Windows 10 creators update so we're
going to focus on the three most
important areas in the creators update
first expanding on our vision for mixed
reality with 3d for everyone second
gamers can experience the best in 4k
gaming and third everyone while a faster
way to connect and share with the people
who matter most I'm proud to announce
with the Windows 10 creators update 3d
is for everyone I'm going to show you
how we can capture this castle with our
windows capture 3d experience now here
you can see the sandcastles taking shape
in front of me today I used HP's Windows
Phone the x3 but we envisioned this
experience on any device I'm excited to
announce that with the Windows 10
creators updates we are introducing
paint 3d so here you can see I've got a
daughter a photo of my daughters and I'm
going to go ahead and turn this into a
3d memory let's start with a crop here
using our magic select which allows me
to remove the background from the photo
and just keep my daughter's I'd like to
add a few more memories from that day
and I have just the perfect item in mind
that exact same sandcastle that I just
scanned moments ago is now a 3d object
in paint fortunately because we are
working in true 3d I can easily move
them into the right depth of the scene
so another way that we are making 3d
creations easy for everyone is with
remix 3d comm this is a community we're
building for people to share discover
and be inspired by 3d with the creators
update you'll also be able to 3d print
them from right here in
community we are excited to announce our
partnership with Trimble to bring
Sketchup and there are millions of
creators and creations from 3d warehouse
to be part of our community the doodle
tool allows me to take any 2d free
sketch with a pen and instantly turn it
into 3d the sticker tool allows you to
take any 2d image and effectively stamp
it to a 3d object just like a texture
Microsoft edge was the first browser to
bring inking to the web and now it's the
first browser to fully embrace 3d for
everyone on hololens Microsoft edge
becomes this incredible portal for
digital content to enter into your real
world as a hologram we can take this
creation put it right into the space so
I'm going to go ahead and select it and
I'm gonna place it right about here
today we want to show you a proof of
concept that demonstrates how house
users through Microsoft edge on hololens
can preview products in their own home
before they buy this one looks good I'm
gonna select it I'm gonna place it right
about here we're bringing a whole new
set of affordable virtual reality
accessories to your Windows 10 PC Taj is
now going to put on one of these virtual
reality accessories let's see how the
same Windows experience we just saw on
hololens now carries over to the virtual
world here Taj is outside the Roman
pantheon in Halle tour this is just one
of the many examples of places that you
can visit in holo tour and one of the
many experiences that Windows 10 and
mixed reality enables with the creators
update our partners including HP Dell
Lenovo Asus and Acer will be shipping
virtual reality headsets like Taj just
demoed
these headsets will be the first and
only to ship with inside out six degrees
of freedom sensors we are announcing
today that these creators update
accessories will start at just 299
dollars with the creators update we're
making it so each of us can become a
game broadcaster because we're building
game broadcast technology right into
Windows with the creators update we're
giving players the ability to create
custom tournaments using arena on Xbox
Live I'm excited to announce that bid
stream audio pass through including
dolby atmos support is coming with the
creator's update for blu-rays on xbox
one today I am proud to show you how we
are placing people at the center of
Windows what if you could simply drag
any content directly to Vicky's view the
message and send cup when I get that
urgent text from my husband Peter who's
currently at the store on his phone and
trying to get in touch with me I'll see
it right on my desktop and in one simple
place I can change from Skype to the
mail app I can see the mail he's
referring to read the content of that
mail and then quickly respond in the app
of my choice the windows 10 creators
update will introduce shoulder taps
whether that's my daughter Jillian
reaching out with a heart and a smile or
even my coworker Vicky saying it is time
for me to get off the stage with a mic
drop and every now and then in pursuing
our mission we see the opportunity to
create a new category of device please
welcome Panos our leader of Microsoft
devices yeah

inch diagonal that's 28 inches across
