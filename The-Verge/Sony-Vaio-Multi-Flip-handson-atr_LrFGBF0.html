and we're looking at sony vaio fit multi
flip PC now at the moment it just looks
like your standard ultrabook and it's
got an aluminum sort frame here and a
trackpad and the usual sort of
full-frame keyboard and the real unique
thing about this is it's got a little
release and lock mechanism here now if
we keep it locked you can close the lid
and just looks like it looks like an
ultrabook and we were kind of split here
now if we go back and then release it we
notice is we can do this pop the screen
out it's like magnetically attached so
you can click it straight back into
place and what it will do is you'll be
able to pull it all the way back and
then straight down into a tablet mode
now it's also got a digitizer and a
stylist I thought she hasn't got slot to
put this in but you know it's going to
work with adobe photoshop it's pressure
sensitive so it's pretty good in that
sense and you can also just sort of get
it into the standard laptop mode or if
you just want to use the trackpad luck
there
well you can flip it around the back and
spin it around it's kind of looks like a
yoga right now I want to see ASA and
Samsung I've got very similar products
this but it's kind of unique in in the
way that Sony's sittings done it here
and the aluminum at the back and what
all around the device it feels quite
good and it's kind of a little heavy you
can be using as a tablet so so it's not
the it's not the finished of devices and
it's actually this is the 13-inch model
which comes with Haswell processor and
1920 x 1080 display and you can't get 15
inch models that have higher resolution
as well in terms of ports actually got a
full hdmi port which is kind of unusual
it's got a SD for SD and usual USB on
the slide there you've got the camera at
the rear and in your power and your
headphone jacks rounder side and as a
volume toggle right the back just next
to the power button as you see it's
quite a complex device so it doesn't
doesn't close quite as neatly as you
might expect to it but and that's the
vaio fit a multi philip pc
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
