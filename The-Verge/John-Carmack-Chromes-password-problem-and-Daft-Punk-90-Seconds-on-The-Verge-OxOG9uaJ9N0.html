adrianne jeffries the Verge's second 3d
printed writer and this is 90 seconds on
the verge John Carmack the gaming legend
behind titles like doom and quake has
joined oculus as chief technology
officer Carmack has long been a
supporter of the virtual reality headset
and even helped optimize dhoom3 for an
early prototype it's software the
company Carmack founded says he's taking
time off to focus on oculus but he'll
still be involved with games currently
in development here's a neat party trick
give me your laptop for 30 seconds and
I'll show you every password you've ever
saved in Chrome unlike other browsers
chrome doesn't require any user
authentication before it gives up your
secrets and they can even be accessed
directly by typing a simple URL the
scarier part is that Google is well
aware of this and is not looking to
change it anytime soon google says it
doesn't want to quote provide users with
a false sense of security and encourage
risky behavior next up password purity
ring's and finally daft punk's
much-hyped appearance on The Colbert
Report was not quite what we were
expecting the French DJ duo dropped out
of their appearance at the last minute
on Monday afternoon the reason Daft Punk
could give an MTV the exclusive on any
TV appearance is leading up to a
surprise appearance at the video music
awards later this month this didn't stop
Colbert from tearing apart MTV and Daft
Punk and lining up an impressive list of
cameos including jimmy fallon jeff
bridges and the cast of Breaking Bad and
although MTV made things clear with Daft
Punk robin thicke blurred the line by
stepping in to perform on the show
that's it for today's top stories coming
up tomorrow we sit down with the first
test tube grandpa spoiler he still
smells like Werther's Originals</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
