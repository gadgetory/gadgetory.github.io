the verge is the problem surrounding
smartphone batteries regardless of which
next-gen battery technology you're using
lithium-ion batteries tend to just die
during the day anyways besides can't
come up with better battery technology
it can at least change how quickly we
charge our batteries USBC for Android
phones and the lightning cable for
iPhones are not capable of delivering
hours of battery life with minutes of
charging it makes life easier if you're
running the meetings and don't want to
carry around battery packs but just how
fast can we charge our phones not just
presently but how fast can fester can
get in the future so before we get into
fast charging let's take a refresher
course volts amps and watts let's look
at it like this volts represent the
amount of electricity available in your
wall outlet the current or amperage is
controlled using your charging brick and
is the rate at which electricity travels
and finally the watts are the total
electrical power that gets into your
phone
this means that watts are the products
of volts and amps vaults times amps
equals watts in order to charge our
battery we can increase the Volt's and
charge it faster if we increase the
amperage we could also occur the battery
faster and if we increased both we can
drastically increase the power going
into the battery the thing you need to
remember about any energy transfer is
resistance the byproduct which is Heat
excessive heat for batteries as we know
is really really bad historically most
USB chargers range from 5 to 12 watts
but they weren't able to charge fast and
stay cool today USBC has come a long way
it supports up to 100 watts charging
times set by the manufacturers and
supports a wide variety of devices to
make sure that the battery doesn't
overheat
OAM is a Qualcomm and Apple install
devices called charge controllers they
regulate electricity going into the
device and make sure that they don't
over fall or overcharge and thus keep
the battery safe and cool for example if
I use a hundred watt power brick to
charge my macbook pro it'll use the full
hundred watts that's what it's supposed
to do but then if I put that same
charger into my phone the charge
controller will transfer the most power
it can use before davic is the bad
around 29 watts or so all fast-charging
standards like 1 + s - charge apples
fast charge or Qualcomm quick charge
basically do the same thing they charge
your battery safely quickly and they
make sure that doesn't overheat while
it's doing so
okay so what's fast charging performance
like nowadays well the fastest way to
charge your phone is with the cables out
of the box Android phones like galaxies
pixels oneplus devices or LG phones
should come with fast charger setups but
with Apple you'll need to buy a USB
power delivery break and USB see the
lightning cable that will allow you to
charge an iPhone 10 from 0 to 50% in 30
minutes
that's pretty good but what sort of
performance improvement are we gonna see
in the next couple years unfortunately
not much there is one concept that could
allow us to charge our phones a matter
of seconds and it's called a super
capacitor electrons make an electrical
field which allows them to travel much
faster the problem is though again
overheating but that's all theoretical
back to reality Qualcomm is working on
the next fast charging tech called quick
charge for plus it's actually available
on a couple phones right now but not
many quick charge for plus aims to not
only regulate heat better from the
conductor's but also charge the phone
even faster in fact Qualcomm designed a
reference smartphone which can charge
from zero to 50 percent in just 15
minutes
which is pretty fast your next flagship
smartphone is probably gonna be using
quick charge for plus and get closer to
those numbers and while those numbers
are an instant well at least your phones
will blow up thanks for watching and
remember not to use off-brand
or cheap cables for fast charging
because they can really mess up your
phone in your battery and if you want to
hear more about batteries head on over
