we're here taking a look at magic
instruments rhythm guitar the company is
basically trying to reinvent the guitar
by removing all of the strings along the
fret board and replacing them with
different buttons and by pressing one of
these buttons you program the guitar to
play a specific chord and then you just
strum and play the idea is that it's a
lot easier to learn to just press
different buttons than it is to figure
out the specific fingerings of every
individual chord you might want to play
and it's definitely true it is a lot
easier to just pick this up and start
strumming than it is an acoustic guitar
but there's still some learning to do
you have to figure out which button to
press to make which sound and you have
to learn how to move your fingers along
the fretboard which is a lot like an
acoustic guitar to help you learn magic
instruments is launching an app that's
basically like at our hero it'll lead
you through popular songs button by
button telling you what to press to make
which sound the hope is that eventually
you'll get pretty comfortable with it
and be able to go off and start playing
songs on your own magic instrument says
that the hardware is about 95% done but
the app that we saw still needs a lot of
work that's why they're not going to
start shipping until sometime early next
year this is never going to teach you
how to play acoustic guitar but if you
want something that's a little bit
easier that's still going to let you
play around then the rhythm guitar might
be for you I know you're here for this
