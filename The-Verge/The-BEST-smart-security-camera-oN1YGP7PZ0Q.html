decade security cameras have gotten
smart typically a smart home appliance
means you get a mobile app to tinker
with some settings and maybe some light
automation perhaps an Alexa integration
if you're lucky but do you really need a
camera in your home that knows it's your
dog and not your kid or that can tell
the difference between you or your
spouse it all depends on why you're
interested in a home security camera
what you think you're gonna use it for
and how many people in your household
you're trying to keep tabs on give them
that criteria the best indoor home
security camera for most people isn't
necessarily the smartest and it's
definitely not the most expensive but it
covers most spaces at a reasonable price
and it allows you add more features
through a cheap monthly cloud
subscription that device is the Amazon
Cloud cam for $119 it's cheaper than
most competing cameras and what you get
for the money is almost as good this
device is nearly three times the price
the camera itself is easy to set up in
pretty no frills it has night vision and
it can record and store HD footage up to
24 hours into the past or farther back
if you have Amazon's monthly
subscription it also has 2-way talk and
audio recording there are some downsides
the image quality isn't the greatest and
you get a fair deal of graininess and
noise especially when you use the cloud
cam zoom feature
and unlike nest cameras the cloud cam
doesn't continuously record it only
saves clips when it detects people or
motion one big plus the app is way less
cluttered than those from Nasty Netgear
and others it's just three screens an
account management panel a live video
feed and then a list of settings there
are some compromises you have to make
with the cloud cam beyond just picture
quality the camera on its own will only
do motion detection if you pay for
amazon $6.99 multi subscription you get
people detection which means it can
differentiate between humans and pets
but unlike cameras from nest the cloud
cam cannot do facial recognition so that
means you'll get constant notifications
if you have the cloud cam facing a busy
part of your home like the living room
or the kitchen if you do pay for
amazon's multi subscription you get a
feature called zones which lets you
section off parts of what the camera
sees to tell it to ignore activity in
that area so I don't think people are
really losing out on too much and the AI
shortcomings aren't enough to tank our
recommendation for one hundred and
nineteen dollars and all the additional
features you go with Amazon's
subscription plan the cloud cam is the
most capable camera for its price if
you're looking for something a little
pricier but high
quality and much much smarter nests
top-of-the-line nest cam IQ is a solid
by the mess cam IQ records in HD and it
comes with a night vision and a lot of
the other standard bells and whistles
but it's picture quality is stellar with
a 4k sensor with HDR you account for
changes in life it also has a powerful
microphone array and speaker so with
Google assistant built in the nest cam
IQ doubles is a mini Google home and
unlike the Amazon Cloud cam the nest cam
IQ continuously records so you can
scroll through a day's events with the
flick of a finger but the nest cam IQ
really stands out though isn't it's AI
features unlike the standard nest cam
this model knows when it sees a person
and not just a pet no subscription
required if you purchase the nest aware
subscription which starts at five
dollars a month and scales depending on
your video storage needs you get what
nest calls familiar face alerts that
lets the camera recognize people you can
even go into the mobile app and train it
to recognize certain faces and to create
profiles for people so it remembers them
later that said at two hundred and
ninety-nine dollars the nest cam IQ is
really pricey and you need to ask
yourself those AI features are really
worth it someone like me who lives in an
apartment and doesn't have kids or a lot
of people coming in and out all the time
it's a bit overkill also I found the
nest cam IQ to be a bit too sensitive on
the AI front it kept asking if it
recognized the faces of actors that saw
on my TV screen but if you have a larger
house and a bigger family and you want
to know when your kids come home from
school or where the dog is or whether
it's the babysitter or a burglar
entering your home then that's K Mike
you can handle all of that plus it's a
really nicely designed gadget there were
a lot of really solid devices out there
that will do a majority of the tests
most people are looking for and almost
every brand lets you link multiple
cameras together but there are a few
shortcomings and compromises here and
there that made it so other devices
didn't make the cut for instance the
Netgear are low Q has a ton of
customization settings and a lot of
features you'd find in a more
professional grade security camera like
using geofencing to arm and disarm the
camera and scheduling recording times
but it lacks any kind of smart AI
features to tell people from pets or to
do any kind of facial recognition it
does have motion detection but I found
out the system registered a lot of false
positives pushing me to limit
notifications the logitech circle 2 has
an ultra wide viewing angle and a pretty
fully featured mobile app but to get
people detection you're going
need to purchase the premium $10 a month
subscription service the camera is
weatherproof so you can use it outside
and it also integrates well with LexA
home kit and Google assistant but it's
more geared for people who want a camera
for outdoor surveillance purposes
truth be told security cameras are
pretty Spartan gadgets most people don't
need fancy AI perks like facial
recognition or super featured in mobile
apps they buy security cameras for peace
of mind and for that reason the Amazon
Cloud cam is the best camera for most
people at $120 it leaves enough in the
bank to buy more than one and down the
line the camera is down to get even
smarter as Amazon upgrades the software
and makes this Alexa digital assistant
even more advanced</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
