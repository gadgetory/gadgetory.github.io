event and it went surprisingly well they
didn't do all the silly things they
often do and they had a few good
surprises we're going to talk about the
three big things that you should know
from this event number one is microsoft
just making xbox one more like a pc
you're now going to be able to play some
games before they're actually released a
similar to an in beta type of thing that
is already available on steam for pc
gamers you're going to be able to have
mods at least in games like fallout 4
mods that are made for PC but available
in the xbox one version of the game it's
pretty interesting and pretty exciting
and maybe a hint at future plans about
what the xbox one will become later in
its life cycle number two is an emphasis
on fanservice now in years past we've
seen Microsoft really roll out the red
carpet for all things halo this year
it's it's everything they're bringing
backwards compatibility for xbox 360
games to the xbox one will we see every
Xbox 360 game working on our xbox one
I'm reluctant to say that I believe that
they've promised a hundred games when
the service rolls out you will see more
going on from there we also saw a
remastered version of Gears of War one
along with footage of years of war for
in gobs of halo 5 Guardians which
started this show they're using their
big eye peas to get fans attention and
they outright said it at the end of the
press conference if you have not
upgraded from xbox 360 to Xbox one now
is the time to do it they're practically
begging you and and you know it as far
as groveling goes this is some great
groveling number three Microsoft didn't
screw it up for itself which it is
capable of doing as it has in years past
they didn't focus on apps or statistics
or analytic or how much money they make
they didn't plop weird PowerPoint slides
we didn't see ESPN and UFC and some
bland partnership with the NFL they
focused on games they focused on the
ip's that they already have out there
that people love and they got some new
exclusives and then did that little
trick where they show games and you're
like is that an exclusive maybe it's not
maybe it is I don't know but I'm gonna
think that I need to buy an xbox one if
I want to play it and that's all they
really care about so good good job
Microsoft you as far as marketing goes
you really nailed it this year uh and
there's a lot more that they had I mean
it was a it was a busy precedent so
here's what I recommend you do if you
want to see everything you should know
from the Microsoft press event go to the
bridge com we have a full write-up and
if you just want to see clips from all
that we have a supercut on youtube.com
forward slash the verge and here's what
I recommend you stay on the verge calm
all week to this e3 week and this is the
exciting time of our lives we're talking
about video games fun stuff not
cellphones not blenders not drones and
you're gonna inevitably kill us all this
fun time I'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
