magical feel to it that is unlike any
other day so what degree do we need to
rework great work that's already been
done what do we keep what do we throw
away what do we add equally we want this
to be our halo game and the first halo
game that people flee as develop we've
really focused on trying to craft these
moments that live up to the legacy of
the halo experience we're working within
the constraints of what makes halo halo
but trying to make every aspect of it
and bigger and better
you
in a before we're really delving into
Master Chief's humanity and exploring
what makes him tick as a character most
of the exploration that we've done of
the master chief has been done through
other media outside of the games being
done through common folks two novels we
wanted to put it squarely in the video
game this time fighting for something
that is really important where there's
something very big at stake those are
things we carry forward one of the
things that we wanted to do is really
introduce a threat that is beyond
anything that Master Chief is faced
before it also gives us an opportunity
without thread to add no gameplay the
backstory of the Spartans and of the
Master Chief in particular promises all
this hyper athletic speed and mass and
weight and power and is supposed to be
this guy in this super suit and you
should feel like a superhero in it and
in order to do that we want the armor to
look and feel functional we've done
everything from really looking at what
should the hood look but it's kind of
like a fly to get hug and we think of it
that way as a player you're really
empower and given a set of tools to
employ any way that you want and fans
will be really happy to be other than
Kelly for the battle rifles back it's
the old burst fire precision weapon that
they know and love all weapons vehicles
and enemies have all been updated
graphically a lot of that is just in
service of the experience we're trying
to create we want you to feel like you
can step right into that world we're
trying to bring that across the
multiplayer that there's this whole
universe out there you get playing all
these cool locations we're absolutely
creating multiplayer levels from scratch
so these are not play spaces that are
recycled from the campaign their purpose
built with competitive in mind the two
maps are we going to be showing war
house and wrap around wrap arounds of
looping arena type structure lots of
verticality up and down combat war house
is like an abandoned military base which
is got a giant neck being constructed in
the center of it we've always had this
sort of schism between multiplayer and
campaign and the campaign was completely
wrapped infection a multiplayer just
wasn't the squadron's in multiplayer
Spartan force is a new breed of spaten
we've created a fairly compelling and
fairly convincing reason why red
Spartans can fight blue spark there's
other pasta where multiplayer experience
they'll be coming in the future with
Halo 4 we tried to create a more
cinematic approach to the experience in
wasting that we did it would completely
new audio to be building all of the
certain effects from scratch
we read an almost everything we've
already recorded a hundred bucks Emile's
artistically the number of assets that
are going into this is way more than any
other Halo game we ordered to do so much
more you have this massive team of
people who have all come together just
one point in time focuses on every day
that we have loved doing everything we
can to make this game the best that it
can possibly it's still halo but it has
its own voice and it's extraordinary
