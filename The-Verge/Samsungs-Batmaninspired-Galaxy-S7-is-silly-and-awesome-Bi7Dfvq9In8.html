front of me I've got something Samsung
announced just about a week ago
it is the galaxy s7 edge in Justice
edition it is a special edition galaxy
s7 edge made to commemorate the third
anniversary of the game gods among us in
Justice edition which is a game that's
on Android and iOS it used to be on
consoles it's a pretty popular game but
it's also three years old and it's kind
of a random anniversary to commemorate
but regardless Samsung did and they
produce a special edition phone and it's
actually pretty cool here it is it says
galaxy s7 edge standard galaxy s7 edge
same hardware and everything however it
comes in a special color scheme so it is
all black and then it's got a black
metal edge you can kind of see next to
my standard black pedestrian very boring
galaxy s7 edge now that is silver edge
the Justice Batman phone has a black
edge got these gold highlights on it for
the logo and the button and stuff like
that definitely the coolest part though
is the Batman Batarang logo on the back
where you would have your normal carrier
logo Batman Batarang there it also comes
with a special theme which changes your
icons and some of the interface things
kind of like standards samsung standard
theme thing it does have the always-on
screen with the Batarang which is pretty
cool but it's a Batman phone it has a
special ringtone couple different sounds
and stuff like that - you know
commemorate this special issue which is
pretty well so you get the phone with
this special edition you also get a
special case which is kind of a
rubberized definitely looks like a
Batman type of case in terms of like his
uniform or whatever and it's got a
Batman logo on it and then you also get
this wild gear VR which is like murdered
out all black edition if you are
familiar with the gear VR you know that
they've always been white with a black
front now this one is all black it looks
really rad Samsung is selling this in a
few markets across the world Korea
Russia
some others we don't really know the
pricing of it yet and unfortunately
don't know if it's ever coming to the US
but this might be the coolest silly
activation tie-in phone I've ever seen
if I had an opportunity to buy this
instead of my standard Galaxy s7 edge I
probably would because it has a Batman
logo on it and it looks really cool
there you go that's a real quick look at
the galaxy s7 edge in justice addition
it's a Batman phone it was announced
about a week ago this is a real first
look at it I'm Dan from the verge for
more be sure to check us out youtube.com
slash The Verge the verge comm of course
and thanks for watching
Batarang ok yeah that's a funny part the
movie which is actually coming out to
like blu-ray very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
