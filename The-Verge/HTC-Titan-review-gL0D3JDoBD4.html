HTC's latest Windows Phone the 4.7 inch
Titan HD is well known for its
proclivity to work from boy and product
names but in case of the Titan the name
is more descriptive than aspirational
this truly is a massive smartphone not
uncomplaining most respons physical
footprint is taken up by the bright and
beautiful Super LCD display HTC is
stirring the buzz around the screen to a
minimum and a single piece aluminum
frame wraps around the sides and back
keeping a device's thickness just below
a centimeter the Titan weighs 160 grams
but it doesn't feel that heavy the
weight is well distributed across the
body the combination of relatively
slender case and a large Super LCD
dominating the front lens the Titan very
slick futuristic appearance the last
time I was so impressed by large screen
handset was when HTC introduced the HD
to running windows mobile 6.5 much like
the Titan it was a device breaking into
a new form factor at 4.3 inches and it
almost no bezel around the display
another similarity orbited less happy 1
between the hd2 and the Titan is in
screen resolution the new 4.7 each
device matches its predecessor by
offering only WVGA or 800 by 480
resolution and means you see exactly as
much content on the Titan as you would
on the 3.7 inch radar HDS other member
of this new Windows Phone lineup the
tiles are makeup Microsoft's Windows
Phone interface appear correctly large
on the Titan and you can't have the
feeling that a larger screen size is
going to waste
without commensurate increase in
resolution which is a shame since the
Titan Super LCD display is truly
gorgeous to look at and offers
outstanding viewing angles the Titan
comes pre-loaded with a mango update
Windows Phone which is branded wooden
number 7.5 but in real terms is close to
version 2.0 following the original
Windows Phone 7 released last year which
were booted Microsoft's mobile OS
efforts and started from scratch it adds
a new visual multitasking overview
mobile hotspot functionality full
Twitter integration further demon
support messaging threads and a number
of enhancements to the built in Bing
search engine although it runs a faster
a newer 1.5 gigahertz processor the
Titan isn't noticeably quicken operation
than HD strophe from last year this is
because Windows Phones interface has
been extremely responsive from the start
leaving the benefits of the Titans
upgraded processor to be heard elsewhere
one such area is in barrel life the new
MSM 8255 snapdragon is much more
efficient than the previous generation
and allows the titan to last for a full
24 hours between recharges the titan is
an impressively well-built
handsome device with a gorgeous screen
that could do with adding a few more
pixels the user experience is
indistinguishable from other windows
phones running the mango update so your
list of alternatives isn't short you can
try out the radar if you have to more
compact dimensions or consider samsung's
upcoming Focus s and Focus flash
handsets they along with each item will
be coming to AT&amp;amp;T in the fourth quarter
of this year for an Android alternative
check out HTC Sensation XL it has the
exact same spec sheet of the Titan just
adds a little more RAM and runs HD s
latest since 3.5 on top of Android 2.3</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
