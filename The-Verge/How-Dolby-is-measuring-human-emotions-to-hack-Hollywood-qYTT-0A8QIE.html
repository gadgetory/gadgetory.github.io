entertainment has in the past been
pretty low-tech people might answer a
survey give thumbs up or five stars in
an app or simply describe how they felt
while they were watching something but
now scientists have access to a variety
of biosensors that can tell them exactly
how people are responding to movies and
TV shows what gets their hearts pumping
or what makes their faces flush in this
physiological data has the potential to
change how movies are made in the future
in fact it's doing that right now Dolby
Labs has been around since 1965 for most
people the company is synonymous with
that label you see on movies that tells
you the sound has been remastered or the
color has been enhanced but inside its
headquarters in San Francisco Dolby has
been working at a lesser-known project
to watch people while they're watching
movies the scientists Adobe want to know
whether people are cognitively involved
or stressed or aroused and they want
this biophysical data to better saw
their technology the idea being that
Dolby can show its Hollywood partners
that a certain color or surround sound
or even high dynamic range will elicit a
stronger response from people one of the
lede image scientists from Pixar in
charge of inside out he says and the
babies born inside out would you get
this diffused white screen what we
wanted there was pain we wanted people
to feel physiological pain because
that's what happens when a baby's born
and so it's this way of now thinking
about the physiological response is part
of what we can create in the color space
we can create that in this multi-sensory
space and that's really powerful to the
creator's that's Dolby chief scientist
poppy Crum she's a neurophysiologist who
on any given day is conducting 15 to 20
experiments with willing subjects I was
curious to hear what these biosensors
are telling poppy and her team so I
decided to try on the sensors myself
one of the beauties of this particular
device so again it's an EEG which stands
for electroencephalogram it lets us
measure small changes in the electrical
signals from your brain through your
scalp my in the matrix yes and what's
this
these are a few other sensors that we're
going to put on you one of these is
going to measure your heart rate another
one of the sensors is a lie detector and
off to your left that's actually your
thermal image by sweating oh the data
that's popping up on the screen right
now from the sensors I'm wearing what is
that telling you so what we've done is
we're just amplifying some of those
channels and this is your raw EEG signal
from each of those electrodes here you
have your GSR response and here's your
heart rate so what are the kinds of
things that would cause aside from fire
like it's pretty serious spike sports
matches those are great examples where
if there's something like a penalty kick
where there's anticipation or things
that surprise you things that are
rousing so you can actually tell when
people are aroused absolutely do you
test it on sex scenes oh so when we use
the word arousal I like to use the word
excitement typically maybe I was jumping
to conclusions okay yeah so be careful
up there
these biophysical labs have existed at
Dolby since 2012
but over the past couple years poppy and
her team have really ramped up the
program this is partly due to the fact
that these kinds of sensors are readily
available now but it's also due to the
fact that there are now displays bright
enough to trigger these kinds of
reactions in some cases the team is
using devices that get up to 20,000
candelas per square meter in terms of
brightness and that can have a
surprising impact on the human body we
have discovered it if you present flame
a picture of flame realistically enough
your body actually starts to flush your
body is just over the eons has adjusted
and adapted such that when it sees flame
it assumes hot that kind of insight is
fundamental in helping us shape the
technologies that drive the stories that
you and I love to go
Doby is hardly the first entertainment
focused company to study human emotions
broadly speaking this kind of effective
computing has been studied for decades
but industry experts say it's becoming
much more common in entertainment in
recent years companies like Netflix and
Hulu have used eye trackers to better
understand how people are reacting to
their app interfaces these types of
biophysical experiences are becoming
more and more important we need to
understand experiences about engagement
how you're emotionally connected to the
experience are having and how our
technologies can help us enhance that
enrich it as much as possible of course
all of this bio sensory tracking could
raise questions around the ethics of
potentially using the data in a more
manipulative way if filmmakers or sound
producers know that they can trigger an
emotional response then isn't it
possible for those tools to be abused or
say an advertiser uses these tools to
sell you something like this Lexus ad
which offers nothing but the sound of an
engine revving in which by the way was
mixed by Dolby but ultimately when it
comes to entertainment that's sort of
what you want you're going for an
intensified human experience core of our
technology and the existence of our
company has always been an understanding
of human experience and how can we take
what we experience how our brain
experiences world how our body's
experiencing really use that to build
intelligent technologies basically we're
more immersed in video than ever before
whether it's on a giant movie or TV
screen on our relatively small
smartphones or even right on our faces
like with VR headsets and Dolby
scientists along with many others in the
industry want to know how that's going
to make us all feel especially if
entertainment becomes indistinguishable
from the realities around us so the next
time you feel your face flush or your
heart race or your armpit sweat during a
movie or TV show you might not be the
only one
in fact it might have been enhanced to
trigger exactly that sort of reaction
I've been reading a lot about sharks
