let me ask you something though do you
want to think about the future of
computing and can the iPad replace a
tablet and like what does the stylus do
a blah blah blah blah blah blah no you
want an iPad to do iPad things like
watching Netflix or playing games and
good news Apple made it it's called the
iPad and it starts at just $329 okay I
know you want to know more so I will
give you some more information here this
iPad replaces the iPad air 2 but it
looks and feels a little bit more like
the original iPad air 1 so what does
that mean well first of all it's just a
little bit thicker than the iPad air 2
and it also has a screen from the iPad
air 1 what does that mean well first of
all the LCD isn't laminated to the glass
so it feels like it's set back a little
bit from the front of the device which
whatever not that big a deal to me the
bigger deal with it is that it's a
little bit more reflective than the iPad
air 2 but you know what honestly forget
all that what matters is that this it's
an iPad and so the screen looks great
it's a Retina display and it's also very
fast it has a new a9 processor in it and
so while it's not as fast or as
beautiful or as high-end as an iPad pro
it's still very very good at doing iPad
things because again it's an iPad now
this is the part of the review where I
tell you about all the amazing new
features and Apple's new iPad but I
actually don't have to do that because
this iPad is just an iPad it doesn't
have the smart connector that you would
get on the iPad pro for attaching
keyboards it doesn't support the Apple
pencil the cameras are you know if
they're fine they're iPad cameras and
that's not a knock on this thing at all
because again this starts at $329 and if
all you want to do are the traditional
iPad things this iPad is great for that
and so honestly the big question with
this iPad is should you upgrade and if
you look at what's happening in the tech
press or investors everybody's super
worried that not everybody's upgrading
their iPads
enough for Apple that's apples problem
that's not your problem your problem is
does the iPad that you have now work
good enough and if not should you get
this one let me break it down if you
have an iPad that's older than an iPad
air this iPad is going to be pretty
amazing you're really going to love it
and again it's cheap but if you have an
iPad air or an iPad air to this thing
isn't going to be at much of an upgrade
over your existing iPad so you're
probably fine to just stick with it now
there's two other weird things you might
consider if you really really care about
a beautiful perfect screen you could
consider getting a refurbished iPad air
2 but honestly if you care that much you
should probably just spend the extra
money and get an iPad pro it is a lot
more but the screen is way better and it
is a little bit faster than this iPad I
would say an iPad a lot and that's
because this thing is called an iPad but
also because everybody knows what an
iPad is everybody knows what they like
to use an iPad for and apples not trying
to reinvent anything with this iPad it's
just letting you do those things for a
relatively inexpensive price you can't
sit on the couch you can watch your
Netflix you can play some games you can
browse the web and this does all that
stuff incredibly well it's an iPad it's
an iPad it's an iPad it's an iPad Apple
named this device iPad the iPad and iPad
this iPad it's an iPad it's an iPad it's
an iPad and if you need an iPad get an
iPad I mean if I have any books that's
kind of its just an iPad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
