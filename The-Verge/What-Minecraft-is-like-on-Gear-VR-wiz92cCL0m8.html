Palmer Luckey handed me this duct-tape
ski goggles put them on my head okay and
I was in a different world god I got a
spaceship
it didn't look photorealistic it didn't
look breathtaking this was not the
future of graphics it was like the
future of presents it's 2016 now you can
have a photorealistic VR experience if
you want to you can have motion controls
you can have anything you want but more
importantly minecraft just came to gear
VR this is important for two reasons the
first reason is that minecraft is still
kind of our cyber space it's the it's
the one virtual world that millions are
about no billions of us have all
inhabited the other reason is that gear
VR still our only portable VR solution I
brought a stool for myself because you
got a swivel that's very important but
but this is VR that you can share it's
not stuck in a living room or an office
like I can hand anybody this and they
can go inhabit a virtual world just like
I can right now
this is how you start out you start in
this living room of sorts it's of course
all built with beautiful minecraft pixel
art you've got two options
you've got VR controls moderate or
classic controls intense and I am prone
to motion sickness I'm going to go
moderate moderate basically stops you
from like going full dual analog and
really disorienting yourself and you can
just play the game like you're just
watching a big-screen TV made out of out
of wood of course but then just tap on
the side of the display and you're in
the world and this is this is which this
is awesome to me this is beautiful the
viewing distances are pretty short but
it's okay I'm get used to it so this is
a this is based on Minecraft Pocket
Edition which basically there's two
primary versions of Minecraft was
originally built in Java and then it's
been rewritten very slowly over the
course of years in C++ so it can be I'm
going to attack I want to attack off to
resume explaining in one second die all
right there we go you go do that I'm a
skeleton killing machine this this
specific version was was further
modified by John Carmack who made games
you might have heard of like doom and
quake and this has kind of been a
passion project it's really the most
important game for gear VR there's been
a lot of really great experiments on a
lot of great experiences for gear VR but
again this is this is a world I don't
know how to communicate this but this is
a world that I love so much which is
minecraft and now I can inhabit this
world
I really feel like I should build a roof
but I only have to shoot I need to eat
something it's a raw pork chop we'll do
the menu is kind of a blend between
regular minecraft because you've got a
cursor where you can look around and
like the xbox version of Minecraft which
by default has sort of like automated
crafting the other thing to know about
this is it's still kind of a work in
progress
there's a warning screen about it you
might not get perfect frame rates there
might be some hiccups and some problems
and that you know the draw distance is
is pretty low the nice thing is that
every year every six months every like
five seconds there's a better phone out
there and I'd say in a year or two this
will be undoubtedly the best way to play
Minecraft and I don't know how to
explain why this is so perfect for VR
but I really think it's just because
this is this is a world and for VR what
you want is to be in a world and
minecraft is just the most effective
simulator of worlds and existence I mean
right now the sun's going down I'm
searching for a village that I found and
looted earlier I've left my home and my
bed and my safety behind I'm I'm in the
middle of Times Square it's all
happening for me right now I'm living
the
I got a little mark here I mean this
maybe isn't the best version of
Minecraft and desist of like I don't
think I could spend four hours in here
it's still a little bit uncomfortable
and I hope that keeps getting better but
I guess with a half an hour in here and
the half an hour I spend in here is
memorable it's because I I went to a
different place and that's special</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
