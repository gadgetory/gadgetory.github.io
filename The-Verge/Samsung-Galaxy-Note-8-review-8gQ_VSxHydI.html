here and told you that the Samsung
Galaxy Note seven was the best take on a
big smartphone ever made now we all know
what happened to the note seven and it
wasn't good it basically caught on fire
and had to be pulled from the market but
because of that Samsung changed the way
it makes batteries so we shouldn't have
to worry about that problem anymore and
now we're here to talk about the new
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 which Samsung
again hopes is the best big phone ever
made you probably already know what a
note is and the note 8 has got it all
it's got a giant screen that stretches
almost to the very edges of the phone's
frame it's got Qualcomm's fastest
processor lots of RAM a big battery with
both fast wired and wireless charging
and it's also Samsung's first phone with
a dual camera system that lets you do
interesting portrait effects that lets
you blur the background like an iPhone
can do and of course because it's a note
it comes with a stylus which has also
gained a few new tricks now you're
probably thinking to yourself that
sounds great this sounds like a monster
phone and you know what you're right
there's actually very little to complain
about with the note 8 aside from perhaps
its starting price of nine hundred and
thirty dollars but unlike the note seven
last year which was head and shoulders
above everything else before it's
falling from grace the note 8 isn't
actually that much different than
Samsung's other really good big phone
the galaxy s 8 plus still there's a
couple of reasons why you might want to
pony up a couple extra hundred dollars
for a note II instead of a galaxy s 8
plus so let's dive in
this is Samsung's biggest premium phone
and it comes with a massive 6.3 inch
display just like the SA and the s8 plus
it's what Samsung calls an infinity
display so the screen stretches almost
to the very edges of the phone's frame
with just a little bit of bezel above
and below the screen is everything you
expect from the Samsung bright and
punchy great to look at and the sheer
size of it just sucks you in when you're
watching a video the notary's build
quality is also just what you'd expect
from a high-end Samsung phone it's metal
and glass with a premium fit and finish
just like the s8 and also just like the
SAE it's ip68 water-resistant so you can
get it wet without having to worry about
it
then the note 8 does have a slightly
different shape it's more square than
the rounded off corners of the SAR si
plus which makes it easier to use the S
Pen wet but it also makes the Note II
feel a lot bigger than the si plus even
though the two are almost the same size
just like all the note phones before it
the note 8 makes no apologies for being
a big phone and if you want to compare
it to the iPhone 7 plus it's a little
bit taller a little bit narrower but has
a way bigger screen the nodine's big
size also makes it even harder to hit
the fingerprint scanner on the back of
the phone which is still super clumsy to
use and I've been using an SI plus for a
couple of months in I've gotten used to
the fingerprint scanners placement but
you can basically get used to anything
it would be a lot easier for everyone if
Samsung would just put the scanner below
the camera like every other phone does
and of course there's a dedicated button
to launch Samsung's big speed voice
assistant and of course it can't be
reprogrammed to do something more useful
because Samsung has committed itself to
blocking all of the apps that come out
to do so
now inside the note 8 has qualcomm
snapdragon 835 processor and 6 sigma
bytes of ram this is the same processor
it's found in the s8
but with 2 gigabytes more ram you don't
wanna see I haven't seen a noticeable
performance difference between the two
both are fast and smooth and really
performance isn't an issue here likewise
the notates 3300 milliamp hour battery
is big enough to last most people
through a full day without having to
recharge in practical terms it gets me
about the same battery life as I
experienced with the si+ despite its
slightly smaller capacity you've
probably picked up on a theme here
there's not a whole lot different
between the note 8 and the s8 plus so
let's talk about those two things that
are different the first is the notes
signature feature the S Pen Stylus the
note 8 is basically the only phone on
the market that you can buy that comes
with a stylus and unless you take notes
mark up screenshots doodle or just
navigate the software with a finer point
than your finger and note diehards love
this thing and according to Samsung the
stylus is the main reason that no buyers
stick with the phone the Galaxy Note 8
has gained a couple of new features it's
got a finer point and a little bit more
pressure sensitivity than the stylus
that's shipped with the note 5 two years
ago
samsung has also improved the
note-taking software and you can now
take longer notes on the phone screen
without even unlocking it which is
pretty cool well my favorite new feature
is live messages which lets you draw
pictures or write messages and convert
them to animated gifs which you can send
to people or post to social networks
it's kind of like the iMessage
handwritten note feature except you can
post them anywhere that supports a gift
the other big difference of the no√© is
its new dual camera system has two 12
megapixel cameras both with optical
image stabilization this lets you zoom
in closer on your subject or more
interestingly take pictures with a
blurred background like you can do with
the DSLR or mirrorless camera the
portrait mode is a lot like the iPhone 7
plus outdoors and good light it can
produce some interesting effects but
indoors aren't poor lighting it looks
pretty bad
and it never quite fooled me into
thinking the picture was taken with a
bigger camera it kind of has this
cardboard cutout effect and it messes up
things like fine detail and hair which
is pretty important for a portrait it's
basically not any worse nor any better
than the iPhone 7 plus as portrait mode
both of these feel like first generation
attempts at something there's a lot of
headroom from
in later iterations the one thing that
Samsung is doing differently is allowing
you to adjust the blur before or after
you take the picture so if the blur
effect is too strong you can roll it
back a little bit I found the best
results were when I had the blur effect
dial just a tad back from its maximum
and since there are two cameras you can
actually take both the wide-angle and
telephoto images at the same time so if
the portrait quality sucks you can
always fall back to the wide-angle
camera which has a much higher quality
sensor and a better lens I feel like
this is a little bit of a safety net but
honestly I'm glad it's there otherwise
the wide-angle camera is exactly the
same as the one you get on the SI it's
fast focusing as a wide aperture and
takes really lovely photos it's one of
the best cameras you can get on a phone
this year there was once a point in time
where if you wanted a big phone the note
was the obvious king of the hill it had
the biggest screen and the best specs
and it didn't really matter if its price
was a little bit higher than other
phones but now there's a lot of really
great big phones on the market including
ones made by Samsung itself that offer a
lot of the same experience of the note
at a lower price so it really comes down
to two things if you want the note do
you care about the camera and do you
care about the S Pen Stylus since I feel
like the camera could still use work to
truly be great it basically comes down
to this little piece of plastic and how
much value you get out of it if you're
an S Pen diehard go for it
you're gonna love the Note II but the
rest of us will probably be just as
happy with any of the other big flagship
phones youtube.com slash The Verge I
can't believe it I can't remember it's
youtube.com slash merge or slash though
that's why I was asking
there's your end card by the way we just
