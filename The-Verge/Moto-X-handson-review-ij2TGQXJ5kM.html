this is the Moto X this is Motorola's
flagship phone the first it designed in
conjunction with Google after being
acquired more than a year ago and what's
most interesting is that it's not really
competing with the other flagship
Android devices out there it doesn't
have a huge hi-def screen or a crazy
fast processor it's going after the
iPhone a simple usable friendly phone
designed for everybody at the same time
though there's no question that the Moto
X feels like a premium device it has a
different feel from the solid metallic
HTC One but even with plastic parts it
feels every bit as high-end the buttons
are sturdier and click here than most
other phones and it has a solidity and
heft to it that a device like the GS 4
just doesn't it's not exactly
groundbreaking design but it's mature
it's comfortable and it's solid of
course the real hook to the X's design
is that you can customize nearly
everything about it most phones today
are black and if you're lucky white but
the Moto X can be anything you want the
front of the phone is either black or
white but the back can be any of 18
colors each of which has a different
texture and feel to it and there are
seven options for the buttons on the
side and the accent ring around the
camera as well being able to customize
the phone probably won't make or break
the success of the Moto X but it might
make buyers consider it when they would
have just passed over a black version on
the shelves there are some great
combinations and some hideous ones and
it's gonna be really interesting to see
how Motorola and carriers show those
options to customers but I love the idea
of being able to treat my phone like my
car or my cool Nike hyssops you
customize the whole thing through a
really simple tool called moto maker
which also lets you pick how much
storage you want on the phone and even
sign into your Google account and pick a
wallpaper we couldn't test ourselves and
actually buy a phone but the tool is
great and it's really nice to be able to
have your phone set up and ready to go
as soon as you turn it on the front of
the phone of course is dominated by a
4.7 inch 720p AMOLED display like all
AMOLED screens it's a little
oversaturated in contrast II but it's
far from the worst screen I've seen
there's some slight color banding at
times and some seriously over-aggressive
dimming but the screen itself is totally
usable even though I don't tend to
prefer AMOLED screens in general in this
case using one enables one of the
coolest software features of the Moto X
it's called active notifications and
it's really great instead of having to
turn your phone on unlock it pull down
the notification window and open an app
the screen just shows you the time in a
notification when you have one tap on
the screen and it shows you the details
it's just so much faster for seeing your
email or your Twitter mentions or
whatever messages you have I wish you
were easier to jump to a specific
notification
instead of just the most recent one and
there's no way to make the little window
turn on other than flipping your phone
upside down and then back up but I
really hope Motorola keeps working on it
because it's an awesome feature it's
exactly how notifications should work
the same is true of the touchless
controls feature which is basically just
voice activation the actual voice
recognition itself is amazingly accurate
but it's really weird to set up you have
to remember the particular cadence of
how you trained your phone with ok
Google now or else it just won't hear
you sometimes it'll also ask you to
choose default apps when you first try
to say set an alarm and it's basically
useless if you have a passcode on your
phone but as long as you don't care
about security and don't just trust it
to work every time immediately without
you looking at it it can be really
useful in places the mic and the speaker
by the way are both pretty good the
phone can hear you and be heard from
across the room which makes for solid
call quality and speakerphone as well
motorola assist on the other hand is
pretty much just universally awesome I
just turned it on and forgot about it
and then was amazed when I was driving
and it started telling me out loud that
I had incoming calls and text messages
it responds to voice commands and made
it dead simple to deal with what would
have otherwise been a pretty dangerous
interaction with my phone assist has
other usage scenarios as well like when
you're in a meeting or when you're
sleeping but it's so useful in the car
that I want a moto X just for a while
I'm driving otherwise the Moto X is
almost a stock Android 4.2.2 fun it
comes with some carrier bloatware which
is the worst AT&amp;amp;T address-book is awful
and so is some of what comes on the
verizon model but it's not nearly as bad
as on some other phones the phone also
prompts you with way too many
notifications about your location or
Wi-Fi and there's an awkward empty space
on the 18 t model whenever you go on
Wi-Fi some of the software just feels
like lazy oversight but overall having
an almost stock phone is great and
having it available on all four major
carriers is a pretty huge deal it
hopefully means faster updates for the
Moto X and hopefully means other
manufacturers will follow suit as well
so Motorola's talked a lot about getting
out of the spec war and not caring about
being the fastest or most powerful or
most core filled smartphone out there
but at the same time it's talking a lot
about its new 10 megapixel clear pixel
sensor which it says uses a fourth clear
pixel to let in 75% more light than
other smartphones it turns out the
camera is really odd sometimes it takes
really fantastic pictures especially
close up with a nice soft background
effect but there's a ton of artifacting
and processing noise all over the
pictures it looks really terrible
sometimes but then sometimes looks
really great
performance is solid and frankly I'd
rather have a noisy picture than a
blurry one but overall the Moto X is
nowhere near as good as the iPhone 5s
camera all around the camera is a lot
faster than the iPhone though the quick
capture gesture which you activate by
turning your wrist like you're using a
screwdriver automatically opens the
camera from anywhere else on the phone
whether it's on or off then tap anywhere
on the screen and it takes a picture
there are a few more manual controls in
settings but it's supposed to be really
fast and simple and it is everything
else about the phone is kind of the same
actually it's really good without being
really great performance is solid even
with difficult games in HD video but
it's not gonna blow your mind or
anything
it's absolutely enough to use everyday
but certainly not bleeding edge and
since it's not bleeding edge Motorola
told us to expect great battery life
that's supposedly the upside to a lower
res screen and a slightly lower powered
processor and better life is good
certainly I got about 15 hours of heavy
use out of it and getting a full 24
hours is totally doable under normal
circumstances but the Moto X should have
been a huge monster of battery life like
the RAZR MAXX
and it just isn't it's good but not
great when I first started using the
Moto X I wasn't particularly thrilled
with it there just didn't seem to be
that many interesting things about the
phone but as I started using the assist
and touchless control features more and
more and seeing that the battery life
was solid and the camera was good enough
I realized I'm really into this phone
for one thing there's really nothing
wrong with it even its worst features
are just average for a smart phone and
its best features are totally
unparalleled on the market I wish it had
better battery life and a 1080p screen
but even despite those things I'm
seriously considering buying this phone
it's just solid I think I might even get
a yellow one we'll see how that goes</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
