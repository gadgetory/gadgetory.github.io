accessible as much as you know possible
so community members submit their ideas
to our website and then from there
community members can vote on ideas and
comment on them and kind of bubble up
the ideas that they find the most
interesting or unique and then we go
through a series of additional
evaluations and pull some of the top
ideas from the community and move them
to our eval session where the entire
staffs brought together in this room and
we review a series of ideas and vote on
whether or not we feel that they're the
type of product that we want our company
to really you know embrace a new
following about 40% of them awaken the
sent out an open invitation all our
community members to submit ideas for
the next generation of Apple accessories
in a very short amount of time let's say
about was about 24-hour period we
received almost 2,000 product
submissions
we go to the audience
let's go roughly 1700 idea submissions
and we narrowed it down to 50 and then
eventually narrowed that down to 15
ideas so right then to there we had 15
ideas to explore and and get ready for
manufacturing literally in 24 hours so
it was pretty crazy
compared to other projects I mean this
is a tiny fraction of the time normally
spent so these are some little later
sketches from the brainstorm session
that we had on Thursday night so it's
really just starting off with the with
the 3d CAD we had of the of the iPhone
basically just started you know first
building the case these parts when I
went to the bracket the process of
building this model was just pretty fast
after a whole bunch of sketching a whole
bunch of engineering there's some kind
of you know CAD work that came out of
that so this was actually really cool
because on Friday as we close out the 24
hour you know cram session we were able
to show the community some of the things
that were already being worked up
this is Bertha this is our 3d printer he
does all of our rapid prototyping in 3d
form and right now you can see her
printing one of the iPhone cases that we
designed last week we have the
capability to do it in-house
so we basically wake up in the morning
open her up clean off the parts and then
test it out the packaging is basically
usually the last step in the process I'm
usually the most rushed because
everything else is driving I want to get
it to market I had never seen products
taken to market so quickly and it amazes
me every day that we actually get it
done but we do and
and I'm really excited to see where it
goes because it's only going like this
