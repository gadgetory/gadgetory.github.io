because if you have the new Asus Zenbook
Pro you actually get to that's right the
Zenbook Pro has two screens on it even
though it's this very traditional
clamshell style laptop now as you can
see a soos actually put a full-color
touchscreen in the trackpad it's
basically a 5.5 inch 1080p smartphone
screen that's turned on its side and
embedded right into the trackpad now
this isn't the first time we've seen
this idea but this is the first one that
you can actually go out and buy this
isn't a concept device or a custom built
machine Asuza is actually selling this
thing if you really want to you can buy
it I say if you really want to because
you really shouldn't buy this laptop
it's just not a great computer crazy
trackpad screen aside the panels are
flexible it's covered in fingerprints in
seconds the battery life is bismal and
even though as a Cory 9 processor the
poor thermal management means you don't
get to take advantage of all that power
it's basically not something you want to
spend $2,300 on but the trackpad here
now that's interesting so let's talk
about it now soos is calling it the
screen pad and it functions as both a
standard Windows 10 precision trackpad
and a touchscreen it has a smooth matte
finish and it supports all of the
standard multi-finger gestures you'd
expect on a modern Windows computer you
can even turn the screen part off
entirely and use it just like you would
any other trackpad but if you do use it
as a touchscreen there's a few different
things you can do with it you can use it
to control music playback as a
calculator as an app launcher or even in
place of a number pad there's a calendar
mode that syncs with the Windows 10
calendar app so you can see upcoming
appointments if you're using an office
app like Word or Excel the screen pad
will pull up a customize toolbar that
gives you quick access to things like
font styling layout tools spreadsheet
functions and more my favorite thing
that the screen pad does is give me
quick controls when I'm watching a
YouTube video in Chrome I can adjust the
volume toggle captions go fullscreen and
even skip ads right to track that
perhaps the craziest thing you can do
with this is extend your main windows
display down to the trackpad so it's
like the world's smallest secondary
computer display now it's wild but I
don't know why you would ever do that
because the buttons and labels and texts
are just way too small now you might be
wondering what happens to
cursor control when you're using the
screen pad as a full-screen toolbar and
it turns out nothing actually the screen
pad still lets you move the pointer
around and click just like a normal
trackpad even when it's displaying a
full-screen toolbar now there's some
things that don't work all that well
here but they could be fixed really
easily there's apps for controlling both
standard music that's on your hard drive
and to control Spotify which is pretty
cool but for some reason a soos removed
all of the standard media controls for
play pause and skip from the function
row of the keyboard so to quickly pause
music or skip a track you have to either
switch to the full Spotify app or go
down to the screen pad select the app
you want and then tap to skip or pause
or play or whatever it's super
cumbersome and it feels like it was
designed to force you to use a screen
pad instead of the much easier way that
exists on like every other computer and
no tracking is pretty good and the
multi-finger gestures work well the
whole screen pad itself is kind of loose
and wiggly when you touch it or click on
it which makes the whole thing feel a
lot cheaper than its $2,300 price tag
would apply but aside from those issues
which I think are all pretty easily
fixable
I actually really like what a suits did
with the screen pad here now it doesn't
interfere with the way you expect a
standard trackpad to work but it does
add convenient shortcuts right at your
fingertips whenever you need them now
obviously there's not a lot you can do
with this and there's plenty of room for
improvement and new features and apps
and integrations and things like that
but the basics are here and they're done
pretty well now hopefully next time that
a soos tries this idea it puts a screen
pad in a better laptop hey thanks for
watching now this laptop is pretty
futuristic but what's really futuristic
it's the whole house we built for our
home of the future series go check them
