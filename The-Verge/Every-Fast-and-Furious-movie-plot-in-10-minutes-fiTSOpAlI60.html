police officer Brian O'Conner went
undercover to investigate ex-convict
Dominic Toretto and his badass gang of
street racers their crime how about
stealing the most leisurely treasure yet
consumer electronics Racine meanwhile
Brian discovered something so big so bad
it would change his life forever
he had the hots for Dom's sister Mia
Brian exposed undying passion the only
way he knew how
by blowing the cover of an ongoing
federal investigation
Mia I'm a cop at the last moment
Brian learned that the truck drivers
shipping all of those consumer
electronics would be armed way armed not
that armed this armed the secret spook
tried to warn the beefy thief but
arrived late to their latest heist the
gang was under fire to save the life of
Dom's best buds
Brian blew his cover and requested
medical support yeah this is officer
Brian O'Conner friendship was on the
rocks until DOM and Brian bonded over
the death of a teenager then they killed
some dudes that's illegal
Brian and Dom seemed like they wanted to
kiss probably with tongue but Dom had a
girlfriend named Letty so instead the
bros raced Dom crashed but Brian was
like if you love something let it go bro
as time on too fast too furious Brian
agreed to go undercover again to arrest
Carter Verone a drug lord for backup
Brian recruited undercover agent Monica
Fuentes and his childhood best bud Roman
Pearce the crew got jobs as drivers for
her own you know what's bad cops
mandatory race scene the crew planned to
capture Varon but the cops called
reinforcements too early great timing
get a watch things got messy from a
narrative logical standpoint shit but
who needs five act structure when you
have chases ejector seats and the most
expensive game of memory ever played the
cop saw druglord Verone would escape by
air one man knew he'd go by see Brian
and Roman fulfilled their number one
mutual childhood dream killing bad dudes
childhood dream number two driving a
Camaro through a yacht last time on fast
and furious Letty
Dom's main squeeze got hit by a car and
shot to death by a mysterious criminal
organization tied to drug lord Arturo
Braga the death gave da manha petite an
appetite for revenge and protein
meanwhile renegade cop turned renegade
FBI agent Brian attempted to murder a
potential informant for no apparent
reason
sad DOM and Brian competed in a race to
decide the newest driver of a heroin
trafficking squad possibly tied to let
his death race scene dumb won the race
but Brian found his way on the team the
old fashioned way abuse of power
an arrest for distribution of meth twice
never touchin shit bro Dwight has now
killed a boy the two drove heroin across
the us-mexico border to find and murder
Letty's killer and also tracked down the
evil drug lord Arturo Braga
hey kids being a drug dealer is nothing
to brag about things got complicated
there was a plea bargain and mixed
identities and secret underground
cross-border tunnels and a chase scene
the duo captured Braga they murdered
Letty's killer and they murdered some
more people to thank Tom for saving the
day the US government gave him an award
25 years to life in the pan
last time on best five on the way to
prison after stopping an evil drug lord
Dom was down by law did you - did your
moosh the gang broke out their leader
faster than you can say coffee and
cigarettes Mia and Brian did things the
only way they knew how
by giving the bird to public
transportation
you've heard of will work for food how
about will work for cars the out of luck
trio helped their friend Vince steal
some hot rides audiences haven't been
wowed by a train sequence like this
since literally dune train and Gare de
la quwata think nothing ever goes wrong
with a complex Train Robbery involving
supercars think again a criminal named
is easy killed DEA agents on board and
the blame got pinned on our American
heroes for revenge the gang concocted an
elaborate plan to rob crime lord
Herrmann rays of his fortune remember
the sequence in Ocean's eleven when they
got the gang back together well so did
Brian
meanwhile the United States of America
sent DSS agent Luke Hobbs to arrest the
entire crew protein powerhouse like the
political philosopher Thomas Hobbes this
Hobbes believes in the right of the
individual the right of the individual
to go to jail only one thing could stop
Hobbes from arresting the game heavy
weapons guns don't kill people raise men
do
they killed Vince and they killed Hobbes
coworkers for revenge
Hobbes and his partner Elena Neves were
like yeah let's rob raised but heists
are boring so they stole the cash with
the one way they knew how
with cars to judge it to chase bababa
ba-ba-ba-ba Banksy Hobbs killed Ray's
Brian killed cz and Dom killed a bunch
of cops Hobbes wouldn't let the gang off
scot-free but he gave them what every
racer wants a heads
start I'll see you soon now you won last
time on Fast and the Furious 6 after
stopping the world's greatest drug and
crime lords the crew began its most wild
most spectacular and most existentially
taxing adventure yet Pina Colada Grandma
and Grandpa Dom moved in with Elena Mia
and Brian made a baby gizelle in HoN
they fell in love in Fast Five moved to
Hong Kong Roman and tej were being rich
and stuff everybody was out of the game
but ol Hobbs began an investigation of
former British Special Forces soldier
Owen Shaw because somebody's got to work
Hobbs asked Brian for help finding Shaw
and Letty Letty that was Dom's old flame
as the world turns motherfuckers the
gang tracked down Shaw in foggy London T
Guvna yeah T pleased with milk one sugar
and a chase scene Brian and company
stopped Shaw and found Letty but Letty
shot Dom because love hurts then things
got weird Shaw began development on a
device that would kill the power of an
entire region Letty suffered from
amnesia Brian went undercover in an
American prison to see Braga remember
Braga never forget Braga
meanwhile Dom reminded amnesiac Letty of
their past the only way he knew how
with a race scene the gangs warded
Shaw's plans Dom saved Letty Bryan saved
Mia Shaw tried to escape on the world's
longest runway but the gang stopped the
plane the only way they knew have
driving a car through its fucking nose
also Giselle died saving Hahn and sent
Hahn into a crippling depression
meanwhile the rest of the crew received
amnesty for all their previous crimes
free to roam the streets of America god
bless the USA
last time on The Fast and the Furious
Tokyo Drift in the year 2006 all the
characters you loved didn't show up on
set meanwhile somewhere else in the
world troublemaking teenager Shawn
Boswell got busted for street racing
with clay clay looked an awful lot like
the older brother from home improvement
Oh
Shawn's dad was pissed so he sent his
son to Japan weird punishment dad in
Tokyo a young man named Twinkie taught
Shawn about drift cars just like the
title predicted Shawn befriended a young
woman named Neela nobody tell Neela's
boyfriend too late
Takashi knows Shawn dealt with things
the only way he knew how
challenging a stranger in a new town in
a foreign country to an illegal street
race weird choice
Shawn Han showed up remember Han he
looked younger but his crippling
depression was obvious because he hung
out with high schoolers Shawn borrowed
Hans car to race against his nemesis
Takashi and Shawn totaled it you call
that a drift this is a drift Shawn
repaid his debt to Han Han taught Sean
to drift names rhymed and everybody
dealt with it then there was a race
scene meanwhile Hans habit of stealing
from the Yakuza caused trouble for
everyone and Hans got killed but who
killed Han this guy no this woman no try
Owen Shaw's brother Deckard a bunch of
other stuff in Tokyo Drift happened like
a race see but it doesn't matter
fucking Deckard Shaw killed Han who will
Shawn race next Dominic Toretto
who will the gang kill next probably
Deckard Shaw</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
