know caused some structural damage from
the robot the stress is palpable because
this is it this is four years of our
lives
it's the third and final round of the
DARPA Robotics Challenge teams have
spent years designing robots that could
aid in an emergency and potentially do
much more and over the next two days
they'll take them through an obstacle
course meant to mimic a disaster zone
it's a chance to win Millions and prize
money and more than that show what the
robots can do it's easy to design a
robot that can handle a specific task
there's police spots for bomb disposal
and things like that where we aren't is
general-purpose robots that can do a lot
of things really well this is the
Florida Institute for human and machine
cognition they're Atlas robot fell twice
during the first round and after some
overnight repairs they're getting ready
for their final run the robots have an
hour to complete eight tasks first they
have to drive a vehicle down a dirt road
avoiding obstacles then they have to get
out of the car one of the most difficult
maneuvers then the robots open a door
and walk through it once inside
communication starts to break down the
robots have to act more autonomously
they have to turn a valve then cut a
hole in a wall using a drill then
complete a surprise task either flipping
a switch or plugging a hose into the
wall finally they have to get over a
pile of debris and climb a set of stairs
our approach to this is to have the
robot do things that the robots good at
and people do things that the people are
good at and so people are very good at
deciding which valve to turn which door
to open we have a display where people
can click on these objects and Shemp can
use its sensors to determine exactly
where that object is how to pick it up
it's actually a lot like a video game
the way the user interface is designed
it's pretty simple like WASD controls
mouse clicks left right click all that
200 times a second the robot is being
commanded at its joints what to do it
has laser rangefinders those are the
spinning devices you see on chimps head
they built a 360-degree
three-dimensional model of the
environment they have a video feed of
the camera coming off the robot the
algorithm just makes it not fall over
and giving this configuration how do I
keep my balance in general people get
their ideas about robotics from science
fiction from books or movies
and of course real science fact is
nothing at all like that so what's going
on yeah yeah we're a couple hours out I
guess what time is it it's a wait what
is today I don't know I don't even know
what today is
we took a nasty spill yesterday we're
just now kind of figuring out what that
damage is we have 24 team members here
we've got close to a hundred that have
worked on this project at some point in
time this is a really good test of our
operator interface because if our
operator can operate a robot that's
broken from the get-go and still
complete even a few of the tasks will be
totally happy t-minus 20 seconds
to
go
dressed
i HMC took second place coming in six
minutes behind South Korea's team cased
and they're transforming will need robot
hue bow a lot of robots fell over and
broke during the finals but they were
much faster and more autonomous and they
were the year before it's really big in
Western culture to see a big humanoid
robot like Atlas and immediately think
terminator and the misunderstanding
there's just because a robot looks like
a human does not mean that it's
processing information or thinking like
a human there there are all the problems
I mean everywhere there are problems
there are different members of our team
that don't sleep under on different
nights there's what we call the Shakey's
a controller on board the robots
computers are telling the robots you
know to shift slightly to the left shift
slightly to the right and when that goes
out of control we got the chi-chi's
where the entire robot vibrates and
falls over walking is not a form of
artificial intelligence it's it's
rigorous algorithms for how to not fall
down if 10 or 20 years from now we see
robots not only for disaster response
but for construction and agriculture and
use in the home for aging society and
healthcare I think will have been a
success too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
