got a screen you may be wondering why do
I need a screen in my echo well this is
Amazon's echo show it's available this
week for about two hundred and thirty
bucks and it comes in black and white
it's basically a square blocky echo with
a 7-inch touchscreen it's also got two
two inch speakers and eight microphones
so it can hear you from across the room
now even though it has a screen it's
definitely not a tablet it's big its
chunky it's kind of heavy and it always
has to be plugged into the wall anyways
but no it's not a tablet and even though
it's an echo with the screen turns out
there's a lot of things you can do with
this screen the home screen can show you
the time and weather and can cycle
through upcoming calendar appointments
or trending news stories and you can ask
it for more information on any of these
things and the show gives you helpful
guides which makes it a little easier to
use you can use it to watch video but
just from Amazon's own prime video or
YouTube right now you can use it to
manage your shopping or to-do list you
can even pull up recipes when you're in
the kitchen or you can set multiple
timers which seems kind of obvious but
it's actually pretty useful because you
can then view them on the screen like
Alexa show me my timers here are your
timers now instead of having to ask for
the timers all the time I can just get a
visual view of them and then there's all
the things that you can do with Amazon's
Alexa assistant on other echo devices
which the show can do all of them as
well
you can ask it FAQs you can set timers
you can turn lights on and off in your
house you can get weather all this other
kind of information that we're used to
asking the echo for
the echo show sounds really good for
music in fact it's better than any other
echo device before it it's not going to
give a solo system a run for its money
but it's so easy to use to just ask the
echo show to listen to anything you want
that I find myself listening to music
here more than I use my solo system and
then the other big feature that Amazon
is using this for is a video calling
device you can make video calls from one
echo show to another or to a mobile
device or from a mobile device to an
echo shop it's basically a super simple
FaceTime device that just sits in your
house and anyone in your home use and
then there's this weird feature about it
Amazon's calling this drop-in where it
allows anybody to connect to your echo
show without having you answer the call
it's kind of weird and kind of creepy
and fortunately it's disabled by default
but it does make it very easy for
children to use the device ID either hi
Dan how you doing I'm good as excited
system foggy white expanse and then it
slowly fades into the actual video you
sound pretty very good I don't think
this works really well it is creepy that
I can just like jump into your house
whenever I feel like it but obviously
wouldn't normally give me that access
although as your boss I think I might
demand it you know it's a good thing
that like I'm sitting right next to this
and I heard you dannion come in because
if I was like a room over I probably
wouldn't have heard it and you just be
kind of chilling in my kitchen to
terrify me when I come in to get some
Oreos that is my life goal as you can
see video quality is actually pretty
good the image was sharp and we didn't
have any dropouts during our test but
because this is at a fixed angle if
you've got it set up and there's a light
in the background or a window the camera
can't really manage the backlight all
that well also if you got it on a high
counter because it's tilted up it may be
difficult for kids to use it they'd
either
so this is cool if we both have deco
shows but if you don't have an echo show
you're supposed to use the Alexa app and
I just don't believe that people want to
use the Alexa app for videoconferencing
like it works for Alexa and echoes but I
don't think it works for it's something
that people really I want to use
otherwise yeah I kind of agree I think
that like you know if you want to use it
as a video calling device for your kids
to their grandparents or something you
can convince you know grandparents to
install the Alexa app but you're not
going to get all your friends onboard
that's for sure just probably good thing
well dad goodbye
make your video thanks dieter Alexa hang
up I'm actually a little disappointed
that the show can't be more I'd really
love to be able to watch Netflix Hulu
slang or another video service on it but
I can't do that yet
it also doesn't always use the fact that
it has a touchscreen sometimes I can't
touch to select things when I want to I
can ask for a local pizza place and it
will give me a list of places but then
it won't give me a map or how far away
or how to get there despite those
shortcomings the echo show is still the
first device with a screen that I've
used that I don't ever have to use my
hands
doesn't matter if my hands are full or
dirty or wet I can just ask the echo
show to do things and there's very
little setup or learning curve I just
turn it on connect it to my Wi-Fi
network and log into my Amazon account
and away I go the show doesn't have a
grid of app icons or an app store to
manage like you might find on an iPad
but it does have integrations with
third-party things that it call skills
you can ask it to install these skills
without ever having to use your phone or
if you ask it to do something that I
can't do out of the box it will actually
suggest a skill like Alexa show me
recipes for chocolate chip cookies
the skill all recipes beta can help you
with that did you want to enable it yes
searching for chocolate chip cookies
basically you're supposed to put this in
one place in your house and just leave
it there so it's ready for video call or
for you to ask it something you can
probably put it in your bedroom on your
nightstand and use it as a super fancy
alarm clock but I think most people will
find the most use out of this in their
kitchen where they can ask it for
recipes or set timers it kind of reminds
me of those old kitchen TVs people used
to have where you might have a TV show
or sports game in the background while
you were preparing a meal or washing
dishes except now you can
Spotify or prime video in the background
at 230 bucks the echo show is kind of
expensive especially if you already have
an iPad or other tablet in your kitchen
or if you own another echo device but
it's better suited to be a home computer
for everyone to share than an iPad in
many different ways it's a lot simpler
to use and it's a lot easier for groups
of people to use it as opposed to just
one person and I think people will
really like it for what it is even if it
is a little simple but if I was say a
room over you could be checking out my
[Laughter]
yeah I mean what do you think Dax that's
a good take to like I feel like we were</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
