David Pierce and I left my shiny metal
suit at the cleaners this is 90 seconds
on the verge brought to you by virginal
chat heads have come to the iphone and
ipad version 6 of the iOS facebook app
was released today and along with a UI
redesign it also features the pop-up
messaging heads that are a central
feature of facebook home unfortunately
the iOS chat heads only work within the
facebook app itself so while they may
look and act the same they don't provide
the same ubiquitous access available on
android so how does google feel about at
home Eric Schmidt called it a quote
tremendous endorsement of Google's Play
Store strategy the first google glass
explorer edition models are rolling off
production lines and we're learning more
about how google plans to deal with
glass acts according to the terms of
service developers won't be able to
charge for glassware apps or include ads
or fees of any sort apps will also only
be available through Google's own
distribution channel if you're thinking
that sounds more like the iPhone app
stores early days rather than Android
you're not alone who will did clarify
that the glass mirror API is in a quote
limited preview and that restrictions
could change down the line and finally
you'll soon be able to apply to colonize
Mars on reality TV the name of the show
is mars-1 and it will start taking
60-second video applications this July
the goal is to assemble a team of 24 one
of the astronauts train them for seven
years and then ship them off with a
one-way ticket to the red planet hi my
name's David and I'd like to go to Mars
cuz space seems pretty nice that's it
for today's top stories join us tomorrow
when I'll be debuting my nine person
backing band now what about that monkey</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
