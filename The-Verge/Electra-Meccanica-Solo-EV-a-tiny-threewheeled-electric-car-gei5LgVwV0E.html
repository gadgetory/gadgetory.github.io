Verge I'm about to hop into this the
electromechanical solo Eevee let's go
for a ride so what exactly am I in right
now this is the electromechanical solo
Eevee it is a tiny three-wheeled
electric car it costs about $20,000 as a
range of about a hundred miles at a top
speed around 80 miles an hour
it is weird it is this is only one of 18
belt so far four of them have actually
already been delivered and
electromechanical is just this company
out of Vancouver who decided to build
this weird little Eevee some other
expect you might be curious about it
takes about three to six hours to charge
out of a standard wall outlet or 220v
outlet
it has a 16 kilowatt batt heart battery
so pretty small but again good enough
for about a hundred mile range which is
pretty close to some of the Eevee's that
are out there inside you find basically
all the kinds of accoutrement you would
want inside a normal car we've got a
radio we've got air conditioning free
shot wipers I mean like it's not like
it's missing anything
it's just less of a car than most cars
the company comes from a group of people
who were a part of inner mechanika which
is an old shop that used to refurbed
Porsches really does kind of look like a
normal car from the front and then you
turn and all of a sudden it looks like a
a slipper or a mohawk I don't know what
you really call it the company that this
most directly relates to is Elio motors
who made a three wheel gasoline car that
has really fallen flat they've run into
so many troubles trying to get that on
the road and
who knows if electromechanical will face
those same kinds of troubles I think
what I like most about this car is not
the way it drives or how it looks or
anything like that it's what it
represents this is another example of
how the drop in price of electric motor
technology and battery technology is
changing everything everything from
something like this to electric scooters
to electric bikes it's making so many
people with weird ideas finally able to
challenge those weird ideas and like try
to put them on the road and that's never
really been possible before I mean we
are really seeing a revolution here
electric vehicles may only make up 1% of
the market so far but we're seeing more
weird ideas like this come out every
year it is extremely strange to be in a
car that's this small I've been in cars
that are this low that's before race
cars that are this low before it but
this is something totally different and
it feels like you're so invisible then
that scares me a little bit I haven't
had a chance to get it up to his top
speed about 85 miles an hour it has an
82 horsepower which I guess I'm feeling
I mean anything below 100 is a bit hard
to register even in a small car like
this also not very quiet in the cabin I
don't know if you can hear that the
whirr of the motor comes right through
physics from right back there I really
don't know who it's for other than
people who's out twenty thousand dollars
the burned one of my favorite things
that is driving anything that draws
attention and everybody keeps looking at
this and wondering what the hell is this
connector country
so that was a drive of the electric
mechanicus solo Eevee for all the weird
electric cars electric scooters
self-driving cars everything we've seen
at CES this week go to youtube.com slash
The Verge click Subscribe go to the
verge comm slash CES for everything else
we've seen and that's it thanks for
watching
no look at me so that was a ride in the
electromechanical
solo-e v4 sorry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
