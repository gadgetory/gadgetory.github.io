knows a lot about you
Google now is a feature that has a
potential to tie all that together in a
way that's actually meaningful they
invited us to their Mountain View campus
of California to talk to people behind
the project and see where it's going in
the future we think the phone and more
broadly kind of the computer that's with
me whether it's a phone or surveys
glasses or something else is is pretty
unique because it has them basically the
context of what I'm doing and we're on
that so we've always had a search bar
and across the very top on Android from
the very beginning
in jellybean we made a few pretty
significant changes to the search
experience on Android the first thing
that we wanted to do in and did was to
go much deeper in answering questions
directions to the museum with the
William Paley exhibition so it turns out
it's at the DeYoung museum what's
happening here is that there is a lot of
information on the web that talks about
this particular you know exhibition and
then it obviously talks about where it
is and that's the de Young Museum in San
Francisco so when I say that Google
crosses all these various different
pieces of information in my question to
give me an answer back which in this
case is actually just a map we're
obviously very excited about search on
mobile devices on Android and about the
idea of people being able to interact
with their phone and in just a natural
way and if you think about what that
takes we feel like there's a few key
elements that have to come together one
obviously is voice recognition the
second piece is once I have those words
is natural language understanding and a
third piece which is a fairly new thing
for us at Google is understanding what
are the basic kind of components and
facts in the world and this is something
we call our knowledge graph and it's
really the first time in sort of
computer science history that those
three things are all available and not
just available in some giant computation
center but of the
you know in a powerful device that's in
my pocket so one of the most important
things from Larry's founder letter from
earlier this year is the part where he
says he thinks computers should do all
the hard work for you sort of getting
all the hard stuff out of the way so you
can enjoy life you know enjoy whatever
use it they would like to do for example
if you have a flight reservation you
will have received that in your email
and you know you get to the hotel you
get to the restaurant whatever it's hard
to find it so what Google now does is
basically retrieve that information for
you automatically from your Gmail and
then display it as a card at the right
point in time right so if if you have a
hotel confirmation it'll display that
you know probably when you land in that
city I think putting together
information that's mine whether it's on
my phone or not and information that is
or the world's is absolutely critically
important people are going to expect
that of course I can have a conversation
with Google and of course Google is
gonna access more than just the public
information on the web we're both gonna
know when my flight is whether my
package has gotten here yet and you know
where my wife is and how long it's gonna
take her to get home this afternoon and
so on and so on and so on because of
course people knows that stuff we wanted
to make voice search like 10 times
better speech recognition is the process
of turning sounds into meaning and
between those two there's many levels of
processing you want to turn sounds into
what we go for news from the phonemes
you want to turn them into words from
the words you construct sentences and
then once you have a sentence you have a
transcript of what you're said you have
to turn that into something that's
meaningful for the computer to interpret
so if you're doing the search query
you're asking for pictures of cats the
the computer has to understand that your
doing an image search for the word cats
we've actually been using neural
networks for variety of tasks because if
you have a very large amount of data and
you can train big models then you just
throw more data at the problem and
you'll start to catch up pick up on
those more subtle refinements like Oh
someone's speaking with a you know an
East Coast accent play the scene where
George says it's not you it's me
so here it gives me a link directly into
YouTube which I can click on every back
end of Google every different web
service that's been developed over the
last you know ten years or so it's part
of this service what Google now is is
precisely what Google is best at how do
you do heavy amounts of computation a
large amount of data to extract patterns
into X you know into score things I
think what we've tried to do is kind of
stay true to the in some sense you could
say the personality or the persona that
Google has today it has that whimsy and
that that fun aspect inside of kind of
unexpected ways but that doesn't really
try to pretend to be your human bunny
what is an Android in science fiction a
robot with a human appearance</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
