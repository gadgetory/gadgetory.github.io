taking a look at the Samsung Galaxy s6
which is being announced here at MWC in
Barcelona it's a completely redesigned
flagship phone for Samsung it looks
significantly different than the galaxy
s5 that preceded it it's also being
announced with the galaxy s6 edge which
has a curved display but the s6 has a
flat screen as a pretty typical standard
screen for most smartphones there's a
Gorilla Glass 4 front as well as Gorilla
Glass on the back and it's a metal frame
as you can see goes all the way around
and it's goes through the phone for
structural stability
it's a significantly upgraded in terms
of looks and feel and design over the
galaxy s5 which use a lot of plastic
components the screen is a 5.1 inch quad
HD panel it really looks great it's
Super AMOLED as most Samsung displays
are it's very bright very vibrant as
come to expect from Samsung screens
below the screen is a new fingerprint
sensor that works just by touching your
fingerprint to it as opposed to swiping
like the older sensors the front-facing
camera is 5 megapixels and uses a wider
angle lens and the galaxy s5 did but
around back there's a new 16 megapixel
camera you can see it kind of doesn't
lay flush with the back here but it's a
brighter lens it's a faster camera
Samsung says there's a lot of tricks in
here to make it a better camera than
ever before they've adjusted the
processing in justed the color to
address many of the complaints that
users have had with the cameras in the
past next to it is a LED flash as well
as an IR sensor and heart rate monitor
the new IR sensor actually is able to
determine white balance so it's more
accurate white balance and the camera
itself has a new autofocus tracking mode
globally the galaxy s6 is gonna have
Samsung's octa-core exynos processor but
the company isn't saying exactly what's
going to be inside of it for the US
market
this one's paired with three gigabytes
of RAM it's gonna be available in 32 64
and 128 gigabyte versions but there's no
microSD card slot as on samsung's older
models additionally the battery on the
galaxy s6 is 25 50 milliamp hours and
it's internal so you can't remove it you
can't swap it which is something that
Samsung phones have long
to do same things is integrating
built-in wireless charging that works
with both qi and PMA pads so you can
wirelessly charge it on almost anything
that's out there and it has its quick
charging if you're using a cable so you
can get a really you can get fifty
percent charge in about thirty minutes
of charging time
additionally the speaker has been moved
to the bottom samsung says it's 1.5
times louder than the s5 and sounds
crisper and clearer and with better bass
response overall the galaxy s6 is a
pretty significant improvement in terms
of design and aesthetics and feel over
Samsung's older phones it really feels
nice in your hand it feels nice when
you're using it and it looks pretty nice
too it'll be available in q2
across the world and probably on every
carrier that you can find</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
