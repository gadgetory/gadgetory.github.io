got an autonomous Tarot mr6 hexacopter
and they've decked it out in 80,000
volts Tonga my name is Willie I'm
co-founder of chaotic moon studios and
chief innovation officer and we are in a
new soon to be expanded into space at
chaotic moons offices here in Austin
Texas so what we wanted to do is we
wanted to take some of these issues that
people have been talking about about
drones patrolling the skies and being
weaponized and all of these things and
actually do some real-world engineering
work around that to kind of raise the
awareness South by was a perfect area to
do that
the original demo we did we looked at
three areas we looked at personal safety
we looked at personal privacy and then
we looked at kind of some
law-enforcement patience in the personal
safety kind of personal drone stuff
which is where we came with the name
Cupid right chaotic unmanned personal
intercepted drone what we did is we took
a scenario of you're on a large swath of
property someone crosses a line sets off
an alarm the drone then deploys itself
it finds the the person it kind of
buzzes around them and then you get a
phone notification and it says you know
here's your video from the drone it says
detain or authorize and if you say
detain then at that point it goes back
to fully autonomous it's got its
instructions it notifies the authorities
the pre-recorded message and it tells
you you know - please kneel down on your
knees on the ground and put your hands
behind your head if you were to run away
from the property line the situational
analysis would say you're leaving you're
becoming less of a threat and so it just
hovers and stays there and let you go if
you were to continue to advance or if
you were to try to take out the drone
then it can make several semi-autonomous
and autonomous decisions on whether it
should tase you or not and then it can
continue to taste you until the
authorities arrive while this demo is
entirely piloted they say cupid's
capable of running the same test with
almost no human intervention I found a
lot about the situational analysis of
like how could this be used say to keep
officers out of danger so perhaps
there's a raid on a house and somebody
runs why send somebody with a gun and
chasing them down the alley
the drone could just go and detain them
and then you could just come in and pick
them up one of the interesting things is
we looked at fencing in other areas and
the physics that's kind of like a parry
and a thrust so that we could program
when it's in full
autonomous it can put enough slack in
the cable so that when you fall if you
run if you flop it it doesn't pull the
drone out of the sky or pull the cable
out of your back and so on and so forth
so it's actually aware of all of that
situational analysis and then it takes
action accordingly based on kind of the
physics of the environment what we
wanted to use was the stage of South by
to raise awareness of this is actually
something is possible now so that we can
kind of start a conversation about how
do you feel as a citizen about you know
police having that how do police feel
how about having it what do congressmen
think what is the F a thank you know so
on and so forth
because we think that there's a not
enough conversation right now
it's educated conversation occurring
around the entire kind of drone industry
in the end it's a simple
proof-of-concept if we want to turn
drones into non-lethal security guards
we know how to do that so how do we feel
about this if you need a security guard
would you rather have a drone with a
Taser or a human being with a gun with
an idea that's new it's hard to say for
sure even if we can build it
it feels like maybe we should
