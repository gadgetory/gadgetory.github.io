we're here with the new chromecast ultra
the biggest change for this is that it
supports 4k streams now if you pay for
the upgraded version of Netflix or
you're a heavy 4k watch around YouTube
you can get those 4k streams streamed
directly to your TV using this device it
also supports 4k streams from Google
Play Movies but that's coming later on
in November another big change of this
device is that it's 1.8 times faster
than the previous chromecast that's
whether or not you're watching 4k or not
it's just about a better processor
inside of it one other big change is
that it has an Ethernet port to the
power adapter meaning if you're a little
bit worried about your Wi-Fi connection
not being able to handle those higher
higher streams and you can simply plug
in an Ethernet port right in the power
adapter and get it sent right to the TV
one other thing that chromecast also
supports is HDR now it supports both HDR
formats including HDR 10 and Dolby
vision the device will retail for $69
it's gonna be available next month
starting in the US but with up to 16
countries around the world
so alongside the chromecast ultra
Google's rounding out if the clients
line up with a new another new device
called Google Wi-Fi so it's like a
hockey puck looking device right here
similar to products like Aero where it's
a scandal own router as on its own but
if you pair it with up to 2 other
devices it'll boost your signal
throughout your home now Google Wi-Fi is
kind of not necessarily new territory
for Google its building on the onhub
router that came out last year and it's
school trying to take control over
basically not just what you watch over
the internet or how you access
information on the internet but actual
the streams itself the data that's going
all throughout your home and to your
phones your tablets and your computer
now Google Wi-Fi is a standalone device
what costs do 129 dollars as a pack of
three you can get that for 299 dollars
now that's significantly cheaper than
Aero it's a biggest main competitor
which sells from $1.99 for one device
and then $4.99 for three devices
in terms of availability Google Wi-Fi
will be ready for pre-order in November
we'll ship in early December but unlike
some of the other devices announced
today it's us only for now
more information about the chromecast
ultra Google Wi-Fi or any of the other
devices Google announced today check out
