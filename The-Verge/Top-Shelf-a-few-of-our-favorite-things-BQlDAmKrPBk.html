welcome to top shelf my name is David
Pierce and on this show we talked about
well lots of things but mostly consumer
electronics past present future cool
terrible all that stuff this week we're
live we're talking about some of our
favorite things with some of our
favorite people we're gonna be taking
your calls but first we're talking to
ellis hamburger our reporter and
resident dude who likes apps like that's
like mostly how I describe a nap freak
how many apps do you have on your iPhone
are you like the guy with like 48 pages
of apps and you're like hold on it's
from a calendar altar nestled within
color-coded folders though is that true
yeah really oh my god I've seen that
done before downing really he's like all
my blue apps or in here actually that
some people have folders like one
folders called eat one folders called
watch and they serve it like that I kind
of like you have a folder of apps about
eating like you suck and I don't like
you and that's really that's all that's
how I feel I have a folder just of
hamburger really oh alright that's fair
I can't argue with that so you have apps
do you like yeah right you're like mr. I
try all the apps and most apps are
terrible but what are good apps tell me
about good apps right now what do you so
one of my current favorite apps is
called day one and it's a journal app
and it's kind of like a private twitter
in a way so you write down all the
little things that you might not want to
tell everybody and I'm the kind of guy
who like uses Twitter as a weird kind of
weirdo poetry that I pretend nobody else
can read I call that the the Laura June
model of twitter if you like she
invented it now everybody else and I'm
with that where it's like you don't use
punctuation you just have like thoughts
sometimes but sometimes I want something
just for me mm-hmm I want to type
something like oh man Joshua Topolsky
just tweeted my articles all right big
day and one of the nice new features
about day one is that you can actually
add tags to it so i might say oh man
joshua topolsky just tweeted one of my
articles and i'll say yeah so if you can
if you can crop in on that a little bit
and now I'm gonna have that in my
dropbox for the rest of my life you know
I can I can export to PDF I can do all
sorts of stuff so it's like you're
basically keeping a journal and you can
do though you can do like pictures in
your location and stuff like that too
right like why keep it Gary I feel like
I just tweet like all the stuff I'm
doing in my life well my for school
there's all the weird places I go and I
remember like why would I keep a diary I
mean you don't need to be you don't need
to be I was you don't need to be some
crazy diary writer right it's just like
little thoughts here and there and you
know those types of things that you
return to that you're really really
value like let's say you told a really
great joke and everyone loved it don't
you want to remember that joke I kind of
do yeah I don't feel like I feel you
thats never happened that kind of stuff
like so why did the chicken cross the
road and you're like oh they all laughed
this is great because Neal I to peer
pressured into it right something like
that yeah so that's day one I like that
and another day one there's like apps
all over the place right you can do it
like on your back and online me there's
no absolutely stuff but they got Mac
iPhone and iPad so really like that one
cool guys behind it and it just works
really well yeah it is pretty I think
they won the Apple Design Award for the
caps this year which is pretty
aggressive in yeah so so what else okay
I'm sorry so yesterday vine added
front-facing camera support how about
that huh this is like the most
earth-shattering feature that has ever
had well you see I mean that's a lot of
people use snapchat right right they use
it to say like you say hey check out
this sweet trick my cat did and I'm
gonna respond like who by good and
that's cool and all but snapchats are
like dead forever right so what I might
respond you're like let's say you say
hey Josh Topolsky just tweeted article
online this is all purely hypothetical
and I'm gonna respond something like oh
and then you hit the check mark and look
I'm gonna watch this for the rest of my
like I'm never gonna stop by and then
I'll say Josh Topolsky tweeted my
article and then I'm gonna post a new
feature as well as they added or
alongside the front facing cameras now
you can tag people really like a tag
Josh and then he he is just say it's
like a Twitter right well you can just
mention whoever you want on Twitter they
have to be on vine I have never used
value out of it you never use never once
so it's like you know how there's the
new banner when you download a new app
on your phone it's still there still
there on my phone never once you I don't
know why I think I'm like intimidated to
get into vine now it's like if I do it
at fig it would have to be really good
all the time i felt when i get back in
the back in the Instagram days I felt
late and you just gotta work your way up
you know just start work your way up
it's never too late they started like
when I see like Rondo's vines like for
anywhere doesn't know Rhonda one of our
video producers is the best person a
vine that has ever existed it's it's
like a work of art every time and I'm
just really intimidated but he's like
he's like the ansel adams of vine grande
o rondo fallen in my life by the way if
you're on twitter right now you can
actually you can check that by i just
watch it for the rest of your life so do
you use snapchat you mentioned snapchat
I like I fighter jet was dead and then
it turns out everyone we work with uses
snapchat like every single person except
for me it's kind of like you know as I
was saying earlier I like poetry and
it's cut it's a kind of visual rate / j
1 is 0 re write poems in day one yeah
about it i feel sign likes my exploding
self-destructing poetry moving snapchat
sure that's private just for my friends
okay and explodes intense so it's right
so it's like the the exploding poetry
and then the selfies poetry mm-hmm and
then the actual poetry goes need a one
and i mean i might like this whole thing
we think i was letting loose on vine hmm
wait till you see the snaps no to get
even my expect snaps i expect snaps yeah
the only thing about it is that it's
hard you can't see if somebody sent you
a snap or if they sent you and 10 other
people and snap so let's say they send
you something really sweet like you look
great today and then you feel all good
and then like and then the person next
to you is like oh man
believe Rhonda said I look great today
and you're thinking thought that was
like me like a dick pic you're like I'm
the only one and then it turns out it
was everybody yeah that's really i'm
excited for some snapchat mistakes yeah
so uh so another app i really like is
ridiculous fishing yes and it is
ridiculous and it is fishing so it
explains a mechanic animates gets don't
want explain how this works so basically
you let down your lure you try and dodge
as many fish as you can right and you
can even use chainsaws and stuff like
that you know just like a nice you do
yeah yeah there's like a coaster you use
that just kills a fish sometimes yep the
whole yeah also the arts great it's
really realistic in terms of types of
fish you can catch that's true and on
the way up you try and catch as many
fish as you can and then once it gets to
the surface all the fish fly into the
air and you blow them up with a minigun
it all makes such perfect sense when you
explain it yeah so so here's here's
ridiculous fishing let's go fish in here
for a second so the thing i love that
escape i played this a lot on my ipad
especially and the thing I love is you
you can like by power up so you get
money for all these guns right and Lou
and I bought like an Uzi and just you
just domestic a job it's amazing yeah
and you just you just eat fish sure oh
alright so i think i only got one more
life so i'm gonna try and catch as many
as i can on the way up here the thing
about this like watching you do this
right now just looks fun at all but it's
it's like a some really fun and
addicting and this is actually this
level is called the Maelstrom and it's
the only level that doesn't have a
bottom middle 8c wow you're a lot
further than i am in this game
I didn't catch too many fish but you get
the idea yeah you're a cups importance
you buy some cool hats and and it's fun
that's about it it's one of those things
where like I I have I have I live in
Brooklyn and I have a friend who lives
in astoria which is like an hour and
what's on the subway yeah and I
literally I just like started going to
his place more often I like I'll just
play somebody kills fishing be totally
fine I just play for like eight hours a
day and it won't be a big deal yeah it's
great and you still probably have to
fish left to get probably I don't think
I'm very far in this game it's which is
sort of setting like you have clear
message boards dedicated to the
different debts at which for certain
fish occur I believe that and you know I
got a bookmarked have you played fish
out of water that's the other game i'm
super now I haven't I know you're into
it I take about it all yeah so I like I
wrote a thing and it doesn't make any
sense at the games phone but then you
like get scores out of 10 and like three
games after this comes out ross miller
sends me a picture you got a perfect 10
and now i'm like obsessed with this game
and I can't really enjoy Ross work or
Pete Ross it's it's not I mean it's not
a fair comparison so what else give me
one more cool app one more cool app
let's say well dude are you like a
weather app dude I feel like you're
crazy about whether stuff I like weather
apps yeah it seems like here's like you
and dan seifert you're like let so try
all the other apps this one's called
today weather and this is the best app
I've found to balance lots of
information with great looks and there's
even radar from the dark sky API and if
you can see that so your main screen
you've got New York you have the high
the low some really nice art you have
the wind and the precipitation you know
next few hours but then the cool thing
that I like the most you go this way you
get hourly forecast looks and most apps
do this in some weird ugly way but this
one's great and it just keeps going it's
not just today and you swipe to this
panel and you have really cool graphic
for the whole week that is a recive so
let's say you want to do you can have
Detroit few different that's forever so
you can do you can pinch out and you can
like get a better glimpse if you want of
what's going on let's say if you're if
you know you're a cool traveler guy
right and you free
only go between san francisco and london
and bangkok and like I know you do to
test out new girl obviously yeah so I do
for LTE speeds it's great app it's uh
it's my favorite weather app that's
awesome we're now now for like 20
minutes and then we something x 25
minutes at least you know what I'm super
into is the Yahoo weather app it is the
ugliest icon on my phone by far but it's
like pretty and they have pictures of
buildings and that's apparently all I
can say yahoo logo like in that icon
three different times yes i think y and
this is Yahoo and then the icon actually
says yahoo itself yeah it's it's really
upsetting actually so you can see wanna
see this the icon on here what are the
ladies gonna wear it says whether it's
purple and it says weather and but it's
mostly like yahoo and it's just it's
just hideous but the app itself is
really nice and it's you know it's got
pictures of bridges and clouds and like
this is I'm like an eight-year-old kid
all I need is bridges and clouds and I'm
a happy guy yeah um alright Ellis go go
play fish out of water and go play
Russell this is this is the new my my
family I like grew up playing Scrabble
and Russell is like the coolest word
game I've ever played I'm a durable
party letter presses is for chumps
everything I'm just gonna say that every
time somebody roses its take a shot and
it's gonna be great that's gonna be you
were all gonna die all right Ellis thank
you very much my pleasure appreciate it
so with me now to talk about bigger
considerably more expensive things is
chris sigler who is he's a man of
mystery really he's in chicago and he
loves cars probably more than anything
except for nike high tops and Chris
you're joining us now hello Chris David
my needs are simple I only want to find
us things in life just like the really
cool high tops to drive your BMWs that's
right that basically right yeah so so
you you've been like mr. car guy I feel
like we didn't really cover cars and
then you were like you know we're gonna
do now is write about cars a lot because
I like cars want to ride in cars I'm on
the car beat man kind of our and you you
let invented it for us which is cool so
tell me tell me about cool cars you
wrote a thing about the porsche 959
which was nifty i did not but you've
also done you've seen a lot of cool
stuff recently tell me what what you're
into
well I think he kind of started with the
with CES this year right where we
covered the the lexus self-driving car
and the Audi self-driving car where they
actually had a demo on site that we did
a video for you should check it out if
you haven't in fact we talked about it
on a top-shelf episode and yes I see my
yes and then of course we did the Tesla
I don't want to call it a review but the
Tesla feature shortly thereafter the
Christian Tesla piece yes yeah yes
there's gonna be a lot of Chris drives X
in the future in my perfect future we'll
see we'll see what happens but but yeah
I mean you know I I think that it over
the course of the next five years
there's going to be such an amazing
growth in technology in the automotive
industry that you know the the the car
mystery is notoriously slow in catching
up to the kind of technology that we
cover and there are some good reasons
for that one of which is that the car
industry is physically not in Silicon
Valley historically of course Tesla's
but everybody else is kind of isolated
in Detroit which is not a particularly
it's becoming more tech savvy now in
fact there's a lot of cool stirrups are
now but everybody has Germany or in
Germany in Germany yes so so that's
that's one thing but then also I think
even even more importantly is the fact
that they are subject to many many
regulations and frankly they're
hamstrung by regulation in a way that
most industries aren't so you know if
they want to like invent like a new cool
kind of tail light it takes like five
years of wrangling with every government
in the world to allow them to do that in
fact right now audi is arguing with the
US Department of Transportation over
this new headlight that they've invented
called matrix lighting where they can
dynamically change the throw of the
light based on where oncoming traffic is
so that there's never any glare to the
oncoming driver and they won't let him
sell it here because it's going to
require like years and years and years
of testing and certification so that's
the kind of thing they have to deal with
wait so is this like these lights are
talking about is this the kind of thing
where like the guy with his brights on
who blinds you forever and you kind of
want to murder them in their car is that
like this could end that and they're not
letting it happen because you know
there's regulation in place getting rid
right side the problem right that's
awful that's like really upsetting so
the next time a driver is blinding you
on the road you can thank the the US
government Obama and now that's good
that's right yeah so because of what
care is my its Obamacare's fault yeah uh
so um in February I checked out that you
know I live in Chicago went to the
chicago auto show on a media pass and
had an opportunity to spend a little bit
of time not driving but checking out the
cadillac ELR by the way this is just
vacation for you right you took time off
to go to the chicago auto show just i
did this is a true story late last year
actually took two days of vacation and
covered both media days today I just
went for one or this year I just went
for one nice um but but yeah I checked
out the cadillac ELR which is it's based
on the same voltec platform as the the
Chevy Volt so it's it's it they called
an extended-range hybrid it can drive 35
or 36 miles on electric alone just like
a Tesla and then when you run out of
juice it transitions over to a gas
engine then you drive on that until you
have the opportunity to charge again the
difference being that the ELR is a coupe
and it's much much much more stylish
than the voltage the mold is kind of a
nerdy looking car for lack of a better
term yeah and the ELR is is really
pretty both inside now and so they'll go
on sale early next year and I'm really
looking forward to checking that out but
in terms of favorites I can't call it
the ELR a favorite yet because I've been
driven it there but I am going to call
the mercedes-benz sls electric drive a
favorite without having driven it early
so why is it what's so special about
that because it's like it's like a 700
horsepower electric car its first of all
it's a nice nonetheless right it's based
on that so less so it's it's a Gullwing
it's just a gorgeous vehicle and then
they throw an electric motor on every
wheel that generates a total of
something like 700 horsepower so you can
imagine this is a just an absurdly quick
car that will glue you to the back years
seat and they the model that they've
been showing that the the prototype is
is painted in this like bizarre
metallic panel fits like a mylar rapper
it's actually painted but it's got this
this bright metallic look that looks
like it it literally literally like came
in on a meteor there's no other way to
point like it's like this bright blue
like it's insane this course right now
like it yes it might kill you at any
moment and it might have later this is
how I'd go it's fine yes it might
actually turn into uh not not about
what's the Decepticon Decepticon like
your new Decepticon and murder you um
but but please by all means google this
car and check it out you'll see what I'm
talking but then buy one for us Ziegler
yes buy one for me so is this car like
is this a car of a billion dollars is
this like yes are regular people ever
gonna be able to buy this car or
anything like it that's all I select
your drive no absolutely not date so
that the base price on the standard SLS
which is you know just a gas-powered car
is something on the order of two hundred
thousand dollars and then the electric
drive i'm assuming the the the pricing
might be out there I don't know first of
all is not gonna be sold in the US at
least that's what mercedes-benz told me
secondly where it is going to be sold
it's going to be sold for much much more
than the the internal combustion version
and I'm assuming it's gonna be sold in
very limited numbers anyway because this
technology is still young they're still
working out the kinks I'm guessing these
are gonna be hand-built so so yeah get
out your checkbook so is is there
anything in terms of like normal cars
for normal people even not specific cars
but like technology or anything that
you're seeing that's really cool that
you've either gotten a drive or just see
that's awesome and like when I buy a car
I might actually get this other ipod
dock in my car which is not that awesome
well you know we wrote it so I I'll
answer that in two ways the one of the
really big tropes right now in the
automotive world is the concept of this
really highly integrated center stack
where you can plug in your phone and it
sometimes it has a 3G or 4G connection
can do all these different things has
smartphone apps that can connect to the
the car and add like you know Spotify or
Rdio or slacker or whatever those stacks
are very young and I think that when you
look at even this second if you go out
and look at like it you know a focus
with ford sync
or you look at like Chevy MyLink or you
look at Hyundai luvo or kia or whoever
whoever is over blue linker all these
different stacks they're very very young
and immature and not particularly easy
to use Cadillac use another example
which is what the lr is going to have
and I think it's going to take some time
for these guys to really work out how to
do this in a way that's in sync with the
level of UX design and usability that we
have in like the smartphone world for
instance so we're not there yet is it's
going to take years so that's that's the
first part of my answer second part is
if you look at like the Fiat Fiat 500e
which we wrote about recently this is
electric car not particularly expensive
has decent range and for urban dwellers
you know driving the the Tesla really
opened my eyes I was always like a super
like EV skeptic I hated the things hated
the concept and I still have a problem
with the lack of infrastructure but
major cities it's not that big of an
issue especially if you're not driving
very much or you're not driving very
long distances so if you look at the
500e that's going to be I think that's
for many people that's going to be their
first like practical introduction to an
EV like a true EV now that's something
like a volt or a hybrid okay so I have
to let you go here but I have exactly
one more question for you and to be
honest this is a very important thing I
have to ask you fast and furious 6 yeah
he's going to be the best movie I've
ever seen or the best movie anyone has
ever seen ever uh those are two
opposites by the way the land the movie
is going to be so good that Hollywood is
literally going to be like well that's a
wrap there's nothing else we can do
that's going to top this movie we can
shut it down they're gonna fire all the
actors it's gonna be that good trust me
okay I'm assuming so I'm just gonna buy
a theater now and just live there
watching this movie over and over for
the rest of my life do it man alright
Chris thank you so much appreciate it go
steal that Mercedes for me and we will
flee the country together and everything
on it wonderful you can count on me
perfect alright with me now freshly back
to the internet
sort of freshly I guess I feel like
you've done a lot in the last couple
days but anyway Paul Miller Paul Miller
welcome back thank you so you've you're
like you're what are you 48 hours in yet
you're 36 hours in being on the internet
through six something right have you
have you slept in these 36 hours um like
eight hours total okay just a lot of a
lot of internet to catch up on ya
tonight last night got pretty bad he
doing I was night I found these like
I've had this app for for ipad like for
like learning Latin it was like flash
card interesting I just started do like
tons and tons of flashcards and I
started flashcards for like English
vocabulary and like mythology I don't
know it's cut so like speak some lying
to me right now oh my gosh I don't know
you don't you get it if you gave me some
flash flash cards with like a
vocabulary range of like 20 flash cards
I could probably figure them out after
like five times through that's where
that's where I'm at with women right
brilliant almost fluent nice yeah you're
pretty close and it's good because it's
a language a lot of people use and speak
all exactly yeah I really wanna know i'm
i think that's Janice bringing a line
with modern culture so what have you
like you've been back what have you you
know we sort of foisted stuff on you
when you first came back yeah vacuum
kitty which has changed my life forever
by the way I've never seen it before you
react so thank god you're so i get to
see vacuum kidding yeah but so like what
have you you've had a chance to like
explore yourself if you just spent the
whole time looking your email that you
had 40 million of or are you gonna do
you know well so that first night i got
like I almost had like a panic attack it
was really who's really like truly
overwhelmed really I'll bet I'm sure it
was it was I mean just even having a few
tabs open you know like like we take for
granted how good we are using the
internet yeah but like I am not very
good at right now and I'm just trying to
relearn it and so like I've watched some
like silly videos and some silly gifts
and some people giving me some links and
my sister was over she was showing me
some of her favorite videos and stuff
like that and watch some music videos
with my roommate
and but like most of it is yeah just
like I'm sitting there on Twitter
sitting there in my email I don't
understand my email yeah I haven't
gotten any past like the the moment I
came online like I haven't looked at the
archives I have 22,000 on red muah and I
haven't gone back or you can even try
you're just gonna bail well the thing is
it's like what if there's a cool thing
in there you know you're twenty two
thousand eight I want to like if I was
like a filter king and figure out a way
to like a ninja way my way through yeah
that's yeah i mean i saw kyle kramer one
of our video producers or one of our
video guys here was going through his
email he was like inspired by you coming
back and he went through nineteen
thousand emails in like the hour before
you came back she says kim man's got
tips 19,000 he i think mostly was just
selecting all in marking is red and then
got to the end oh you wanted feel fit
you wanted it just to look like it was
already claimed he like dealt with it
but i think you oh yeah so what's like
if we're talking about favorite things
right to your you've been back for two
days what's your what's your favorite
internet stuff the illness i think it's
obvious that i'm just crazy about
twitter okay like you kind of came back
with a vengeance twitter was the thing
that i missed the most and like like my
mind still like worked in that way we
were like a month or two where I'd be
formulating tweets all the time but I
couldn't tweet him and you keep like a
140 character diary you don't want every
first actually okay and then that faded
after a while and I became just an on
Twitter user yeah but now like I'm just
so into it I just want to tweet all the
times and it's like I gained like a
bunch of the followers i was so excited
I keep getting Maddie try to request
them because you kept getting more
followers and look he's no tweeting
anything he keeps getting more fault
yeah that's pretty yeah you should try
that just don't try it for a year say
that David why don't you just quit okay
i'm all right i'm gone see it's been fun
yeah and i love vine and snap channel
you guys were just talking about that
well so tell like why why do you get
some of that you've been vining like
crazy well as vine is actually wrote an
editorial about the set at CES this year
hmm yes this year where it's like we get
so much technology but like i'd say like
ninety-eight percent of the stuff
on that show floor was to consume media
basically true and vine is a way to
create media and it's a you know
Instagram is awesome and in fact like I
see a lot of people who like there's a
lot of crosstalk between people of great
Instagram and people who are great
photographers interests and even
inspires photographers to be better and
photographers are on there following
each other vine is like that for video
and like you are making little short
films well yeah you could just make a
vine of your fit you could be Ellis you
know just be silly I camera yeah just
ham it up really proud yeah well like
you can make little short films with it
I'm just excited you know it's a little
higher barrier to entry I understand
that not everybody's gonna want to do it
but I'm so excited to have an app that's
creative and then snapchat is
interesting because the exact reason
that I think I am too into Twitter it is
the reaction to that where I am a
performer on Twitter and I'm rice
basking in the attention I get on
Twitter but snapchat is about the people
that you're directing the snapchats at I
like that it's really it's personal and
and you don't you don't get to glory in
it forever and even if even if you send
an amazing snapchat the best that person
could do is describe it to somebody else
they can't even sure they can retweet it
so it's really really really for the
person or people you send it to and I
think that's just there are isn't much
on the internet like that see that's
like the first time anyone's ever made a
compelling case to me for either of
those apps and like I will say have you
seen the the vine competition they did
at tribeca for like the best six second
videos so much stuff people did was
amazing like incredible it's like you
said short films there six seconds long
and you would think it would just be
like you know goofy people staring at
things but it's not like people doing
really cool stuff I think that's why I'm
intimidated by it cuz I'm like I want to
be good and I I know yeah it's
intimidating and I already feel that
like I probably not that good at it feel
like I'm just goofin right now we had
the one where you threw the frisbee that
was you that nervous like that was like
a team effort of our bar that looks
pretty a pretty low-end 12
electro Lynn google glass that's a nice
on it and it's like my edit is very well
I should have like redone it you know I
got to take pride in my vibe but yeah
it's just like doing something like that
and exercising creative muscle is like
so awesome and that's what I did when I
was a kid hmm and it's something that
it's easy to like stop doing when you're
just in consumption though yeah so let's
talk gadgets so you gave up lots of
stuff you have yeah you were you know
you were mr. gadget guy you were the
pixel density enthusiasm for so long and
kind of gave all that up and now you're
back like do you have are you gonna buy
a smartphone or you're gonna buy you
know you have an iPad yeah you're gonna
buy a new one or a laptop like what's
what's struck your fancy since you come
back I wanted like a data only android
phone because I never really got much of
an experience with Android and it sounds
like it's just getting better okay which
is awesome did it and it is the HTC
first everybody loves it facebook phone
yeah yeah I think that's gonna be it
because I don't think I want something
that's so huge okay uh cuz you have your
do you have your current phone on you
though like tiny island in there it's
like a little wall we go yeah like if
you had a phone in 1994 it looks like
yeah it's it's it was like twenty
dollars now stupid like loves I know
have a contract on it easy i just have a
Tory just walked into a store and gave
them 29 yeah this is this fine um and
then I'm gonna wait for the 5s okay and
I'm kind of I'm kind of impatient with
Apple at this point I thought I'm gonna
upgrade all my laptop pretty soon I
thought there'd be a retina macbook air
by now it's it has to come eventually
all right I would think but you're young
wait forever yeah it's true so but I get
a macbook air gonna wait for the retina
rubber and I think I might want to get
I'm trying to think if I want to get a
ipad mini mm-hmm or like a kindle
paperwhite probably go with the kindle
cuz i already have an ipad 3 ads
everything is I updated to six cuz i was
on 5mm after these six and everything is
like a lot of times iOS updates i kind
of bog your device you must have spent
like an entire day updating stuff by the
way just between like your computer and
your ipad is like to the internet i
spent a lot of time like updating things
I had to do
some stuff off my hard drive to make a
room for mountain lion mm-hmm that's
some sorry so sorry about not but it you
know it wasn't that hard so people are
asking me about it and to be honest like
I I was update free for a year it's true
so nothing bro payback now if there was
some stuff on there that was broke and
so it was broke all year uh sure yeah
but nothing nothing that i had that was
running at this entry here wasn't
running at the end of the year that was
kind of cool it's like the glass half
full way to look at yeah and I also
something I I don't know if you know
this for the on the xbox and ps3 if you
get a game and you have an outdated
firmware uh-huh and asks you to update
if you're not connected to the Internet
the new firmware is on the disk even
with some blu-ray movies real update
your ps3 so needing the internet is just
kind of I have the newest dashboard as
far as I know oh my i have a pretty
fresh dashboard of my xbox cuz i bought
a recent game and it updated it for me
nice that's so there you go yeah now you
and you're always on internet
connections right yeah so so anything
else like are you super psyched to be
back to netflix to be watch house of
cards yet no you know that's a big thing
is I haven't had I'm don't thinking we
could get netflix at first okay wanna
like ease back into it yeah like that's
a really great place to binge but I
haven't had any time to really sit back
and do anything like I really want to
catch up on the music I missed oh
interesting and I just had you where are
you going I like record stores and stuff
like that or did you just kind of ignore
music idris you know like me and my
roommate would go to like flea market by
random records nice uh he got me
Graceland for christmas okay no that was
it plan on like your Victrola and no we
have a really nice record player like we
have a nice setup and we really
experience music and like I don't want
to be pretentious but like I've gotten
grown accustom to like kind of sitting
there and enjoying music okay or like
what I do listen to something in the
background it's like wall i'm writing
mmm I've hunkered down I'm doing one
thing and then music's going okay but
like the thought of trying to enjoy some
of this new music that I have
heard well like doing these billions of
things so and I so I haven't written
anything since I got back and I'm like I
want to describe my experiences to
people I'd like I can't find the time
well as I was going to ask like you you
one of the things you wrote in your
piece which you should all read if you
haven't yet it's wonderful um it was how
you like slowly got used to reading
books again and I think that would be
I'm curious to see if that holds up for
you or like you have this long attention
span for reading now yeah I wonder how
could that I go it because it shows that
I can't read anything I don't want it's
really upset you know that one of the
things that like really really really
hit me when I am just started off the
internet I had the copy of the Odyssey
mm-hmm translated by Alexander Pope okay
he spent shoot I'm gonna get this wrong
it's either 10 years or 20 years Wow
translating the Odyssey and the alien
Wow anyway it's a long time people
didn't live that long back in I don't
know when it was like the seventeen
hundreds i was like three generations
appeared like like is the oldest man you
know like him people have asked me like
for the year was a really long time and
it's like I don't know like I think
there are ther are a lot of things that
are easy and quick and fun to digest but
there are things that are valuable
enough to not just spend two hours on
but maybe to spend a lot a lot a lot of
time I want to create things like that
and and consume things like that and so
I want to keep that long attention span
just as much for creativity as for
consumption so yeah I mean and that's
like that's sort of what's interesting
about you liking vine is right it's like
cool ways to do stuff and you don't
really need a long attention span which
is yeah on but do you like what else
have you gotten into do you think you'll
do sort of longer form things like there
are all these cool apps for reading now
and there's you know amazon has the cool
thing where you can listen to a book and
then read the book and do you think are
you are you just sort of staving off the
horribleness of being back with
technology or anything kit like will it
help you like a kindle might help in
that case having sent me claps or Latin
fog like not even kidding no that's true
because there's there is something about
like because I have a bunch of books
online a dictionary and stuff like that
age there's something it's hard
me to get off the couch and get into
something and it's hard to keep going at
it it's just really tough but like these
educational games yeah they kind of come
to you and they make it a little more
fun and I think stuff like that is going
to be really great I want to enjoy that
kind of technology I don't want to get
into everything all at once i wanna i
want to keep some stuff for me I don't
know so what woody what are you waiting
on your waiting on netflix wait is there
anything else you're sort of worried
about getting revenge well there's like
like Facebook you getting back on
facebook I'm actually gonna a wife I
want to do more Facebook than Twitter or
leaving it out of it okay cuz my family
is on facebook right randos are on
twitter okay awesome what can I know
that I've scoped rifle that I love
dearly individually no like I it's
awesome talking to two bunch of people
you don't know but i also want to talk
to people i do now so I actually I think
I'm gonna be try to be a little slow
with getting back into Minecraft okay
I'm trying out the play diablo for a
while that's what big time so ya think
you were big into starcraft before that
was like yeah yeah you know like
starcraft is something that you have to
Train act it's like going to the gym for
a long time before you can be an athlete
right and so those are things were like
I want to do them eventually but I'm
gonna like know that I really have the
time that's appropriate to set aside and
I can really do a quality I don't want
to play minecraft distracted I want to
play minecraft and make something
awesome and minecraft and high five
everybody in Minecraft yeah and then you
know go on to the next thing okay see I
like that I feel like that's like that's
like the perspective you sort of got
from off the internet it's like I you
can still do all these things but you
want to like do them I feel like I run
out of time I give ten different things
like ten percent of my attention at all
times or like one percent of my
attention for a hundred things and I
kind of like the idea that you're like
I'm gonna do one thing at a time even
though there's infinitely more things to
do and the number one thing for me and
maybe it's sappy but it's probably set
people if you like spit like a hundred
percent on a person yeah is not to be
trifled it's an awesome thing yet I got
to do for a year and
I've already seen myself a little
distracted and because now that I see it
so vibrantly and I think I could fade to
a point where I don't think I'm
distracting but I am yeah so I want to
like tion stuff that might be
distracting when I want to be spending
time no I like that that's the reason
don't get smart phone if you want to be
that way don't eat don't ever eat as
well do you think a smartphone would
help me like win an email and get ahead
of stuff and stay on top of things and I
mean I kind of love your idea of getting
like keeping your old crappy phone for
like voice and text so that like goes
everywhere with you all the time and
when you're just like getting you know
walking around on the subway or
something you bring your data on my
smartphone so you can do all that stuff
but then GMO on some right where it's
now it's like even if I'm with somebody
and all I want to do is like be
reachable by phone if like there's an
emergency or something bad happens i
still have my phone and then it buzzes
and it's all then you discover the ls
made an amazing vine right in the
watcher I have to watch it and I'm like
hold on girlfriend yeah just pause for
three to four hours while I read twitter
