described as a computer that you wear on
your face which is not entirely untrue
but what if there was a virtual reality
headset that had all the components of
an all-in-one PC and you didn't have to
be tethered to a separate computer
that's what Intel is pushing with
project alloy it's new prototype design
for merged reality experiences now this
isn't a headset that Intel is going to
sell directly to consumers but instead
it plans to partner with companies like
Microsoft to create a headset that it
thinks is going to offer a unique
experience I don't know about you but I
could use a little break from actual
reality lately so we went down to
Intel's headquarters in Santa Clara to
try on project alloy and find out a
little bit more about what merged
reality is supposed to be this is
project alloy it's a prototype headset
that Intel is built to show potential
hardware partners what it's capable of
is a bunch of processors and intel's
realsense cameras built directly into it
and it runs in a battery so you don't
have to be tethered to anything although
it could work that way too
the mobility of project alloy along with
this concept of merge reality are really
what's supposed to set it apart merge
reality means that you can bring real
world objects into a virtual environment
and then make them virtual too you can
also see other people in the room in
your virtual world it's kind of bizarre
and cool and disorienting
if microsoft's hololens is all about
augmented reality meaning you can see
all of the real world with a layer of
computing over it an oculus rift is all
about virtual reality meaning you're
entirely in a virtual world just lies in
this crazy place in between so for
example while we were shooting this
video I found myself in a completely
virtual environment but one where I
could still see my berge colleagues and
the other people in the lab I could use
physical objects to play a virtual game
if someone handed me a piece of paper
and pen I could still see well enough to
write a note with it while I had to be
our headset on I could even check the
time and a real physical watch or take a
selfie while I was wearing the headset
so a VR headset like this is arguably
stay
because it means you're not blocking out
everything around you and maybe you'll
be less likely to walk into something it
also means you don't need complex
sensors or fancy hand controllers in
order to have a more interactive
experience the model I tried is only
version 1 of project alloy it was pretty
clunky and honestly didn't fit all that
well it also felt heavy on my head
even though Intel says that in an ideal
world project alloy headsets won't weigh
more than around one and a half pounds
and a lot of the real world objects that
appeared in my virtual world whether it
was a person standing in front of me or
even my own hands we're sort of
pixelated and difficult to see but Intel
says a second updated project outlay
headset it's coming sometime in the new
year with better internals and a sleeker
design it will have the newer Intel Core
processor KB Lake and improved computer
vision chip from Ovidius and the option
for a discreet graphics card intel also
has a series of dedicated lab setup in
its offices where the company is
constantly testing things like latency
in other words how many milliseconds it
takes for real-world stuff to show up in
your computerized world so far only
Microsoft has publicly committed to
working with Intel on this project but
Intel is hoping that project alloy is
intriguing enough that other companies
will want to jump on board as well
so right now VR is kind of all over the
place right you have these super simple
experiences where you can just throw
your phone and a piece of cardboard or
even a cloth headset and use it that way
and then you have really advanced VR
experiences that usually require
tethering to some sort of computer
system intel is hoping to strike the
balance between something that offers
mobility and something that's powerful
which so far has been really difficult
to achieve but in an alternate reality i
guess anything's possible
throwing your phone and a piece of card
bare card bare hard bare that card bared
headwear super cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
