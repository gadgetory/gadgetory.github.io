earlier videos but I love a good Kindle
especially a new one what she needs to
say is that she likes spending money on
gadgets that clever marketing campaigns
have convinced her she needs no I just
like buying high quality items that I
know I'm going to get a lot of value out
of like this new Kindle Oasis
it wasn't the Kindle Oasis new in 2016
no this is the new new Kindle Oasis and
it's even better for reading books you
know it's really good for reading books
books Amazon launched this Kindle Oasis
last fall and it replaced the previous
Kindle Oasis oh yeah I remember now that
was the first Kindle Oasis and it wasn't
waterproof well surprise this one is
finally waterproof it also costs two
hundred and forty nine dollars which is
fifty dollars less than the original
Oasis that's still a lot of money for a
Kindle let me guess this is the part
where you say the Kindle paperwhite is
the best Kindle ever no actually I I've
turned a new leaf I'm off of Twitter I'm
only checking Facebook once a day and
I'm reading real books real books so
basically you're trying to go back to
living in 2008 sometimes I think that
wouldn't be such a terrible thing now
this new Kindle Oasis has the brightest
highest resolution display of any Kindle
and I bet you can barely see the
difference no I mean this actually
matters when you're in a dark
environment and you're just trying to
see what's on the page right which is
why I have this book lamp we just okay
that is the nerdiest thing I've ever
seen you do did you carry that here in
your knitting bag yeah okay also this is
square shaped and it's weighted in such
a way that it's really easy to hold in
one hand what does it matter that it's
square shaped okay try holding that in
one hand comfortably
for an extended period of time okay
that's probably one of the only things
the Kindle is good for it has these page
turn buttons here who needs buttons to
turn okay and like other Kindles it has
a touchscreen so you can just navigate
through chapters by tapping on it or you
can even press on a word to get its
definition so if you're lazy or you like
skipping entire chapters of books and
that's the product for you is what
you're saying also its battery life is
excellent if you read for about a half
hour a day with the screen set to 40% of
its maximum brightness you should get
about six weeks of battery life out of
this you know how long this thing lasts
unless there's a fire or a flood or a
nuclear event forever to last forever it
doesn't need to be charged you just pick
it up and you read it speaking of floods
this is the first Kindle that's
waterproof finally an Amazon made a
virtual assistant that infiltrated
everybody's homes before it managed to
make a waterproof skin yeah so you can
bring this in the tub or the pool or
even the ocean and not worry that if you
drop it in you're going to break it if
you drop that book at the tub it's
ruined that's not true I mean you'd have
to shake it out a bit and let it air dry
and it'd probably be pretty wrinkled but
it's readable it's totally fine uh-huh
and this kindle supports audible so you
compare it with bluetooth headphones and
have your books read aloud to you sake
just get a tablet then look I know
people really like their Kindles and
they're great for some things but I just
prefer actual books I dog-ear pages you
know and I love when you can see what
someone else is reading and not just a
leather-bound gadget that moment when
you're on the train and you look across
the aisle and your eyes meet across the
top of the page you sound like an
unhinged Craigslist ad
okay we'll look people don't collect
Kindles
collect books they don't buy Kindle
cases they invest in bookcases and when
I'm done I can share these books with
all of my friends which is more than you
can do because of DRM yeah but the same
modern technology means that I have
access to all the same books that you do
but in seconds not days also when I go
on vacation my carry-on bag is a lot
lighter than yours I don't mind
slow shipping I mean with Amazon Prime
it's usually more like a couple days and
these arrive wait so you're you're
ordering all of your books off of Amazon
no I mean some of them a lot most of
them from we're both just giving all of
our money to Amazon did I mention that I
only buy used books this one is
waterproof it's oh it's I forgot what I
was going to say because I improvised
should we do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
