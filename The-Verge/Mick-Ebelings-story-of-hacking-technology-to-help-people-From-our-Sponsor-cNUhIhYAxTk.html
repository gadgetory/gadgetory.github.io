concept of Technology and creativity
colliding
i was born in Long Beach California and
then moved out to phoenix arizona tempe
phoenix arizona grew up in a fantastic
family parents were married until the
day my dad died so every summer at
literally every summer we would go on a
family vacation and we've got the same
family vacation every year and we would
camp at to camp sites every single time
we would leave the campground my dad
would always say you always leave the
campground cleaner than when you found
it and looking back now it's one of
those things that ever so subtly just
ingrained a certain way of thinking into
my brother and I in terms of just trying
to make the world a slightly better
place in 2009 i got bit by this bug of
using and hacking technology for the
sake of humanity and taking technology
and actually applying it to things that
are gonna create a more global good i
came back from dinner one night after
having a conversation with a friend of
mine and he told me about this doctor
out in south sudan who was helping the
people of the nuba mountains who were
getting bombed and there was a large
number of amputees out there went online
and and researched him a little bit and
was just blown away by his story and the
story of a young boy named Daniel who
dr. Tom had helped stitch up and that
story for me was one of those stories
that you couldn't just read it
it was just something that stuck in me
that I had to do something earlier in
the summer we had just interviewed a guy
named Richard vanassa he created this 3d
printed prosthetic solution that was
amazing and now he was making it for
other kids who needed it we ended up
going to Africa if we found Daniel which
that was a miracle and of itself that we
found this young boy who at the time was
in a 70,000 person refugee camp when we
put the arm on him for the first time
all of a sudden he started to see oh my
oh my gosh I've got an arm now and that
I think was the moment for him where he
got it like he totally understood like I
am gonna have this extension now and it
works after we made the arm for him he
was able to feed himself we made our
train our trip up to dr. Tom and then we
taught about eight or nine young men who
were working at the hospital how to 3d
print and how to make these arms
themselves in my life if I can keep
causing or being exposed to those
moments of realization that was like
pure moments of just aha like oh my gosh
and doing that in a way that's actually
like pushing society forward and
advancing us as a species then man
that's that's that's all I can wish for
the thing that I'm most excited about is
that this has awoken the realization
that this is not rocket science if we
can continue to show people that
technology is not this foreign
inaccessible thing that you can't
actually use but it's something that's
very real and that can help the world
and help individuals within their
the world then then project Daniels
going to be the first of many things my
name is makeb lean and this is my story
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
