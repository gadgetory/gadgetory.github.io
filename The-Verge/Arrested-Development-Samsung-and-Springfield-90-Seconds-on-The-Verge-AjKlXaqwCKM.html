two parts bourbon in a dash of steel
french fry don't judge this is 90
seconds on the verge the Blues are back
on Sunday netflix released all 50 new
episodes of Arrested Development the new
season reunites career Mitch Hurwitz
with the show's original cast not at the
same time scheduling conflicts
unfortunately prevented the entire group
from being in the same room for more
than a few days so the show features a
few narrative and even some technical
tricks to work its way around the
limitation so is it worth your seven
half hours I'd say so but let's let's
all agree on a two-week moratorium
source way Samsung's Gus fat-ass new
device is on its way and we'll probably
see the next month the company will be
holding an event in london on jun 20th
there'll be showcasing both its galaxy
and a teeth lines which means we'll be
seeing new android devices and even
something for windows that timing is
very likely not a coincidence apple's
big developer conference is one week
before samsung revenge and microsoft is
one week after finally you two will be
able to visit Springfield but you gotta
go to Florida universal has announced
that the new simpsons themed area of
universal studios orlando is almost
ready to open it expands upon the
simpsons ride already there and we'll
add real-life versions of Krusty Burger
Moe's Tavern and even a duff beer
brewery springfield will open its torso
citizens later this summer that's it for
today's top stories but coming up
tomorrow the solutions are we my
hypothesis down at the bottom we are
very large espresso oh very complicated</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
