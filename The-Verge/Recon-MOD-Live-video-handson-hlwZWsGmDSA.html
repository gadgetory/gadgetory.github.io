now I am standing 698 feet high and I
could tell you my longitude and latitude
but I won't bore you with that right now
I know that because I'm wearing the mod
live it's a new thing from a company
called recon and what it does is it puts
a tiny little telemetry display in the
bottom right corner of your ski goggles
it's for extreme skiers and snowboarders
who want to know all this data and in
addition to telling you how high you are
it can tell you how high you jumped and
how far you went and it can record all
this data about your runs for the day
temperature outside all kinds of
different stuff and then at the end of
the day you can either you know see how
awesome your jumps were or upload all
your data to a site called recon HQ at
which point you can share it on Facebook
or just keep kind of a history of your
run or the season in here it's this tiny
little thing inside and it actually runs
a really simple version of Android and
that means it can run apps there's an
SDK coming soon but it's not out yet
there are some apps like there's one
called buddy tracker which lets you pick
a friend on the mountain or something
and you can always see where they are or
you can pair it to your Android phone
and see text messages as they come in
they actually scroll across this little
display or you can see that you have a
phone call you can't answer the phone
but that would be awesome
it has all kinds of information and it
can go into any pair of supporting
goggles they're they're called recon
ready and they just snap into this
little micro USB thing here which is
also how they charge and it lasts about
a day a full day of skiing or
snowboarding or whatever and then you
can offload it and there's only a few
brands out right now but they say by
this winner or next winner they'll have
every brand you can think of ready to
put these in it's $2.99 for a simple
version of it and 399 for the Android
running version and that is the mod Live</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
