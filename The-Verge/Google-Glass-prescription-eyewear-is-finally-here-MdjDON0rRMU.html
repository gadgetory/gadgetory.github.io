masses yet the augmented reality headset
has technical problems that still need
to be overcome the software is still in
active development battery life isn't
that great and we're not even sure what
we want to do with a tiny screen on our
face anyway but before we figure all
that out Google needs to make sure the
glass can work for everybody the Google
glass Explorer program has been slowly
expanding over the past year but I've
never used them that's because I have
prescription glasses but now Google is
releasing four different frames that
work with prescription lenses so I can
finally see what life is like through
glass well there have been rumors that
Google would partner with Warby Parker
or other established glasses makers
today the company is announcing that
it's going out on its own with four new
frames instead of completely redesigning
glass Google kept the electronic parts
the same you just attach that part with
a tiny screw to the new glasses Google
calls these four frames and titanium
collection and sure enough each is made
of the metal the designs are simple and
fairly elegant you might say restrained
and the design goal was to try to pare
down the broad categories of glass of
shapes into their most iconic forms
Google calls a bold curved thin and
split we started looking at what are
people's favorite styles and what are
things on the market and when you look
at it there are only about eight kinds
of styles that people actually do wear
so we looked at those and took
inspiration from those but then made
them more iconic and simplify them into
kind of this silhouette there's also a
few new sunglasses that we clipped onto
the original glass headband
now Google isn't filling your
prescriptions you'll need to pony up the
225 dollars to buy the frames on top of
the 1500 bucks you're already spending
on the base unit then you're going to
need to get your lenses cut afterwards
Google has a list of eye care
professionals it recommends but it's not
the massive expansion of the glass
Explorer program that many even waiting
for and though the four frames are
pretty good they're certainly not going
to appeal to every person's tastes the
glasses are surprisingly comfortable and
just slightly less weird-looking than
glass on its own they're thin and light
I guess you could say inoffensive which
for a set of hardware designed to put a
screen and camera above your right eye
ball is kind of exactly what you'd want
now we're definitely focusing on slow
expanding the Explorer program and of
course with these this release of this
new collection it opens it up to a lot
more people the frames are simple and
elegant with clean lines and they're
pretty light too I don't know if it's
going to make people want to try Google
glass but at least now they'll be able
to see for themselves</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
