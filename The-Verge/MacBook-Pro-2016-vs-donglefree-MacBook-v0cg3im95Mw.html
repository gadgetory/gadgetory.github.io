of new gadgets with me including the new
MacBook Pro and the new iPhone 7
everything is just nicer and faster and
better progress no it's not yes it is I
mean the MacBook Pro is thinner and
lighter and it has this nice bright
display it has a force touch trackpad
and the iPhone 7 has an even better
camera I mean this is a legitimate
advancement in consumer technology no
it's not
says the person carrying around a 2011
laptop and an old iPhone I mean
seriously
a thing weighs five and a half pounds
and it's slow as hell there's one thing
I have with all of this stuff that you
don't have a life free of dongles see
you may have acquired a much thinner
more powerful laptop and a fancy new
iPhone but you've lost basic stuff like
a headphone jack on your iPhone or
regular USB ports which means everywhere
you go dongles you are stuck in the
dongle life I am NOT stuck in the dongle
life okay and anyway they're called
adaptors yeah sure they're no really
they're called adapters also there are
easy solutions for all of this like
lightning headphones that come right in
the box with iPhone 7 yeah where is that
box right now I think I think it's home
mm-hmm right anyway everything is going
the way of lightning and us PC I mean we
don't even need regular ports anymore
okay sure tell you what let's try
something exhibit a your phone is dying
but you've got that laptop there so
charge your phone go ahead sergeant I'll
do it with you this is easy I can either
use
this one or this one go with this one
yeah so you you still need a dongle yeah
this is not that big of a deal
Exhibit B I like music
do you like music let's listen to music
on our phones while we charge our phones
okay easy I'll just use this double
dongle and I might have to use one other
one
that looks convenient Exhibit C hey when
was the last time you took a vacation
last summer why did you bring a camera
with you
I did actually even though the iPhone
takes tremendous photos I love the
quality of photos as thing captures hmm
yeah uh I would love to see them can you
send me a couple sure I'd be happy to I
mean I have a bunch on my external hard
drive although I didn't bring a
Thunderbolt adapter this is exactly what
I'm talking about it's not it's not a
big deal I also have a an SD card
adapter so I'll just use this
have you ever been to Hawaii I totally
recommend it it's fantastic there's
ocean fish in it yeah they're just
another adapter Exhibit D
hey how are you good listen can I call
you leader I'm kind of dealing with a
hot mess over here right now okay thanks
bye ah doing okay over there
yeah yeah I'm just gonna call them back
question for you how much did all of
these costs oh not much
yeah but like how much I don't know 30
or $40 apiece and Apple just cut the
prices on a bunch of them okay I don't
know what kind of rich person apple
juice you've been drinking but that
added cost kinda ridiculous look time is
money
okay and the time it takes for you to
boot up that 2011 laptop you've got
there and get stuff running on it I'm
already done with all the stuff that I
need to do on this machine here's the
thing about new technology I mean sure
it's uncomfortable at first but I don't
know if no one pushes technology forward
then no one pushes it forward and yes
maybe there will be times when you don't
have the exact adapter that you need
right in your pocket you know with your
iPhone 7 but if you work at the same
office every day and you're carrying or
new MacBook to the same place every day
you likely have all the adapters right
there that you need ok but on the flip
side you don't need to upgrade to all
the latest and greatest technology and I
mean this just proves it companies like
Apple and other companies are just
trying to convince you that you need all
the latest stuff that you need to spend
your money on it while they're quietly
dismissing popular standards and in the
meantime creating a user hostile
experience but you're holding back
progress if nobody ever upgrade then
nobody ever upgrades yeah ok sure I hear
what you're saying but for now I'm just
gonna stick with this plus can you do
this
okay that's ridiculous that's a bright
new display it has a force force force
your choice yes it is so exciting it's
like boom infinity hmm okay let's just
do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
