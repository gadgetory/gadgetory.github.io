this is episode 59 for the week of
August twentieth or today actually is
August twentieth if you're watching this
live 2013 and you re starting late sorry
we had some technical difficulties so I
apologize from the bottom of my heart to
anybody those that's trying to watch us
live but we are here and we're ready to
do a show i'm dan seifert i'm chris
sigler and i have with me this is the
guy who normally produces this show his
name's evan rodgers someone from the
internet he's the internet's evan
rodgers but today you can blame him for
everything that has gone wrong with this
show so far yes literally everything if
you have any complaints track them devin
rogers he's having rogers on twitter i
just tweeted about him feel free to just
load up just give him he'll please i'm
looking forward to it it should be good
but no the reason why evan is here is a
because he's awesome be because he
classes up the joint uh see deters on an
aircraft uh d vlad savov AKA Vlad wick
is at Gamescom in Germany and II why not
yeah man why not absolutely so do we
have to talk about um we got a lot of
things to talk about don't we we've got
why don't we jump right into it so the
Moto X is still kind of in the news even
though we've already talked a lot about
it and we reviewed in everything but you
can actually buy it on this friday the
twenty-third you can order it through
Moto's motomaker website which we took a
look at this week and you can customize
the heck out of it and you can get it on
AT&amp;amp;T ah this is only 18 t this this ride
is that right I believe so yeah um
because i think verizon is delayed a
week or so if i'm not mistaken and who
knows what the on carriers really so so
i have a very special then even you
don't know about this it's so it's so
clandestine Oh mandan I don't know how
you pronounce that word uh just like
gaffey uh
so I have a live demonstration that I'd
like to do for our very special viewers
right now this is the Moto X that I
ordered uh it's kind of a tennis ball
yellow on the back with blue accents and
thence white on the front and in the
course of about 24 hours just 24 hours
the back I don't know if you can see
this at all but it's super grungy and
gross just from being in my pocket and
rubbing up against a plane boarding pass
and I think that some of the ink rubbed
off mmm tink gal that ink yeah dirty
Pakistan so it's just these are brand
new pants used and it's not ink from the
pants because it's not blue so the only
other explanation is that is the
boarding pass now Chris did you have a
dirty boarding pass I may have on your
Moto X is it like it's like a kind of
like a matte soft touch finish right yes
yeah I mean this is we have we seen that
before right I think I me was it the 1x
uh with its white soft touch kind of
matte finish if you put that in a pocket
like your pocket of your blue jeans
chances are the thing was coming out
kind of blue right yeah absolutely and
and so the demonstration I want to do
for our viewers is that I've heard the
word on the street in fact we may have
mentioned this on this very podcast
before word on the street is that you
can fix grungy matte plastic backs with
mr. clean magic erasers uh and so I
literally just moments ago had one of
our are very very talented interns run
down to a drugstore to buy a magic
eraser and he brought in a bowl of water
and so we are going to dip this is
happening right now if you guys aren't
watching this live I'm sorry but you're
about to see some some crazy
demonstation demonstrate right now Chris
is I'm dipping I'm dipping their magic
eraser in the bowl of water which is
slightly off camera I apologize and we
are going to try to rub this phone clean
uh you uh whoa yeah there's a lot of
water in here how do you uh do you have
to squeeze it out first hey you got to
get a ring at all yeah the magic erasers
almost kind of like a sponge hold on
hold on this is about to get real okay
and then hold it out in front of the
yeah for the viewers a little bit more
uh so I'm rubbing I'm rubbing wow this
is this is actually working hold on I
think this is working dude is it rub it
is it taking any of the paint off any
other like is it is it taking the
carrier logo off yeah what meal and I
were joking about this that this morning
unfortunately the AT&amp;amp;T logo is engraved
into the phone so that's not gonna
happen this is like seriously working
really yeah and I apologize this is not
a paid advertisement for whatever
Procter &amp;amp; Gamble who makes this magic
eraser I just heard on the street that
literally on the street is walking the
hard streets of Chicago and I overheard
some people say that the magic erasers
really good at this hang on dudes dudes
Evan tell me that's not clean it's it's
totally clean I mean it looks brand new
right on a few looks brand new in like
the wet soggy gone away but yeah now
that that is some serious yellow that
you've got there on your particular unit
Chris yeah a soccer ball it looks like a
soccer ball yeah I'd like to think of it
as a tennis ball but yeah I like the
tennis ball analogy no Chris so
obviously in order to get your custom
Moto X you had to go through the Moto
maker website and do the ordering uh
tell us about that how was that process
the process was fine it was super easy
the one thing I thought about this quite
a bit like um you know they make you
choose the front in the back differently
obviously because I have what on the
front and yellow in the back um I just
activated the silly camera gesture that
i would i would really like if they made
the front available and all the same
colors that they make the backs but they
only have white and black on the front
and i suspect the reason for that is
that there is that the front is a much
more complicated piece than the back the
back is just
solid piece of plastic the front you
have like you know the the screen you
have these these things up top for the
you know the sensors and the camera the
earpiece etc so i think that they wanted
to you know in the name of efficiency
they just said okay we'll screw it we're
just gonna do white black and everyone
has to pick one of those two so if I if
I'd been able to get this phone in the
same color in the front that I that I
did in the back I think it'd be
considerably hotter but it still looks
good looks good Josh was giving me a
hard time earlier because he doesn't
like white anymore you decided inside
that white is that pass a showing the
white the plastic on the Moto X the
white plastic on the Moto X just doesn't
leave it just doesn't have a very high
ball you go I think you texture I think
you don't have a high quality feel Evan
oh really oh this is this is a good no
the mat the mat back is great but it's
that the the surrounding rim out of the
white plastic I think doesn't look very
good I have some touch-up work to do but
I gosh I you know take your time now
Chris while you while you clean up your
your Moto X again uh you've been kind of
raving about it since you got it huh
well so when I when I first pulled it
out of the the package and I started
using it I loved the size the feel uh I
mean it really is like the perfect for
my size hand and I think for many hands
across the world it is the perfect size
and that's even though it is the same
size screen is that as the HTC One it
feels a lot smaller and I think that's
because it just has a ridiculously small
bezel which it also doesn't have those
speakers right below it right yeah
that's right um so it just comes across
as like the perfect feel and I love
matte plastic that always feels great
feels great on nokia's so so the the
Moto X is a 4.7 inch device yeah but it
is pretty much straight up the size of a
4.3 inch device can you will you been
that whoa alright so what I have right
here is the HTC first one of those we
just have hanging around and it's like
it's just not that much bigger like to
the point where it's
yeah I get that a little closer to the
camera so so if you guys can see here uh
you can see that they're really the
profile of the first pretty much is the
exact same footprint as the Moto X which
is kind of impressive and you know
something we've been asking for for ever
right yeah yeah it's kind of the best of
both worlds you get a big screen in a
small body so it looks great it feels
great the design ability I still think
that you know build order phones are
kind of like the next big thing in
mobile and I think we're going to be
seeing more companies do that just
because this is going to pique their
interest and more people are going to
say way I want my choice of like 14
different bags so I think this is just
the beginning so Dells gonna make a
definite come back then right did you
say del yeah Evan Evan I I listen dudes
dell is gonna go private michael dell's
finally going to get his way he's got a
defeat carl icahn somehow he's gonna go
private and then boom there's going to
be customizable dell smartphones just
any be any color specifically
customizable venue pros yes nothing else
just venue for after the apocalypse
there will only be two phones there will
be the hd2 and the venue from the two is
essentially the cockroach oh it really
is so I want to share one other anecdote
about this phone that I think is
important for people to realize they
shift it with the skip which is that NFC
it's like a it's like a clip it's like a
leather it's probably not real leather
but it feels like a leather clip that
hinges in the middle and has a magnet on
either sides that it like it closes shut
you can put around like a belt loop or
some it's almost like a money clip then
yeah a little bit except smaller and it
has an NFC tag and the idea is that when
you touch the phone to it and it unlocks
it so you don't have to go through your
pen or your pattern or whatever you have
set up the breath the problem is that i
was on the plane this morning we just
arrived at LaGuardia and and I touched
it like it's on the belt loop closest to
my crotch and so I touched it against my
crotch and it didn't unlock and then so
I did it again I did like five or six
times and i realize that i'm sitting
there beating my crotch with my with my
Moto X on the plane which just looks
really weird and and really raises the
question do you want to put an object on
your body that you need to tap in order
to unlock your phone I'm not sure you do
i'm not sure that i'll be using this
game but you put it I just thank you you
chose the wrong spot because when you
get up from the table and it but even if
you're putting it like say you're
putting on the side of your body like no
Chris don't tell me you when you when
you back pocket because you check your
cuties in wallet like you tap it you
just give it a tap on the butt when you
tap it how long does it recognize or
save that authentication is it like
every single time you pull out of your
pocket you got a tapper or is it yeah
it's it's one shot so so literally every
time you turn the screen off you have to
tap it again or you got to put your
passcode it well they're most phones
have the ability to set like a time oh
yeah well yeah sure and I yeah I've
mindset so that every time I turn the
screen off it it sets the path locks I'm
insane and paranoid no but yeah if you
set it to not you said it to only relock
after like 10 minutes or something then
it'll honor that yeah of course but I
mean that that just seems so I don't
know like like I'm thinking like right
now I have my pebble set up as an
authenticator for my phone through a
particular app on my phone and and so
that means that as long as my pebble is
connected to my phone there's no pass
code like I don't have to put in a
passcode unlock my fault with this case
as soon as my pebble I know disconnects
the phone locks puts a passcode on it so
if I leave it and I walk away from my
phone and advertently as soon as the
Bluetooth range is out it disconnect in
locks it up or someone steals my phone
it locks it up and I don't worry about
it but when I'm carrying the phone and
using the phone all day long I don't
have to put in my passcode all day which
rise me nuts which seems like a way more
practical implementation of this
technology and as far as I understood I
thought the Moto X had the ability to
use like trusted Bluetooth at things is
that true yes yeah every time you paired
a device a thing pops up in the
in the notification bar that says i cant
rember what it says but something the
effective do you want this to be a
trusted Bluetooth device and then you
know that makes it so that once that
device pairs the phone is unlocked so
you know that works great for a
bluetooth headset or you know a pebble
or whatnot yeah that just seems like a
way better implementation of these types
of like avoiding your passcode
technology right I'm also concerned that
that not even concerned but resigned to
the fact that the Skip will go through
my clothes washer and then I don't know
maybe it's it's like resistant to that
if they didn't design it to be resistant
to getting thrown in the washer then
it's even more insane because you know
you put in your belt loop you forget
it's there and then it's going to go
through well I mean NFC's a passive
technology like there's no power you
have to worry about right but I'd be
worried about like the the leather or
leather like substance that it's covered
in that's real particularly durable so i
don't know if it's designed to be able
to do that or not so Chris did you get
did you get your custom engraving on the
motor works no so this is interesting uh
Josh got one that was engraved and he
has not yet received his mom so I think
that and and as you go through moto
maker it does warn you that engraving
it's just like it you know an apple
device where like if you try to engrave
it warns you that there's gonna be delay
in shipping moto maker is the same way
so I think you know and that time varies
you know I got mine yesterday without
engraving he has not received his yet
don't know if he'll get it today yet or
forget tomorrow or what but um yeah that
will delay your ship date for sure yeah
and well now motorola is not even gonna
be offering it know what they got rid of
engraving completely well at least for
launch so yesterday motorola you know
reached out to a lot of press and told
them that they are not going to be
offering the engraving at launch because
of quality control issues that they're
seeing during this beta test when it's
yet when they've been giving out review
units and things like that apparently
the quality of the engraving is
up to Motorola standards so they've
essentially said that it's not going to
be available at launch it's going to be
hopefully available soon but they don't
really know when so that means if this
friday if you were hoping to order once
a moto maker and get your name inscribed
on it um sorry you're out what my take
is that if you get a device in you know
in grave then you've immediately made it
unruhe sellable which for me yes you
very something really cool on it like
yeah but you can't engrave anything
really cool because Motorola's gonna
censor yeah yeah exactly um one other
thing I noticed well actually I didn't
notice this josh did and I wish that I
had noticed it at his device so he has
the original he has one of the original
all black moto x review units that were
sent out before moto maker was live um
and the the volume and power buttons on
his device are considerably nicer than
mine his really yeah his standout
further from the body of the phone and
are more touchable they have more
tactile response mine are basically
flush with the body which is not doesn't
seem right so and what what color did
you get I got I came from the name of
the color but it's like a fluorescent
yellow basically no sew the buttons are
fluorescent yellow as well oh no that
the the buttons are blue okay kind of
you can see there or not so yeah that I
I don't know if that's a quality control
issue or if they've changed it so that
they're all more flush with the body now
or what the story is but that's
something we need to keep an eye on like
as they're pumping out these custom-made
phones is there a lot of variance in
these buttons and in the phone the
manufacturing the phone in general from
device to device if there is that's
that's an issue that's an interesting
point because you know years ago that
was kind of a concern that you'd have uh
for a lot of smart phones you know
certain depending on which you know run
of the production line you got sometimes
your power button was more reliable than
others sometimes your volume buttons
were we're better working and in recent
years you know a lot of that has been
kind of sorted out by most of the
manufacturer
at least at least most of the top tier
manufacturers you could say definitely
Apple is very consistent with its
manufacturing HTC has really improved a
lot of its manufacturing and Samsung's
really consistent as well so you don't
see that too much often but like he just
said if they're you know doing different
setups for every single phone that they
produce as far as the color options and
there that throws in another curveball
or variable into the Equality control
that they've got to manage that's that's
exactly right a number of possible sk
uses so it's just so although i just
want to say that those are my absolute
favorite as XDA threads ever they're
like hey hey did you get the sony panel
oh you got the LG panel oh man oh where
they like go through really oh dude like
the code yeah at all number dude yes
that's got like five percent less
contrast it's so bad it just just like
sell the phone like you don't even
having a phone that is this crappy yeah
like so so this actually uh is a nice
segue into our next point where you know
Motorola's doing this phone
customization thing now actually found
out this week that apparently HTC had
something very similar in the works for
its windows phone 8x or the 8xt or
whatever is calling the sprint version
it was originally going to do the same
kind of thing where customers could go
online customize the colors of the phone
that they want and then have it shipped
directly to them but apparently it
wasn't logistical II feasible for HTC or
at least HTC felt like it wasn't and
they scrap the plans for that so it's
interesting to see you know why Motorola
is able to follow through and push
through on this and and HTC decided
against it yeah I mean you can
definitely understand what kinds of
legit like gavins point you can see what
kinds of logistical challenges what
would exist when you're allowing people
to physically choose which components go
into their phone and what we'll have to
see a whether the Moto X is able to do
with a with sufficient quality control
and be whether this is something they
continue they go back to just doing you
know a stock run of devices um one thing
that I'm just I'm kind of thinking out
loud here but what happens if you have a
warranty as
you on a custom Moto X that means that
you're you know you're not getting next
day turnaround or two-day turnaround
that phone your ball man well it is
assembled in the US right yeah so they
may actually they may actually repair it
and disassemble it oh this type of thing
makes me think of like the nightmare
scenario where motorola finally says you
can order wooden panels and like i'm
able to place an order for a teak phone
and then there's a huge demand run on
the cheekbones and they're backordered
like four weeks and then i get a
defective teak phone and i need to
replace it here are the problem here's
the problem with your dream so excited
for the wood panel no I wanted you I
want to so bad here's here's the problem
with your dream of a wooden phone okay
you're gonna get that phone you're gonna
be in a bar and and someone is going to
be you know playing with matches or you
know like with matches and head you're
playing with a Zippo or who knows what
yeah the punk rock kids are gonna
they're gonna get the little too close
seats and and next thing you know your
phones on fire because i'm more worried
of like I mean we're more worried about
getting like a beer on it and then
heaven expand and then kind of yeah the
wood would warp after getting wet or
something like that in the teak is
supposed to be really resilient to that
right I'll tell you what it's resilient
to looking terrible like a tennis ball
I'm sorry oh ever just bird you yeah
that was a pretty sick burn uh but I
stand by the fluorescent yellow Moto X I
i'm happy i was a little you know it's
like it's a really um was where I'm
looking for it's like fresh no it's like
it's a really heavy moment your life
when you like oh you're like I'm gonna
have this device for anywhere from six
months to two years and I need to make
the right just hovering over the over
the x button right just button the sub
submitting your jokes mr. sweating exact
how how like so when you ordered it on
moto maker and you saw they were like
this is what your phones would look like
with the colors that you chose and then
you got the actual device how accurate
was that was it an accurate
representation online to what you
actually got in person yeah I would say
it was actually very very accurate
and I can't say that you know that may
not be true for every color but in my
case I would say that it was
surprisingly accurate I'm super happy
with it so as anybody actually touched
and felt like a retail black and white
model like to your point about the
buttons I wonder if those with those
large production runs for the black and
white ones at our quality well I mean
the Josh's review unit is all black so
like the but is that the same black that
t-mobile is gonna get because they're
only gonna get black and white in the
store yeah i don't know like yeah so
that that's a good point on moto maker
if you get a black or white back you can
choose from two materials you can choose
from a like a honey nut honeycomb but
it's like a textured back it's like
almost carbon fiber esque yeah and it
has some but it has some like bumps to
it doesn't know it has no bumps it's
really smooth really yeah David is david
has that one the textured appearing one
okay and then the other choice is just
the smooth matte which is like what the
yellow is um so if I were to get black
or what I'm not sure to answer your
question I don't know okay what carriers
are gonna get what and if I were to
choose black or white from moto maker
first of all I'd be questioning
everything about my life because I you
know like if are you really gonna go
through the process of like you know
customizing a phone and just giving up
and say I'm screwed i'm getting white or
black I mean come on really but I I
don't know what material i get all right
so we've talked a lot about the Moto X
does anybody else have anything else to
say about the Moto X before we move on I
have one more thing to say about the
motorbikes of course you do uh so in
fact I think I tried to smooth the
conversation in this direction and I may
have derailed myself but so so I pulled
it out of the package yesterday loved it
loved the feel of the shape i love the
like the active notifications and all
that garbage and the ok Google now but
after about an hour it got to the point
where like people calling me we're just
going straight to voicemail and I could
call people but after like between one
and five
it's the calls would degrade in quality
to the point where like I could hear
them but they couldn't hear me at all
which renders it useless and I wasn't
getting some text messages Neil I sent
me a text message last night apparently
and I didn't get it uh so this is
ongoing and I don't know first of all I
use I use an 18 teen Microsoft which
puts me in a very very small minority of
ATT customers and I doubt that they
properly verify every phone they sell
with the microcell so that's one concern
it might be a problem to Mike yourself
to might be a defective moto x 3 it
might just be a problem with moto x's in
general for whatever reason I pulled the
SIM out and cleaned it and put it back
in I don't know like maybe I think that
was just to make myself feel better I
don't really know but we'll see so I'm
gonna be using the phone over the course
of this week if I don't get any of my
phone calls I'll know that the phone is
messed up right right yeah that's kind
of kind of an important thing yeah okay
so speaking of AT&amp;amp;T yesterday 18t
announced a phone called the mini and a
phone called the mega also arriving this
friday so ATT is getting a whole
buttload of things in addition to the
Moto X it's getting the one mini which
actually I'm kind of excited for on
friday for 99 bucks and then it's also
getting the galaxy mega 6.3 which I have
zero excitement for for 150 bucks
because it's not big enough right you
want a bigger phone yeah I mean if it's
under 7 inches I don't even want to want
to entertain the notion i am actually
excited for the sony ultra bonanza well
that yeah but that was just ran free
like yeah like the galaxy mega is like
intentionally a mid-range device yeah
whereas the Sony is not mid-range so
that's that's tangential though I do I
want to come back to the mini I could
not be more excited about the mini
really yes I'd there's no there's no
phone I desire so highly as the mini now
why is that uh because i have i have a
one okay that's here it's you know it is
what it is it's great um but i also have
this H this first this HTC first and I
just I just
on this to be this size and
interestingly enough the one mini is
almost exactly the same as the HTC first
the discontinued redheaded stepchild but
now let me ask you this Evan yes if all
you want is a one that's the size of the
first once you rather keep the 4.7 inch
display the one absolutely not
absolutely not I would rather take the
720p 4.3 inch display because it's LCD
and I like that do take any color test
like a nice monitor and your phone and
try to hold back the vomit you kill me
bro I'm gonna start calling me Neil is
what I'm gonna so bad look it's like
plasma underneath the screen i just want
regular okay just to be clear let's
let's set the stage for listeners Evan
was relaying a story to me about how he
listens to like these insane like 48-bit
songs or so I don't know like you listen
to music it's like nothing that's wrong
with chiptune no no no no you're a
chiptune I'm talking about like like it
better than lossless like it's so
lossless that like it it's it's more
full than the original like oh I don't
know they retire I don't open physics
yeah and I am listening to the thoughts
and imaginations that's exactly is it
that is how you presented it to me so I
just want to set the stage for listeners
that evan is uh he isn't just an audio
file or video file or anything he is
just a file and that that that that goes
for everything evan is involved with
including displays for me personally if
I can see text and browse and look at
emails I'm a happy camper in fact why
don't we just using ink for all of our
phones well first of all an eating phone
would be amazing if the refresh rate was
anything better than Jurassic but what
was the moto f6 was it's the survivor
phone here nothing is great but the mini
like i aven't you mobile customer and
it's coming out on ATT and who knows how
long that exclusive is yeah i'd be
shocked to tmobile ever gets it i'm
gonna let's just say i'm gonna buy it so
hard and you know the the first actually
there's a way to sim unlock at HTC if
you're listening don't ruin this for me
okay I need this made it bad and I by
the way I can assure you HTC is
listening sweetie listen listen listen
no joke don't take this away from me
don't tell anyone my HTC but there's a
way to get a free sim unlock on the HTC
first you just copy memory block 0 page
six I think to a file you just dump that
you just root it made of it and then you
get another utility and then you get it
in a hex editor Hey look for that eight
digit code in plain tex HTC don't you do
this I know it's too close dear to the
launch date for you to change it don't
have a launch day update for this I need
it just that one day that's all I mean
I'll be I mean you're not supposed to
you're not supposed to explain how you
do this when you're telling someone not
to stop it you just you just ruined a
wonderful hack for the 0 for the
community God look nor yes look that the
mini I don't want to take anything away
from the one or the one mini I just like
I'm so mesmerised by the size and and
shape and like it has i'm in love i'm
about to cry okay like the the material
of the moto x that the matte plastic is
something that absolutely adored on
every lumia that I've ever touched and
the size is perfect I just this matte
plastic you just the only that my
plastic this mad plastic is for Buster's
and I'll tell you why what uh because
facebook yeah because Facebook and I was
a nice kid you just get rid of that
Facebook and it's all gravy uh yeah I
could use this phone actually this is
not actually but you know what's the bet
actually I need to ask you about this
how is the sound quality from the Moto X
the speaker phone no the headphone
quality I have not tested the headphones
yep and see heat crazy life hehe chris
hasn't been able to test the Moto X's
sound quality because he can't get any
phone calls this is true I won't know
part of the thing that makes that like I
had an Xperia z4 a little bit and the
sound quality was really good but
through headphones were just talking
about through it audio through
headphones sound quality was very like
flat and
sounded really nice but it was not even
close to loud enough so I can loud
Subway's with trains even unlike the
other side of the station almost
completely lose the ability to hear
anything but both the first and the one
just have just monumental amplifiers oh
yeah no the one that I think he's
specifically dancar me if I'm wrong and
they like specifically advertise the
headphone amp on the the one like there
yeah the ones got the ones got its own
special speaker amp and headphone amp as
far as I understand well the mini is
just as good in terms of like hardware I
mean in terms of yeah just just audio
processing hardware it's loud and it's
really clear and and the design is great
look I mean the design of the phones is
so i just i mean like I've I have been
playing with this first because I am
like on tenterhooks for the warm mini
you're on what for the diet and sitting
on pinterest and i did you know what
he's talking about dance no no this is
this is when we explain to our viewers
evan is from kentucky and so he might be
referring to something there's nobody on
the coast knows what that means i have
no idea with it why why the ultrapixel
camera though on the mini why didn't
they just glossing that ovaries like
yeah i move on yeah i'm not gonna talk
about my i attend roads yeah all right
but why didn't they just kind of back
down from the ultra pixel sensor and
just put in a garden variety anything 8
megapixel sony exmor you know the Moto X
has a terrible camera and they're just
owning it they're like we're not known
for cameras yeah we're just owning our
mediocrity in the camera Department but
but I mean I guess they already had it
already purchased to you know had a deal
or something yeah I still you know for
like if I just want like a consistently
awesome picture with no hassles and like
software that works but there's still
nothing that beats iphone I hate you
there's nothing but it is absolutely
true yeah it's it's such a shame I mean
I have an anecdote about this I my wife
is an iphone user she's had an iphone 4s
for a couple years and she was having
some issues with it so I said I'll you
know try out the nexus 4 since I've got
it lying
around and so I put her on that for a
week and you know everything is gravy
until she goes to take a picture and
then like the whole world falls apart
yet you know that that ended that
experience experiment pretty quickly no
she's backing around another weird thing
about the nexus for that I've never
understood is that you know LG has made
some amazing displays including a bunch
of iphone displays and yet the display
on the Nexus 4 is a steaming what tell
you what it's better than I totally
disagree i think the display is great on
the Nexus 4 I don't know what you're
needing the Nexus ok just take one look
at the Xperia Z or Z are and you'll be
like holy shit Yeah right I don't i dint
that yours I don't doubt it um know that
Dan seriously the Nexus porn is like the
worst contrast ratio that's not even
that's not even true the contrast ratio
are insane on the nexus 4 insanely bad
ok you disagree in that in that the
blacks are not black enough or they are
over the blacks are overtly white the
black the black so that's all just
profiling you like the screen itself is
capable of showing more blacks than it
is it's just the software is profiling
it to be a flatter curve you're just
trying to throw like technical terms at
me did it to like convince me that the
nexus 4 dough doesn't have a terrible
screen bigger haces no I really disagree
with you like crit like like Evan was
saying the Sony's have these like major
like viewing angle problems and you get
all max back that's actually grey just
pick up any Sony yeah i mean the nexus 4
has you know one of the better displays
of the market not as good as HTC's
definitely up there with samsung's as
far as you know the samsung's AMOLED
screens but you know you definitely like
way better than the Galaxy Nexus what if
I got myself into like this is the
conspired to like throw me with this
nexus no one it always made you like
amoled screens and I orange I god you're
just yeah Chris that's a problem you're
just used to these AMOLED screens that
are like way over contrast E and like
way out of reality okay here's what's
gonna happen i'm gonna
text dieter right now and ask him if the
Nexus forest screens he's gonna ask him
if you can join you on the acid trip
that is amyloid testing a real because
that's what it looks like to me it's
like a swimming glowing terribly
oversaturated display quick question
colon does oh no way wait in your
opinion does no not doors does the Nexus
so what we're learning here is that
despite years of using mobile devices
Chris still takes forever to send a text
message true no look I'm saving time by
typing su ex instead of su there you go
yes now could you could you have typed
that faster on a blackberry no no uh you
have to download oh wait wait wait no
because I don't want plural sucks i just
want suck what hold on okay all right
wait it won't everyone listening at home
I I am distributing okay okay so that
text message is out to dieter well I
will keep you up guys updated live if
and when he gets back to me my opinion
live deets yes ly ly beats uh what's
next well what do we need to talk about
next all right let's move on so we got a
little more details about the alleged
upcoming iPhone um that were expecting
to be announced September 10th now now
the wall street journal is saying that
Apple has asked its suppliers to step up
production and get ready to ship to new
iPhones in the early September which
kind of lines up with what we'd expect
if it was announced on the tenth chances
are it'll probably be available to
consumers within two weeks after that
right uh I guess I mean apples gonna do
what Apple wants to do I don't put a lot
of stock in anything until the phone is
actually on the shelves we'll see and
then I also just want to point out that
I want to point out the insanity like
all signs are at this point all signs
are pointing to this this fricking gold
iPhone being real yes and it's insane
damn sheffer wants it so bad well Sam
sheffer is he's hypebeast
he's a Heidi's you always concerned
about his uh penis wangle a quarter a
dude his swag could be so much higher
and the old iphone look doesn't matter
you know a week at why breaking news
from dieter it's tuned to dimly since
it's a nexus it's too wide the screen
itself Matt and I quote met em eh it's
not the worst I give it a six a six the
end so he kind of falls in between you
and I like I think it's pretty good you
think it's socks deters like yeah oh
wait he clarifies he says that the bone
six not a verge six I don't know what
that means that's that's out of a scale
of at 8.25 it's very specific which
makes him agree more with me than with
you so I'll take that so that I guess it
quick I guess my question is is there's
there's the rumor of the more affordable
plastic iPhone which we may or may not
have seen backs for if it's if it's the
backs that have been leaked yeah we've
seen this I mean assuming those leaks or
legit we see the back of this iphone 5c
or whatever it is the cheap phone buzz
ilion times like that is hot just want
to put that out there but and my next
question is do you think that we'll have
like the 5s or the next iteration of the
flagship iPhone is going to have the
same body style the same like angular
body style or will they adopt the the
curves like ipod touch wait breaking
news update peter says maybe a seven
it's fine really just he says it's the
Chevy Malibu of screams update good I
know yeah i love how dieter is like
sitting there wherever he is I think
he's traveling so wherever he probably
just got off an airplane and he's like
sitting there waffling on his score of
an exit but to clarify the bone score
not the verge score right of course uh
so anyway back to the so I think what's
gonna happen is the rumor correct me if
i'm wrong i think the rumor has been
that the 5c will replace like the 5 and
4s
just gonna clear out the low model or
the like that you know their their
classic model of taking last year's
model making it this year's like low low
cost model they're going to get rid of
both 5 and the 4 s so 5 is only going to
last year presumably and they're gonna
place both both those with 5c and then
the 5s or 6 or whatever they call it
will be gold and will look like it will
look like a five except gold and it's
it's really messed up okay so despite
that look the gold iPhone should be a
color where that should be like Kim
Kardashian says I need a gold iPhone and
then pays four hundred dollars they have
a gold iPhone made like there should not
be an oem gold iPhone it's you didn't
get to see them everywhere I'm sitting
back I'm just gonna sit back here lie
because you know proving or providing
that this gold i phone is true i know
chris is just gonna like run out and buy
one no I'm not I am absolutely one
hundred percent not going to do that I
may in fact I probably will buy an
iphone 5s because I bought every
previous model iphone but I will not
mark my words physically on a board mark
my words I will not be buying a gold
iPhone if I do buy a gold iPhone you
guys can uh I don't do something bad to
me I don't know what but I just I don't
believe that Chris I believe it when you
I believe it when I don't see it that's
what you get if you break down and get a
gold phone you have to give up your next
favorite device and we're gonna coat
that gold but not in like a good way I'm
not gonna have professionals do it is
coded gold in the bad way yeah will be
24 karat gold it could be well they even
that even that could be bad then all
hola after you do that I'll scrap it
okay they just collect the go to a pawn
shop here's how this here's how this is
going to go down is Apple's going to
announce it and they're not going to
call it gold they're gonna call it like
champagne and then Chris will have this
little loophole to be able to buy a
champagne iphone without ever buying a
go out just cry I'll live streaming I'll
life I cried look I I don't own a single
gold anything I think gold is it is a
detestable
all color I think big gold has value as
like currency as like you know bullion
but i don't think that gold has value as
like a design elements and that includes
the iphone you heard it here folks I yes
you did here here here it here I'll
remember that each GRE however that when
you have it look you're gonna sway hard
but the same holds true this year that
would that held true last year as your
friendly local industrial design trend
experts black is still the new white
black the murdered-out iphone 5s will
continue to be like the model to have if
you if you get the gold your Buster if
you get you get the white you're just
not up on the trends you're not exhaust
ripping so I don't know if I agree with
you Chris because you know last year
when the iphone 5 was announced and the
black murdered out one looks so hot and
everyone scooped it up and I bought one
myself and I loved it and then it got
like scratched and scuffed and beat up
and now it's like not looking so hot and
then I see people with the white one
which like still looks pristine and
looks really hot too and I kind of want
if I do by the 5s I kind of want to like
one dan I I gotta say I think it's a
grass is always greener thing because I
originally had a white iphone 5 I
thought it looked so fresh and then I
kept seeing those murdered out black
ones and I was like I gotta get that it
so I switched I had traded someone for
it but then after lots of time and
dedicated service for my black iphone I
kept seeing those white ones house like
I gotta go back soon I you're both yeah
but I don't have both I don't have both
I do have the silver one but all I'm
saying is is that it's hard to win it's
hard to win it's hard to be satisfied
speaking of uh special colors of phones
is anyone else stoked stoge is not the
right word but like the red HTC one is
going to be awesome and it only makes me
say that it's on sprint because none of
us have sprint or likely will ever have
but it's it's an awesome well yeah it's
it's super interesting to me because the
red not members bad line the
the red model that sprint is carrying is
different than the red model that was
released in the UK like the red the
woods released in the UK is like this
Ferrari red and then the red model that
sprint is carrying is like this more
muted darker red but I mean they both
look crazy yeah i would take either one
i think i would prefer the brighter red
i think i saw a picture of a blue one I
have no idea yeah I think I think
there's been some leaks of like a blue
one oh so I think Oh básicos kind of
look gross personally I do i do really
want a black one though well the silver
one you probably I'm guessing you have
some expertise on this the silver one is
probably pretty anodizing right yeah
yeah will you don't you see he's a duck
off you can take off let me just let me
just bring you bring you here on the
inner bring it you're gonna bring us
into the world of anodization yeah well
do I used to play lacrosse and that was
the I don't know what all of you all the
sticks are anodized anyway anyway so you
could take anything at all that's
anodized and submerge it in like a plate
or pan or a ceramic dish of drano and it
will d anodized the whole thing wine you
can just go through with like any kind
of like bristly brush and I kinda get
the other stuff off polish it up then
you could Rhiannon eyes it you could
take it wherever you want to go can you
just have it polish yeah and you could
definitely do that think about all the
polished aluminum stuff you could have
you think of all the polished aluminum
stuff one could own yeah if one only had
a large quantity of drano episodes 0 so
what makes me concerned or a question
the ability to anodize the one and this
is because I haven't seen any services
pop up that let you send them your one
and get a different color is the like
the plastic pieces that are embedded in
it like aren't easily removable so it's
like like you know with the with the
iphone 5 you know their services dieter
actually got it done and now he has an
orange iphone 5 that you can like send
your phone to and they will anodized the
metal parts and change your color I
haven't seen that come up for the one
which it could just be a like it's flown
under my radar and I didn't notice it
but it seems like it's a little more
difficult on one
so I think that a lot of those
specifically for the iphone coloring one
a lot of those services are actually
complete a horse horse pucky actually
because you can get you can order
colored iPhone rear battery covers like
bin wholesale from hong kong yeah but i
don't know man like if you seen deters
deters is like straight up anodized
orange and it's not just the back it's
the yeah edge it's the buttons it's
everything that's what I'm saying it's
like that actually sounds more like a
factory like they achieved as many that
Apple ordered in a month they're free to
use the machine after that because you
know app only rents the machines from
them and they just start running not
like I don't know man I think the place
is in Canada if it was actually still
your Center fun to Canada wait back up
one hot minute there's no way there's a
company that rolls up on Apple's factory
and that's hey are you guys done making
any of the day except they don't Pollard
I fake though weirdo in the factories
they don't own those factories only the
least they only least the machine but
apples not just like oh sure go ahead
and make some more iphones whatever
color you want yeah we're done for what
they leased the machines they have no
control over that would be I'm sure they
don't leave the designs that know any
any any manufacturer that we do that
with luminescent with apples so quickly
like it like Apple would drop their
contract in an instant if another like a
manufactory turn it in where do they
come from who's making these then I
think you sent it to Canada I think the
companies in Canada you could buy them
wholesale you could buy right now if you
want it if you are like one of these new
york city's street marketplaces and
you're like you know what i want to do i
want to sell colored iphones you could
buy 900 identical lime green iphone
backs and have it like drop ships to
your to your place to your jan a instant
business model just proposed by if
anyone out there is an entrepreneur
looking for a new business talk to this
guy yes like there are suppliers that
you can just you can just I mean uh
aliexpress will sell you like lots of 25
of them like someone is making these
involves what I'm saying and if I was
somebody who enjoyed large amounts of
money and high margins on myself I would
totally say that I am Scott let me
dude I will totally anodized this for
you and by anodized I mean I'll switch
it out for Hong Kong back no more you're
the sketchiest person we've ever had
virg mobile show I don't know what 47
evidence brought the mobile show to new
levels of sketchiness yeah like I never
know if what you're saying is legal or
illegal I don't know we're about to be
raving I don't know if a British
Authority is going to come in and
destroy all of our hard drives just
don't know I mean well somebody is
surveilling this we know that I don't
it's probably HTC but also the NSA well
yeah we know for a fact HTC is really
nice uh anyway so speaking of HTC
there's one more thing I want to bring
up only because uh our dear colleague
Chris Welch uh just tweeted at us about
a young the HTC One finally coming to
verizon this week and frankly at this
point Verizon customers are just kind of
like abused by the fact that like they
they've been teased with this beautiful
phone for months and months and months
now and they're just now getting it this
week but Chris it appears is excited
enough about this phone to buy it that's
the impression I actually know a lot of
my friends I was just talking to one of
my friends last night who his contract
is up on verizon and he's been waiting
and like he is super interested in the
HTC One and has been waiting for it to
come to verizon so I kind of made his
week when I told him that he could buy
it like exciting crimes are upon us for
Verizon customers this indeed this kind
of rounds out there their lineup after
they they you know they just launched
the droids today right the new droid
yeah so the the family of new droids
what is it the droid ultra droid Maxx
and yep and then they are they calling
it the mini I forget already yes I'm
like that and then they get the the one
later this week it's a good week to be a
verizon customer great week it like a
really unless week you want to buy Moto
X and you want to customize color not
sign that wait for me and then it is
yeah and then it's a terrible week to be
a bright
what what's next what do we got so Chris
you got a scoop on this galaxy gear
we've heard a lot of rumors about this
Samsung's supposedly launching a
SmartWatch very very soon gonna take on
pebble and all the other quote
SmartWatch competitors arm and I guess
you know we we got a scoop it's real
it's real and it's not so there was a
backup for a second there was am there's
a bloomberg report i believe it was last
friday that went into a variety of
rumors one of which was the galaxy gear
confirming that it was they confirmed he
was real they speculated i don't know if
they had any solid evidence but they at
least speculated that it might be
announced at Aoife just coming up in
germany in what a week we can have some
like that and but there was a very
ambiguous line in Bloomberg's report
that says something to the effect of the
galaxy gear can make phone calls and
that led a lot of people to think that
meant that it was in itself a phone
meaning you know it has a sim card it
has probably a giant banner he probably
gets really hot it's probably a piece of
garbage and something you don't want
your life and and you know there is
precedent for this because Samsung has
believe it or not a lot of Americans may
not not know this but they have samsung
has made and sold to actual human beings
risk watches that our phones in the past
going back several years I think you
know two things one the Samsung will
sell you literally anything that could
make sure this is true and and to weave
good samsung it's been a lot of weight
places i guess those was the same point
is so you're two points are actually one
point yeah the two points are actually
one point it happens sometimes uh in
fact i think that was the bet that was
like the plot of inception with no i
don't think I'm different and it's just
the same idea but layers deep so are you
are you you just got a pebble no I
didn't shit well a few weeks ago yeah I
don't know hey you don't like it no I
hate so are you excited about what Sam
is not gonna could offer you I'll take
it a look but I'll take it a look what
is it I'll take a look at it but it
unless it is
is a dedicated unless it's like a very
low power lightweight device that that
looks like a you know a jewelry caliber
wristwatch and connects our smartphone
never happen exactly it's gonna it like
it's going a lot of just involves it's
going to look I have a very strong
feeling it's gonna look ridiculous but
anyway getting back to our post post was
just confirming that it's not a phone it
is a smartphone companion first your to
your smartphone but so that makes me ask
you know with all these smart watches
and things like that so far everything
we've seen is not a phone its it's an
accessory to your phone you still have
to carry your phone around to do
anything that you want with it um does
anybody want it to be a phone like
personally I don't yes John Gruber of
daring fireball with love well do you
want it to be a phone or do you just
want to be able to communicate through
it like a phone like do you want to have
a separate number like I would not want
to be I do not want to be Dick Tracy
shouting at my wrist it was clearly want
that I will never know why well and
people definitely do but like how would
you negotiate that because you still
need to have a phone with you to make to
like type things up well so to watch
phones of the past have done one of two
things they've either I think I want to
say like LG or somebody did one where
like the band doubled as an earpiece and
microphone Wow uh maybe oh that sounds
like something LG with you yeah and then
Samsung has done them where you know you
just use a hands-free to use it as a
phone but then you still end up with two
pieces but like the notion is so John
Gruber and I had a brief Twitter
conversation about this last night
wherein he pointed out that he doesn't
have his phone with him while he is
swimming or running but he does have his
watch now I that to me that he'd like to
make phone calls while he's swimming and
which raises the question do you want to
be on the receiving end of a call from a
gentleman who is swimming I I don't if I
heard like water splashing around
someone and just like kind of gurgling
sounds I would personally hang up
I'd be like oh this person dropped their
phone into the water maybe they'll call
me back later I'm not sure maybe this
person's in a whole heck of a lot of
trouble terrifying yes now there's
nothing good that can come from that
right so and and but he also brought up
the point that you know if you if you
walk if you have a pebble you walk away
from your phone uh it basically just
becomes a wristwatch not a very nice
looking one or nice feeling one at that
and that's a valid point but I think the
solution and I've said this for a long
time is to drive smart phone or smart
watches in the direction of pieces of
jewelry you know you want you want the
the citizens and the psychos and the
Rolexes of the world making smart
watches you don't want you don't want
smart watches to become phones unto
themselves that's a huge mistake okay so
i actually have experienced something
that was it was more it was smarter
watch then most watches are
traditionally um i use it on a really
recent episode of top shelf okay i don't
wanna I don't wanna give away what it
was maybe I have to I don't know it was
a gps watch is what it was I'll save the
actual box is soon toward garmin is a
wash he's not gonna tell me as a watch
but it was aiming it felt really great
it had an aluminum housing he was yeah
yes you may did you guess what uh it was
a watch chris is just gonna bombard you
with his knowledge of washes right now
much uh but it had a really solid
construction it only had a grayscale um
LCD uh-uh but it was like it was so
thick it was like probably an actual
inch thick um and just just with without
a color screen and with only gps
activity like that battery did not last
yeah like that's not gonna ask you
that's not fill last you uh five hours
and your smartphone that's the thing
your smartphone already has all these
sensors built in yeah they spent years
optimizing the sensors for like that
amount of battery capacity ble exists
yep that's exactly that's exactly my
point like I don't want when I was
getting at was like I don't want a
device that's an actual phone of my
wrist I want a accessory to my
smartphone which I'm always gonna be
carrying around with me anyways I've
kind of resigned the notion that I'm
going to leave my smart phone at home
and
they talk to my watch like I'm gonna
have my smartphone on me all the time so
I knee I want something that's an
accessory to it I want something that's
going to give me notifications easier ah
and and whatever you can do it with the
the SmartWatch but you know to chris's
point it'd be like I on my pebble I
bought a leather wristband for it just
to make it more comfortable and it looks
a little nicer but as soon as you put on
a dress shirt or a suit or something you
look ridiculous wearing a pebble you
look like total amateur hour um so you
know it'd be great to have a real style
jewelry type of watch that i can write
that sexually intelligent so speaking of
ble here's kind of what i worry about
with these uh smartwatches i really just
worry about locking like between the
manufacturer and the actual watch
because I mean bluetooth low energy
exists and it's a common standard but i
wonder if you know samsung and motorola
and sony and Apple are going to make you
know keep all the premium functionality
or like the tight integration for their
own platforms I mean so many kind of
does that Motorola already kind of does
that um and that's a little bit of that
is driven by the fact that Bluetooth Low
Energy didn't exist when they created
those products but I don't think there's
a there's really much incentive for them
to make it compatible across across a
range of devices especially if they are
selling them as accessories in their
stores I I think that's certainly true
with Apple I think that's probably less
true with others just because there's no
yeah I don't know I just can't see
Samsung saying you can only use the
galaxy gear with the galaxy smartphone I
don't see that happen well only boat
like feature like this premium touch
with speakers you know all of those
premium TouchWiz because there are the
premium touch with features yeah uh yeah
I mean but like that's where the in it
that's where the these companies are
going to try to innovate beyond what's
just like regular notifications and
smart like layout and design like that's
obviously gonna improve and become a
standard but like they're really
interesting stuff right I think it's
gonna be locked in at least I would
expect it to maybe go that way
we will see so so I'm going to I'm going
to a hammerhead a segue into this and so
we got time for one more topic today and
that kind of the whole companies
competing against each other is kind of
the topic the story of it you know last
couple week Microsoft and Google have
been like going at each other over the
silly YouTube app for Windows Phone and
it's like it's it's a it's a it's a sad
but funny story we're uh one company
says that it is doing in one thing and
one company says it's doing one thing
and then you know Microsoft releases an
app and then it stops working the next
day because my google turned off its its
accessibility to to the api's so
unfortunately uh Windows Phone users are
kind of like stuck in this middle of
this little tit for tat between
Microsoft and Google over a decent
YouTube app for Windows Phone it sucks
it really sucks Evan said I mean the
person the people that are really losing
or just windows phone customers and I'm
a little bit surprised that Microsoft
isn't willing to do anything to take to
keep the situation nice this was this
was clearly a game of chicken between
Microsoft and Google um I think that
Microsoft but i think my guess is that
and tom wrote a great report on this
said I I think what probably happened
was Google was very clear and like what
had happen and what needed to happen and
then Microsoft was like well that's cool
but we bet you're not going to screw all
of our customers out of Google services
if we just don't do that and so they
just like ignored what Google was asking
for betting that Google wouldn't have
the cojones to just shut off youtube
completely for Windows Phone users
obviously Google called Microsoft's
bluff and now we're in this this rather
terrible situation so well it is really
is really great going it's it's it's
it's funny I mean obviously you know
both sides are to blame right so so it
seems to be that Google is making these
demands of Microsoft that it used this
html5 standard which it it kind of knows
that Windows Phone does
support really right on the other hand
the iOS and Android versions of YouTube
that are made by google itself are not
built using these html5 api's and html5
standards so it's telling Microsoft that
you can do this you can build this app
it has to conform to these standards
that our own apps don't conform to oh
but wait your platform doesn't support
it sorry well it's not know i mean i
don't know i think that google has carte
blanche to do whatever it wants with its
own apps I would more call them out for
other third-party apps that don't comply
which Google just isn't paying attention
to a bit tom was saying there's like
another Windows Phone app for YouTube
that doesn't comply and Google's is
completely ignoring it like there's
definitely an aspect of Google just
messing with Microsoft here no question
about it uh but I mean like to to point
out google's own apps and say hey your
apps aren't complying with your stand
well I mean like they're it's googles
apps they can do whatever they want sure
sure but I mean like you mentioned there
are there's other third-party apps on
windows phone there's third party apps
on iOS even that don't use these HTML 5
api's and they use they they work around
and figured out google's own private api
is to make their own apps work and it
doesn't seem that Google's going to let
that fly for Microsoft unfortunately
yeah so here we are stuck without a
decent YouTube official YouTube app for
Windows Phone if I was running my own
google hangout instance here i would
this is right insert the sad trombone
but i'm not so i can't you do we I would
do anything to not leave on a Windows
Phone Microsoft's topic oh wait that's
the wrong one because it was about the
rape
there we go there we go there is emotion
so I I know that there are other people
anxious to use the studio so this better
be quick oh yeah okay well no no now you
have me curious what ok so this nokia
phone this monster bandit the monster of
a no you don't wait you just said you
just said I don't want to end on Windows
Phone I guess that's true and then you
wet it right into a windows I yeah but
Nokia at least that's what no yes a
little happier look I a new it's a fresh
gigantic start Titanic start for Evan
that's it you have a lot to learn about
the Virgin Mobile show and why we don't
want to end on a windows phone phablet
play again sometime someday if you join
us often enough you'll realize that's
not a very strong way to end show but
for now you're you're new here Jana yeah
yeah I understand I get it look there
yeah with Tom scoop the world 6 inch
Windows Phone codename bandit great code
name by the way love the code name yeah
obably won't buy the phone well I just
don't know what I'm gonna do with a
three and a half inch wide tile very
point so you know expect to see that
probably sometime in the near future it
will be interesting according to Tom
it's going to have a 1080p display which
no other windows phone has right now and
it will also have a quad-core snapdragon
processor which again no other windows
phone has so you know it'll apparently
be UH one of the first if not the first
1080p Windows Phone device it'll have
more cores to run all the games it
doesn't have a lot more cores to run all
the YouTube maps it doesn't have oh I'm
so sorry so on that note we're gonna
