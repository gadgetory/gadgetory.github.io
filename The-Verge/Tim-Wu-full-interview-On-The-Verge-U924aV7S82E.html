neutrality here please welcome Tim whoo
hi I I have to say I realized now after
having three guests the most guests
we've ever had on the show up by the way
right that we have a lot of obstacles to
getting onto the couch well that's what
it means to be fancy that is room just
you gotta put up you got to make the
barrier to entry very high Tim thank you
for coming tim is the author of a book
called the master switch it looks like
this it's available in stores around the
world and was it by the way apparently
very hard to find we went we had some of
our people go looking for copies of this
and even want to call Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
yeah it's almost like it's almost like
they don't want it to be sold they don't
want to hear the truth of his book but
um you coined the term net neutrality
what does it mean I mean these people
people on the street don't know what it
is what yeah you know it was watching
that video and I was thinking you got a
lot of taxis in this video and it's
exactly the principle that applies when
when you get into a taxicab the taxicab
has to take you where you want to go you
know imagine get on you in the taxicab
this actually happens in some countries
and you say i want to go to know
Brooklyn and you end up in the gift
store yeah yeah you know this country
when I want to go home from Manhattan
yeah like I want to go to Brooklyn
they're like no I don't go too well
there's that problem too but essentially
is the idea that the taxi is supposed to
take you where you want to go and the
basic principle is the internet was
built on the principle that the carriers
take your data where you want it to go
and that people are allowed to
communicate over the internet without
interference by the people in the middle
it's a pretty profound principle and the
fact people don't know about it is is
you know on the street doesn't mean it's
not important because I think some of
the you know most important principles
are just sometimes very subtle you know
they operate at the scent of
subterranean level like e equals MC
square geometry don't need to know where
ya know I think it's the I need to know
I'd sounding is that important well we
can debate about that but it a lot of
these things you know freedom is a
I have a thing that you can't really you
know experience you just experienced its
absence right you know when you're not
free but you you don't notice when
you're able to go to internet sites when
you want to or say what you want to
because you just live in life you just
live in and you're just doing what you
want it's when you aren't able to do
that something to notice it and i think
that's that's that's why this is a
profound principle it was baked into the
original design of the internet it's
what made the internet so revolutionary
in so many ways I mean what made all
these companies able to grow without
asking somebody for permission the
companies like Google ebay amazon
whatever they just started their
businesses they didn't sort of have to
say you know AT&amp;amp;T or Verizon I got a
good idea you want to you know run my
service to you should've been like well
you know well you know check it out wait
for five years ten years see what
happens I mean it's a very profound
thing that as I said before you don't
notice freedom you notice its absence
and and and whose job is it to ensure
net neutrality is it is it the
government's job is it Verizon's job is
it the citizens job I think it's kind of
everybody's damn it i knew i knew i was
going to say that but i'll tell you that
in a functioning system it's never
completely possible to allocate a
responsibility to you know one entity
when you talk about something like how
do you guarantee freedom of speech well
you could say well you just have to have
the government do that but you know the
government did I work for the government
sometimes they're they're lazy not
everything gets to them they're not
all-powerful but the government does but
the government did do a lot of stuff to
guarantee free speech they knew the only
mess with it so it you know they're not
completely reliable no one's totally
reliable it's a little paranoid although
but terms of free speech but you have to
admit like the US government has done a
relatively good job of saying like we've
got we need a free speech and we're
going to push that on our citizens we're
gonna say like you can't just limit what
somebody has slowed the courts have said
that right the executive branch now and
then is like maybe we don't want so much
free speech maybe we'd like the New York
Times to to say that there's weapons of
mass destruction in Iraq or something I
mean like that's not freedom of speech
that's manipulation of the price well
that's true I'll just say that the
federal the executive branch hasn't
been exactly reliable to hell with the
executive you know that they have their
moments but laws exist sorry I have to
get off track but they are but we have
let we have said not their legislation
but we've said uh we've got some basic
rules here that we believe in right one
of those roses free speech and we and
people fought on both sides of it but we
have kind of pushed this agenda of free
speech is valuable we need to protect it
there has not been a similar there's not
been a similar fight for the Internet
that's right nobody has said the free
internet the open Internet is important
and we need to protect it what they have
said is with like things like SOPA right
 the free internet we want to
protect we want to make sure we have
money right and there you've got people
who are backed by lobbyists right
pushing laws that will ultimately
diminish the openness of the Internet
right you notice elf a fan are you how
would that be possible I don't know you
tell them I like soap i don't like by
yourself and that's great but uh but i
mean so so so what do we do I mean
what's the obstacle here how do we how
do we combat I mean it feels like we've
got verizon and AT&amp;amp;T mm-hmm largely
controlling the pipes was a few other
players in there but not that many right
and they are dictating in many ways what
happens on the internet or what happens
with the internet right you obviously
have forces you've got forces from
places like Hollywood what you talk
about in your book and you've talked
about elsewhere I ran into some
Hollywood forces recently that there
were very psyched on on the idea that
you know that it's it's like Verizon
1880s responsibility to block things so
that's a fairly scary concept what what
are we supposed to do how do we how do
we how we fix this you need two things
you need a norm and you know and you
need a law so first of all it has to be
a principle that Internet freedom is
sacred and fundamentally important to to
a civilized nation it has to be
understand stood at the level of free
speech just like we've you equate you
see you queen a neutrality with free
speech yeah I think it's the sort of the
flip side of it I mean free speech is I
can say whatever I want net neutrality
is I get to connect with whoever I want
you know unless there's a really strong
reason not to free speech is an absolute
net neutrality is an absolute but as a
general rule i get to connect with you
oh man what are those reasons how do we
pick them how do we decide well that's
another story and and you know there's
obvious examples in free speech you have
principles like it might send a very
serious message to assassinate the
president but that doesn't mean it
should be legal right it obviously needs
to be prevented so similarly with net
neutrality you can think of I think very
narrow categories but certain reasons
that it might be reasonable to influence
what people can connect to but they're
rare they're sort of like interfering
with terrorists efforts to sort of
attack the United States or the
country's things like this are elderly
or nog raphy child pornography is
probably another except what about
pirated movies no i mean because what
one man's pirated movie you know one
man's pirated movie is another man's
innovation what is exactly a pirated
movie is often not exactly clear and I
you know you say it is if we know what a
pirated movie is and sometimes you do
but so the copyright law is so unclear
that sometimes it's not legal it's
sometimes legal and the other issue I
have with with with pirated movies is
that fundamentally I don't think it's
important to pass laws protect an
industry that is in decline and that you
know I think we go in a dangerous
direction when we have an industry which
is essentially in in decline and you
know it is has been in decline for some
time to try to use all the powers of
government to try to save them right
this has been an issue since the 16th
century is every time an industry is
dying it says I'm threatened by piracy
can you give us some examples the
booksellers in the 16th I can give you a
million examples my book is full of them
again the master switch by Tim Wu
available available in paperback 1595
very affordable available in ebook form
i would imagine yeah it's 10 it's i
think it's about nine dollars on nine
dollars on amazon you where they're
taking a cut of the profits
but not hopefully not too big no it's
good but so no see you have examples so
you've got I have tons of examples you
know if you look as early as 1920s for
example at that point sheep music was
the dominant industry for distributing
music and I said sheet music she oh
sheet she amazed I did anybody else
think he said sheet music yeah I felt
like the animal thought I don't realize
that all neither heard of that so I got
no but the way you made music in the
19th century it was actually nice as you
bought music and then you took it home
and played it you know that was like
that was the recording industry in the
day no they were the dominant way of
distributing music along came the record
player and the sheet music was suffering
because people listening to records even
playing yourself so what they say they
said the recording industry are a bunch
of pirates who are destroying American
culture they're just taking the sheet
music recording what's on it and then
selling is exactly like these guys are
destroying America because you know
America used to be a place where people
sing and dance and and now you know
people are listening these crazy
photographs and and player pianos and
we've lost our culture and its disaster
out of work everyone's out of work out
you see the hair the same thing every 20
years I mean it is what that is with the
entertainment industry is saying I mean
I mean Ari Emanuel said you can't make
curb your enthusiasm in any other way
than to have this big industry behind it
and if you don't if you don't have the 3
million dollars per episode there's a
hundred maybe 500 year old tradition of
making starving artists the the kind of
symbol of what is really an industry
that's dying that's being replaced by
different technology same thing Atma and
cable came out people are like cable and
I don't love cable but when it came out
as a new industry and they said these
cable guys are a bunch of pirates all
they want to do is loot Hollywood loot
TV the same thing is said every single
time is this a bit you become what you
despise because I feel like you've got
the Cable guy's really hey we're
innovators and now they're the old guard
and you've got internet a television
sort of this whole IP you know
revolution right and the cable guys are
going like we got to do something about
this everyone becomes what they despise
did you know that oh really okay I don't
know
got something terrible in that case
which is absolutely terrible so so so
obviously very complex lot to talk about
here we're not going to get to all of it
tonight but but but I mean how are we
doing I mean we've got verizon as I was
saying earlier they've got this monopoly
how do we regulate these guys I mean
they own the pipes they build the pipes
there doesn't seem to be a ton of
regulation there's a fear with
government regulation that you're going
to end up in this kind of down this
rabbit hole of right you know it can be
like Brazil nothing will ever get
innovated on I mean what how do you
strike a balance how do you do this I
think you have to have just very simple
rules net neutrality rules that say you
must allow people to connect with who
they want to connect with exactly what I
said before they have to be regulated
basically like New York taxi cabs and I
know New York taxi cabs don't always
obey the rules right but the basic rule
when you get in a taxi cab as it goes
where you want to go not where they want
to go right and as long as I understand
that position I think it's relatively
straightforward but that is it difficult
because as you pointed out there is a
growth a return of the power of the
telephone and cable monopoly you know
for most of the history the United
States we had one company AT&amp;amp;T running
the show and things of the way you know
like the Terminator robot if kind of
going back to the way they were and we
have to be very careful to see that our
phone companies verizon AT&amp;amp;T comcast I
guess their cable company don't end up
hat being essentially the gatekeepers of
the internet that's extremely important
so what do you what do you say it like
people here what's the best thing you
can do what is the best thing you can do
you think the best you can do is
complain or get angry yes when no
problem yeah we got ready for that read
it read it helps you just need to be not
willing to accept it when your cable
company or your phone company says we're
going to decide what the internet is you
have to take possession of this thing
and say it is our network I mean some of
the people on there were like who owns
the internet people on the internet and
that's actually true right it was not
designed to be owned by anyone but I
phone companies all intents and purposes
verizon on the internet
you but UK I can't just go get on the
internet I have to go through something
somebody oh I have to go through some of
that somebody else home look you have to
take a taxi to go to Brooklyn doesn't
mean the taxi owns broad but I can also
buy it but I could buy a car you got to
go through the Brooklyn Bridge and I
can't drive and I could drive that road
is anybody can drive on by the way this
is a metaphor that apparently people who
like so if I hate but I mean you can but
I can go buy a car and drive myself to
Brooklyn you can't drive yourself to the
Internet to get to Brooklyn you got a
cast Pass I the Brooklyn Bridge or blue
manhattanville bridgeberg yeah those
guys earlier they don't own Brooklyn
right you know you got to go through
them if they had a policy like oh we're
only going to let so and so through that
would change you could get there but
doesn't mean they own Brooklyn and it's
very important not to convince to get
confused a gatekeeper with an owner
right they're completely different
people someone has a tollbooth does not
mean they own the thing but the
gatekeeper has a lot of houses and how
about our is the owner they have a lot
of power and that's why since basically
medieval times there's been a series of
laws designed to guard the gate keepers
so you think violent revolution is the
only way to solve this maybe I'm
paraphrasing all right we just arrived
up but you're working on a new book II
just tell me question you know I'm
interested basically what technology
should do next I think we're starting to
solve some of the problems of scarcity
that have obsessed humanity for 500
years or so and I think we're starting
doing at this question of what do we do
now now that we have a lot of things
enough food enough information what's
next that's my next book I think huge
party it's gonna be the answer Tim thank
you so much right really off ledger
timber everyone and again again
the master sway in book stores now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
