released the stunning Surface Studio
and proved that, hey, maybe
desktop PCs don't need
to be ugly boxes you hide under your desk.
(techno music)
Now we have the new Surface Studio 2,
which is just as visually
stunning as the first model
but with way more power under the hood.
It's also still really expensive.
It even costs more than the first Studio
and starts at 35 hundred dollars.
But once you sit in front of this thing,
with it's massive 28-inch touch screen
that pivots on a floating hinge,
the price is the last thing
you're thinking about.
Just like before, the Surface
Studio is really designed
for creators, people who use computers
to make digital art.
Now since I'm just a word monkey
and a talking head here on
video, I had Verge reporter
and published cartoonist
Dami Lee try out the Studio 2
for creating digital artwork.
- I mainly just make web comics,
so I think having a machine like this
would definitely be
over-the-top luxury for me.
With that said though, the
three by two display ratio
really makes the screen feel huge.
There's more than enough
space on the screen to look
at reference images on
another window while drawing
and I liked having a video
tutorial open in another window
while following along in After Effects.
The Surface Pen has replaceable nibs
and re-mappable buttons, which
also doubles as an eraser.
It's got 4096 levels of
pressure sensitivity,
includes tilt support and I
didn't notice any sort of lag
or any offset between the cursor
and the stylus, which is a problem
that sometimes affects
the Wacoms and Teak lines.
It also attaches magnetically
to the side of the screen,
which is nice so you don't lose it.
One weird issue I ran
into while drawing was
that the pen was still
suffering from the line jitter
that's plagued the
Surface line for months.
Microsoft said it fixed
the problem in August
through a firmware update
so I'm not sure if it's back
or if it used to be worse.
I tried drawing straight
lines both freehand
and with a ruler and
the wobbly lines persist
if you draw slowly, it
goes away if you draw
with fast strokes so it's
not too big of a deal,
but it still feels like a problem
that a 35 hundred dollar
device shouldn't be having.
There's also a 99 dollar
Surface Dial accessory
that isn't included in the box
and it hasn't been updated
since the last Surface Studio.
There's a couple of drawing apps
that are optimized to give
the Dial more features,
like Sketchable, but because I'm so used
to keyboard shortcuts, I
can't really see myself
adopting the Dial for everyday use.
On a screen that already
has touch support,
so you can do things like pinch to zoom,
having a Dial feels almost redundant
but maybe this is just a me problem.
If there's a Surface
Dial fan club out there,
please let me know in the comments.
(techno music)
- So the Studio can be
useful for some artists,
but it's also just an interesting
computer to do work on.
The screen is so big and so bright,
I can just fling windows
all over the place.
Now normally I work on a big
34-inch, ultrawide monitor
but the Studio's 28-inch screen
actually has more surface area
because of its unique three by two ratio.
I will say though, with a screen this big,
it's hard to work on anything discretely
in an open office because
basically anyone can just walk by
and easily see whatever you're doing.
Now the big difference
from the last Studio
with this one is all on the inside.
It's got a beefier processor,
newer graphics card
and, finally, a proper SSD.
The Studio 2 has enough power
to run the latest AAA gaming titles,
even at high resolutions
and keep smooth frame rates.
And gaming on this thing is a blast.
The screen is so big and in your face
that everything just feels more immersive.
I mean, just looks at
Forza Horizon 4 on it.
Or Star Wars Battlefront 2.
Even games like Shadow of
the Tomb Raider look great,
even though I do have to
lower the resolution more
to make them smooth and playable.
Now one concern with gaming
on the Studio 2 is the
unique screen ratio.
It might cause some issues
with games like Overwatch
that have a locked view
port to 16 by nine.
You're going to see these giant black bars
and lose a fair amount
of the playable screen.
The Studio's aspect ratio is the same
as every other Surface product
and it's really great for productivity
but maybe it's not the best
for games or watching video.
But still, most of the games
I tested on it had no issues
and ran pretty amazingly.
So the Studio 2 is kind of
interesting for digital artists.
It's probably overkill for
a daily productivity machine
and it's also a unique gaming PC.
But there's still plenty
of areas where the Studio 2
could be an even more compelling computer.
For example, I can't
plug in an external GPU
to give it more graphical oomph
because the USB C port on
the back isn't Thunderbolt 3.
I can't use the Studio 2's
gorgeous display as a monitor
for a more powerful workstation
because it doesn't support video input.
And this might sound like a nitpick,
but, my opinion, with a 35
hundred dollar and up computer,
there's no nit that's too small to pick.
Microsoft packages the absolute
worst mouse with the Studio.
It's a cheap feeling, two-button
and scroll wheel wireless deal.
Now Microsoft has much better mice
in its hardware portfolio.
It'd be nice if it actually
included one of those
with its high-end, flagship desktop PC.
But, all of those complaints aside,
I still really want this thing
because it's a widely unique computer
that's fun to use and powerful enough
to get most any work I
need to do done on it.
Now like Dami said, it's
an over-the-top luxury
for my needs but you can't
match this computer's features
with a different model.
It just doesn't exist.
I can use it to write, I
can use it to browse the web
or play games, and if I could
actually draw good enough
to save my life, I'd use it
to create artwork as well.
The Studio 2 is just more
fun to use than a standard
all-in-one desktop or a
desktop and monitor set up.
Now it's certainly designed
for a specific market,
where cost maybe isn't as big of a concern
as what the device can actually do.
But if you're in that market,
it's really hard to find a better option.
Thanks for watching.
If you're looking for a device
that's good for creators,

on the new iPad Pro.
We had a bunch of creatives
on staff test it out
and really dive into what it can do.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
