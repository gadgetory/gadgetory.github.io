processor called end stage known as
something unusual debit cards are
withdrawing thousands of dollars at a
time far beyond the normal limit someone
impacting it and stable system and
raised the withdrawal and letting
millions of dollars flood out of
accounts across 24 different countries
by the time end state regains control of
the system the next day more than 26,000
transactions had gone through for 40
million dollars that's more than double
the largest cash robbery in US history
the heist was organized by a crew of
hackers in Turkey Romania and Ukraine
they were the ones breaking in to end
stage and raising the limits but how
they get the cards in the first place
pulling off a heist this big require
global network of debit card thieves
it's still in existence today
stealing ATM cards easier than you think
all use the pin code and a copy of the
magnetic stripe but that stripe is the
same magnetic encoding that's on a
simple cassette tape that makes it easy
to copy and easy to steal you can even
do it with a cassette player thieves
usually steal that data by putting a
skimmer over at ATMs card slot and
planting a nearby camera to capture the
pin code once they have that data they
can turn a cheap hotel key into a copy
of the ATM card and head to an ATM the
big question for criminals is how much
money can you make off each car you
usually only get one withdrawal before
banks pick up on the throg so the big
problem is that withdrawal limit with
the turkish hacking through on your side
that goes from 200 dollars to over a
thousand easily worth whatever cut the
crew is taking but that loose network
also gave investigators a clear path for
tracking a group down police arrested
one of the cashiers after using a hacked
card an ATM in Brooklyn he led them back
to the rest of the group and earlier
this year one of the crew a Turkish
hacker named aircon Vindico Glu pled
guilty to computer intrusion conspiracy
and other charges which could add up to
as much as 57 years in prison the rest
of the group is still at large
