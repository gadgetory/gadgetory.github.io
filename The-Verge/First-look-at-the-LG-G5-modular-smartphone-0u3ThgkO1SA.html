Congress here in Barcelona 2016 and
plywood verge and we're here with the
first big new phone announcement this is
the brand new LG g5 it's a 5.3 inch
handset the company follows up from the
LG g4 from last year as you can see it's
a more complex and wallet device but it
still has the same resolution 2560 by
1440 quad HD the first thing I noticed
with this device is that it video
reminds me of Google's Nexus 60 it has
the fingerprint sensor but all over here
in the back which is also that was up as
a power button also you might notice
this is where LG starts to come into its
own it has a dual camera system so it
has a 16 megapixel camera and an 8
megapixel camera the second 8 megapixel
camera actually gives you wide of your
period of view goes out to 135 degrees
g5 will be available in the silver
option there also be a code a pink and a
dark color which LG calls Titan but
Philips really different about the LG g5
is something that LG calls a set of
friends for accessories for the new
phone there's a tiny little button right
here on the side which when you press it
it pops open and you should pull out the
battery of the phone with it it's a
twenty eight hundred million power
battery and you can add more accessories
so one of them is this extra camera grip
which you took the battery into and then
you plug back into the phone LG says
that the g5 brings up really quickly so
we can actually test that right now but
what you have with this compartment is
you get an extended battery but you do
get a dedicated shutter button a
dedicated video button and LED indicator
light and a job dial for zoom and the
phone is just put it up so there's a few
seconds that it took
with the external battery as well you
get up to four thousand milliamp hours
LG says that gets you 50% more usage or
six or eight hours extra Camrys which is
you know it's nice also noticeable down
here the bottom use DC this uses a USBC
connector another attachment that LG has
for the g5 is the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen high
five DAC and M so this is a 32 bit DAC
it has its own headphone jack which
might turn out a bit confusing because
of the headphone jack up here and this
is why I put the top of the phone one of
the bottom is for 32 bit high five DAC
and amber the whole idea with this is
that the g5 once you have this plugged
in turns into a high five portable media
player but these are just the two
attachable accessories the two
attachable so-called friends is the LG
360 cam which does pretty much what the
name suggests it's a 360 camera and
there's also new USBC head mounted
display it weighs 100 grams it's a
little bit more attractive than the
usual VR set and also there is a rolling
robot it's kind of like this view elbow
it's a big bowl that you control with
your phone it has a laser pointer it has
a camera integrated into it has speakers
and a microphone and LG presents it as a
home monitoring device / pet care access
reason another big new feature is he
always on display so the display never
goes off it's an IPS display not OLED
and consumes not point eight percent of
battery power or rout the one thing that
LG isn't giving us is any pricing for
any of these accessories the big
innovation for og
is all of these accessories the friends
that it's adding on this is what's going
to set g5 apart but speaking for myself
personally I love the design I love the
feel of this phone and I feel with the
new and improved cameras the new
improved processes as a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 820 inside four gigabytes of
RAM 32 gigabytes of storage micro is the
expandability just as a phone this might
be one of the more interesting most
exciting ones coming out in a long while
the LG g5 and all of its friends are
going to be coming out in early April
we're told around the world but anyhow
this is all from the LG g5 and MWC for
now but stay tuned to the verge tune
into our YouTube channel as well we'll
have a whole bunch more from here at MWC
that's it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
