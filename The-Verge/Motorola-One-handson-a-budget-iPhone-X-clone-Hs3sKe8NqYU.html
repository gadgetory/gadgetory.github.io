at Aoife 2018 with Motorola's new phones
we have the Motorola one and the
Motorola one power the new bezel acid'
range Android phones they run Android
one and the big things that they have an
iPhone 10 style notched display but like
a much lower price point the moto 1 is
going to be more widely available it
will be available in Europe Latin
America and Asia starting in October for
299 euros which works out to like three
hundred and fifty dollars u.s. which is
really cheap for a phone where you're
getting this kind of form factor and at
that price is honestly pretty great the
two phones are pretty similar the
Motorola one is smaller with a 5.9 inch
screen and the design is a bit different
it has Gorilla Glass 2.5 on both sides
with a metal frame on the other hand you
have the Motorola one power which will
again only be available in India it's
bigger with a 6 point 2 inch screen
that's a bit of a higher resolution and
it swaps out the frame from the glass on
both sides to metal on the back and top
as a headphone jack which is
unfortunately a little rare to see on
phones these days and extremely welcome
here the rear cameras in the motor Row 1
are dual 13 megapixel shooters the front
camera is an 8 megapixel selfie cam the
Motorola 1 power for India bumps those
both up a bit the rear cameras are
upgraded to 16 megapixel lenses in the
front facing cameras 12 megapixels both
ones will be shipping with Android 8.1
Oreo running the Android 1 version which
google promises security updates for for
at least 3 years being Motorola phones
they're also running pretty close to
stock Android with a couple of
enhancements here and there but both
phones should be getting Android 9.0 Pi
in the near future which should have
additional software enhancements
especially for those nozzles on top in
terms of processor the Android one has a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 well the one
power has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 636
again these aren't quite top low-end
processors but for a mid-range Android
phone at the price points that these are
reaching it's pretty much in line what
you'd expect with the rest of the market
storage and memory are also pretty good
both phones come with 4 gigabytes of RAM
64 gigabytes of storage out of the box
which can be expanded up to 256
gigabytes with microSD cards
so I'm holding the iPhone 10 and the
Motorola one and honestly I'm really
impressed with the Motorola one again
it's not quite the same level fit and
polish that you'd expect from the iPhone
the screen isn't quite as seamless with
the sides the screen on the iPhone
obviously has much higher pixel density
it's brighter it's an OLED screen with
the colors a little better but for the
price at this cost which is again 299
euros around $350 in America it's a
really impressive piece of hardware for
a mid-range Android phone that has this
kind of design in Polish Motorola seems
to have something really impressive on
its hands here and when you add in the
fact that it's running Android 1 which
is again nearly stock Android with just
a couple of Motorola's enhancements here
and there it's a religious great
experience that you don't usually see
from Android phones at this price range
there's no extra you know bloatware
installed
it's just Android the way you wanted and
right now just quickly it does feel
pretty snappy the Motorola one is set to
come out in Europe Asia and Latin
America starting in October for 299
euros the Motorola one power will only
be available in India at a later date
and honestly if it came to America I'd
probably buy one on the back of also a
fingerprint scanner which is useful
right side of the phone have your useful
volume power buttons bottom is speaker
USB C charging which is great right side
is where the SIM card slot is and top
has a headphone jack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
