emphasis on people first app second
thing is not exactly a people person
baby picture baby picture self-portrait
engagement photos now at the sunset
mountain sunrise she really hates obama
but despite all that i'm still enamored
with HTC's first the so-called facebook
phone why because with a push of a
button i can get rid of facebook home
and therein lies the beauty hidden
inside the acc first is a trojan unicorn
stock android with LTE support like most
phones the HTC first comes set up with a
skin over android thanks samsung's
touchwiz or HTC Sense unlike those
phones facebook home was incredibly easy
turn off the back it's the first option
in home settings there's no rooting or
hacking involved I've now got bone stock
Android 4.1 jelly bean the HTC first is
considered a mid-tier phone at some
point all companies made a pact that
high-end Android devices needed five
inch strains but I don't I can use the
agency first in one hand and everything
is easy to read I'm sure the phones not
as gorgeous as HTC is amazing one but
with the mat bag it just feels better
also it doesn't do this
the truly devoted Android lover will
probably still want to offer the nexus 4
and there are many good reasons to do so
it's got the latest version of Android
and it's got a tacit guarantee from
google that whatever version android
comes out next it's probably gonna get
pretty quickly with the HTC first there
is no guarantee it'll be upgraded at all
but I can live with 4.1 for a couple of
years i've used android in the past and
I've perfect set being a virgin or two
behind besides I know it won't stop me
forgetting the latest apps the other
nice thing it supports AT&amp;amp;T LTE network
which isn't something any next device
does right now that may not matter to
everyone but haven't spent months with
an iphone 5 I just can't go back to
slower speeds yes the camera is so-so
and truth be told that'll be the one
thing I really missed from my iphone but
for Instagram and Twitter that's good
enough I don't need the latest and
greatest and i don't want all the bells
and whistles I don't want a five if
device but I need a break from my iphone
and with the HTC first I can't think of
a better option right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
