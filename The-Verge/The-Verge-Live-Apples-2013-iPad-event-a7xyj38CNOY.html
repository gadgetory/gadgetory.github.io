apple ipad event ross miller is here
with me good to see Olga and of course
the lovely the delightful the handsome
the new liebe sure did hellas hamburger
yes not gosh Topolsky of course added
their chief of the verge and generally
nice guy unless you cross me and then I
end you and your entire family and that
would be anyone who left the stream
anybody taking a brain you're dead
anyhow we're back a post post apple ipad
event uh no big surprise is really no uh
and and I kept my tie on yeah so not a
big surprise there either team tai ellis
you just watch the event you're known
around the office as the app man what's
your take on this what's your take on
Apple's like the first thing I thought
of was that old commercial from my thick
2007 of Mac versus PC where they say I
can do everything right out of the box
and for whatever reason when iOS came
out they decided to strip all those apps
out of it and charge for them
independently so with this new version
they made everything free they made
Mavericks free everything's back in the
box they want everybody to be on the
same playing field you know so that was
my takeaway yeah I think that's a good
thing I mean software making money from
software doesn't mean anything to Apple
it's all about the hardware at least for
now right and what they're doing well
making money on the app's but making
money in their stores is a major part of
their business right I'm talking about
their own well yeah making money off of
pages right that small beans really
fugly final cut is not a big so why are
they charging five dollars for pages
when they can just give it away now they
can say hey not that we're necessarily
worried about the surface but you're in
a Cyrano one of the few microsoft stores
they say this is a productivity machine
you got office on there now whole can
say the same thing right they can say we
give you pages and numbers and all this
other stuff that's that's a it's plug
its plugin it's a very holistic view
like you're giving it back to you guys
for free yeah only that but they're like
they're leaning on the I cloud
infrastructures like okay we can do this
you can also view on your iPad
don't have your laptop you can
collaborate it's a big deal now you can
collaborate with right yeah is it real
time collaboration yeah it remains to be
seen they don't really go into them they
didn't go into a demo of that yeah they
already and of all things he did not
demo yeah well I mean I demo it briefly
but it wasn't but they really just
showed hey look you can add
collaborators we can change a text right
but but I don't know how that compares
to something like like Google Drive or
Google Docs real-time collaboration they
did say it was the most requested
feature though for I work for web beta
yeah so yeah I'm not try any more likely
how this works a little bit i'm sure
that's exactly what video that doesn't
that doesn't surprise me at all because
you know their competitor is leaps and
bounds ahead in that department and i
think people are looking at it saying
like look i want to use all your stuff i
want to use it on my iPad but then i get
to the web and ? where i want to
collaborate and ? now that ? is
hopefully less of a ? terrible way to
end that oh by the way but uh what else
what about the new ipads any feeling a
big i think small and not even yeah as
much as he took romantic it resting
behind a pencil and you couldn't see if
that was the idea yeah everybody's like
how Apple made a really nice a nice
pencil I thought there is a stylish not
a second you are you I mean just what do
you have to have an iPad right now I
have a mini yeah would you upgrade to
the the red nominee oh yeah uh so when I
was thinking about getting a mini I
didn't use the ipad 3 much because it
was so heavy and it would fall on my
face and yes the great eras terrified if
you're if you're a horny like if you're
like laying down you've got it like
you're doing this or even if you let so
I would like lay down with and do this
I've dropped it on my chest but your
newsstand just dance my seriously
actually it's frightening yeah it's not
cool so anyhow that you were saying so I
was saying so that's why I got the mini
and one of things about the mini as I
did a lot of reading on it and to be
honest like I felt I felt kind of like a
whiner but I did notice all the time i
used my iphone there's so much that well
then its lot smaller but that it wasn't
a Retina display yeah uh he's very
noticeable that was the one thing I kind
of freaked I love the nice that stuff
but it definitely is particularly for
reading he's obvious I mean my
assumption is obviously our guys are out
there right now my assumption is we're
going to see some shots and close-up
shots of that
it's gonna look incredible remember
right we're talking about retina
resolution on a relatively smaller just
actually the same amount of pixels yeah
right right so the pixel density is
going to be higher right and uh my guess
is that's gonna look incredible right on
display of that size is it the same
thickness and weight is the old iPad
Mini I missed that detail I'm not sure
they have is what's in the what is the
liveblog say only we had Emily we could
find out oh that we can find out the
site that has a good live blog yes apple
com no but but regardless the the body
type has not changed right for the ipad
mini main space essentially the same
body type is it is it's internship they
say it's thinner and lighter i don't
think they do they don't they do they do
live the size that is now 326 pixels per
inch yeah same density on 23 26 the same
number as the as the iphone at the i5
the 326 or the five guys yeah pretty
close it 316 I think the previous the
3.5 inch display was 326 I could be
wrong yup 326 at any rate um you know I
think I have to say they spent a lot of
time on the software mm-hmm no snow big
surprises the the freebie stuff was
definitely someone surprising Mavericks
for free was a little bit surprising
right they did not I thought there might
be some final cut stuff for pros there
was no mention of it there may be
something since there's apple will roll
out some of these updates without
talking about it on stage especially for
the pro stuff Mac Pro came in at a price
point that I think was where we expected
it to be 99 um sigler said he was
betting for two thousand well he was way
off oh yeah that's the guy that a gene
that's the guy that owes me money they
way off that guy should not be allowed
to guess about anything um but I think
overall the event was there's a lot of
geeky stuff it was geeky stuff well I
mean it's funny cuz apples gone a little
bit further into this spec kind of feeds
and speeds I mean I remember you know I
remember being at an event watching Phil
Schiller on stage making fun of other
companies talking about feeds and speeds
right you know yeah they used to
downplay the idea of that stuff and now
they're really playing it up I mean I
think part of it has to do with the
consumer consumer's have become a lot
more knowledgeable about what it means
to have
a cpu or a high-resolution display but I
think also you know when you think about
how you compete with these devices the
changes are incremental and their
incremental between companies devices
you know the offering of the surface vs
the ipad when it comes to hardware you
know you that's the way you
differentiate you know they're all
tablets the Nexus 7 is a little tablet
the ipad minis a little tablet obviously
there's a better software offering for
the ipad mini but how do you
differentiate you have to start to talk
about specs throws because they're not
adding their increasingly getting to
know their consumers better yeah yeah
and it's a broader consumer base ya mean
people i think last year we're saying
crap is the mac pro damn right like I
love my big I rhenium tower well that's
a difference that's a different type of
consumer right so that's back and they
talked about the specs for the back book
air but guess what they did for regular
people they drop the price by two
hundred dollars right which means a lot
right to a lot of people there's still
hold out to say I don't want to make is
I mean I'm they're still in a price
range that's not gonna compete with the
low end you're not gonna be with
Chromebooks they're not going to compete
with cheap 500 or pc laptops like
they're just not going to do that they
are going to compete for that
thousand-dollar laptop market they are
going to compete for the big the big and
small I mean you have to think about the
actually the price point what is the
price point now for the ipad mini it's
299 the low-end one yeah the original
rub it 30 bucks I mean you're still it's
still no no no not a night for them no
it's two night there's no way to drop to
that much no it's 299 for 299 and 399
yes okay and so they dropped it 30 bucks
right but you know the competition is at
229 the kindle is the kindle fire they
sell a version of the kindle fire for a
hundred and thirty-nine that has an HD
display right yeah last kindle fire HD
yeah and you know but you have to
remember consumers they're not they are
looking at that price point they're
saying well i can spend three hundred
dollars or i could spend 139 or 199 that
does make a difference to them but you
know clearly Apple has an advantage
in the ecosystem yeah and they played up
every single time you know if you give
13 billion dollars developers they have
425 thousand apps that are actually
specialized custom designed for the ipad
these are not the android apps have been
like expanded to fill screen this is
james like for that experience and the
kapil drives at home every single time
you're not just getting a bigger iphone
you're getting something unique yeah
well and you know it is definitely
unique thanks to the developers and and
i think increasingly unique thanks to
Apple's first party apps which are
clearly they're putting some some effort
behind and strength behind now they want
to make those a feature of these things
they want to say we offer this sweet
like you were saying Ellis but so let's
talk overall for a second I want to talk
about the event uh none of the surprise
of the people were expecting of course
can you really expect a surprise sort of
an oxymoron there isn't it the invite
said we got a lot to cover I think a lot
of people were thinking cover yeah yeah
i mean i would even say hi nicely i even
tweeted that you know the cover idea can
be really powerful for apple right i
mean i still think i gotta say you know
i have a surface sitting here there are
things i like about this the thing that
I like most about it is this the utility
of this these covers with the with the
keyboards on I mean they're actually
really really useful at everybody I know
who has a regular-sized iPad everybody I
see on a plane or when a lot of keyboard
they have a logitech keyboard adapter
and they they all kind of herb not that
great you did a big run down of
keyboards in jus yeah and the thing is
there are a few that stood out and one
of them was this origami keyboard holder
thing which has been I remember that
brought in by was it for the surface to
they have the exact same foldables
kindle HDX as a kindle HDX that's right
and i think it would be a good place for
apple to jump in and build something of
their own and i'll read at a premium
price and make so much money the
Argent's on their first party
accessories are insane no i mean add to
me it seems like a no-brainer it's like
first off you squash the whole concept
of the service if like right if you were
even remotely where it which I don't
think apple is but you're even remotely
worried you add the iwork suite and they
say look you really want to do a bunch
of email and you
you type it up a storm and you love
having a physical keyboard we made a
cover for you and it's an advanced
technology blah blah charge 100 bucks
for it or 130 bucks for it make it for
you know 15 or whatever 20 it whatever
would cost their margins would probably
pretty good on something like that you
know and it just seems like there's a
demand for from our users I mean I've
seen ya you know it's anecdotal but it's
pretty strong that users who are have
iPads want this kind of stuff it's not
like apple doesn't make apple keyboards
anyway right I guess is somebody new to
worry about cuz like and this is enough
that was interesting there's a chart but
they showed ipad sales he said iPad sold
170 million they show this line chart
but the thing was at the top for the
last two or three quarters these sales
have kind of slowed it's not the
exponential rate it has been so this
like the iPad buyers market seems to be
sung at least a little bit right now
which thing that has never happened
before it seems and the tablet market
self is growing much faster so they're
actually at some point kind of seating
some the dominance they've had yeah the
usage doesn't seem to be seating any
dominance though there's no saying what
what percent of it 81 1157 what is they
will spend on tablets what is the usage
what were they how are they rated use it
i don't know i think in past time
they've used web usage let anything get
exactly so is that the metric its web
usage I think that's what it's been I
think it's a fairly you know it's not
unless it's debatable but it's a
different kind of metric what you want
to know is time on device you know web I
mean I hardly ever browse the web when
i'm using a tablet right i spend time
reading i spent time in a pocket or into
paper or reading a book or reading
magazines or reading feedly sometimes
okay very casually i'll play a game i
really dont watch video and miss
sometimes I listen to music but but the
thing is so what is use you know the
shopping statistics are absolutely off
the charts yeah right they don't even
compared to android tablets for holiday
shopping for right the percentage of
people that are shopping on tablets is
increasing and most of them are doing it
on ipad so i think that that's like a
scenario that's becoming so so important
yeah so I mean I don't think anybody's
offered a really good alternative I mean
in terms of the ecosystem and
completeness I mean I think that look
android tablets are still getting there
the surface the one that is really
competitive the surface RT that I
consider to be the competitor is still
lacking as far as ecosystem is concerned
big time and and so you just have you
know as it and then you get kindle they
don't really talk about numbers i think
that amazon feels like they're doing
quite well they've talked about their
they've talked about their market share
being thirty percent of the tablet or
something thirty percent of the tablet
market but but I don't know how that I
don't know how that's possible if
Apple's numbers are accurate you know so
all this is a bit of a guessing game and
all these numbers are a little bit you
know sort of questionable to some degree
but I'm inclined to believe Apple when
they say they've got a big-ass market
share with iPads right because that's
what I see people using and a big-ass
market share of like people are using
them yeah yeah well I don't get this i
don't think this idea that people buy
them and i use them so they're talking
about a specific type of use well i mean
like i'm a shy guy with the nexus 7 on
the train today playing playing a game
what is the game where you run and jump
tired dog kennel run temple run he's
playing some variation of temper on you
know i see people playing temple run on
all sorts of things that wouldn't factor
into usage hmm in those metrics if
they're just saying about web browsing a
shower shopping right so there's
different uses but i believe that that
Apple's still far and away the preferred
tablet it is and although it's just it's
just not perhaps alarming I'm sure
they're kind of thing about the IDC
numbers second quarter 2013 they
actually had lower growth needed
year-over-year you know this other
interesting note here localytics tablet
usage I want to use this kind of jumping
off point the ACT amazed out seventeen
percent of all the Iowas tablets being
used your ipad 2 is apparently still
thirty-eight percent yeah there's a huge
ship well the only will grow thank you
guys by the way uh so the the ipad mini
retina depth is actually it's a little
bit bigger right and a little bit
heavier
and the previous mini Adam to Pascal or
Pascal I'm sorry i'm not saying that
right lets us know that it's point 07
heavier point 01 I'm something inch
thicker yep yeah so so you know that
kind of makes sense who knew display
probably a slightly larger battery i
would assume and you know here's the
thing it's a cool update yeah i think a
lot of it we're gonna buy it this
certainly isn't I mean this is Apple
exerting its place and its dominance in
tablets mm-hmm you know the software it
looks good I don't get that excited
about productivity software as I said
during the line they seem to love it who
the demos oh yeah there I was very
excited me well Tim Cook is the numbers
guy when he sees a spreadsheet he gets
very excited wants fireworks in it he
added that's right I'm sure why not but
have a lot to cover you don't spend 5 10
works make well they didn't have him I
they actually have that much recovered
no no an apple TV no I wat I think we
knew these things were going to happen
there's no apple television set no I
watch they didn't get into any new
product categories this year Tim Cook
had made mention of exciting new product
categories there's some debate about
whether he specifically was talking
about getting into them or just that
they're excited about new product
categories but unless they hold another
event this year Apple is not getting
into any new product categories in any
significant way let's also look at some
of the stuff they usually mention that
didn't come up there no ipods at all ya
know I've no bigger iPad we explain how
this rumor no Apple TV set-top box or
condom distribution deals no matter for
that no games like which is not as well
iphone famous our friend than any blade
they could have shown off some gaming
but I think it's a well established fact
that gaming is a thing that you do on
the iPad I don't feel like they have to
hit people over the head with it you
know they did for four pages for nobody
I think that's what they wanted to sell
I mean I do think there was a little bit
of a response to Microsoft in there you
think so there's certainly respond teta
cup certainly response to google the
google doesn't sell their stuff on
productivity they sell their stuff the
productivity is kind of this for google
is this it's there it's increasing its
you know the growth is obvious that
people are adopting
for its prime e we use them internally
for all of our a you know all of our Fox
and Virg right communication and
collaboration but you know I but look I
still use keynote when I need to put
together a presentation right what I
don't use this power point and you know
office is the one place where where
windows and microsoft has have had this
you know incredible foothold right this
is almost a stranglehold on people and
you still see people there like I can't
move off of office I can't move out of
these like these complications all right
but i do think apple's saying are
starting to say we're here and we want
to be a player we want to beacon taken
seriously as a prof as more than just a
you know a cool device that your kids
use or that you use to watch movies they
did the same thing with the iphone I
mean the iphone started out is this
obviously very closed device that had no
apps they opened it up to apps and it
was seen as like this incredibly go cool
games and you know cute little to-do
list or whatever and I think pretty
quickly they said look these are real
productivity devices you can get stuff
done with them but and I think they're
saying the same thing they're also
saying we're competin against a done
with them but we're competitive and
we're going to be competitive by
offering this stuff I wonder how much we
are thinking about that in advance when
you look at the iphone i mean they're
obviously lots of crazy quotes that
people said about the iphone and how
they predicted it would do but i don't
think anybody predicted that it would be
the the phone that accountants today are
provided by their IT departments right
top four accounting firms right five
years later I don't think anybody
predicted that yeah so it's interesting
to me maybe how much they're thinking
about how much they want these to be
productivity devices I mean if you look
at what airline is it that thats hanging
out iPads and you see it is a very odd
job yeah I think it's Delta maybe I know
there was something about the service
they're giving services to people on oh
right American Society iPads this is
these same productivity at Williams yeah
can you climb ships and also now read
about pilots
love to my flying games when they're I
think with the controls the last thing I
want to see is my pilot about to do a
stomp pad just give it a system yeah
very or do you want to see that because
then he's getting in abysus that's true
but yeah no I mean the absolutely I mean
that's a great point and I think that
they have replaced blackberry mm-hmm and
a lot of pleasantly not out of their
reach no to disrupt no big business the
way that they have I mean I talked to
some of my friends and they're still
trying to get their company on you know
windows 2010 and or something they're
like Word 2010 and Excel 2010 and it's
years old and that probably came out in
2009 since it's called 2010 and it just
takes ages and ages and ages to do that
and it's moving so slowly that maybe
Apple thinks it can make a difference
what I'm interested in is where they're
dipping their toes into web like I work
and clearly this is a place that people
want to do word processing and key not
making and editing their documents and
I'm interested to see where they're
going to do that with their other apps
and services obviously it's a challenge
for them let's talk about that for a
second so obviously we know I work apps
for OS 10 and 4 obviously I feel like
for the iOS devices what can you
actually do with the web version or if
you had a windows machine what could you
actually do to interact with pages they
said it worked with Internet Explorer I
think it's meant to be pretty much
identical I me it was rebuilt from the
ground up to work on the web in for
collaboration apparently yet when you
look at something like Maps it's
probably using a lot of graphics
acceleration to do a lot of the flyover
stuff right um but I mean google earth
looks pretty sweet in the browser too
and maybe that's just not their
expertise but they're still focusing a
lot on the local apps on your machine
that's still there bread butter but it's
cool to see them trying out new stuff on
the web and actually making changes
quickly like they seem to have done by
adding collaboration just in the last
few months right I think you know it's a
long road for them you know the web has
always been a challenge for Apple and
it's always been a channel
for them to get that together they've
been slow moving you know they have you
know people forget about this I mean
I've we don't obviously but I love you
forget when mobileme was first launched
it was seen as this big push into the
web big push into services connected
services and and you know it was a
disastrous launch Steve Jobs famously
fired a bunch of people after it and but
but since then they learned a lot of
lessons they've been they've been moving
i think in baby steps the apple maps a
situation and coupled when they release
the iphone 5 was a similar had a similar
feel to it where they rushed into
something and didn't have all their
ducks in a row and you saw like an
immediate backlash from people and I to
this day like nobody trusts Apple maps
that I know and and frankly nobody I
know invests in or trust I cloud has
something where they like this is I use
this I rely on it I know it's going to
work for everything I know what it does
so that right exactly and so in so they
have moved slowly but they haven't done
anything that is to you know they need
to move the needle in some way they need
to say we're giving you something you
can't get anywhere else and we're doing
it better than the experience you have
anywhere else and they still haven't
shown me look their desktop apps are
incredible their iOS apps are incredible
but are they for something like word
processing for pages how much better
does it have to be for me to not use the
thing that is ubiquitous that I can
collaborate with people on that is
innately connected to my email and my
calendars and my contacts you know you
have to buy into the whole thing and in
order to do that you have to have a
seamless offering that not only is as
good but in some way better than the
thing that you're already using and I
think that's where you see with
Microsoft the way they've been able to
just hang on with office is okay yes
it's climbing I think it's a look office
in general i think is terrible to use I
think it's overly complex I think it is
you know archaic in some ways in the way
it functions obviously very powerful a
lot of the features of those apps are
very powerful and and businesses have
just plugged into it and they're there
so how do you change
those attitudes how do you move the
needle how do you tell people mobile was
easier here's why blackberry had some
footprint there in in mobile devices for
for large companies windows mobile a
little bit we're talking five six seven
years ago the iphone technology changes
the phones from foots f five years ago
are you totally useless you can't use
them six years ago you can't use them
you can't do anything with them they
literally don't function at this point
so what happens you've got to upgrade
your devices once you have to upgrade
your devices you know the software is in
some way secondary when it comes to
mobile it's not like they were relying
on their blackberries it's like they
were relying on their blackberries for
every single thing that had to do if
they saw a better device some other
opportunity like oh we can make our
warehouse run smoother because now we
have a device that has real applications
right I think there was an obvious
window there you have to upgrade the
hardware the software had done I think
nothing impressive except for blackberry
security and email which obviously and
push right well once you take that out
of the equation and if Apple saying
we're secure and you know it's Apple
it's not like they have a track record
of being insecure unsecured you know I
think there was a there was a way to
turn that over with with with desktops
and with systems that are hugely
integrated with you know windows XP
running office across a thousands tens
of thousands of computers want to ask
you you're describing a lot of these a
lot of these areas that Apple disrupted
with the iphone that people didn't
necessarily expect when you look at TV
do you feel like that's coming soon do
you feel like the rumors are mounting or
maybe waning a little bit because it's
been years that people have been saying
it and and when I look at my TV every
day or so that's what voicemail looked
like to me before on my phone got to
press all these but no we gotta hold
that hold that thought we have dieter oh
dude dinner is on the ground live from
the apple areas dieter bohn welcome
welcome to the version yeah
how are you look great first off I just
want to say fantastic very sunny there
in in San Francisco what's going on give
us your take on today's event I gotta
say I think the event felt a little
low-key there weren't any really huge
surprises i guess if there was any
surprise it was that so much of the
software was free but you know the new
iPads were basically we expected got
basically expected with the with the new
macbooks so i didn't walk out of there
feeling totally shocked and amazed by
anything is there is our product that
you saw that you feel like is a slam
dunk for them today i mean it is the air
you know is this going to spike a whole
new rash of ipad purchases or if you're
thinking of purchasing ipad you were
already a get the newest one and this is
just the next one that's that's
available to you do you think this moves
the needle at all huh i think it moves
it a little bit the i think Phil
Schiller said on stage that this is one
of these products where you actually
need to pick it up and send it to really
feel how it is and the ipad air man that
is one pound they say and it's super
light it feels completely different and
so I'm really you know I've been using
the ipad mini for a long time and I
assume coming into this event that i
would get retina mini but after holding
the ipad air i am actually a big
believer a guy and just went right for
it i think that i might go back to the
full-size iPad and release real classy
did you get a sense from people who were
there obviously you're talking the other
journalists who are there and and
clearly you're talking to Apple reps
though they're not going to express this
was there any sense from other people
around you that there were that people
expected more here that they were
thinking that there'd be something else
a lot of journalists were you know
laying odds down that we might see
something crazy a lot of people really
hoping for a 4k display panel I kind of
wasn't wasn't a big believer in that and
so nobody really expected anything else
but everybody was hoping for a little
bit more instead we got something that
was just kind of by the numbers from a
blow so the software they say they
showed ah sorry go ahead I was I was
just going to transition to the software
i think that moving i work to completely
free on new devices and making mavericks
completely free is it's really
interesting and they put it in context
of competing against Microsoft in office
which charges I think it's ninety-nine
bucks a year and so I was thinking wow
this is totally crazy and new but then I
also remembered oh wait I use Google
Docs which is free all the time and so
on the one hand yes they're they're
giving you a better deal than what
Microsoft doesn't it
on the other hand I mean
market is changing and stuff like oh and
productivity on tribal discretion over
the top starts moving toward sorry and I
think Apple attention of Annapolis
aligning itself more closely with Google
but it isn't my purse all that stuff
sorry we asked audion if you there but
but do you did you get a chance they
showed off a little bit of this
collaboration this I work collaboration
can you talk about it at all did you get
a better impression of what that would
entail is that how similar is that to
Google Docs collaborative editing well
you know I don't know I mean they showed
it running on the desktop so I can't say
if it's going to work as well as a web
version or on the iPad I mean the google
doc collaboration is really second to
none and so I be kind of surprised if it
worked as well as that but when they
were demoing it on stage you know the
changes were instantaneous you know
across the stage on whatever their
connection was and it seemed to work
fairly well but the big question is is
will it be is full featured as some of
the stuff you can get in other sweets
with like full commenting and revision
history and all the rest it looks pretty
but whether or not it's actually like
useful to be productive is a different
thing I have to use it
them I do think it's a marketing play
any part you begin marketing I know very
very people who use those apps you say
use keynote and I don't know a ton of
normal people who use those apps on a
daily basis and I think that it is now
easy for them to say look we've got a
productivity suite that's free on this
device to ya all right dieter I know you
have to get back to work there as a
matter of fact I'm if you don't get back
to work you're going to be in huge
trouble but I appreciate you taking the
time and any any any final thought here
from you from today's event my final
thought is the thing I said at the
outset honestly this was this is a
by-the-numbers event it'll big surprises
i don't think it's disappointing unless
you're you were hoping for more I kind
of was but you know Apple turned out
some new stuff but
three degrees and sunny again in San
Francisco dieter thanks so much thanks
so much for joining us and a great job
today right it really is god I went way
into newscaster voice there for 173
degrees in sunny and unusual and
Cupertino now back to what was your name
I was doing before we started I had a
vacant clay clay Parker clay clay clay
what clay buster yes right clay buster
anyhow uh yeah it really was though I
have to say was by the it was by the
numbers by the books for Apple but we
shouldn't be surprised about that
anymore I mean we would you know all of
these events you go into this incredible
mental high even your men the thing
about Apple is your imagination runs
wild because every so often they'll pull
something out and it's just like whoa
did not see this coming did not know
this was going to happen that has been
increasingly not the case in the last
few years if I'll just pray for the one
yeah thing and I think I mean I think we
I think we are remembering the apple of
two thousand six and two thousand seven
and two you know like but even post
iphone we knew the ipad was going but i
remember going on these hunts you know
we'd get sent we'd get sent images of
some weird blurry image you know the
leaks were not as specific and not as
obvious as they are now you couldn't
just get the backing from the new ipad
shipped to you from china you know we
used to get these blurry photos and we'd
be trying to decipher you know doing
running filters on them trying to figure
out isn't real is if a like where is
this from what's the exif data i like
doing all of this investigation about
the leaks and the stuff that we were
seeing you know we had the whole thing
with with gizmodo and the iphone 4 and
the pictures that we've gotten and all
this stuff where we were we didn't know
if it was real we didn't know if it was
if it was fake there was a huge amount
of excitement and hype around it but
that is fewer and further between now
and then there are two things to get to
that one like history is always more
interesting because we missed the times
in between right like ipad was about
twenty ten iphone was 2007 things
weren't always interesting in every
event in between but we can go look back
and say they did five great things in
five years right sometimes he won't get
as big years even with steve jobs were
off years yeah anything is ever since
they said we're doubling down on secrecy
they've done everything but
I mean I would say I mean you know it is
incredible that that the the type of
leak we're seeing now is as close to you
could put most of the thing together
right before apple announces definitely
I mean people had yeah right you don't
have the name of people had the casing
they had the the housing for the screen
they had all sorts of bits of this thing
basically put together so one thing I
want to talk about and so I think
somebody just tweeted me about it no
touch ID mm-hmm on the iPads obviously
they're manufacturing these these
sensors these fingerprint sensors I
they're putting them in iphone 5s is is
this just a thing where they said is
this kind of like Siri where they said
it's only going to be for our phone for
the flagship phone and we're not going
to bring it to our other devices why not
bring touch ID if you're going to buy
the five-hundred-dollar
six-hundred-dollar seven hundred dollar
ipad with all of your work information
on it all of your sensitive everything
all your name is tech stuff yeah why not
why is the security less stringent for
such a high-end device do you have any
answer for that's a good question I mean
I mean that seriously I think it's worth
asking because yeah you know Apple made
a big deal about it they said we've got
this new innovation you know you talk
about the innovative Apple here's Apple
saying we've got this innovation it's a
better sensor it's faster it's more
secure we're doing all this stuff where
we save that data in a special place we
don't let anybody have access to it the
Enclave the Walt Walt community and no
doubt they could fit it in the big iPad
it ok that's a room for the Enclave the
bigger even in the red mother's room for
the Enclave no Enclave no fingerprint
sensor why is that with Syria they could
blame it on the processor ostensibly
yeah but with this there's no there's no
blaming it because it's the same system
yeah and these are essentially the
retina is the m7 by the way I have a
look at the specs yet is the m7 in the
in the retina mini as well if that up
yeah can you check on it but so okay I
don't think a saline either acting no no
it says there it's in the big one yeah
it's in the air hmm you know it I just
think the question is you put everything
else in there
widely the fingerprint sensor off you
know don't you want me to be secure
don't you care about my privacy on my
pages yeah you're my pages yeah I'm
working on a new airplane for Boeing I
was wireframing i was showing eyes got a
secret you know that I don't wanted
people know where the fuselages next
thing you know I lost my iPad no
fingerprint sensor doxxed everybody has
my Boeing plans do have you do not find
my ipad which something Google Android
only recently got ya at least in a
first-party capacity ya know that's true
but idea one idea is if you look at
ipads a lot of people use them with
their entire families and i know you can
do maximum of 10 fingers touch ID some
people attacked a way to do 50 believe
it or not yeah with touch ID but maybe
the actual sunshiny seems like great for
a family actually yeah i mean what they
should do mean apple doesn't want to do
this because they want everybody i'm
just talking about making sure it just
works right with one person they could
be a lot more a lot more competent dude
how many families actually share an ipad
thats I say that's psychotic I wouldn't
let anybody touch my ipod I won't even
let Laura touch it you can't you can't
share like app store like all right you
have basically have to say like okay
here's the app store along and do
whatever you want I'm you can put
parental controls on it but then like as
the parent you have to go in and I mean
it just doesn't really so the ipad mini
does heavy m7 coprocessor the motion
processor so we're like the elevated
Apple quote gizmodo yes do they really
yeah somebody just tweeted me about it i
missed that completely that's a huge
deal yeah is gizmodo gonna get out of
the timeout or whenever I'm as bad as
already there's another one okay yeah so
let's catch everybody up so uh you know
years ago when the iphone four before
the iphone 4s released there was this
phone floating around we publish the
pictures when we were at engadget we
publish the photos of it the next day it
gives moto have gotten the device I
can't believe I'm telling this story but
it's interesting because they showed a
quote from them and they ran a huge
story a huge feature on this thing and
it turned out that this phone had been
lost in a bar I can't believe I'm
telling this story phone up in life if
you don't know how the why are you
watching
the phone had been lost in a bar in
California somebody found it and then
they sold it to gizmodo and and then you
know Apple freaked out there like this
is our device though they didn't say
publicly they contacted gizmodo right
here's here's the post actually land and
they said will you send this back to us
and I think what happened I don't
remember all the details but I think
like basically they were like we'll send
it back gives was like we'll send it
back to you if you send us something
saying this is this is the next iPhone
ce1 confirmation received jobs are
things yeah so they didn't like that no
the next thing that happened is that
basically Apple had police it is insane
now that I think of it Apple had police
kick in the door of Jason Chen who was
the editor of his moto LT wasn't there
he was out they like kicked in his door
and took his computers and stuff right
and arrested him at some point or
something i don't remember he was a
resident I know they inhale and then I
think there was a lawsuit with with
Gawker it was an insane it was an insane
situation was like but the long and
short of it was it ended up gizmodo was
like band and Steve Jobs actually talked
about it he was at it edit all things D
they do their d events and he talked
about on stage with Walt and kara and
was like very clear that he kind of was
hated those guys and was really
personally upset about it and wanted to
blacklist them for as long as there's
Jason Chen showing off the phone and
this by the way when we saw this with
nobody knew for sure we assume that it
was real but you had no way of knowing
it was a radical design it was a crazy
story I mean it's probably one of the
biggest maybe the biggest thing that
gives has ever done I mean until that
hash tag video what you got I'm kind of
crazy it was a great Hellion temper like
that yeah the Timberlake Valon thing but
but anyhow it's really interesting
notable that they quoted them today
that's a big deal that's a big deal for
Apple I mean they don't they tend their
they're out there a company that holds
grudges and also that like that was back
at a time we didn't know what that from
for look like at this point everything
leaks so early can't blacklist every
yeah right exactly uh very interesting
very shocking what was the quote does
anybody know what the quote was I must
well we were wrong yes I think
hyperbolic like mind blown or the best
laptop ever I think it was the best
laptop other macbook air yeah well
that's cool maybe we'll start to see
gives guys at these events again about
time I mean it's been how long I 740 807
yea its to long we didn't kill it sounds
ridiculous I'm holding garage 9 I find
holding grudges is unhealthy to Harper
all that you know get life together let
the go you're an easygoing how many
easygoing guy i'm not a grudge holder
only very specific instances do I hold
grudges you get a really really screw me
over let me ask some talk about Michael
yeah did you expect anything updates of
that other than like a few things to
talk about it awesome left up no I'm not
something they just introduced new
macbook airs I don't think apples in the
habit of saying hey it's three months
ago we deduce immac will guarantee now
here's a new macbook air and when do
they introduce them at the WWDC very
researched Lagos is that right yeah yeah
i mean that's that's sick not even six
months ago right so i think that nothing
was surprising the mac pro updates not
some macbook pro updates not surprising
where we are now dead on notice if this
was the case beforehand but definitely
as of today we're down to only one
non-retina laptop it's just a 13-inch
macbook pro by the 11 inch the 11 inch
winning me not retin a laptop that the
arrows oh the pro the pros yeah yeah
we're down to just 113 that's like the
ipad 2 of their lab it is likely at the
ipod classic a 13-inch macbook what is
it is a hundred our price difference who
would buy who would buy this old 13-inch
the core i5 like the same people who are
saying i'm not gonna spend a hundred
more on my phone even though i use it
all day 42 everything you a disk drives
for a few more years right i mean it
seems crazy to me that they would even
continue selling that thing for a
hundred dollar price difference yeah you
know why don't you say we're getting rid
of the old one I guess they want to sell
out of their old style hey what about
the ipad to give the ipad 2 I don't
understand can we talk about that raise
I please so I bet to did they change the
connector on it no is this the same 30
pin can we just I just want to be doubly
sure i'll double check I do not be sure
so it's a it's the it's two years old
mm-hmm it's the second iPad ok we're on
now the fifth iPad yeah
probably magnitude slower and oh yeah
non-retina non-retina where is it can i
see the text box where the tech specs
this is a class yeah tax back center at
85 chip a five trips the two chicks
behind mm-hmm uh wonder 75,000 absa
course they do now we know that design I
say the connector plates grow up its
cross scroll down over via scroll down
okay what's in the bus dock connector to
USB cable so it's the old 30-pin
connector hmm for how much is it four
hundred dollars for no same prize is
almost promise well I say it's almost
offensive that Apple is still selling
this it is I guarantee you performances
awful with ios7 people I know who have
older devices have updated to iOS 7 my
mother emailed me she has an iphone 4s
and was like so pissed about iOS 7 its
performance on her phone she said
crashes and it's been slow people on
iphone fours people on ipad tues I mean
the performance is not good for iOS 7 so
I feel like it's almost insulting to
people to say spend four hundred dollars
on this heavily on respect old ass
device that does it isn't even
compatible with new accessories right
because in new cables it just seems
crate why even sell it then they just
need to get rid of them there's there's
a jo jeeta discounted they're like 200
bucks that's what they have done is that
we're gonna sell these for two hundred
dollars just get rid of them I mean they
want to get if they want yeah what did
even more people buying apps on the
platform now they're stuck and they're
gonna get next year's I've been if I
mean that is that it no no one's gonna
spend 400 hours on I hear you mean and
then buy another one next year they made
it cheaper they made it cheap yeah like
they still have the ipod classic this is
the device that will never die no I
ipad2 doesn't make any sense like if you
look at though if you look at that if
you look at the lineage of these things
all right why not just say we're getting
rid of the ipad to our new low end is
the ipad is he knows the ipad mini yeah
you know what take that take the ipad
for and price it down the problem is
there's not enough differentiation
between the ipad 4 and the ipad air the
truth is like the screen resolution is
the same the processor is
faster in the new one but probably not
you know noticeably faster between those
two devices you know the body type is
different people don't really care about
that had lightning connector so I feel
like what's going to actually happen is
they needed to draw a big line somewhere
instead of value perspective 499 for the
air vs 3 99 for the two which is years
old is just really does all know it's
good it's so disproportionate it's
insane and I think that I think that you
know it's confusing to me but I know
maybe Apple has a reason somebody
suggested on Twitter that this is an
educational government education pricing
but I don't see why you couldn't do the
same thing I mean he'll you could take
the ipad 3 design and do the same thing
right you know it it'd be more
compatible and faster I mean or the ipad
4 I mean there's no way update the cable
I mean they were selling the ipad 4 for
a base price of 499 up until today right
right now the air replaces it so
presumably they've been making that
design and have a bunch of them sitting
in a warehouse somewhere had if I'm
sitting a warehouse somewhere and you
don't have these sylvans on the ipad 2
or they just have so much support no I
think they're still making them you know
uh it does it does kind of create some
pricing pressure though yeah you know
yeah what happened all at the ipad 3
your where all the ipad 3 diabetic the
lost Renata's with anything they they
updated the ipad 3 early right he didn't
take a beer it was what six months to
something like that you only wanted make
it in it you're the worst soccer ever he
bought the three and then they gave her
the x and they give the lightning yeah
yeah miss Kean wessling was not even a
year yeah I'm it was unfortunate as a
third the ipad to type antigen was a big
leap it was the retina really it was a
cold and then they just changed little
little dock connector yeah it was a cold
no cover we want I wanted to cover I
wanted something yeah so now we have
hands-on with these devices I just want
to talk about what's going on if you're
not looking at the site verge calm which
you should be don't be insane we have
hands on posts with the ipad mini with
retina display the new ipad air and do
if we done the laptops yet we doesn't
we've done the laptops yet no though the
laptops are not going to be I mean their
laptops running Mavericks this is
interesting though t-mobile is offering
new iPad users 200 megabytes of free
monthly data he was doing anything you
can't like get people onto its network
spend a lot of big plays this is a
interesting incentive for people right
well t-mobile is looking to incentivize
people I guess there is a market so me
just mention on Twitter there's a big
market for 30 pin accessories maybe that
explains some of the ipad to longevity
someone else mentioned education market
so buying a lot of people a lot of bulk
orders of ipad 2 yeah 307 nine dollars
people k through 12 yeah what should be
i still you know it doesn't seem that
compelling to me now listen what the mac
pro a little bit yeah let's do that so i
thought there would be a really thought
there was going to be a final cut update
I've been hearing rumors that they need
to roll back some of that stuff
filmmakers and everything yeah it's
almost like maybe they just couldn't get
it I feel like it just didn't yeah
Justin Hammer for some reason they
definitely we're leaning into that uh
but Mac Pro what's your take on it I'm
honestly that is almost peripheral that
I think it's a great piece of hardware
I'm kind of surprised they're not giving
it a great display to go with it yeah it
is surprising like a really cool black
display right like where's the awesome
you know they made it a crazy same
design kind of display like a little bit
more rounded or something that is you
know crazy high resolution and what is
though where's the resolution of the
current 21 or 27 inch imac I think it's
just above 1080p let's say no it's it's
great it's really high is it it's
something we're stupid and it'll be a
good idea but I mean like if they're
like they're boasting that you know
we're not run saw the top arena for K
displays but the thing is insane makeup
Samsung's gonna make them right and
they're each gonna cost you another few
thousand well they don't Apple obviously
doesn't make a 4k display if Neil I will
learn i also got rid of the hard drive
is no more no more fusion drives or what
have you oh yeah right they called a
clash oh so they got the fusion drives
are out well i thought i said sure is
that true just sure about that was
fusion just a stopgap till they could
get cheaper flash- kind of seems like it
they made it out to be like a
breakthrough mmm between you flash and
you know you can do the stuff that you
need right now right on flash and the
rest there's also a new version of iOS 7
now today yeah madam Rose 256
flash-based storage yeah well they want
people to go to external storage their
whole deal is external storage I'm
looking right you got Thunderbolt 2
which you can expand it with yeah I mean
that's the idea you know look it's hard
for me to get excited about the mac pro
I know that people have been people who
use mac pro's been clamoring for a new
version I just wonder if this one is
really serving their purposes if they
really feel like this is what they've
been waiting for so the display is 2560
x 1440 right the 27-inch and that's also
for the cinema display that came out
September 2010 rights people show so you
know that's obviously extremely high res
hmm but also big 27 inch monitor just
just above it today p yeah but well I
mean it's noticeably above it no save of
like so I feel like going really hot i
mean i think doing a 4k displays clearly
within their reach they just didn't want
to do it for some reason mm-hmm you know
so we are at some point going to speak
to David peers and appears he's rattling
of the hands on he's doing some hands-on
work right now we're going to talk to
him I gotta say it like I'm kind of
stunted not stunned but I guess a little
disappointed that there wasn't any
there's nothing meat-eor to really to
discuss here you know it it's uh you
know there was Grabbe the software was
the focus to me where there's a hardware
Mavericks I was which we are assured
everything about yeah let me still focus
a lot on my Mavericks demo they all they
always do this but the but the price
point is really notable free any was 29
I think last year 2029 left date the
last version right now it's free I mean
again this is apple's game right right
they want people to use the software
they don't really make money off of
updating their OS that's not where you
remember when iOS costs money to update
on your ipod touch or what have you oh
my god was right oh they had the thing
wears away at all yeah what it was why
you want you want my ten dollars I never
wrote that was also like that was before
the App Store really kind of hit it off
like they get so much money and rep
chair for that like to get people the
latest version of iOS they can now get
the you know 7030 split from app
developers I've had the same thing for
like the Mac App Store net like there
that's a huge thing was last time you
bought a nap outside the app store
frosted on the app guy has almost a week
purify actually do it pretty often being
said i'm there a lot of limitations to
App Store apps that's all there is to it
so we actually have David Pierce live
and direct from San Francisco David are
you with us David David Pierce I here no
there is a very sporty sporty peers
looking company David you've you've wow
that is still docket he's only on David
you've handled you've handled pronto
today tell us tell us your experience
tell us how you feel about the new stuff
i mean i think the the ipad air is is
pretty remarkable I mean it's exactly
what we thought it was going to be but
it's it's so much smaller it's so much
lighter it's it's big I mean it's really
it's hilarious how much it's just a
slightly bigger ipad mini newest i'm
like that's a good thing is saying
really light it's really nice and just
feels really good in a way that but it's
the old I matically feels like you know
well put together as the ipad mini and
now it does like but again it's you know
I've been hearing some of your
conversation it's it's exactly what we
thought it would be it's really obvious
it's sort of a normal move a lot of the
pricing things they did here make
absolutely no sense to me yeah the
screen on the ipad mini looks amazing
and i think in a lot of ways what's
really sort of weird about today is that
the ipad mini is in almost every way a
more compelling device now than the ipad
air is it it's I'm just I'm sort of
confused by everything I saw today but
both of the iPads feel really nice
that's I can say at least that much yeah
i mean look there's no question that
Apple has every with each iteration made
a more beautiful device battery life is
is it the same on the air what is there
what is their number now for the air
compared to the ipad 4 do you know yeah
it's 10 hours in both cases they showed
it was funny they show the exact same
slide the exact same like he's described
the exact same way the they're the same
as each other and they're the same
they've always been it's just kind of
the same did you have a chance while
you've been there to play around with
any of the iwork updates or any of the
collaboration have you had a chance to
look at that more in depth yeah i have
only only briefly but one it which is
just a wonderful thing about iOS 7 as
the icons are mostly just really ugly
but the apps themselves are wonderful
the iMovie app is super simple and
really well put together I even was
using it on the mini which before has
been kind of slow and not quite there
but it's really visual it's really
pretty now and there's this great they
were just like flipping around a picture
in picture and she was adding a bunch of
different timelines all to the same
video and it's really simple and works
really really well I was actually really
impressed in keynote you know keynote is
keynote there's new animations and stuff
but it's still sort of the same
presentation tool as always all the apps
are really nice and well put together
but they were so much the focus of this
event that was it was really surprising
that they you know they spent longer
demoing GarageBand than they did doing
any kind of meaningful demos with any of
the new hardware and it was clearly a
recap of a lot of things that talked
about before a lot of things are they're
really nice like Mavericks adding an
extra hour of battery life to your
existing pc is a great thing like good
job APPL that's a smart way to do it but
to spend all this time on software and
then kind of get to the iPad call it
something new I was sure they were
building towards something called the
ipad pro that was a meaningfully
different and better and more expensive
in some way and then it just kind of
ended but haven't they haven't they
opened the window for an iPad pro here
haven't they set a kind of precedent
with the naming convention do you think
that this is in the cards now does it
feel like an iPad pro make sense i mean
how much more pro can an ipad get after
the after the air i mean it's really
good question of screen size right
because they mean until they have a new
processor unless I'm missing something
yeah I mean I it's a fair question I
mean we were talking to some of the
Apple people in as you're waiting in
line to get in this morning and we were
talking about you know the rumors and
stuff and were like oh so the big iPads
coming and one of the leading they
really just listened the big iPad we
already have that it's called the
macbook air and so like this is this is
not a thing that they're either you know
they're either doing the classic
misdirection thing which is possible and
given the fact that they changed the
name like why would you change the name
from ipad 2 ipad air if you're not going
to add something else to this lineup it
just doesn't make any sense but they
also they spent a lot of time like with
the sly surface burns talking about how
bad microsoft is and they had that
hilarious graphic where there's all the
lines intertwined where they were like
nobody else knows what they're doing and
we're really terrific so I don't know
it's it's this weird they're saying
everybody else is doing it wrong but
then there's this big sort of obvious
gaping hole now where that kind of
product would live so I don't know it's
gonna be interesting yeah alright well
look I know that you have you have to
get back to work I think that you've got
several thousand more hands-on videos
that you're going to participate in
before the day is out David thank you
for taking the time I'm sure you're very
tired you guys got up at like five in
the morning or something I'm sure you're
very tired thanks for taking the time
and we'll see you back in New York very
soon another interesting point is that
the ipad mini and the ipad air's the two
iPads are now on parity in terms of
what's inside finally it's specs and
design too because we have it's like
there's this convergence I feel that's
like it's clear that they see the the
and I'm sure that they have data that
makes sense that this is how it needs to
be but they see the mini and the air now
that iPads as separate their separate
use cases separate users there right
well think which seems weird to me but
indeed um cuz like they actually show
that it made a big point we saw it a
second ago in the b-roll that a there's
a guy holding the ipad air with one hand
which is writing never showed with the
old line right couldn't do it I don't
know whether the message is here's your
one hand here's your pointing to a
friend and showing them your work that
you're doing the difference
it's just sighs no but that's what I'm
saying but its size but it also seems
like they're saying look we have strata
here we've got ipad mini cheap I've had
many expensive ipad air well they don't
have a tree by better than we've got
ipad air is it just i mean the the mini
retina and the error at parity in terms
of specs so you don't think those are
seen as separate tracks like hey there's
me people want the small screen people
who want the large screen we're making a
set of products are way more confusing
now for people i think it's it's purple
saying their convergence is a downsize
the body of the you know 9.7 at 7.9 it's
they're not wildly odd in terms of size
so and they look as similar as they've
ever looked now that the bezel has been
trimmed on the sides which means they're
they're saying okay we like this in
portrait mode you can hold it
horizontally with those you know bars on
the side but I think the way I've been
thinking about it is that it's like
having a legal pad and like having a
moleskine different people like
different things different people like
to read you know different ways
different people like to take notes
different ways so I think they're just
trying to fill both of those needs at
least for now while people are still
buying both of them yeah I think so i
think that we're about ready to wrap
yours or anything that we have not
thoroughly dissected know i'ma shirts
the untucked shirts we haven't talked
about that we thought about a lot we did
talk a lot about Jerry the three the law
shirts or any deal for us I get it maybe
I'm just nitpicking but I I really you
are close attention to these
presentations and I heard more stutters
and little word miscues today than I've
ever heard no I really did I do hear
that he had a lot of enough this
stalking someone is stuttering right now
you know they had a lot of like pre
recorded footage more than I've seen
them happy for you had a lot of pre
recorded footage and frankly like you
know this was not an energetic event no
it was very mellow I mean all of their
events lately are very mellow you know
there is the showmanship of Steve Jobs
we got hooked on it we're used to it we
still even though we know it's not going
to be there we kind of expect it from an
apple event when the spectacle starts
ratcheting up
these guys are all fine on stage they're
all good at their jobs you know they're
all capable smart dudes and they're
still a tier above and the other company
oh I'm actually you know people have
gotten better they've learned you know
Samsung still hasn't learned but most
companies have taken cues and they don't
put they don't put the really
embarrassing guys out on stage they
didn't put teens on stage which was good
they didn't yeah there's no chance but
but but it's still you know you kind of
ratchet up for that excitement and it's
just not there this is a very low-key
very mellow event these are incremental
product updates and you know it just
seems like until they enter that new
product category they're gonna feel like
this and that maybe early next year you
know that may happen very soon it could
be some weird imitation fun like watch
what happens or someone that yeah i
think when we go back to the title for a
second i guess what upsets me the most
we kept getting super excited by that
whatever pun could be you know still a
lot to cover in fact there was no pun it
was just she'll have to talk about it
was a very boring non pun announcement
yeah we've got a lot to cover anyhow
here to post about all the puns in their
meeting we were hoping we did well I
mean they've been they've been teasing
set for 10 years in these invitations
they've got something have been really
cryptic they never has been just just
whatever ok so I think we need to wrap
up that is the verge live at Apple it is
