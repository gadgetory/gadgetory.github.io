didn't know if people really knew about
the fire if they were aware of this mean
you guys know because you're super smart
and handsome but but regular humans and
so we actually went to because you're
super humans obviously but we actually
went to Union Square and ask people if
they were gonna get the fire if they
knew of it and and we got some pretty
interesting responses so check out this
clip use me would you guys like to
answer some questions about gadgets no
okay people are kind of reluctant to
talk about tablets very sensitive
subject if the truth is a very personal
decision and a lot of people don't want
to talk about it on camera it's
understandable excuse me would you I
talk to you for a second about gadgets
No are you a tablet owner do you have
one now I have an iPad yeah would you
consider getting the kindle fire if i
didn't have an ipad no i'm looking at
getting one of the Samsung Galaxy Tabs
the hoping for the 7.7 I actually am
possibly in the market after considering
that I did not want an ipad I feel Apple
is a little too complex I'm oh you're
really cana your Microsoft man no we're
just even hearing people of the asking
about the kiddo I thought you could give
me an upgrade how about you kindle fire
you know what it is this is the first
time I've ever I've ever heard of
it Apple's the only thing I really know
like that yeah really you know we have a
person here hates Apple do you guys want
to talk about this at all do you know
what the kindle fire is i dunno to
kindle is but i didn't know the addition
of the fire are you thinking about
getting a tablet i want to yeah you have
a budget for that well graduation
present right hey mom and dad you know
okay what's your name T rain t raise
that's your act God giving it really
yeah t rave do you know what the kindle
fire is yes okay are you getting one ah
maybe it's very intriguing you don't
have a tablet right now i have a barnes
&amp;amp; noble nook okay you're not happy with
the new color well I hacked it I had fun
with it now it's time to pack what did
you do how do i put just another android
rom on and what rom uh miui i'm really
bad with technology really what about
gifts for friends or family any interest
that thing is it seems like a really
good idea but if I can't use it I feel
bad giving it to someone else because
maybe they can't use it right so you're
just gonna stick with traditional gifts
like wood yeah yeah that kind of thing
okay what's your name Simon do you know
Simon do you know what the kindle fire
is yes I've heard of it would you
consider buying me a kindle fire this
holiday season you would yes that is
awesome joy you're my new favorite
person in entire wrong well there you

I like my favorite guys t raves no I
catch T rave that's its name is it t
underscore rave d dash raves he tweeted
I he tweeted at me after that he's
totally plugged in once you hit the deer
avison but what was crazy about this was
so not only do people know the fire but
they're like talking about android
tablets more than one person was like I
think about getting an android tablet
which to me suggests a shift a seismic
shift in the market it's all over for
Apple what they're finished</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
