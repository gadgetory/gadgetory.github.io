alt GDC an exhibit that shows all sorts
of different ways to control video games
I'm looking at one of the coolest things
I've mounts online wobbler my Robin
Baumgartner just a one dimensional
dungeon crawler the way it works use
this shoe more shoe train your control
in your green finger and you attack bad
guys and eventually make your way to the
end of a sting they're all 12 different
stages and I died if I'm not good at
video games I'm going to have enemies
like this one of them have lava their
boss battles it's a complete pain it is
being played out on a single strip of an
LED lights it's exciting to see things
like this usually when you come to big
video game conferences to see a lot of
the call of duties or maybe even smaller
mobile games that are you know
simulations but rarely you're gonna see
a strips of LED lights tied to a
cardboard clone and say it's one of the
most enjoyable things to be played all
week so hopefully someday there'll be
away from more people to try this out
until then you can just stare at me play
on the video because i'll be tweeting us
for the next 15 minutes</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
