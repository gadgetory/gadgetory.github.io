you think it's an instrument now I know
it sounds weird but think about it when
you go out to buy a new phone you're
like I really wish you took better
pictures and so you go get a thing that
solves that problem better than the
thing you had before but what if that's
all wrong you're thinking of your phone
like this thing like a hammer but what
if it's not like that what if it's more
like missing an instrument I've been
obsessed with phones for like 20 years
actually Oh God twenty-two years my
first phone was a mountain dew extreme
Network pager when I was in high school
okay
okay anyway I've been obsessed with
phones for twenty years I've been
writing about them for like 15 years and
in that time I have learned a lot about
phone specs the Snapdragon processor and
Mei it's all that and color gamut and
blob a lot of love I do believe that
specs matter but I also think that we
probably spend way too much time arguing
about them specs make your phone a
better tool if you've got I don't know a
better camera it's going to take better
photos but deal with a tool is you use
it to solve a task and then you put it
away and then you get a different tool
to solve another task so the best hammer
in the world isn't going to help you cut
down a tree just like the best most
beautiful screen in the world isn't
going to help you if you drop your phone
you might need a different tool for that
so what you want to do when you're
picking out a phone or any technology is
don't think of it as just a single thing
to solve a problem think it was
something that you kind of need to have
a relationship with look the tool thing
it's not a very good metaphor but I
think there's a better metaphor one that
can help you have a actually good
relationship with your phone and hell
with most tech and that metaphor is one
I said earlier think of your phone as a
musical instrument I think the first
thing that happens when you think about
your phone as an instrument is that you
tend to care about it more the way that
a musician cares about their instrument
it's not some foreign thing to you
that's like being inflicted upon you
it's actually something that you
participate in that you actually enjoy
using the first time you pick
any musical instrument you suck at it I
mean you are deeply deeply bad at
playing that thing and you know what the
same is true with phones you have to
learn how to use it and you can get
better with it over time so if it feels
awkward and annoying to you you can just
practice with it the other thing about
instruments is you have to keep them in
tune they don't just work all the time
without a little bit of care and
maintenance look at your storage if the
thing seems slow maybe it's full look at
your battery and we've learned with the
iPhones that if the battery is kind of
old and crappy the phone's gonna slow
down I hate to say it but Android apps
tend to have more crappy little
tentacles that sneak out into the rest
of the OS and getting rid of the weird
crappy games that you downloaded this
you maybe don't need just periodically
cleaning stuff up can really help keep
the thing running fast the other thing
we can go back to what I was saying
earlier about specs if you think of your
phone as an instrument then specs sort
of like I don't know it's weird is there
such a thing as the best guitar there's
lots of different kinds and they make
different kinds of music so why should
you be worried about necessarily having
the quote-unquote best phone the truth
is that there's really no such thing now
if you're anything like me you're
probably thinking you know this metaphor
isn't that great it's kind of broken
down actually yeah that's that's what
metaphors do they they break down words
have got a wide array of meaning so I
don't know instruments can be used to
just measure things and tools can be
used to make beautiful amazing art are
you gonna use your phone to just consume
junk just endlessly scroll Twitter and
feel bad about what your friends are
doing on Instagram
would you sit and listen to really
crappy music that you hate know what you
do on your phone should make you feel
good or if it's a work stuff it should
make you feel productive and here's
maybe the most important point if you
really think about your phone as an
extension of your mind then the things
you do on your phone are an extension of
what you are and who you are the
technology doesn't absolve you from your
actions so if you're using your phone to
leave hateful comments or say hateful
things or just generally be terrible on
the Internet
that's you doing it it's not some
separate thing you should use your phone
to improve humanity not make it worse in
the same way that a musician doesn't
pick up a guitar to like make you feel
like crap they do it to make music that
makes people feel good the metaphor of
an instrument is more useful because it
makes you feel differently about the
phone you should think differently about
it or more importantly you should have a
different attitude when you're using
your phone as long as we're talking
about metaphors and words and whatever
here's one for you the phone it comes
from the Greek for voice and it's for
communicating with other people but more
than other people it's for communicating
with culture so when you play a game on
your phone it's an instrument for
experiencing a new kind of art and when
you take a selfie with your phone it's
an instrument for putting a picture of
yourself out in the world phones are
pieces of culture that also create
culture if you treat your phone like a
tool like a hammer you're just going to
pound nails with it you're going to
dehumanize the person on the other end
of the phone but if you treat it like an
instrument you're going to recognize
that it creates culture that it has a
place in our culture and so do you
because that's what instruments do and
I'm really curious you know this is my
metaphor but maybe you have a better
idea of how we should think about these
phones so that they feel better in our
lives please let me know down in the
comments and we'll have a chat</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
