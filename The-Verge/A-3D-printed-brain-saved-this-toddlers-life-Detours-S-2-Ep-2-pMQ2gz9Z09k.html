for decades diagnosis and surgical plans
have been made based on 2d x-rays and
MRI scans requiring doctors to rely on
instinct during surgical procedures when
18 month old Gabriel started having
hundreds of micro seizures called mind
erasers everyday surgeons at Boston
Children's Hospital piloted a
revolutionary technique to save his
brain Gabriel is 18 months old and he
was born in January 28th of 2013 and he
had a major stroke at birth and actually
almost died in Boston Children's
Hospital saved him and about five months
later he developed these horrible
seizures called infantile spasms they
call them mind erasers actually because
many children who end up with these
spasms forget everything that they've
already learned the scariest part about
it was that we were warned that he could
maybe forget us so every day we would go
into his crib and be like please don't
let this be the day that he forgets who
we are we had talked to many people here
at the hospital and it was decided that
he needed to have something called a
hemispherectomy so hemispherectomy is
probably the most challenging operation
and it's used in fairly rare cases where
one whole half of the brain is not
working well but it's causing seizures
and involves actually disconnecting one
whole half of the brain from the rest of
the brain and from everything on the
other side what's really made a big
difference is being able to actually get
a model of the brain that we can
practice the surgery on
we're doing the surgery I'll never
forget when he said you know we're gonna
do something with your son that we've
never done with anybody before and I was
like what and he said we have this 3d
printing machine and I can make an
actual replica of his brain before the
surgery 3d printing has been used to
make guns dresses cars and prosthetics
but using new 3d technology bch can
simulate the conditions of even the most
difficult of surgeries this technology
allows them to take CT and MRI scans of
a patient's brain and turn them into 3d
printed models which surgeons can
practice on before going into the
operating room so I was actually able to
perform this operation in its entirety
on this child the night before surgery
and actually show it to the parents and
say this is what we're going to be doing
it was so amazing to know that the
surgeon was gonna go in and actually do
the surgery on this replica before he
was gonna touch my baby until now
medical simulations have been limited to
simple training exercises like CPR or
intubation
Gabriel surgery marks a breakthrough in
medical simulation nobody wants to be
the first person to get a
hemispherectomy from a particular
surgeon ever really so why would you
ever want to have your first operation
be on a real patient and I think that's
what what we're seeing with with the
simulator movement 3d printing using
simulation offers an opportunity to
cascade knowledge to share knowledge in
a box if there's a surgeon in another
country who is interested in doing a
very particular surgery on a patient on
a child imagine the opportunity to send
the images of that particular patient
have us print those images have our
surgeons iterate the surgery and send
them back essentially a kit that they
can hold in their hands that's a
game-changer being able to actually do a
patient specific operation I think is a
real plus that that I've really enjoyed
having that opportunity
we did the surgery this this boy has
been seizure-free ever since and his
parents are just absolutely thrilled and
they're really wonderful people all
three of them he's doing great he's
starting to hit all these milestones
that he missed he doesn't have to have
these seizures take his life away I hope
every hospital in the world ends up with
this kind of technology because it is
such a godsend I thank God for this
place every day</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
