and on this show we bring you the best
in consumer electronics past present and
future this week we're talking all about
the facebook phone their phones I guess
lots of phones after years of rumors
Facebook's throwing its hat in the
Android ring in a big big way Facebook
home is more or less a total takeover of
the platform CEO Mark Zuckerberg called
it a people first approach there's no
chrome no nav just content the lock
screen now displays your friends photos
and updates messaging is literally
everywhere and your friends pop-up is
so-called chat heads facebook home is
launching this week for a handful of
high-end HTC and Samsung devices
including the upcoming Galaxy s4 but HTC
is also releasing a standalone facebook
phone called the first it's available
this week for ninety nine dollars from
AT&amp;amp;T you spend some quality time with
the device and you know what so bad the
HTC first is an anomaly really for a
whole variety of reasons for one thing
it's not gigantic with a 4.3 inch screen
and a thin rounded body it's actually
usable in one hand and in a market where
six inch phones are a thing that's
pretty rare it's a nice size and a nice
weight though it doesn't really feel
like a premium device we've been using
the HTC One for a while now and compared
to its gorgeous metal body the first
Matt polycarbonate back feels like
something you might get off a shelf at
Toys R Us it's perfectly well made but
from the moment you pick it up it's
clear why the first is ninety nine
dollars and not a high-end device like
the one or the iphone five it actually
looks like the love child of the iphone
3gs and HTC's last flagship phone the
One X it's good not spectacular but for
a mid-range phone especially there's a
lot to like here the first 4.3 inch 720p
display is crisp and bright though it
can get pretty hard to see outdoors and
it has good colors and great viewing
angles and we can't say this enough it's
exactly the right size where you do lose
something with the first is its camera
it's a 5 megapixel sensor and even
though megapixels aren't everything the
shooter leaves a lot to be desired it
takes okay pictures and great lighting
but even then has some noise and over
processing in low light you might as
well not even try we've heard rumors
that HCC is working on a phone like the
first using the ones ultrapixel camera
and we're hoping they're true that's a
much better proposition the first
general performance isn't perfect either
it's definitely a beat slower than some
high-end phone
so it works fine for most normal tasks
battery life is well mid-range below the
screen are the first hints that this
isn't like any other Android phone there
are three menu buttons yeah but they
don't look quite like you'd expect
there's a left pointing arrow a circle
and a horizontal line that's because
though this phone does run Android 4.1
point2 if you're counting you'd never
know this is a facebook phone with
Facebook's new home software layered
over top of Google's operating system it
takes over the home screen the
lockscreen your messaging and constantly
reminds you of Facebook's presence in
your life the appeal of Facebook home is
entirely dependent on how you use
Facebook because it completely changes
how you use your phone turning an
Android device from a curated list of
apps widgets and backgrounds into
essentially a picture frame showing what
your friends are up to if you have
pretty friends who take pretty pictures
and say witty things all the time you're
golden but are you still friends with
your ex on facebook or do you have a
bunch of friends who think blurry photos
are the best photos if so you're in for
kind of a weird experience facebook
wants to be front and center on your
phone but do you want facebook front and
center on your phone whether you do or
not the first is a great phone it's a
good size it has LTE and even though its
performance isn't perfect it's solid and
for ninety-nine dollars this is a pretty
good buy on AT&amp;amp;T facebook home on the
other hand is coming April twelfth for a
couple of high-end HTC and Samsung
phones as well as on the first luckily
it's free and it's easy to uninstall if
you hate it but frankly we're not
convinced that it deserves such a big
place on your phone not yet anyway
Facebook may have some interesting cards
up its sleeves joining me now to talk
more about all this is our own ellis
hamburger you were in California last
week and was late with this thing so
what I really want to know is why why
now why is Facebook doing this
particular thing and why are they doing
it right now so this is basically a
Facebook's baby for the last year
happens to run on this HTC phone but
Facebook home is the product of
everything Facebook's been working on
but was saying the company around mobile
everything's mobile first now every team
has a mobile component and this
represents the best of that because II
do you buy that like his Facebook really
a mobile first company now because
they've gotten crap for that for years
for everybody saying you know their
mobile products were terrible like do
you believe that there really a mobile
company now yeah I mean starting last
summer when they start rolling out the
native iphone app for the first time I
think that was a pretty clear indicator
that they're focused on delivering the
best experience
mobile that they can and they need to
because for the first time last quarter
mobile monthly active users on mobile or
higher than on desktop yeah they said
what was it twenty three percent of your
time on your phone is spent on facebook
yep they has insane really this is just
a manifestation of that like Google
they're all about data so when they see
data like that they're like okay let's
make Facebook bigger on your phone let's
put it right on top of Android so you
can't possibly miss it will show it show
me a little bit here they did this in
two pieces right and so the biggest
thing is like these weird pictures of
people i barely know that are all over
my phone yeah so facebook's biggest
product is newsfeed and here it is right
on top of your phone you turn it on and
newsfeed is right there you can't miss
it so you can scroll through your
newsfeed items you can double tap to
like something like an Instagram you can
tap and hold to blow this out and then
you also have this call to chat heads
which is basically your SMS is and your
facebook messages all inside of one
screen and this actually stays right
where it is unless you move it and even
if you're inside of another app so
that's kind of making a big statement
right there so yeah I mean I guess the
idea is base no matter where you go I
can't avoid facebook anymore right and
so newsfeed messenger their two biggest
products right now they're both huge
focuses on mobile and well so it's like
a focal point since I get that news feed
is huge that's like the stick of
Facebook it has been forever but his
messenger really that important to
Facebook they've been you know tweaking
it forever but it doesn't seem like it's
really huge is this a thing for them now
I think at some point maybe when
whatsapp hit 150 million users that they
realized okay people especially teens
are starting to text a ton just on their
phones they are sending pictures videos
voice memos what have you so instead of
like poke they're like oh wait maybe
people don't want snapchat they just
want like the other stuff that it does
and that's right it's personal person
messaging and that's an area of Facebook
that's always been a little bit lacking
and they've really been tuning it up a
ton over the last year and if you look
at it it's very fast it's multi-platform
it's instantaneous and it's synced
across everything and in facebook home
and a messenger the newest version you
just can't miss it so and this will work
even on the messenger peace will work
even on phones that don't get home
this is like the new way you message
yeah Chad heads is really big for
facebook I mean it's kind of like your
friends faces are always there and it's
not immediately apparent whether you're
texting them or your Facebook messaging
them kind of like with I message which
is a good play for them because as long
as you're getting in touch with your
friend that's the goal right right like
that that's the dream right is like I
need to get in touch with you I don't
necessarily care how i do it i just want
you to know that i'm trying to get in
touch with you right and there's also
group messages you can take somebody you
can throw them off screen and you can
even rearrange these and these are meant
to kind of stay with you as your let's
say you're looking at a map or something
like that you're saying oh hey Ross
here's where I am rappe out pop back in
it isolates your messages from all the
notifications which is great I mean it's
brave right it's like all your other
notifications are still in the in the
Android notification slider but just
messages are here and that's kind of
them saying this is top priority right
well so that's kind of the weird thing
for me is that it seems like good
Facebook is doing now is almost you know
trying to obviate all of these other
Google services right so instead of
having your SMS messages and gmail and
facebook or whatever they're all sort of
in Facebook's realm even when it's a
text message yeah fair so there it seems
like they're trying to like encroach on
Google's territory with Android here is
that that where this goes next like
there's their promise monthly updates
they've said that they have a lot more
features and they have a lot more things
they could do they have the voice
calling they have video calling with
skype like are they eventually just
going to take over my entire phone is
that the plan it seems like it I mean
based on what they've done so far Google
doesn't seem to be a very big barrier if
anything they've said Android is making
this pretty easy for us it was funny
sucks we got up there he was like thanks
google for letting us do whatever we
want I mean they didn't need to fork
Android and slow it down like Amazon did
they basically created a launcher and
the lock screen combined with your home
screen and it's kind of the whole
package they spent a long time re
architecting all these physics to make
them feel a lot smoother they kind of
had to dig dig into the Android source
code to do that and i think it was it
was fruitful and i think it worked and
and it's a really smooth experience that
like kind of lays the groundwork for
what they're going to do next and I mean
nobody's emailing any
more I want to focus on how people are
using Facebook and how people are
communicating in general so what do you
think is next is it is it going to be
voice calling is my phone app going to
be replaced by just dial Ellis with
Facebook you know I think if that person
is online and they have facebook
messenger installed in their phone
that's going to be the default and I
guess why not I feel like that weirds me
out but I guess it's really not that big
an issue and not only that I mean
carriers are so so stubborn about about
you letting you call or video chat over
cellular data you know they don't want
they don't want their minute plans going
away ever right but I mean that's what's
gonna happen yeah but you're connected
to somebody over Wi-Fi it's a lot more
efficient and a lot higher quality right
so just call them that way that does
have an amazed yeah and as of a few as
of a few months ago that's what you got
I mean it's only in a few countries
right now on iOS 9 Android I think it's
only in Canada but free calling over
Facebook is good is going down yeah and
I mean hopefully that's what they do is
make that the default on your phone
whether you like it or not because it's
gonna be a better connection but so you
don't think they're gonna take you know
the natural extension then is build
their own operating system and Tim
Carmody wrote this great piece where you
compare it to Mozilla and Google back in
the day when Google built Google toolbar
and Firefox and it had all these cool
features and they kept doing more and
more and more and eventually were like
well screw this let's just build our own
browser and now they compute with
Mozilla but you don't you don't think
Facebook is gonna do that here they
don't have a ton of expertise really
coding down to the hardware and working
with these manufacturers I mean this is
software running on an HTC phone but I
mean this doesn't this doesn't feel like
the kind of situation where they
necessarily yet at least have the
expertise I mean that's part of the
reason i think that they didn't build a
phone i mean that would have been
monumental enough to work on some
hardware of their own but really what's
the difference right i mean face this
looks like a facebook phone and morning
whenever he spoke phones it look like a
fit and I mean it's one of the first
phones to ship with with Instagram right
on it and you know you can imagine that
any other phones you're sorry any other
apps that Facebook comes out with are
going to be stock on here and that's
kind of like the one app for one purpose
type of mentality and they wanted to
just be your facebook toolbox
and whatever functions they feel like
rolling out they can just add it and
that once a month release cycle but then
what's weird to me about that is they
did make a phone right they was the
weirdest thing of her mark zuckerberg
comes out as needed no mark zuckerberg
comes out and he was like I want to talk
about the facebook phone just kidding we
didn't make a phone and then he comes
back like an hour later is like just
kidding we made a phone right like why
why on earth would you make this whole
play for we want every phone to be a
facebook phone and then build a phone I
don't think this is how it might be
imagined like Google working with
Samsung or Google working with LG on the
Nexus 4 I don't think it's as closely as
that I mean if you look if you look on
the back of this phone there is a
facebook logo right there yeah but I
mean you can go right into your your
apps and in home settings you can turn
it off just like that you can't do that
on other android phones and it's created
as an experience that kind of lives on
top and I think that that's also the
reason so lightweight and maybe that's
easier for them to code for as well yeah
but it seems to me that do you think
people like this phone is ninety nine
dollars right so yeah and it's it's
small and it's fast and it's pretty
light and it seems to be a phone that
people are going to get into so is is
the idea do you think that they sell a
lot of these phones and since most
people sort of don't know what they're
dealing with anyway they just get used
to the idea of having Facebook
everywhere and then they use Facebook a
lot and then they get another phone and
they install facebook on that like is
this the maybe the gateway drug to
making everybody use facebook phones or
like my friend comes over he's like
who's debt weird picture of a girl you
don't know on your friend and then they
go buy or download a facebook app like
what's the I still don't totally get the
play there well I think that it's an
experiment Facebook there anytime you
talk to them they talk about their
hacker culture over and over and over
again they talk about somebody stayed up
all night working on this at hackathon
or it was on the weekend and they built
something or they had an idea and they
pitched it to Zach and he said go you
know and then they went kazusa and they
tried it I mean if you look it just sits
on a throne and he's like yes yeah if
you look at something like poke there
were lessons learned from poke even
though nobody's using it literally no
one yeah and for facebook it's all about
gathering data it's all about
experimentation and even though it seems
like they've kind of been following the
footsteps of some other apps like
snapchat they're doing all this work on
their own to kind of gather data on what
people want so they can make assumptions
based on that and build something and
like that 23% data point about that's
how much people use facebook on their
phone that's why they made it right
there like that bring that's worthy of
an experiment right that brings up a
whole host of other issues right because
the he said what was it a hundred times
a day that you look at your home screen
and it's like the the first thing you
look at the morning and the last thing
at night and it's with you all day and
every time you open the phone there it
is and so now they you know that this
puts Facebook there in all of those
places and I get the appeal of that for
facebook but that brings up all sorts of
possible privacy issues right like this
is this is just running all the time and
it's presumably take it's getting
location data so i can check in it's
prompting me to upload photos it's
prompting me for my status all the time
and a lot of people sort of freaked out
about the privacy issues here some
people i think got kind of out of
control about it like everybody always
gets out of control that everything but
are there like should i be worried about
this is facebook gonna suddenly own my
life is this like Mark Zuckerberg spying
on me if I'm using my phone I don't
think so I mean maybe somewhere down the
line but at least for right now the only
place you're really seeing ads is your
newsfeed and yeah this is with you all
the time it's in your pocket it's
recording your location and it's kind of
hard to tell exactly how Facebook is
going to use that information right now
but I mean as this always the case with
Facebook if you're not buying the
product then you are the product and
that's kind of what you're signing up
for if you get on board you know what it
is a great phone and for people who are
addicted to Facebook as Mark Zuckerberg
said this is the best experience and I
mean if you're not using Facebook very
much you might want to get this phone
because it's a good phone right but
Facebook home is not the market you're
not part of that market that they're
addressing right and if you are part of
the market they're addressing you know
you're kind of on board with that the
whole way you're like you know and I'm
sharing everything on facebook i'm
messaging all my friends on facebook and
I'm okay with that but part of the part
of what Facebook always does is say like
you know I I'm willing to part with all
of my privacy on the stuff that I share
right so I have I'm okay with putting up
pictures and you can sell ads against
all the stuff I put on your site but
then the word here is that it's just
running all the time like it Facebook is
just sort of happening in my pocket all
the time and but you don't think there's
necessarily anything to worry about
there I saw somebody writing about how
like Facebook can now track my location
all the time and part of me is like well
you they could probably do that anyway
right but it is so it's just you know
same old same old and they'll sell me
better ads i guess and never be for like
the place across the street instead of
some like weird Papa John's in New
Jersey that I can't go to anyway yeah I
think that's it and you know maybe some
point down the line they're going to use
that data to create something useful
like alerts for when you're near friends
or when you're near a restaurant you
might like or something like that and
you know you might be into that or you
might think that sounds horrible but I
mean if you're into that you might be
one of the kind of people they're trying
to sell phone too and you know this is a
mid-range bone they devoted a lot of
people to working on this but in the
grand scheme of things if this
experiment fails it's not going to be
the end of Facebook fair so are you are
you gonna buy this phone I don't think
so that's not I mean I really like the
design I like Facebook home you might
use Facebook right you're like a lot of
people think I don't really use face
we're gonna want it but you you use it
I'm in facebook all the time but I'm so
closely tethered to my favorite indie
iphone apps and games I just can't
possibly get on board with this right
now and you know the bummer is that
Android is just a lot more of an open
system than iOS and this I mean this
type of thing is never going to happen
yeah on iphone and chat heads chat heads
chat heads that stay with me no matter
what app I'm in it's not going to happen
on iphone yeah and maybe Apple comes up
with some unique way to say okay maybe
you can elevate some notifications you
really like or that matter the most you
like VIPs maybe they say we're going to
give that a shot but this is never going
to work we my family Mars and yeah you
know if some of my favorite iOS apps
start coming to Android I might be a
convert and this is certainly helping
this is one of the coolest things
Facebook's down in a while and it really
kind of illustrates where Android is far
far ahead of iOS if somebody codes in a
great experience and spends it on a time
making it
fast and work well you know that's going
to be a potential switching point like a
for a lot of people getting us out how
good they are for google mm-hmm well
thank you so much Ellis really
appreciate you coming on thank you for
having you know go look at weird
pictures of all my friends on face oh I
will these are the people I haven't seen
in a thousand years but anyway so the
first is a pretty interesting phone for
a bunch of reasons but there's one in
particular that Facebook doesn't really
talk about and probably doesn't really
want you to know and it's that you can
actually turn off facebook home and
you're left with just a complete pure
clean stock Android experience that
doesn't come along very often especially
on a small phone with LTE and a pretty
nice build quality so it's got a bunch
of people on our staff really excited
including ross miller who may or may not
already have pre-ordered the whole
selection from AT&amp;amp;T the new facebook
home places a heavy emphasis on people
first appt second thing is not exactly a
people person baby picture baby picture
self-portrait engagement photos now the
sunset announced sunrise she really
hates obama but despite all that i'm
still enamored with HTC's first the
so-called facebook phone why because
with a push of a button i can get rid of
facebook home and therein lies the
beauty hidden inside the acc first is a
trojan unicorn stock android with LTE
support like most phones the HTC first
comes set up with a skin over android
bank samsung's touchwiz or HTC sense
unlike those phones facebook home was
incredibly easy turn off the back it's
the first option in home settings
there's no routing or hacking involved
I've now got bone stock Android 4.1
jelly bean
the HTC first is considered a mid-tier
phone at some point all companies made a
pact that high-end Android devices
needed 5-inch strains but I don't I can
use the agency first in one hand and
everything is easy to read I'm sure the
phone is not as gorgeous as HTC is
amazing one but with the mat back it
just feels better also it doesn't do
this the truly devoted Android lover
will probably still want to offer the
nexus 4 and there are many good reasons
to do so it's got the latest version of
Android and it's got a tacit guarantee
from google that whatever version entra
comes up next it's probably gonna get
pretty quickly with the HTC first there
is no guarantee they'll be upgraded at
all but I can live with 4.1 for a couple
of years i've used android in the past
and a perfect set being a virgin or two
behind besides I know won't stop me for
getting the latest apps the other nice
thing it supports AT&amp;amp;T LTE network which
isn't something any next device does
right now that may not matter to
everyone but haven't spent months with
an iphone 5 I just can't go back to
slower speeds yes the camera is so-so
and truth be told that'll be the one
thing I really missed from my iphone but
for Instagram and Twitter it's good
enough I don't need the latest and
greatest and i don't want all the bells
and whistles I don't want a 5 inch
device I need to break from my iphone
and with the HTC first I can't think of
a better option right now and that's our
show thanks to ellis hamburger and ross
miller for being here for lots more on
facebook home and the hcc first
including our full reviews be sure and
check out the verge calm thank you so
much for watching we'll see you next
week
