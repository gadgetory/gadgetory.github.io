maybe it's one of the first tablets I
don't know what you want to call it I'm
Walt Mossberg I have been reviewing tech
gadgets since the early 90s and
collecting them since the 80s and I
wanted to show you some of my collection
it's the trs-80 model 100 which is made
by RadioShack and this was my personal
one you can see I still have my little
name label here it used for double A's
it's what it used according to the label
here I used it at the Wall Street
Journal to cover things because it was
one of the first computers that had a
built-in modem it's a word processor
phone directory and dialer it even
communicates with the office computer
Roger alpha treborj I think it cost
about twelve or thirteen hundred bucks
for each one of these at one time I
remember them saying publicly that their
biggest customer base was journalists
the media computer network is the most
efficient way to inform all the news
media in only a few minutes time the
journal had a lot of money rolling in
dough in those days print was big so
they gave me the budget to buy one of
these for everyone in the bureau you
could send your story to the journal and
then what was on the other end was a
printer that had a modem built into it
and it would print it out because the
editing process was still paper you'll
go far I think this is I mean I honestly
think you could probably draw a line
from this to the iPad of all things
because look it's a single flat surface
it's not a clamshell I've granted it has
a tiny black and white screen nothing
like a retina iPad screen but I think
this in a way Radio Shack at the time
was kind of a power and computing him
and then they went out of the business
but
maybe they would have had the purse you
know tablet everyone wanted to have at
some point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
