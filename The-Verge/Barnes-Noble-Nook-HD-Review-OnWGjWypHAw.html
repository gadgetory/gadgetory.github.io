this is the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble nuke HD plus
it's the larger of the two new tablets
from the company along with the new nuke
HD it's a 9 inch tablet which makes it a
little big for reading which obviously
Barnes and Noble is trying to promote
but it's actually pretty easy to hold
and use it only weighs slightly over a
pound and you can actually hold it in
one hand though it's still a little
awkward trying to get your thumbs all
over the screen it's a little more
normal-looking than the smaller Nook HD
which stands out has a gray matte
rubbery texture all over its body but it
does have one unique feature it's the
cut out circle on the bottom left corner
which is for something it's probably
just a design decision so you can tell
this tablet apart from others but I kind
of found myself wondering what all I
could do with it that weird cutout will
definitely be the first thing you notice
but the second one is gonna be the 9
inch nineteen twenty by twelve eighty
display it's a really good screen it has
really great color reproduction and
great viewing angles having a screen
this sharp is really important on a
device that's designed for reading text
on the Nook HD plus is crisp and clean
no matter how small it is and it really
does help the reading experience
actually the reading experience in
general is really solid on this device
it's smooth and responsive there are a
bunch of ways to customize fonts colors
and line Heights and Barnes &amp;amp; Noble has
a huge library of books and periodicals
available unfortunately that's about the
only good experience on the note HD plus
it's actually really frustrating there
are so many good ideas and cool features
but they're just not well done I love
the idea of nook today which shows you
the weather and it recommends new things
to read and actually offer some really
good stuff Barnes Noble has a great
recommendations engine I also like the
magazine reader and even the catalogue
reader which are high-res and beautiful
and let you rip out and save pages into
a digital scrapbook it's really cool the
UI is even nice the Nook HD Plus is
based on Android 4.0 but it's been
totally redesigned and it really looks
nothing like you'd expect from Android
it's simple and mostly good looking
other than the crazy drop shadows on
some icons but everything is just slow
and laggy and kind of clunky there's a
cool multiple accounts feature that lets
you share your tablet with other people
but it takes a really long time to
switch between accounts like a really
long time and it actually shows the
original account before switching away
from it
that's pretty rough when you're trying
to keep things separate launching apps
takes a while and even dragging down the
notification or Settings window which
seems like a pretty basic thing is
really laggy there's a cool favorites
menu which is always accessible in the
bottom right corner except that it takes
three seconds to open every time and
just becomes really frustrating to use
there's a 1.5 gigahertz TI processor
inside the nuke HD Plus which is plenty
powerful and it plays even really
intensive games just fine after kind of
an interminable loading process games
all work pretty well but it seems like
Barnes &amp;amp; Noble didn't really do anything
to fine tune its own software even
watching movies which look great on the
high-res screen and can actually be
played up to 1080p are hurt a bit by the
weak single speaker on the back though
you can at least fix that with a pair of
headphones the neck HD plus starts at
$269 for 16 gigs of internal storage
though you can get 32 gigs for $299 and
you absolutely showed $30 for more
storage is an easy deal but unless you
want the absolute cheapest tablet you
can find you probably shouldn't buy this
one at least not yet most of the new HD
pluses problems can probably be fixed by
software updates and Barnes &amp;amp; Noble does
seem to be committed to fixing them but
for right now it's just too buggy to be
fun to use the Nexus 10 and the Kindle
Fire HD both have great screens
comparable prices and they offer much
much better performance and that's not
to mention Apple's iPad or especially
the iPad Mini which isn't much more
expensive than the nokey HD plus and it
offers much better performance plus a
much larger app ecosystem than you get
from Barnes &amp;amp; Noble's extra curated set
of Android apps this is a great reading
tablet and it's fine for things like
Netflix and Hulu but if you want to do
more and you should with a tablet there
are much better options out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
