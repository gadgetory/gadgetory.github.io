gonna clip the bow with rekt and we're
here at CES in Las Vegas one thing we've
seen a lot of this year our brand new
wearables but one thing that we've
noticed is that they're not particularly
attractive in a lot of cases which isn't
necessarily a news story but we did find
three that we think look pretty dang
good they do not look like celibacy Dan
let's go check them out
all right so first up is Mira this is a
$169 activity tracker that launched
earlier this year or last year last year
guide which is 2016 9 2016 6 army and
then this one is coming out this year
which is just a new housing for the same
guns basically and what do you think of
it what is your expert opinion okay when
I this I saw this like a couple of
months ago and I really liked it because
it just looks different and like it is
made of like like jewelry like materials
but I love this because the whole thing
is hidden and it really doesn't it
really doesn't look like an absurd
bracelet to be wearing like there's a
lot of times where these companies try
to meld fitness trackers into jewelry or
do like a jewelry closure on a sport
band and it's just something a sense but
this just hides the whole thing this is
definitely a bracelet they don't happen
to have a tracker yeah it doesn't look
weird at all like this does not look
strange on my wrist panel the one thing
that I don't love
is that currently you can share the data
to the mobile apps which is cool so like
if you're wearing something like that
that's where you might see your data but
the mobile app doesn't share with things
like health care and google fit so if
you are also using other health and
fitness apps right now all of your data
is trapped in the mirror a band I don't
know anything about the mirror I have
you seem to like it when you looked at
it yeah well I have it personalized yeah
it asks prompts that weren't just like
what's your height what's your weight
ask you that stuff too but then it asks
you things like how like realistically
how much time you have for activity
today when do you have the most energy
in a day things like that so it just
felt like a little bit more of a
personality lifestyle opener than the
average just like how tall are you how
much do you weigh but yeah this is the
new fossil cue dreamer this actually
came out late last year but these are
new versions of it from what I
understand and it costs one hundred and
forty five dollars so I mean fossils
known for lifestyle watches somewhat
accessible I'm not super expensive right
and what do you think of these
I lost my mind when I saw these yeah I
got so excited because the material
combination is like nothing like nothing
else it does I mean there's I don't know
about you but I've never seen anything
that looks even remotely like this the
leather band feels
nice and I said actually we're another
one for its that like three or four
weeks and the leather got a little bit
dinged up after a while yeah started to
just call her a little bit need to be
really careful about to be on the water
on it you know is that what it is yeah
would you pay one hundred and forty five
dollars for this well I would want to
know more about what it does of course
before I made a choice like that because
I want to know if I like app it's
something I would want to live with but
if I was like satisfied with that I'd be
like yeah sure I mean one of the things
I found in the app it's called a cute
dreamer app it doesn't just work with
this it also works with some of their
smartwatches
there's this section of the app called
cue curiosity where so you've got the
health tracking section and it's like I
usually walk all these steps and then in
the curiosity section it says it gives
you these challenges you know take a
selfie and post a photo and create
something today do origami and all this
crazy stuff and I was in the app and I
was like I'm never going to you and this
is something that like I've noticed for
sure in in apps that are particularly
like if they're kind of like designed
for women they have a lot of this kind
of like motivation that goes beyond just
like today you walked a thousand steps
but it'll have kind of a like great job
today you have 8000 steps
that's 133 more steps than you walked
last Tuesday you're on time you know
there's another glass of wine yeah okay
with your friends in front yeah yeah
yeah then it gives you the trade off or
like like you've been sitting for three
hours you should get up and move because
your mood is gonna be better and then
you'll be happy and it's Monday so this
one's the misfit ray which incidentally
now only by fossil they were acquired by
them last year so just looking fossil
here's another one but this was a
development before the acquisition so
what do you think of this one okay you
wrote about this before I got to see yes
so I looked at it online and I was so
excited so excited which is funny
because as I tell more like technology
people that they're like really it looks
like something you made at camp or like
it looks like a battery on a strep I
love it but I love the one that has the
leather strap the vest there's a mixture
of having like low shine leather with
like medium shine college crafts
together is really beautiful one thing I
also like about this too is at the top
of it is pretty unembellished so you
just have that little LED light at the
top and then the misfit logo is on the
back but it's hidden there's no you know
glaring the obvious logo anywhere yeah
which is actually a signature misfit
thing they make coin shapes wearable
trackers as well and they don't put
anything anywhere on yeah
and I've always been attracted to them
just for that reason because like I I
like like clean lines simple like I
don't want jewels
I don't watch owls I'm a SmartWatch I
don't want you old on things and that's
seems to be the common theme or it's
like how to solve for women put jewels
on it
no no oh my god that's another rant
though but um but this pledge speaks me
because this is like truly truly like
genderless it looks it just looks good
I mean feels like there are still those
trade offs like we're looking at really
nice you know bracelet if you want to
connect a bracelet but the technology is
still
pretty basic in them and then when you
get into more high-powered stuff the
high-powered stuff still isn't really
that attractive so those were three
wearables I was really impressed by I
did not think I was going to come to CES
and really like much of anything
aesthetically but those guys really
really blew me away so like we said
earlier looks matter because you have to
want to wear the device but if you don't
like the way that it works then there's
no point in wearing it but do I need you
here to let me know about the guts of
these things well I definitely need your
fashion sense because I feel like I have
no idea what looks good and what doesn't
I think the biggest thing for me is not
just the looks and not just the feature
set because a lot of feature sets are
the same no it's the software it's not
only do I want to wear this thing but I
also want to open the app every day
I want that experience too and I think
it can be really tough for companies to
get all of those things right some books
maybe we'll see better stuff in 2016 I
don't know for more coverage on CES 2016
