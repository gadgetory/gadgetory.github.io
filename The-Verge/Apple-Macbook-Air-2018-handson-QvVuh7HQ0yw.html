verbs I'm here at Apple's event in
Brooklyn and I am holding the all-new
13.3 inch MacBook Air we've been waiting
for this thing for a very very long time
so I want to get into it see what we got
as you can see the start of the show is
the new fully Retina display it's still
13.3 inches but they shrunk the bezels
down they also made them black glass and
glossy but that means that its overall
footprint is smaller than the last
generation MacBook Airs but it's full
srgb and it has a very high resolution
same as the 13-inch MacBook Pro and you
could also do some other changes it has
this third-generation butterfly keyboard
which means that it's a little bit
quieter than a Mac older MacBook Pros
but it's still pretty slim key travel
but you'll also see right there there is
a touch lady so much that you can login
with your fingerprint and that's great
because it's way more convenient typing
in your passcode or waiting for your
Apple watch to finally connect to it now
in order to make that thing work it
includes this new team ship which makes
everything more secure and also to
controls yes
see and so on but the real process you
care about is the Intel processor it's
an eighth generation Intel processor
the base model here is a core i5 with
eight gigs of RAM and 128 gig SSD and it
costs 1199 now this looks quite a bit
like the generation of MacBook Pros at
UC Merced
but it's nice and tapered along the
sides so you get that classic macbook
air look there is of course a headphone
jack and then over on the other side
your two ports are USB C and Thunderbolt
they both work as Thunderbolt so you're
going to lose MagSafe which is going to
be a bummer for a lot of people but USB
C is a lot more versatile although you
are probably still going to have to deal
with some dock the last thing I will
point out on this thing is the trackpad
it is it's huge it's a giant trackpad
it's it's just really big it's also
using force touch so you can click
anywhere on the trackpad and
we'll look it works really well so that
is it it is the MacBook Air you can go
and pre-order it right now it should be
shipping I think as soon as next week
and again the base model cost 1199 which
is a little bit more than I was hoping
but it's still a pretty decent price for
a MacBook Air that finally finally
finally has modern specs you can also
see that they've added the speakers on
the side just like on the MacBook Pros
and they are supposed to be much louder
than before the new MacBook Air is going
to come into standard macbook colors the
gold the space gray and the gray you'll
also see that it's got this aluminum
finish that are all made of aluminum of
course but it's 100% recycled aluminum
and it weighs 2.75 pounds which actually
isn't that much it's a little bit less
than the old MacBook Air although it is
more than the quality the other Mac
those announced here today was a brand
new Mac Mini it looks exactly the same
as the old Mac Mini but it has all new
modern specs USBC basically everything
you were hoping that they would have put
in that device so for much more on
what's going on here at Apple's event
MacBook Air Mac Mini and the new iPad
pro definitely gave a lot to the verge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
