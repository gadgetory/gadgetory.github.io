are taking a look at the new Motorola
MOTO X style this is the pure edition
that's going to be sold here in the US
it is Motorola's new flagship phone for
2015 if you are looking at it it looks
really really similar to last year's
Moto X and that's not really bad things
last year's Moto X really looked great
it feels similar in the hand as well
you've got a screen that goes all the
way to the edges of the device two front
facing speakers nice metal trim around
it
this particular model that I'm holding
has a leather finish on the back which
is one of the options through the Moto
maker program feels really great looks
great as well but what's new here is the
screen it's much larger it's 5.7 inches
as opposed to 5.2 the resolution has
been upgraded to a qHD resolution so
it's more than the 1080p that we had
last year inside its Qualcomm processor
it's a 3000 milliamp hour battery it's
running a very near stock version of
Android 5.1 which is part of the pure
edition appeal from Motorola they say
that this is the pure Android experience
and then it gets also rapid software
updates on the front up here you've got
a new front facing camera that has an
LED flash there and then around the back
is the new 21 megapixel camera with dual
LED flash motorola is really talking up
this camera a lot because it's when one
of the weak points on the Moto X line
for years so we'll really have to see
how that one compares but really it's a
fast great feeling great looking phone
and what's really great about it is that
it's going to cost starting at 399 for
an unlocked version it works with any of
the major carriers whether you're on
Verizon Sprint AT&amp;amp;T or t-mobile or any
of their MVNOs so you can really use
this phone out anywhere you want and
it's a really great low price
Motorola's going to be selling this
direct through its website through Best
Buy comm through amazon.com in September
and you'll also be able to get it in
Best Buy stores</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
