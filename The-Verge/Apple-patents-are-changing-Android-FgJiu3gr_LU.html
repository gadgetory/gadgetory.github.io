i'm here at Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona now for a lot of years this
show has been about the iphone even
though Apple isn't here all the other
companies here have had to kind of react
to the iphone try to compete with it but
this year there's something different
going on because apples filed so many
patent lawsuits around the world against
basically every company here they've had
to make some real changes to how Android
works we should I'm talking about here's
apple patents 7469 381 it's a scroll
back patent it covers the iphones
distinctive scrolling behavior the key
element is it shows you what's just
behind as you get to the end of the list
Google's been doing something a little
bit differently since gingerbread with a
subtle blue highlight when you get to
the end of the list most other
manufacturers are using the same
technique here's LG's blue highlight
here's Samsung's blue highlight in touch
wins Sony uses a much bolder white
highlight but HTC is doing something
really different and sends four-point-oh
as you get to the end of the list all of
the list elements pull apart that's not
the only change Apple's patents have had
on Android here's apple patents 7 6 5 7
8 49 slide unlock one of the iphones
most distinctive features and maybe one
of the most famous software patents in
the conversation today the key element
here is dragging the image in a
predefined path Google is doing
something a little bit different in
android 4.0 there's no predefined path
from start to finish here HTC doesn't
have a predefined path I can move this
element anywhere I want the screen and
analog with TouchWiz I don't even have
to start in a predefined location LG is
really crazy as you move your finger on
the lock screen and actually shows you
what's underneath but not everyone's
afraid of Apple here's Sony's new Xperia
P which basically has the exact same
behavior is the author well a lot of
these patents definitely seem a little
bit silly but now that these companies
can't copy Apple they're starting to get
created by coming up with new ideas and
new ways of doing things and ultimately
that might be a bigger revolution in the
iPhone itself
