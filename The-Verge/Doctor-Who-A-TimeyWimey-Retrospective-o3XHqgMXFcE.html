return of Doctor Who and the first full
introduction of the twelfth doctor
august twenty-third not coming soon
enough let's see how doctor who got to
this point in the meantime Doctor Who
first aired in 1963 and if you don't
discount the cancellation in 1989 and
the movies in between it's the
longest-running science fiction show
ever at the time of its premiere the
doctor was played by the age of William
Hartnell and over the years the
character has regenerated thus allowing
the producers to recast the titular hero
without having to start the storyline
although each doctor is technically a
reincarnation of the previous one they
each have different looks and
personalities the first was essentially
your time-traveling grandfather the
second was playful and childlike the
third was a smooth-talking scientist the
fourth and the longest-lived of all was
quirky with that wild scarf and so on
and so forth after the Seventh Doctor in
nineteen eighty nine the series went
into hibernation there was an attempt to
reboot in 1996 but that pilot was
released as a one-off television movie
after a 16-year hiatus doctor who is
rebooted in 2005 by Russell T Davies the
creator of careers poke the series
generally referred to as new launched
with the Ninth Doctor played by Krista
reckless teen but echlin only stayed one
season and was promptly replaced by the
tenth doctor david tennant davies period
ran for four seasons and brought back
many of the series most iconic
antagonists including the doctors
one-time friend the master in 2010 Davey
step down and doctor who was passed to
Steven Moffat then widely considered one
of the show's best episode writers where
Davies had tended toward loosely plans
sometimes downright goofy plots Moffat
created extremely intricate season wide
arcs sometimes work Ian plot points from
almost every episode and with a new
showrunner came a new doctor the
eleventh one played by Matt Smith after
the series finale Smith appeared in two
more specials the day of the doctor
premiered last November in honor of the
show's 50th anniversary it featured
appearances from all previous doctors
both living and dead and introduced fans
to the war doctor played by John Hurt
Smith's final appearance as the eleventh
doctor was last year's christmas special
the time of the doctor which ended on
the introduction of the twelfth doctor
played by Peter Capaldi what does the
future hold for the new doctor not even
the time war can tell but at least he
has new kidneys to see
wish I can do kidneys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
