but are you - what is it what are you
five ounce hamburger growing in a lab
from the stem cells what cow will be
served next week in London it's not
natural
no it's called the Frankenberger would
you take a bite of the Frankenberger
Frankenberger the frankenburger what
you'd call it maybe a freaking burger
some cool Franken bogus Frankenberg
frankenburger test-tube freakin burgers
Frankenberger Frankenberger Juli
Banderas would you eat one of these No
good afternoon and welcome to what we
hope will be an historic event this will
be the first time a burger made with
cultured beef has been cooked and tasted
for the past five years one scientist
has led the research in this field
please welcome onto the stage from
Maastricht University in the Netherlands
the professor of physiology mark post I
think most people just don't realize
that the current meat production is at
its maximum so we need to come up with
an alternative there's no question we've
devoted huge amounts of land fertilizer
pesticides energy and water to a
production system that also results in
inhumane conditions for the animals to
be raised in lots of food safety issues
just the other day we saw another recall
of 50,000 pounds of ground beef because
it was contaminated with a strain of
e.coli that's extremely dangerous if you
have a technology that can check all of
those boxes and and begin to eliminate
those problems to me at least it's worth
a look with the real estate market
reeling color companies crumbling and
the overall outlook ominous there is one
juicy exception everything seems to be
failing in America right now yeah except
for the burger which is booming that's
right and it always will boom because
the burger is omnipotent and
irresistible it can never be weakened it
can never be slowed down it can never
stop its
ever-increasing growth in popularity
it's the most single powerful force in
the food universe their current methods
of production today aren't sustainable
looking at the global demand for me they
won't be sustainable when we hit 500
million annual times by 2050 so whether
or not regardless of your stance you
need to look and say this is where we're
starting from where can we go from here
how safe is it if you produce the tissue
and and you end up with the same tissue
as beef there's no reason to assume that
it's going to be unsafe so you can just
start to let people eat it he's right in
that theoretically there's no reason why
it would be unsafe and if we look at
kind of where tissue engineering has
existed so far a lot of it is in these
medical applications where you're you
know you're putting organs into people
or you're you know transplanting their
body parts with these kind of
synthetically produced tissues to
consider doing that as more safe than
consuming I think there's something you
know there's a question to be asked
there that how come is safe to put this
stuff like physically in your body
rather than to ingest it honey you have
eaten taste it
digesting your thoughts what did it
taste like there's quite some intense
taste it's close to meat it's not that
juicy the texture the the the mouthfeel
has
I feel like meat oh yeah I just saw that
you put away the rest of the burger so
what are you gonna do with it can I
please have a small bite I think in
terms of I had to say that at the
beginning you know we've got one small
burger we've got a room full of people
who are desperate to try it I mean
you're asking the world press basically
to report on something that happened
really they can only report on second
hand so would you be willing to give a
tiny little bit one random member of the
audience that would be sort of unfair to
a number of you just to avoid any riots
in the crowd I'll just take care of this
finish you know one of my greatest fear
was that it tasted awful and then it was
gonna provoke a gagging reflex and I was
gonna puke on TV and it was gonna go
viral and then you know for the rest of
my life I'd be known as that guy but I
it would have had a very neutral flavor
and had a familiar buddy I didn't have a
chance to do this today or I just didn't
have the balls to do it but I wanted to
say this is one small bite for man one
giant bite for mankind and I do feel
that way you know I do feel like hey
this is this is you know it's important
to explore a lot of different ways of
dealing with the problems lady in the
black dress with the white necklace I
think a huge part of this story is that
a lot of development has been
philanthropic in the past what do you
think has made it philanthropic rather
than more of a technology push from
industry I think food companies in
general I hope no offense
are kind of conservative are trying to
stay away from really revolutionary
improvements now gradually some
companies start to become interested and
I hope this worldwide emphasis on this
technology may foster it it's
essentially totally open source right
now because it's completely
philanthropically funded Sergey was
funding it a lot of the funding came
from new harvests and its donors all the
publications are online on the new
harvest website anyone can read about
this
maybe that's why it remains the kind of
a startup thing is because individuals
can get on board with this kind of
research I'm thrilled that Sergey Brin
invested in this and it also could help
make this happen people think this is
science fiction it's not real somewhere
out there I actually think that's a good
if what you're doing is not seen by some
people a science fiction that's probably
not transformative enough</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
