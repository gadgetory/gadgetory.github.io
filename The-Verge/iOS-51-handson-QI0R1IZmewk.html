looking at iOS 5.1 which just rolled out
today most of the fixes are pretty minor
it's just little changes in audio
quality and call quality and a couple of
things to improve battery life but there
are a few new features that are actually
pretty cool one is that on the old
version of iOS you actually had to
double tap the home button to get the
camera and then one press on the button
would take you straight to the camera
app now it's always present on the lock
screen every time you turn the phone on
and you slide the camera up to get
straight to the camera app it's just a
little easier and that's cool animation
anyway speaking of the camera Apple
redesigned the iPads camera app it's
even more simple and it was before it's
really fast and has just a few really
basic options but coupled with the brand
new camera on the new iPad which is
usually improved over apples other
tablets it should be a nice upgrade you
can also finally delete a photo from
your photo stream for some reason you
just couldn't do it before but now it's
finally a feature that you actually have
available to you the last big feature in
iOS 5.1 is Japanese language support for
Syria which is going to be rolling out
over the next few weeks but otherwise as
we said it's a fairly minor update but
it's definitely one worth getting it's
available now for any of the recent
iPads iPhones or ipod touches basically
anything over the last couple of years
you should be able to get it and that is
ios 5.1</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
