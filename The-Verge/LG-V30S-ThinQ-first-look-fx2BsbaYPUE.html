difference okay
here at MWC 2018 LG is getting into the
S model game for new phones which means
doing a small iterative change to a
device we've already seen so this right
here is the LG v 30 and this is LG v 30s
if you're not able to support a
difference other than the slightly
different silver color that's because
there isn't any these phones in terms of
hardware identical what we've seen LG do
in reality is issue software updates in
the form of hardware launch with this LG
v 30s technically the company is also
calling the device the LG v 30s thank
you but I think that's such a terrible
name I'm just not gonna repeat it
anymore but what does the LG v 30 years
give us above and beyond the be 30 well
one thing okay fair enough to OG there's
more RAM so it goes for 4 gigs to 6 gigs
you get more storage so the options are
64 gigs I've worded to 128 128 is
upgrade to 256
besides that LG is also giving you a new
function called a I cam this is done in
partnership with I am and they have
taken a hundred million photos put them
into machine learning system and trained
that so that the AI cam functionality
can detect you seen basically and just
said a bit of color profile color
bracketing they call it and make sure
that the settings match the scene that
you're taking a photo of one example
that would you gave is it makes food
look more delicious I don't know what
exactly that entails but that's how she
describes it I think primarily what it's
going to do is make things look a bit
more vivid
maybe contrast a little bit and it might
also help with white balance detection
and exposure detection things like that
LG is also adding a new function to the
camera which is a bright mode is what LG
is calling it and that's actually
combining pixels so it combines four
pixels into one so when you're in really
low light situations you take a 4
megapixel photo which
much brighter than the usual 16
megapixel photo so there the trade-off
is delese resolution but you gave
brightness in extremely low light
situations now the thing with both these
functions the AI cam and the bright mode
photo they're interesting and it might
be compelling for a whole bunch of
people but LG has already promised that
it's going to be issuing those a
software update for the V 30 so in
reality the difference between the V 30
and V 30 s is color it's the ability to
have a bit more RAM so maybe slightly
smoother performance I haven't noticed
it myself
in playing around with the new phone
compared to the old one and more storage
you know one of the things that upset me
when I was reviewing the original V 30
it was actually the quality of the
display with I talked to LG asked them
specifically about display and the
company said that he has not changed at
all so having said that the V 30 s and V
30 very similar that doesn't necessarily
mean that you're going to have a bad
phone with V 30 yes and one of those
really great strengths of the V 30 is
the audio system so these phones do
still have a headphone jack LG is taking
with a headphone jack and the V 30
produced the best audio that I've heard
from any smartphone to date I would have
much preferred to see LG do more here
you have the snapdragon 835 processor
instead of the 845 which is now
available and probably going to be in
the new Galaxy S 9 and some reason
flagship and so on as soon as two
cameras on the back one is telephoto one
is wide-angle I would have liked to see
LG do more to upgrade their improve the
image quality what LG has opted to do is
go the AI route of having automatic
automated scene detection and oh there's
another thing which is called LG's cue
lens which is supposed to allow you to
shop by taking photo or something and
that does visual shopping connected with
Amazon I tried that with V 30 it offered
me I phone as SD auto-detected option I
flipped the phone around I took a photo
of the back of the v30
it started offering me cell phone cases
so that Q lens functionality I omitted
to mention it because I don't really see
this being a particular function with
the moment
I'm not able to show for anything with
it as I say the edge of e30 was already
a pretty decent phone and the LGB 30s is
pretty much a reissue of the same thing
what this does signal though is LG's new
strategy the company's new president for
its mobile division
it's rethinking everything and that's
part of the reason why we're not seeing
the new g-series flagship here at MWC
you could say that V 30 years is kind of
filling the void of not having a new
flagship phone from LG but it also shows
that LG is going to iterate faster it
will have these S models in the future
so its next flagship which might be
coming out in June that might be
succeeded within six months just as the
V 30 was succeeded by this V 30s model
so this is something that I guess we're
just going to have to get used as I'm
gonna show you the same please got this
as I say the LGP 30 was already a pretty
decent phone and the ojv 30 yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
