the hottest new display in tech is wood
this is muy and it's basically an
internet-connected block of wood that
acts as a smart home hub so this is a
movie and this is how you touched awake
and as you can see the interface is
pretty minimalistic and there's five
icons on the screen that represent its
different functionalities so this one
controls or this one shows you the
weather and you can swipe across the
screen to go to the different menus this
one shows what song is playing on your
Spotify unfortunately you can't really
choose from your playlist on the screen
like this it's more just a interface
display that you control through the app
on your phone let's swipe again and you
can see that it connects to the smart
home hub you can control your home
temperature if you have like a smart
thermostat like nest and swipe one more
time and this one from next to any smart
lighting products you might have like
the Philips hue you can control how
bright you want your light bulbs to be
it's a slight lag and this button here
is for Google assistant unfortunately
you can't use a wakeboard like okay
Google you have to tap the button on the
screen but you can say what's the
weather in Las Vegas and it'll display
its response on the screen a little bit
slowly so let's give it some time so the
designer is intentionally left pretty
much half the block blank and that was a
purposeful decision for you know the
sake of minimalism and it looks pretty
good but sometimes it does cut off the
responses there so what I like about the
movie is that although it basically does
the same thing as an Amazon echo show or
Google Home Hub where it's basically a
display for your smart home hub this is
a block of wood
it's an internet-connected block of wood
and it's unique and instead of just
being a device in your home it's
actually a part of your home as
furniture and I can really see them
selling this at IKEA or a lot of like
design home goods stores and it's really
just a beautiful block of wood so the
merchants finished a successful
Kickstarter project and it's launching
next week on IndieGoGo in demand for
$549 if you want more videos like this
