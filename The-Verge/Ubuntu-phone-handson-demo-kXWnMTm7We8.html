quick first look at the brand new
freshly announced you've been to phone
OS so this is what canonical comes to
welcome screen not a lock screen which
you get actually unlock by swiping to
one side six to the home screen or
swiping in from the other side you can
get a list of your most regularly used
applications and then jump right into
the application itself same
functionality is available when you have
an app open you swipe down get yourself
to the home screen like so you can swipe
down from the top like so and bring in
the messages if you swipe down on the
little messages icon right here it's up
we can take looky battery settings
connectivity sound etc if you swipe in
from the right you bring in the latest
application and in chronological order
for the other applications that you
might have had open there's a little bit
of lag but obviously that is to be
expected these are the first demo
devices we look at a development version
of the OS it's running on Galaxy Nexus
canonical promised that they'll have the
images for you to download install on
your Galaxy Nexus with the next couple
of weeks and it expects developers start
building out the ecosystem for punchy
phones using those devices which the
first shipping devices then we might see
early in 2014 but the first time that
you might see something similar to this
will be winter for Android shipping
phones without always should be coming
out some point 2013 but it's just a very
quick look at his swipe centric its face
it reminds me of the Nokia n9 and the
fact that there are basically no buttons
here everything is swipe-based edge
based and it does look good and
attractive provided this lag is some
point eliminated</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
