is neil i I'm sorry you stepped up my
line
we're at CES unveiled it's the first
real day of CES and I am excited I am
feeling like this is an environment
where i will definitely catch a disease
this is the narrative clip this is a
plastic square that records many
pictures of what's happening in your day
look it how easy that it that's great
and then super and conspicuous right
it's it's a google glass for your
pectoral muscle it's why I liked it I do
yeah its food brush yeah that's great
it's booth less I mean there are just
there are a lot of people here you know
there are a lot of people here with big
dreams nilay big dreams and really weird
ideas about how to accomplish those
dreams i believe it's pronounced
activity activity a point off women what
a drag queen drama connectivity you know
what i have to say the lock man feels
really nice so when i watch this video i
see like a group of attractive people
all wearing the same watch Mary who's
that sort of your mindset like where
this is going doing case you feel like
we've seen so much and there's just so
much activity at 70 p
to take a break and get refreshed a
really low key like not Vegas ready like
what what's your idea you know I my
suggestion would be that we go at the
CES ice luge
I mean that is really gross do you want
to try it I don't what have you learned
Casey well if there's one thing I
learned about today it was the social
media of things which is a phrase that
is incomprehensible but it gets at
dreams dreams and hope and hope and what
we sell for Burgess hope and what they
sell at CES is cold shrimp this is a
chair that's also a torture chamber you
strap yourself into it yeah and your
flames very relaxing it's very relaxing
can you push it yeah you can push down
on it you can pull Buster you're better
at pushing yeah I mean really really
just kind of explore the space it's very
nice leather but don't let that stop you
from this game your schedule over it and
just sat on it yeah have a lot of fun
with it so all right so Scott we have a
question how do I pronounce this
activity activity activity activity I
was pronouncing it like activity
did you park your truck in the middle of
CES unveiled because what you want to do
in the desert is go kayaking listen we
have to go so here's it was not
expecting that to happen at least one
for CES you have to hover board</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
