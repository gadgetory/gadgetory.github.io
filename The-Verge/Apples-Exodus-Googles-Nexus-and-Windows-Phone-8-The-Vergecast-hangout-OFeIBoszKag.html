live until people's netword of see us
we're live in secret hi everyone hi
Scott Wow terrible noise yeah yeah you
guys literally no like I could die at
any second like the Statue of Liberty
could come flying through this way where
exactly are you in New York right now
because I could die too I may have to
die first I'm in a hotel in Murray Hill
so let's oh whatever my fiance people
die together yeah I'm gonna tweak this
slank and then we can start tweeting
movements already not or the other one
tweet the youtube link not their post
not the bull don't get to eat the post
don't tweet the special plus sign in
link thing I don't see the post am I
crazy is it it's up where's the post on
the front page you're lying to me look
for your face but count the number of
times have been told that Mellie alright
I join it okay i'm gonna start decimal
up gentlemen froze yo people sat can we
talk all right Mike this camera on me
how do I make the camera go me all right
keep talking okay here I am hello it's
not switching to me what is happening I
see you do you see me I just see Ross
what I thought a brothel okay I'm just
on we can trim this in the beginning hi
everybody and welcome to a very special
hurricane edition of The Verge cast our
studio new york city is closed so we
can't go to it I've actually been
evacuated from my home which is cool so
I'm at a hotel Ross as a mass we flooded
at any moment and chris sigler is here
hopefully a tornado will hit his home in
Chicago well to be okay to be absolutely
clear I'm like a few blocks down for me
so if I go we're going together yeah and
I was on literally the last flight out
of New York from Newark last night
before they shut down the airport so I'm
feeling I should have come with you I
don't know I don't know what I was like
uh but so this is it this is the second
time I've navin evacuated for her
uh so i may just apologize to everyone i
I'm sorry that I'm like a hotel room
like weirdly lit but you can you can
sense my panic and fear with me I hope
that he do and I'm sitting in front of a
window and watching the crazy sideways
rain so if something basically if
something comes flying through this
window and murders me you'll be the
first to know and I think that that is
truly the verge chaste experience
waiting for a murder and then knowing
about it that's breaking news that's
news as it happened absolutely tweet
about that so the reason we wanted to to
put on the show even under are
constrained circumstances is that today
was an absolutely bonkers day of news if
you've been paying attention to anything
but the hurricane you probably know
everybody's going on we wanted to kind
of unpack it all a little bit so this
morning uh start out with Google when
Google is actually going to have it's
amazing how many events were cancelled
in the city by the hurricane lot and so
Google was supposed to have an event
today that I was supposed to live blog
and reporters are going to go to it may
be hundreds of people there but they had
to cancel it because the hurricane it
was supposed to be held it I pier 38 so
that's a terrible place to hold an event
and they were scrambling they're trying
to find an alternate way to do it and
they slightly just couldn't there's no
structural way unless they waited out
the hurricane for them to make the
announcement so they just decided to
publish with the blog post so that that
one up today it's the nexus 4 was
announced running Android 4.2 the nexus
4 dozen of LTE which I have a lot of
things to say about but in every other
way it's a very high-end device there's
a nexus 10 also running Android 4.2 it's
a 10 inch tablet made by samsung
ridiculous display 12 2560 by 1600 a 300
PPI the crazy display and then you Nexus
7 with 3G connectivity with Nexus 7th
mobile right in calling so huge number
of ounces there and then later in the
day after couple hours after Google
Microsoft held its windows from eight
event and add some major new features
here one is from a which I don't
anything about because I was
he talked about Google that's why chris
is here Chris that's why you're here man
what happened yesterday uh so we you
know we kind of got a sneak preview of
Windows Phone 8 back at that developer
event a few months ago and then they
went strangely silent for a very long
time developers haven't had access to
the SDK there have been some weird kind
of nebulous PR releases that have come
out saying you know these funds are
going to be available in the coming
weeks but they've been very vague about
like what the exact date is going to be
and what the prices are going to be what
carriers in some cases so today was the
day where they they kind of came clean
with all that consumer facing
information and that leads him to build
which is their developer event where
they're really going to get into the
nitty-gritty details of what developers
need to do to target this platform and
presumably the SDK will be released
there too okay wait wait a second so
this is actually I don't think I realize
so much so the SDK has been in the dark
for a lot of people even up until this
day yep yep which is very different than
the way they handled both windows phone
7 + 7.5 launches this weekend yes it
launches this weekend so so so so to
hear Microsoft tell it um eight well if
they don't have a story around that
really but but what we've heard we've
heard some people tell us that there
that there really haven't been the
metrics to prove that there are there is
an advantage to releasing the SDK early
in terms of app uptake app availability
at product launch and I you know I don't
think they're ready with sdk ahead of
time I don't think it was in a state
where they felt comfortable giving it to
everybody and of course there's the
concern I mean there's the iOS effect
where that's DK comes out early and then
everything that's under NDA is like
immediately note right because you know
right people are talking about it though
there was a kinda like me is that is
that a terrible trade off to having apps
at launch like they was the window Sorna
has 120,000 apps which is great they've
got pandora they've got facebook twitter
is also awesome I didn't want to get
back with that later but is that really
the best trade-off in May at what point
are we going to
seeing a huge delusion of apps that come
from the SDK coming out now no I agree
with you but um keep a couple things in
mind for one thing there aren't that
many app facing features in Windows
Phone 8 that that major apps need to
take advantage of in order to target the
platform overall meaning like you know
I'm trying to think of a good example
like Pandora there isn't much in Windows
Phone 8 that an app like pandora needs
to be successful there's some cool new
life ha I'll stuff there's VoIP
integration simply which is called a
VoIP boy but that's gonna that's going
to common type which isn't out yet and
then the you know they're able to do
things like track location in the
background now which they couldn't do
before so that'll allow developers to
push interesting stuff to your live
tiles based on your current location so
there are a few things but there's
nothing preventing a 7.5 app from being
compelling on a point 0 right now and a
lot of the apps that i tested look great
one notable exception was one password
which looks really really terrible on
Windows Phone 8 but I I think that might
just have to do with the resolution of
the screen and the aspect ratio but but
by and large is not bad um so I mean
they'd have some some big core apps
though I feel like the Facebook app
looks really nice it's tough to live app
functionality right the geode iraq was
really nice yeah you know I was um I was
looking at Twitter last night I saw
maybe a couple days ago i saw eric lin
from HTC he switched back from Windows
Phone device to an Android device and he
was like oh my god I forgot there are
apps for everything on Android which is
uh yeah the OEM is like Kobe crap
there's so much so many more apps for
Android uh but you know they've got to
make this push I mean this is this is
there a moment I will say Microsoft did
something really crazy and embarrassing
when I had Jessica Alba up on stage I
watched that part of the stream and it
was so I'm like I'm one of these people
but if I see something embarrassing on
TV have to turn it off somebody have
that you know talking about like
something really bad is happening like I
commonly cover my ears because I can't
take it and Jessica on the mic up
Microsoft stage is like it was it was
that level of life you know actually
terrible I hate to disagree with you
know I agree I don't uh it was I mean at
one point Joe Belfiore was like so tell
us so much like Windows Phone and she
was like uh I like Windows Phone I mean
if she is it was it was ridiculous now
remember you and I have gone to the Sony
events where Will Smith has come on
stage and shelled for now this is
embarrassing too don't get me wrong I
wanted total rain terribly embarrassed
ranked this properly uh well so Sony is
like Sony would have the celebrities
come on with sir howard stringer who is
like you that man doesn't know how to
how to like operate to a script in his
like he's constantly just saying
whatever he wants so like the
celebrities are come out he biked look
at you I paid you a lot of money to
stand here and that's like hilarious
Microsoft does this thing if they do
with whether that's like paid actors or
not when they have this like hokey like
real world it's like they don't know how
to interact with each other like human
beings would so they hired like a
teenager to like write them like a
script and they have to follow it like
you know so last night i was talking to
uh my friend right you were like to that
right and i decided to use this app to
do this totally normal thing i was gonna
do and the other person's like yeah i do
that totally normal thing all the time
it's like just stop please God and
anyway and so but the idea that they
would loop jessica alba into that exact
type of environment but her totally
normal things are like normal things sir
jessica alba like i was shooting a movie
when my kids tweeted 24 million of my
followers by accident and kids connect
or whatever that could really help me
with that problem it isn't that a
totally normal problem that you have I'm
like uh no it's not uh I mean no I don't
know what you're talking about um I mean
that the phone is good I'm sorry Chris
substance in problems but I just watched
that part and said why do you always do
this ya know I I why I think that the
notion in general the notion of paying a
famous person to talk about your product
is
is I don't think that works in this
business I think that works when you're
talking about Gatorade I don't think it
works when you're talking about Windows
Phone and I think that that's that you
know I I don't think they're going to
get a return on their investment from
that particular higher but I could be
wrong um but no so you know I feel like
going all the way back to like windows
phone 7.5 Microsoft has had this thing
we're like you know people complain
about there being no apps and they're
like what you talking about we have tons
of apps what do you want you want to
want a camera filter app you want you
know and and and just yesterday I came
up with three very specific examples
which I talked about in the review of
apps that I needed well not needed but
very strongly desired that I didn't have
access to on the 8x that I was testing
with a United app because I was stuck in
New York with no way to get out and I
need to check flight statuses uber
because I needed to get the hell out of
lower Manhattan and and a real Starbucks
app now there are a few like really
shady like third-party starbucks apps
where you can like enter your card
number and then it creates the 2d
barcode on the screen but it's not it's
not the real deal and speaking of
starbucks i want to talk about this
because it cracked me up uh-uh so i was
i was standing outside my hotel on Wall
Street literally on Wall Street and no
not on wall street around the corner
from old street and i entered starbucks
into the maps app it zoomed out to all
of Manhattan Island and showed me aight
starbucks none of which were within like
a 16 block radius of where I was
standing when in fact I was actually
standing like within walking distance of
three starbucks so I know that Microsoft
has talked a lot about the fact that
we've now using nokia napping
technologies in Windows Phone 8 but I'm
not seeing the benefits of that yet yeah
I mean look we have the devices we're
going to be reviewing a bunch then you
know I think this is like we were it's
same thing we've been saying I think
with windows 8 itself it's microsoft is
in this like perpetual transition period
and if they've hit another end point you
know with Windows Phone 8 but they're
clearly not there yet and I don't
they've got a I think they finally have
these foundations to build on and
they've got some really nice hardware to
show off those foundations and now it's
like okay you finally caught up in the
way that you said you were going to uh
you know you built you know I saying
ideas they're five apps in the home
screen art like cool uh they've got
they've got a lot of work to do to build
that platform with something viable
against against iOS which now I i think
has entered a period of iterative
refinement not radical radical change in
you know I think this is we can talk
about Google a little bit against Google
which is doing some crazy stuff danger
at 4.2 it has in Google's challenge is
filtering that stuff down into the mass
market of Android devices and not
limiting it to you know nice nice Nexus
phones that don't have LTE right that's
like I mean there's there's challenges
at every part of market but you know
Microsoft they brought themselves onto
competitive level but they've they've
got to work really fast on getting after
dollar personally just witness Renee and
you know adding some of the stuff to
anticipated kind of desperately need
yeah we were talking about this on the
mobile show last week you know you
compare the 920 or the 8x to the Lumia
900 from six months ago and and it's
it's a compelling product and if you
look at the specs line item by line item
you can see that it's a great great
product a much better product but
convincing somebody that's walking into
an AT&amp;amp;T store that this 149 99 Lumia 920
is worth fifty dollars more than the
Lumia 900 that you didn't want to buy
six months ago a lot of dieter are you
in it are you in like a German disco
right come what is where are you what is
happening I'm here hanging out at the
you know the microsoft event there's you
know there's the stage that we just live
blog from Wow
you know I don't know I don't know who
that is it's not dieter because he's not
wearing deters glasses I yeah what do
you guys you not bad huh that's good the
hair dear you've got your doing this
this floppy I mean you look more like a
d like English major who try to steal my
girlfriend at every party in college now
I'm just I mean let's seal the deal dude
are you wearing a cardigan or a sweater
vest is myself wearing a cardigan oh
nice nice it's good it's good you are
you to me off your pants what are you
know I was right ear we were just
talking on Microsoft you were there what
are you revived on the spot impressions
what's happening I think that um this is
it this feels like the fifteenth time
that we've had windows phone 8 announced
and I know that this is like the
official official announcement and that
general consumers you know this is what
they're going to see apparently but it
there wasn't any like big blow you away
moments that the thing that really stood
out to me is they showed off rooms and
they showed off kids corner and then
they brought out Jessica Alba on stage
yeah and all three of those things are
Microsoft saying look we can't get any
of the traditional smartphone buyers we
can but we do have a shot with families
and it seems like families is dog
whistling for like moms basically and
we've seen other smartphone
manufacturers try and market to moms and
failed terribly but they're being much
more subtle here and I think they might
have you know a chance to maybe you know
pick up some like you know real
attention with that stuff but I mean
it's a relatively small thing and so I
don't really think that it's going to
you know it's not going to blow anybody
away the stuff they announced here they
spend most the time we architecting the
OS not adding new features right right
you know I think that point about we've
seen this presentation so many times I
mean that's like Joe Belfiore Smoove now
is to show up at events and give give
the windows phone presentation which is
like have you heard of live tiles and
it's you gotta you gotta move beyond
dan hesse dan seifert is join us I'm
trying if you can hear me dad you're
danza much more like hurricane you're an
upstate New York right writer like your
yeah as far as I know you live in like a
like a farm you having a windmill that's
like going crazy well you know what
we're earning all of our electricity
right now for the right yeah I like as
soon as I connection there we go oh
Jesus tom Wow hey are you why don't you
just go stand next to dieter are you
doing it's ridiculous we're invading
zaneta turn more lights on mark out this
uh this first pass is quickly gone to
like an insane party with like two
people at sums dan dan you're killing me
man or whatever that noise is Tom are
you typing my missus what happens when
you try to podcast from hurricane well
who's all control Tom do you want to
tell us what your thoughts of this
Microsoft events were since you're there
well we really are there I'm its kind of
similar to the how to give the surfaces
windows later it's gonna like they
they're really doing the whole like
consumer marketing play and stuff it's
not like new stuff for us and it's like
I loved eating my URL right now yeah so
yeah I mean if I would've liked to see
more apps Instagram well I suppose done
and yeah it's fun of so pretty
anticlimactic I mean that's what I'm
getting is that you guys were there and
they showed you a bunch of stuff you've
seen you know in so Tom we were
discussing the fact that Microsoft has
kept kept witness tripping a kind of a
secret a long time and they've actually
said I've heard yo belfiore I say many
times you know we're not showing all of
the OS yet we're going to show you all
of us later and today they showed what
presumably is the entire OS and they've
got a handful of features that are new I
I think again I think live apps in kids
corner like the big ones as far as I
data showed her that data data
management something that's a carrier
enabled so yeah yeah that's not even
yeah that's not hitting right now that's
hitting down the road private so we
really need to know more about that data
sense that it is built in but it's not
the carriers control it also oh yeah
kind of an interesting aspect that we
were like that's something we weren't
fully aware how they were in but so you
put anything which anything else truly
new today from Microsoft not really I
mean cater to our economy oh you know is
it whenever I see somebody with a
Windows run from now on I'm taking their
phone in a twin kids corner and not
telling me that's like good sorry bro
neighborhood this thing kills me here's
what kills me about kids corner why is
it not just a generic guest modes that
you can hand your phone to anybody on
the street and say you know if they need
to make a call if they need to do
anything so you don't need to give them
access to all your email and your text
messages right that inevitably has swear
words that um because this is easier to
market this is more interesting instead
of guest mode it's kids corner and it
appeals to families right i mean that's
that's the whole bag uh do you know to
say your line about a marketing to moms
being a complete fail is like it is so
true like it's not it's dead it's not a
real segment of the market like late
because like that's fifty percent of
people you know like here's women is a
thing like it has never worked for
anyone like palm tried it they put the
stupid mirror on the back of the pre and
are like check it out babe it's a just
do like it it's bad it's like there are
no features on a smartphone that you can
you can actually say to somebody men
want this and write that you know you
want them on a good fo yeah but so the
thing is like Microsoft isn't being
ham-fisted about it they're talking
about families and you know kids corner
and so I don't think it's going to hurt
them I think it's just an interesting
strategy that they're taking because you
know what else can they do right after a
trying to find all these different areas
where they can try and sell win this one
now families the latest over well I'm
gonna be working i think that stuff to
me that stuff plays better on tablets
right because that's its you can give
the kid a tab they play with this don't
screw with anyhow like like I've handed
my phone to my niece and nephew like all
the time and they know they want to do
one thing they want to play one game
they don't wanna like it's like that
works for like babies it doesn't work or
I'm snapping that it doesn't work for
kids are like I want to play like the
game that I want I mean I want we'll see
how many kids so and I hope I never do
our species is due 11 kids blue I'm
never I mean like I'm saying I'll use
it's a trophy um ok looks actually I
think this is really interesting
transition to google which right we we
read there's Microsoft did a lot of
stuff today but a lot of stuff we've
seen already and I think Google is the
stuff is so new and so crazy even though
we questioned it has been leaked but I
mean that's you know for example that's
one of the features of android 4.2 on
tablets is multiple user accounts that
you can let's share the tablet and it's
like it's such a blindingly good idea to
do that for real at the operating system
level um you know I think that Google is
making a play for like the tablet is a
pure consumption device it's like very
entertaining because they can't tell the
story of the tablet is a laptop
replacement which is the story that
Microsoft is on the surface the story
that Apple is increasingly telling with
the ipad and they just can't do it so
they're they're much more of the leave
it lying around pick it up play with it
at different apps and different games
and like I think that's very smart um
but at the same time you know there to
the nexus 10 doesn't have it doesn't
have any wireless capabilities doesn't
have LTE doesn't even have 3g the nexus
7's 3g but i don't want to pay for 3g on
a 7-inch tablet it just doesn't feel
right and obviously the nexus 4 dozen
LTE so dieter you and i wrote a long
piece on the LTE situation when i def
wanna do you want to go through it a
little bit i think there was some
perception that we were in some way
trying to explain for google what the
problems were uh
but that's my intention was to actually
point out how deeply fucked up the world
is that a company of Google sighs can't
make the right decision uh yeah so it's
I think google made a huge mistake I
want to be a clear that yes i would say
they should not have done this and I
think if if at the end of the day the
only the other bad option for them was
produced unlocked ATT LTE handsets and
sell them at a loss uh they should have
done it and just like lied and said
we're out of stock or something rather
than like produce like a thousand and
like a lot of stock chipsets are too
fancy instead of saying we can't do this
to me that's where I'm at but the
structural problems are are also really
intense and really to me just as
irritating in anger god yeah I mean
basically Google you know they're like
we want we want to have the nexus
program be about shipping software
updates without any carrier intervention
period and therefore we can't be on cdma
devices i mean this is this is basically
the argument that we inferred from from
talking to them and okay that's very
morally pure stance that you've taken
but you know get your hands dirty and
talk to the carriers and do what you
need to do to get your phone launched
and frankly do what Apple has managed to
do and get your software updates out
there in a more timely fashion the the
joke that I made earlier this morning is
that it's not so much that it's the
nexus 4 it's that it's the Nexus
petulance like we basically took its
ball and went home and and refuse to do
the really dirty crappy scummy work of
cutting deals with us wireless carriers
to get the phone on the network with LTE
instead they're taking the morally pure
high ground which is great for people
that don't care about LTE don't have LTE
in their area or whatever but it makes
the phone not feel like a true blanket
or pump because it's not because it
doesn't avail to eat right and all right
I don't think go ahead then well I was
just going to say
because it's lacking LTE and you know
it's being picked up by t-mobile as far
as a sales success the thing is
essentially dead on arrival because even
though it's unlocked you know ATT is not
going to sell this phone right I'm not
going to sell this phone that's between
the two of them in the US that's 200
million users that are going to be
exposed to this phone at all oh so like
does Google what the Nexus phones to be
big sellers or not it seems like they
can't decide they seem like they made a
real go of it with the the Galaxy Nexus
and now they're just like they clearly
don't think that they're going to have
this thing take over the planet and do
they want to sell a ton of these or not
I can't I think that they have a very
high in mighty view both with the Nexus
line and also with Chromebooks that they
are you know they think that they are
way out of the curve they are several
years ahead of the curve in in this in
this part of the market where they're
not selling devices and maths they're
selling devices the way they think that
they're supposed to be I mean seriously
I've never seen a Chromebook anywhere on
the street Nexus is I do see but only
because of the verizon galaxy nexus it's
not like I see nexus ones every day or
Nexus threat wow if you shot nexus ones
every day as you like where are you the
be fair but but dieter dieter back to
your point about getting getting their
hands dirty and talking to carriers I
think that the answer is not to get
their hands dirty and and talk to
carriers it's to completely ignore the
carrier's go straight to the source of
the radios and straight to the sources
of the chipsets and and just you know
make the phone like yeah do it right
well the ATT dieter ATT told you if you
bring an LTE phone that supports our
bands to us will sell you a sim it'll
work maybe there'll be some problems
with it all the features might not be
enabled bubble hotspot video calling
whatever whatever ATT crap we're gonna
do we'll do it but at the end of the day
you'll get data for you know ninety
percent your phone build that phone you
know what uh and the thing is LG has
already built that up right no they do
people yeah so I don't know oh I'm very
confused as to why
you gotta go dude actually murder you
Gladys just came on that's over man
seriously like a little British smear
robot dropping out of the ceiling over
there asking me to run away with him so
I gotta go guys think you're the fun
idea for that image so now I here's my
question to that if your didn't have the
LTA chips they did you know your dream
scenario how much would it cost like
that's a better Chris question i think
but i would say it would be 650 700
whatever that's how much you don't mind
icon is right right now it's right now
it's three hundred dollars unlocked off
contract you know you don't have to
worry about the carrier stuff it would
cost through here dollars more if you
put LTE radio trips in there those chips
are bonkers expensive Chris I mean you
want to get to this a little bit yeah no
I mean it's it's it's just a scale thing
right and and amateur a chipset maturity
thing like these HSP chipsets HSPA
chipsets that they're working with now
have literally been around for
generations and generations of products
and they I mean they're they're
basically free uh you know the same
thing is happening to them now that
happened to the GSM edge chipsets five
years ago uh and an LTE is not there yet
so yeah it would be a big premium but I
mean regardless that's a phone that I
still think that they need if they if
they really want to take the principled
stance part of taking that principled
stance is making going out on a limb and
making that LTE product right now
they're they're half-assing it they're
they're not taking a principled stance
on anything because anyone can make an
unlocked HSPA device so what right kool
Kris I think if we wanted to have an
idea of the price difference between LTE
and 9lt we could just take a look at
devices on the market that already have
like a wire or Wi-Fi only version and an
LTE version yeah the iPad it's a hundred
and thirty dollar difference on the
kindle fire HD the difference between
the LTE model the Wi-Fi model i think is
over two hundred bucks um so it's it's
it's a significant cost factor amazon
sells its tablets at cost so if it
was not a two-hundred-dollar cost
increase it wouldn't be a
two-hundred-dollar cost increase for the
the kindle fire so it definitely would
push the cost higher but like Chris said
you know that's where the level of
high-end phones are you know that the
iphone is over six hundred dollars
unlocked the the 920 and the other high
ended windows phones are going to be you
know in that neighborhood for an unlock
device so if Google really wants to have
a competing device it you know it's got
to put the specs there and if it pushes
the drive or pushes the price there so
be it right so let's I mean I think
we've let me just say this we when so
Josh was in San Francisco we did a big
feature on the Nexus program it's really
great you should you should go see it I
dieter to a big feature on google now
which we should talk about because it's
it's awesome it's really cool now um so
you should go look at that stuff but i
know that when Josh and dieter found out
about no LTE in San Francisco they
basically freaked out at Google like
this eh to say and then when Google was
in New York we were doing some other
stuff here Josh and I were talking and
we basically freaked out them again and
we're like this is this is a huge step
back like uh we did a speedtest I have
my iphone 5 and LTE josh had his AT&amp;amp;T
Galaxy Nexus and they had a nexus for
those run a tmobile uh and you know just
very informal like kind of you know take
this for what it is but my my iphone got
15 megabits down on 18 tlte the tech
jobs Galaxy Nexus got like point 02
we're just just sad and the tmobile
phone the nexus 4 got four day so it's
it's an improvement over what has been
terrible Josh first I biology what's up
buddy my god latasha hurricane just
working yeah my uh mi on the internet
you know this is publicly available to
be able to put this is over this man the
human beings are not shy tweet I should
tweet to tell people eat it how's your
concert hurricane man um you know I
think that this hurricane is
been wrongly accused of murder murder
for murder that it I could prove it on
the night of the that had happened that
the this hurricane had it was nowhere
near the event the entire east coast of
the United States that's right they
understand my reference I don't know if
this may be a little bit too high level
for some of the people in the Hangout
chris ziegler I'm kidding you're a
wonderful man ah but I was just telling
the story of when we were with Google
and we did some speed tests on the
phones because they were like t-mobile's
great yeah and I say my phone got 15
down I have fun with LTE your phone your
Galaxy Nexus and 18t got like point O 2
or something really terrible yeah it's
really bad and in there in the nexus 4
on tmobile got four down so there's a
jump a little bit of a jump if you're on
t-mobile but it's nowhere close to LTE
and these again these are kind of like
second-generation ltd products so the
hope is that that network will get even
faster where she Mobile's definitely
maxed out I so so yeah um it was it's my
i actually have just been sitting here
on my phone trying to tweak I'm like
maybe I'm doing something Robin tweaking
my APN settings which by the way is like
it's maybe second only to flashing the
phone with a bomb in the list of things
and I don't want to do with my phone
ever like when people are like you were
just flash like as soon as they say you
can just flash like that like I punch
them in the face and run out of the room
screaming and care and at the curtain
I'm crying and upset there of course
injured uh no it's uh yeah i mean III um
here's the thing like google has this
this story about their here's what I
think happened i think i think google is
very hurt and mad and disappointed about
their experience with the galaxy nexus i
think it like they somehow saw this is
like getting back at the carriers but
the truth is it just makes it just makes
them look like bad you know and and they
don't really have a good i mean their
reasons are like we want to make a phone
that you know we have control over
basically and the the the thing
that isn't the thing that is the problem
is that like how come google doesn't
have any power yeah right this is in
other sales that's why it's samsung has
the power rent in the top right nobody
buys flagship devices they're just on
they just don't sell flagship devices
you know right i think when we were
reporting on the on one of these
injunctions it was like they said what
the sales of the galaxy nexus were you
never like some infinitesimal number
some tiny Samsung's Samsung's most
popular handset in the US was the this
prepaid phone on boost mobile yeah
galaxy prevail they sold like two
million of those and nothing else even
came close not the galaxy s2 or anything
like that yeah I mean I it's just the
balance of power through the carrier's
is who's going to make us the most money
uh and the answer is Samsung it has been
samsung and google it's great that
Google provides us operating system but
that doesn't actually generate any
revenue for carriers so it seems like
they're not willing to you know and
Google with the flagship devices even
with the Galaxy Nexus attitude Google
Wallet off the phone for verizon they
had a preload some other crappy thing
for verizon if I remember correctly and
Verizon held it back because they wanted
to sell the droid razr instead and they
held it back for months I you know
that's a thing in one October and I the
Galaxy Nexus didn't hit until December
but I you know I just want to say like
we we mentioned i mentioned this in the
piece that i did the feature piece about
the fact that like when you get right
down to it for google it's an economics
question they're not going to be able to
sell enough of these phones on a carrier
to convince a carrier to play ball with
them and they can't just like make the
phone with LT radios nobody can they
can't that's because i'm making for AT&amp;amp;T
that's what we're saying look no are you
doing operating systems real i
understand they can make it for AT&amp;amp;T but
economically for them it doesn't make
sense for them to make the more
expensive LTE device and try to sell you
know what a few hundred thousand because
they're true yeah but they're trying to
the whole thing about this this HSPA
move is that they're trying to take a
principled stance
wait and and the only way they can take
a principled stance is by taking that
loss by making an HSPA phone nobody's
impressed anybody can make an NHS be a
phone at this point it's cheap it's easy
well what I'm saying if they opt an LG
makes the LTE phone the optimus G on ATT
has LTE also part of that work has
clearly been done right but but I but I
think I mean there it is a different
phone I mean they have to produce it
right and google has to justify it
economically they have to be able to say
like we can sell enough of these that it
makes sense for us to actually spend the
money in the time and have our partner
spend the money in the time to leave
name but but but what I'm saying is they
already they have made that
justification for the whole of Android
right wait either I have a yeah I mean
this thing is it's a nightmare I mean
look let's forget about let's freak
let's not even talk about their
reasoning let's talk about what you
might I don't know okay go ahead I have
a question okay weather so I mean we do
we're all on the same page that and you
know an off-contract phone in the US
with no LTE makes no sense in a country
where everyone just gets it on contract
anyway what about international yeah I
was going to say contractor national
this this approach might be very
successful in like Europe where like
Chris was saying how Google is trying to
be years ahead of where everyone else is
as far as selling phones if you look at
the structure of contracts and carriers
in Europe they are already essential
years ahead of what we have here in the
US so this kind of thing might be very
very successful in Europe where there's
only you know a smattering of LTE
networks in the hand football places so
the vast majority of users don't care if
it has LTE or not and they buy their
phones unlocked anyways all right but if
we're looking for a u.s. perspective
it's hard to see that no I mean from the
US perspective that I think that's the
thing is they're just like we're not
looking at this from us perspective i'm
not i'm not defending them because
because this is what I wanted to say
next is what is my next phone going to
be because I swore to to up so I you
know I was juggling the the verizon
galaxy nexus and the AT&amp;amp;T galaxy nexus
and i wanna i want to have a single
phone i do not want to be swapping two
phones i do not want to be doing any sim
swapping or anything else
I want a single phone that will do
everything that I wanted to do on LTE
what am i buying what am i buying does
anybody know my s3 got yes I that's
right now you're gonna do it's all about
seeing it i won't i won't i won't have
another pentile display no no no no the
galaxy s3 display is beautiful pen tiles
are non issue on gs3 your brilliance as
you're saying galaxy s3 yeah so the only
thing about the gs3 for you is that it's
not stock Android right we were talking
about us right ok honest I think I think
I'm just gonna get an iphone I mean it's
it's you know it's the only it's the
only device on the market that is not
compromised and so let me know in 20 I
mean I actually I mean in all honesty
like watching the HTC stuff today in
reading the review and reading the
windows phone 8 review and just kind of
thinking about it you know it is
somewhat attractive but I don't know if
I'm going to go for if I'm going to get
away from the the Android ecosystem i'm
going to not use like the best gmail
experience and the best calendar
experience and a google talk and
whatever else like i'm not going to go
further away like i'm gonna go to
something that you know i feel like i'm
gonna end up going to something that I'm
more familiar with yeah that's Chris
little fun yeah I want to ask you two
something cuz like i I've been traffic
off I want to stick with Android its 4.2
that much better than 4.1 or should i
just go it with what chris says and just
get a jellybean s3 um I think that some
of the conveniences in in 4.2 are really
great i think the new camera stuff is
really cool i think the the widget stuff
is obviously a really cool feature but i
mean is it like deal breaker i mean
Samsung's actually made a lot of changes
to the software that are some of them
are not completely terrible I'm just
trying to imagine a world where that is
the phone that I use yeah it's not bad
uh no actually this actually got I know
it seems like you know the defining
feature of the nexus 4 is kind of what
it doesn't
have but what it does have as a phone is
actually very impressive it isn't it is
a surprisingly nice piece of hardware
and I was very unimpressed by all the
leaks that we saw all the dashers but
having actually held it and play with a
little bit the back is really cool it's
kind of funny that they made out of
glass which is like so cuz I actually
you know the more I was thinking about
it when we were working on that hands-on
post last night Josh the more to me it
feels it it has a 5 of a like it like an
old high-end blackberry I used to give
me yeah where's like very professional
executive yeah it's cool and then you
flip it over and I like sparkles at you
yeah so it's it's that kind of like
1980s executive yeah there's only one
not one problem which is it's a horrible
lack of LTE yeah with other problems I'm
gonna say that was kinda say one more
thing and the screen is incredible um
it's going from the Galaxy Nexus which
is like the phone that I i was gonna
switch Andhra that be the phone that I
would have gotten and I hate I really
really dislike that screen this screen
is like it is on par with any other
display industry iphone 1x whatever you
like whatever whatever nokia is doing at
the lumia a 320 dpi is using a new
technology so the pixels are closer to
the top of the screen it's a FM values
in cell touch and this uses GT or so
there they've gotten rid of the layer of
the screen that were the touch sensor is
an integrated it with the actual screen
it looked mean it's a it is a very nice
phone and it has a great CPU it's got
the the Snapdragon s4 so what you're
getting for three hundred dollars or
whatever it is uh is great but it's
missing the thing that you want I think
if you live in i think if you live in
europe or a place where lt's not
deployed it's a it's a really awesome
phone I mean I yeah you know I just
think it's really hard to accept you
know on the other hand uh Apple did this
with 3g with the original iphone I'm not
saying it's the same justification even
though like you know Google is
essentially saying sort of similar stuff
like battery life and whatever with the
iPhone 5 is LTE yeah you're sure about
it in the same size
batteries previous one like I'm not just
answer there I'm not defending I'm just
saying that there is some precedent for
this stuff but like I mean let's put it
this way okay I really would like this
to have this phone be my next phone I
I'm a you know obviously a big fan of
the the newest versions of Android and
my gut feeling is no matter how good the
phone is no matter how good the software
is it's going to be really hard for me
to consider going another year with my
main phone not having the fastest
possible network in America yeah me too
seems insane to me because the
difference is not like oh I get five on
this thing and eight on this thing it's
like I get to on this thing and 15 on
this thing you know like that's a huge
huge difference and so you know they're
played for Europe may be fine but it's
really really difficult for me to
imagine that this is the phone that I
stick with for an entire year you know
but there's no alternative i mean the
alternatives suck like everything about
everything i say this in my piece that
there that the the double-edged sword of
google's openness that you know they
work with a lot of people they work they
work with a lot of manufacturers they
work with a lot of carriers and anybody
can take their software make a phone but
the double-edge of that is they don't
really exert control over any of that
stuff you know none of me insane to me
that there's not a single device you
can't buy a single device with stock
Android and LTE except the Galaxy Nexus
and that's like always a step behind the
actual release it's like it's just crazy
to me they can't do one phone that is on
their release schedule I remember having
a conversation with drew Bamford who is
HTC's lead designer for on the software
side he's sort of Scott Crayolas
counterpart on the software side and and
and I asked him why don't you release
the stock android device and he said
because we want to differentiate we want
something that's different and I said
well guess what if you release his stock
Android device that would be different
because nobody does stock Android right
right I agree I mean I just think that
um so here's the problem look even if
HTC releases stock Android device they
still aren't going to get updates on
schedule I mean for some reason Apple is
the only company that has found a way to
bully carriers or the force carriers
into letting them do what they want I
mean and by the way they didn't start
this way I mean the iphone the first
iphone was not just a a runaway hit in
everybody's mind I mean it was a runaway
hit but before it was sold it wasn't
like all the carriers were going oh yeah
this is going to just be yeah yes I
vision mission well has it rejected
that's right verizon rejected a team's
he picked up the scraps and you know of
course it was obviously a huge hit and
Apple was right what's weird is that
nobody can repeat what they're doing you
know it's very frustrating I think as an
industry to see an industry that is that
is hamstrung in this way so Microsoft Oh
Microsoft's is their strategy is
actually close it's not as good as
apples but what they do is they say that
carriers can reject individual updates
for Windows Phone but if they do so the
next time they do pick up an update it
will include it will roll up everything
in every previous release so ultimately
at some point they need to pull the
trigger and come up to speed well one
thing one thing one thing I will say is
that with Windows Phone I mean they've
been pretty good about actually getting
those updates to the devices I mean my I
mean obviously I'm not using every
device so i can't speak for every
person's experience but i will say that
it seems to me that they've they've
actually gotten their act together on
getting those update and they're not
selling phones that are wildly them in
their stock you know essentially their
stock with like a couple of extra apps
and correct me if i'm wrong chris and
anybody else can correct me if I'm wrong
but my memory is uh you can actually
just delete any app you can uninstall
any app you don't want it's not like
disabling you can just straight-up take
it off the phone right on Windows Phone
devices yeah so like if you buy an
eighteen t phone that's got a bunch of
eighteen t carrier branded apps you can
just go one by one and uninstalled and
cook yeah so I'm actually about to
uninstall HTC's included app right now
you can see on it while you can see but
once augen stall is not grayed out so
yeah wow yeah you know I wrote a piece
in July right arguing that it's it was
like five years after the iphone was
announced rk1 on sale uh
I feel like that was a moment when it
felt like there'd be this huge explosion
of innovation in mobile uh it's it
particularly with the transition LTE and
I think this phone is kind of a breaking
point for LTE yeah in terms of making it
clear what's happening uh the transition
LTE was was hard-fought right you know
verizon bought this spectrum at auction
from the FCC there were rules in place
that required them to make it open the
exact phrase was any app any device
right think if not allowed to block
anything from your 700 right here its
LTE Google thought verizon they were in
court against each other they're in
court with the FCC google had to
participate in the auction right because
there was like if the price to go to a
certain level the rules wouldn't kick in
so google was actually bidding on the
spectrum to make sure Verizon's price
was high enough to trigger the rules
well all of this stuff happened this is
like a massive story enjoy a lot and
it's been completely it's been
completely co-opted by Verizon right
yeah they have used
hey Neil I dailies like funky yeah that
just completely drop for a second
whatever you want to say a backdrop
special miss like what i'm using yeah
i'm usually ever honest I find it
connects I'm probably being we didn't
hear anyone grace said the last ten set
15 12 seconds we're just was very
dramatic we all just kind of cut out no
I think we were all I think we were all
under the impression that we were
freezing yeah i thought i was super
going oh this i saw a tree fly by my
window so i figured i'm sure i was just
ranting about verizon and open access
and i'm convinced at my my they
disclosed rises ye my phone they're
pulling a huge switch somewhere that
doesn t life it has nilay patel labeled
on it they're like geo-targeting you for
a shutdown um no but but you're right to
your point uh what little is that we
heard we know we really are like at this
I do i do hope this draw some attention
to the fact but like you know it's not
just like hey the industry won't let
Google do it I mean Google doesn't have
the power to do some things they need to
do but what is increasingly and
constantly crazy to me is that we don't
have I mean we just it's like you can't
just buy a phone and put it on a network
you know explained to me by the way I
just want to be clear how many skews
does Apple actually make like in terms
of the the different rate other
different radios in the verizon iphone 5
vs the AT&amp;amp;T iphone 5 what's the
breakdown yeah there are so i think i
wrote this piece up when the iphone 5
was announced and essentially there's
three different model numbers for the
iphone 5 there's an AT&amp;amp;T version that
has ATT hspa+ support guys guys my back
can you hear me yeah yeah uncle news is
breaking all over the internet right now
that scott forstall is leaving apple
next year what what yeah very the chat
room is like going insane right well
what which is crazy you know what
actually I'm not surprised after the
maps thing after Cirie be kind of
disappointment I'm not surprised as he
and kind of yeah I'm reported by
bloomberg Scott Forstall leaving Apple
next year boy he he fell out in a hurry
yeah well yeah
Apple's I book above yeah that is crazy
yeah once you start issuing a public
apologies uh I think your time is up yes
uh that's a big big deal Wow kid um that
I wonder what those real wifes reactions
ha yeah this is interesting we've been
talking about this but but I wonder how
much of this is um I mean maybe he just
wants to retire or leave Apple but
there's been a lot of I think heat on
him for the map stuff for like the lack
of iOS seeming lack of iOS innovation
yeah I mean he's the software guy right
no so I wonder how much of this is
actually blowback I mean match has
obviously been a huge embarrassment for
apple and and I don't think that any of
the other stuff helped I mean I think my
biggest negative in the review is like
you know I love the phone it's really
really good but like software wise
development seems to have stalled out
yeah you love any lies writing the post
right now yeah the sentences this is
like we're live it's like live streaming
a guy writing it up now just look at me
don't forget the roaches who's crazy
stair oh uh Neil Athena pretty use a
swagger the swagger shot we took from we
owe their it is yeah we have yeah we're
doing that yeah goodness fire Sean this
is good it was just like a live a live
stream of something coming together and
I just say this can I just point out
apple announced this during a hurricane
openam it is my view cycle is the day
with Google were already announcing
something and Mike this one the markets
are closed the markets are closed
there's a hurricane on is there actually
is there actually news wedding they're
actually a piece of PR from them or
something and I it hit the Bloomberg
terminal and then my Twitter explode
mm-hmm so I think a press release
probably coming forthcoming google
google news
nothing how does Michael Bloomberg have
time to worry about Apple Mayor
Bloomberg had to sit there and type this
out he got the memo from apple and he's
like all right I gotta go do it in the
ticker tape and he had a minute I
haven't achieved all right here I have
an announcement apple today announced on
executive management changes will
encourage even more collaboration from
the company's world cross hardware
software and services team as far do
these changes Johnny I Bob Mansfield
Eddy Cue and Craig federighi will add
more responsibility sir rols apple also
announced that Scott Forstall be leaving
Apple next year and serve as an advisor
to so this is what Bob Mansfield did
right I think we'd lost you again Jimmy
that's okay his he what he had to say
wasn't very interesting or important
anyhow I'm here I'm do I can hear you I
don't you know I guys guys are you like
Neil I is gone and we just have to
accept that he's not during this hangout
all of you are fired and move on with
our lives you know what kinda it was
gonna say this press release wrong way
it's written surprising who's a
wonderful man but he just didn't have
what it took to date for the hurricane
Scott who Scott Forstall Ernie lie he
also spiked it off work I don't want to
tell you says he's missing due to the
hurricane he's been blown away with a
lot haha Jeremy uh Eddie will take on
the additional responsibility of Syrian
maps placing all of our online services
in one group Johnny I will provide
leadership in directions for human
interface cued up they got this thing
cued up it's a johnny is a software now
yeah Johnny I is that its first software
role Wow wait really where is this
report Neil I the center because it's a
PR it's where aspire yeah it is much I
dropped the link in our chat oh I got it
I got a kiss is uh there's the only way
to this is a massive shake up this is a
huge yeah this is this is crazy this is
crazy we're uh it was that knee like
inner was at me I don't know that was
Neil I dropping out again damn it Neil I
stopped dropping the mic Neil I I know
you got a lot of coins to make but
wait wait wait a second John John
Browett is leaving Apple and he's only
done there since retail so the head just
got there he said he got oh shit the
head of retail got can this is wait a
second this is a vein head of retail
have gone also Wow well that you know it
wasn't this is like seriously and say
are they bringing back the JCPenney guy
oh I hope no he's busy or JC Penney
dudes look I mean this is like they will
pay money they'll throw money to bring
him back no here's what it says as
Apple's reto organization has an
incredible strong network of leaders at
the store and regional level who will
continue the work that has been done
over the past decade to revolutionize
retailing with unique innovative
strategies for customers uh this is
blowing my mind right now like the the
Johnny I've human interface stuff is
crazy by the way this also puts Johnny
I've much much closer to the position
that Steve Jobs would have had in the
sense that he's like it has an eye on
software and hardware as a holistic
thing like I think that is a I think
that is a pretty monumental piece of
news to their I mean to me this is this
is this is actually like a much bigger
piece of beautiful probably anything
else that we reported on today which is
ironic because there's a lot of big news
what we talked about the fact that Tim
Cook is numbers man he's like he's a
great seat like a traditional CEO but he
is not a visionary in the same sense
that Steve Jobs was they've been lacking
that and to unify that under Johnny I
probably makes a lot of stuff here's a
here's a preemption here's a prediction
for you soon soon many many good
designers and engineers from google will
be leaving for new jobs elsewhere yeah
that's that's a that's of my prediction
cuz like I think that I mean I feel like
I've sensibilities are actually a lot
more in line with what they've been
doing with Android like in terms of
design then then what Apple has been
doing I mean if you look at Apple
hardware like mommy tell me I mean you'd
really like if you look at windows phone
or android that seems like it's much
better match to this like extremely
streamline minimal sophisticated
hardware then
anything they've been doing on the
software side I wouldn't be surprised
like honestly if if like in some way
jobs was a kind of a stickler for some
of the some of the stuff that uh you
know that I've probably wasn't that into
I mean when you think about like the
generational gap there because there is
a gap and when you think about what
Johnny I've brought hardware-wise seems
like a different aesthetic in a lot of
ways you know anyhow I'm specs Wow yeah
i mean i'd say like there's there's the
fact of the news and then there's the
timing of when it's being delivered that
is looking knew they knew we were
hanging out and they were like exim off
guard about the design of those morrow
to right they have two days of market
down time to let his news begin what's
what's weird what's weird is that Eddy
Cue I'm sorry Bob Mansfield left I mean
he quit right he retired and it says
he's gonna lead a new group called tech
called what Neil I Eli's gone isn't it
yeah he's just now never know the name
of that group um this dramatic pause I
can still see his like freeze frame like
just looking dead in the camera with his
mouth slightly a gape yeah these values
about to tell us something quite
incredible importance I think of a lot
because the weather's still fine i'm
actually facing the LA right now he's
fine but uh technologies that's the new
group technologies all I had to do is
read this this newswire release right so
what do you know um crazy crazy piece of
news yeah just wild any Google Microsoft
had a day in the news cycle Apple
decides to kick it over for the next 2-3
days how many times is that going to
happen this just fall because literally
every single time microsoft announces
something apple just comes in and like
just like cuts them off at their knees
when you can be sure that this was not
an accident oh yeah and and by the way i
if I'm not mistaken I think that's just
popped on Apple's
yet there we go oh hold on this is
different um it's not a little thin no
it's the same is it the same yeah yeah
exactly same yeah okay so this is a big
by the way um yeah this is a huge you
this is just not I'm not almost
speechless like I'm just trying to take
in what this means uh I think this means
big big changes for Apple next year in
terms of what they're doing in software
I mean yes I I just hope this means that
we no longer see stitched leather and
awful ski morphic ideas maybe there's no
way that there's no way that there's no
way that this is not going to i think
the stitch leather is gonna go yeah it's
that's been it's been another like The
Trevor at Game Center just need to be
like totally rebound if you're if you're
a if you're a Johnny I've and you see
that stitch leather on your device does
it not make you cringe a little bit like
you like I you're like I i created a
whole new process for putting a screen
under glass and you put stitched leather
on that screen so i think i think the
other thing I've got Williams I doubted
me about this it's not only was it Siri
in maps our kind of issues but
apparently rumor has it Bob Mansfield I
hated Scott Forstall so much this is
kind of what the carrots the gave Bob to
stay you know like Scott's on the way
out you should definitely stay with us
don't casually retire out yeah
interesting well then that makes sense
and Bob Mansfield is kind of back in
right um but so so Forrestal is leaving
immediately or basically like in January
I mean there's only a couple of months
here it says he's leaving next year and
will serve as an adviser to CEO Tim Cook
in the interim welcome back meat which
means that he's already gone so so four
stalls essentially gone according to
this and he's serving right now as an
advisor to Tim Cook and then he'll be
officially gone next year yeah i doubt i
doubt that he's actually going to my
house nothing it's nothing
okay I'll bet you I'll bet you the tip
that uh that force call isn't actually
doing anything it probably has something
to do with like you know options
maturity or something I doubt that he's
you know he's probably on a beach
somewhere who forced all oh you don't
think he's actually advising right now
he's not sitting next to Tim Cook
telling you how to do so today he's
probably just some margaritas on the
beach with rivers night yeah everybody
maybe for Stalin and Rubenstein will
start a new phone company together call
me rod spring guys guys RF there it is
called lounge in the bar and oh yeah
Margaritaville yeah it would be a bunch
of poorly made devices with terrible ski
morphic software I like it because like
a device at Oreo it's like me to do an
order and then like it Oreos like the
pre did and then when you when you Oreo
it open it has an Oreo like a premium on
the screen which like that is very
photorealistic at least get morphic I'm
it's a little bit cartoony of course and
then you Oreo the oreo and then that's
where they are inside dog that's your
unlock gestures on doing you get the
oreo and something like the cute to have
they turn off Wi-Fi you dip it in
different oh like strawberry milk and
chocolate milk that does different
settings think about it just just
contemplate that for a moment I want you
to really get your head around that idea
um I wonder if we need to be doing
anything you know site wise while this
huge news is breaking can you talk can
anybody tell me uh yeah we uh we should
we should have a discussion about that
i'm not sure if we should be doing it
live on the air though i don't think i
don't think alive on the air is the way
to do it I don't know whose idea this uh
this idea this earth this hangout was
anyhow I was like it was actually a
Michael Shane's idea well Michael Shane
is unfortunately now looking for a new
job haha we wanted to do we want to do a
live yeah we wanted to do a live
broadcast for all these announcements
like we did for Apple but uh you can't
our studio is shut down because of the
hurricane uh so this was that
josh Josh I think what you meant to say
is that Michael Shane is advising Joshua
Topolsky until the end of the year yeah
that sounds that sounds about right is
that that means any hook that's
interested yes apparently yeah that's
what I'm getting at Rita that's yeah it
took almost 39 million that doesn't seem
like a lot though if I'm sure it's more
than your Scott Forstall I don't know
its teeth it is like 40 million dollars
that not not for you I mean how much did
Tim Cook get when he became CEO there's
a there was a number there too um what's
that how much it got some like huge
stock uh when he became CEO what was
that um all right now his Kurt his
current total compensation package is
378 million it's not bad yeah that's all
I'd say my Twitter stream right now is
this insane combination of people
freaking out about the hurricane and
people freaking out about apple and like
I can't tell who is more intensely
worried about like the state of the
world but it's like here's a picture of
here's a picture of Hurricane sandy
coming over the East Coast and then
sounds like here's a picture of Scott
Forstall looking sad so here's here's on
the way i'ma talk too much is a Craig
federighi my saying that name that name
had he's that are doing I yeah he's not
doing iOS and I was 10 like he's
overseeing portions of both at this
point trials for the proof that they're
they're combining overtime yeah yeah I
think I think we need to hang on one
second sorry you guys could keep talking
I need to type something into our team
Josh needs to yellow words my way to
worst worst fucking timing ever right or
it's the best fucking timing people get
to see behind the scenes of us freaked
out hey maybe maybe um is even go ahead
it's just funny because you know we
there were so much other Google stuff to
talk about uh
now none of it actually seems very
important it's like they put out in your
tablet you know what happened Apple
fired everyone sorry uh I mean I have to
say this is a pretty astounding set of
moves especially because the way Apple
was set up the way it was telling the
story about the company Coast jobs was
that it had this deep deep bench of
people who could absolutely rely on to
carry forward the spirit of Apple like
this leadership had been personally
selected and trained by jobs to do this
thing it's like they're they're carrying
down that path but the products that
we've seen thus far have been they were
products in the pipeline yeah the
reporting was the iphone 5s last phone
Steve Jobs it like I mean this is a hand
in what this is about the future like
this is like and I want to put this in
perspective there was an article in
Bloomberg a couple months ago right
after Jobs died and it was like four
Sol's the heir apparent it was like four
stalls the guy you know um this team was
was touted there was this tight-knit
team of people that were doing things
you know everybody in their place and to
have to have blown it apart this majorly
is I think says like speaks volumes it
either means like I mean it either means
things are going to start working in a
very different way and working well or
they're gonna start working in a very
different way and maybe not working that
well like I don't know this is like I
don't know this is house cleaning or if
this is like chaos like that's the
question that asked now let's what let's
put things in perspective though because
this has happened before with Rubinstein
it's happened with Fidel uh you know i
mean this this isn't without precedent
it's without precedent in the post jobs
era right right well yeah but the thing
within it happened with paper master who
came in right they they fought IBM to
hire him to they did the antenna for the
iphone 4 and they got rid of him that's
fine uh and I know it's happened before
but I think the level to which they are
completely reorganizing their executive
ranks has not happened before Jana and
you know the thing with Ruby and the
thing with uh with Fidel was that they
were driven out
by Scott Forstall right i mean yeah
those are those of it that was the
personality clash uh you know that with
that with the phone with for Stalin
Fidel it was you know they were gonna
they were deciding whether to build the
phone based on the ipod or yeah they
decided one of the build off the ipod or
bring down a mac and they went with four
stalls let's bring down ls10 uh in that
clash like drove Fidel out of the
company with Rubinstein he was in charge
of like everything for a minute and then
iOS became more important and he left
the company do you what build a
competitor to iOS so that those changes
happen but they happened in the sense
that like Scott Forstall expanded to
fill those voids and that was very clear
that that was happening this is like
he's leaving and to fill the void of
Scott Forstall they have to expand eight
people to like to take over all of his
jobs up I will say this i'm just looking
at this scene this release what's very
interesting to me is that Eddy Cue is
taking over syrian maps because those
are the two I hesitate to call Syria
failure uh but those are the tube
trouble spots but not a runaway not a
runaway success not around those are
those are the two like those are big
huge splashy launch features for two
versions of the US and to think uh yeah
so he was he was not loved by the people
i mean he made some really boneheaded
moves brow it we're talking about ya
mates made some really boneheaded move
so go ahead i want talk about two things
up one to the point earlier you have the
bloomberg piece I don't want to discount
that this isn't just like a trend like
this is just cheap people that quite
frankly had it coming I'd to go back to
a bloomberg businessweek article here's
a quote from it quote some former
associates of forestall none of whom
would comment of course say he routinely
takes credit for collateral successes
and a flex blame for mistakes so even if
he was on a winning streak he was just
so dead so you're saying he did exactly
what jobs did yeah exactly job state but
he didn't waste like well well well
documented well I mean everybody's jobs
you know exactly
this is look this is four stalls next
period I man haha what is his easy if
he's rattling its gattling gun apparent
there is a you gotta hear because I've
got stuff gotta gotta take care of so
you guys carry on yeah I ended by the
way my house is literally starting to
shake with the way the winds getting
really bad here so I'm gonna like I am
gonna like split in a second but I do
want to say I cannot III don't think
that we should we should underestimate
how big of a deal it is that Jony ive is
taking this human what is the exact role
the interface interface hmm an interface
role I mean which which I I assume will
have and I don't know the extent of that
role or what it actually covers my guess
is that it's going to touch on a bunch
of software stuff it makes me frankly
very very excited about what Apple may
do in the future software wise I there
there has not been a new hand on the
wheel there for a while and I don't know
how much this role is actually in the
nuts and bolts of the software but if
Johnny ive has a kind of girl that he
has anything like what he has in
hardware and software we could see a sea
change in some of their software some of
the other software functions which i
think is how quickly do you think you'll
take the faux leather out of the
calendar app that's all I need to get
six months do you think it's two years
let me go do this liquid do this way if
I were at at Apple right now um you know
they very very clever gestures a very
good user interface ideas but I would be
looking at what people are dreaming I
mean some of the stuff that that Google
showed us with the camera with this one
handed a circular menu that you can
reach with just one thumb from anywhere
on the screen I mean this stuff is like
wild like futuristic new interface ideas
and Apple is so far away from that right
now they're so they're so locked into
what they've created I think that
they've got a gigantic opportunity to
look around and to innovate on what
other people are doing and I mean Johnny
ive is a guy who can obviously take up
something that is a familiar form and
make it very new so uh I i I'm like I'm
actually kind of like psyched about this
I mean this is a cool weird move I think
that it says a lot about what Apple
wants to do I think it says that they
are hearing I think they're hearing some
of the criticisms are obviously not
happy with the map situation and some of
the other stuff they've gotten hell from
the press for and from users and I think
that putting Johnny I've in this role
means they're taking a different look at
it they're taking a different angle
which is which is excited I mean I think
it's really different I mean I think the
interesting too is a any q's now taking
maps in Syria he also did mobileme I
mean those things are all argue be
platform agnostic and Craig is now
controlling iOS and i was 10 i mean it's
clearly like there's a unification going
on not just with the corporate you know
personnel but also with the platforms
itself yeah right i mean now here's my
question Eddy Cue is responsible for
itunes right yeah yeah what why is he
not going out with forestall here Eddy
Cue should have left Apple five years
ago why uh because itunes is a flaming
pile of garbage yeah it's kind of charge
of the app you're not the app he's in
charge of the store so basically
anything with a server component you
mean he used to Eddy Cue yeah yeah yeah
I just the stores over which actually
makes so that actually makes sense that
he would take Syrian maps on the other
both infrastructure problems exactly so
he's responsible for the front end uh
Rob or iTunes App team yeah 24 stores
though I mean horse all must have some
hand in it right if he's if he's leading
the software design for iOS I mean he is
right hey right uh and I have to say you
know like Eddy Cue has a different vibe
to him than any other Apple executive
like he's the guy who makes the deals
with other people and he's clearly very
good at it so you know what Apple needs
to improve Syrian maps is they gotta go
make the deals right they gotta make
deals for better map data or figure out
how to hire people to build better map
data and with Siri they got to make the
deals for additional content sources
I'll make the service actually useful on
and like you know that's what Eddy Cue
does and I've to say he's also my
favorite apple presenter because he
like what girl shit we did huh it's
great he's late playback yeah that's
what you're saying all right I guess
dear point hey Laura I honestly I gotta
go because I think we've there's some
hatton that some some I need to batten
some hatches here there's there this
does seem to be a day that we will not
likely forget anytime in the near future
I wanna and I want to leave you with
with well wishes yeah you guys don't
make it it was great knowing you great
working with you and I think actually I
feel good forestall Josh yeah you wanna
you wanna you wanna just take the sound
Josh we can wrap this up i think we've
exhausted everything how do you hey what
would you open it with a song what do
you say to that i see it's a verge cast
say goodbye to the verge cast yeah okay
well that's our verge cast for the week
I guess I mean these are weeks is it
because it's a special edition verge
cast no one next week we'll do a real
one next week if the studio is still
there yes we do well next week we have
our anniversary verge cast do we not
yeah I think it's gonna be friday I know
if you guys realize this if whoever is
you guys not everybody here cuz you guys
realize this but but but november first
will be our one year a birthday of the
verb just crazy so what a way to go out
what a month to go out on right I'm so
how this routine will kill like okay
like you taken we're getting like you
know completely destroyed by the
hurricane and we had you know they've
pretty much news is over now this is the
end of technology news as we know yeah
yeah I I do i need to do a proper wrap
up here you don't have I think we're
done we're done they're good it was
great hanging out with you guys I really
enjoyed i look forward to Arden it ah I
hope I survive the night all right thank
you everybody for tuning in I know this
was a this was hacked together it was a
lot of fun all right let's go retinues
