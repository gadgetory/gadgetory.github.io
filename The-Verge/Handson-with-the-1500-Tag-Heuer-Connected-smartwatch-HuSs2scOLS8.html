are here in New York looking at the
brand new Tag Heuer Carrera connected
watch it's a new SmartWatch from the
Swiss watchmaker company runs Android
wear it's got a touch screen like you'd
expect on an Android wear device and it
happens to have an Intel chip inside the
watch itself it looks like a classic Tag
Heuer watch it looks very similar to the
company's analog line of watches that
the Carrera line the body itself is made
out of titanium it makes it really light
it's it's it's strikingly light you'd
expect it to weigh a bit more if you're
familiar with watches of this size the
face of the watch is 46 millimeters
definitely makes it large you can see it
next to my Moto 360 here which is about
the same size face this is definitely a
big watch it's kind of designed for a
man's wrist though tag says that they
will be introducing a women's model at
some point in the future it's got a
rubber strap titanium deployment clasp
there so you can see that and then on
the bottom it's got a charging connector
point for its to recharge your battery
which I say will last about a day of use
of course the big thing with this watch
is that it's going to cost fifteen
hundred dollars you can buy it today
online or at a handful of tag boutiques
but this is definitely a luxury watch
it's designed to compete against the
highest priced Apple watches which run
all the way up to $17,000 but there are
some in a thousand a fifteen hundred
dollar range and it's definitely the
most expensive Android wear watch we've
seen yet one of the unique things about
this is that buyers will be able to
trade it in towards an analogue tag
watch at some point in the future if
they are tired of having the SmartWatch
or just want something that will last
forever there you go that's a quick look
at the Tag Heuer Carrera connected
SmartWatch running Android wear</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
