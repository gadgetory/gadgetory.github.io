of course we got a lot of folk are make
out of wood if we are near a place
producing a lot of stone we kind of folk
are producing soul since then has no
nature resource but it has a gigantic
and atrani manufacture base so people
here that experiment with electronics
because this becoming the nature
resource of censored
welcome to the Watchung Bay market a
gadget lovers paradise tucked into these
tiny stalls you can find the parts you
need to make a new phone tablet or
computer you can design a hover board or
come up with the next big thing think of
this as the front office for the massive
electronic supply chain that stretches
across China it's not just a place to
produce but is also as a place to find
components by inspiration and finding a
new way of doing things so we walk
around
that's component for everything the
circuit board for everything that's
casing for everything and if you want to
create a new product it's coming in and
realized I can put all this piece
together and with the back in of this
supply chain this will be ready to ship
in the mode this market is the beating
heart of Shenzhen a city built on the
consumer electronics industry so
Shenzhen was designated as these the
first special economic zone 30 years ago
as the well China wants to experiment
with capitalism Center is the city of 15
million people but it's responsible for
at least 80% of the electronic for 7
billion people 97% of the PC and milk
books are producing sentient some 87
percent of a mobile format producing
center along with whole sort of other
electronics
the density of the manufacturer the
scale manufactured here is unprecedented
this is the hub serving the whole war's
name for electronics the watering Bay
Market has long been known as a place
where Outsiders could come to secure
components and contract for
manufacturing but over the last decade
it has increasingly moved up the food
chain to design and engineer its own
creations Shenzhen has a very big
industrial design industry 4,000
industrial design house 150 thousand
working industrial designer so designs
here engineering is here and this has
been the advantage of the ecosystem
that's how this ecosystem can pop up
anything coming to their mind some of
this innovation is easy to see the
Shenzhen based startup DJI has emerged
as the global leader in the drone market
thanks to the engineering talent and
manufacturing base has access to in its
hometown but some of that innovation
happens without a big brand name or
media story it was the rapid
experimentation and iteration around
gadgets in places like watch on Bay that
gave birth to the selfie stick and the
hover board which popped up in this
market years before they became hits
around the world as Shenzhen evolves so
too has the outside perception of China
and it's placed in the world's
technology industry for years ago if
anyone any journalists come in take a
shot of this the head light will always
be China copycat piratey iPhone that has
totally shift in the past four years
right now the same footage the subtitle
is sentient
innovations future
