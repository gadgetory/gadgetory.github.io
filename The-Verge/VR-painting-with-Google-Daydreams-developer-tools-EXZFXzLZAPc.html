with the very beginning of Google
daydream
what does daydream you might ask it's
Google's VR platform that's supposed to
be much more advanced than Google
cardboard which had introduced a couple
of years ago it's mobile virtual reality
that actually comes with a motion
controller so daydream isn't actually
coming out until this fall when we start
saying all the hardware that's going to
come with it
daydream compatible phones the actual
headset the actual controller but the
latest Android n Developer Preview does
have some virtual reality features that
are meant for people to just get a taste
of what daydream can do so they can
develop their own apps so let's take a
look at this so what we've got here is a
painting app that Google is suggesting
you use to see sort of how daydream will
function and what you can do is launch
this on the Nexus 6p phone which again
is the only phone that Google actually
considers a development kit it's saying
it's not a daydream phone you're not
going to be able to use it for the final
daydream and it's going to be a little
bit substandard in terms of performance
it's going to start throttling when it
gets too hot but for now it's good
enough so obviously this doesn't look
very much like an actual controller and
Google doesn't quite have a solution for
this but I have something kind of clever
it has an overlay that you can print out
and put over your phone so it looks less
like a phone I guess and more like a
controller and you can just focus on
these buttons so we're gonna tape this
on right now and we're gonna start
painting you start painting with the
controller you double tap the trackpad
to start drawing a line and it actually
will use the accelerometer and gyroscope
to detect motion and do a pretty good
job of emulating motion control so this
is really different from what you'd see
on the the HTC vive or the oculus rift
because there's no camera tracking this
stuff it's not actually telling you
where this is in space what it can do is
tell okay how far is this moving what
direction is it moving and it can
actually do a really good job of
predicting where it is based on that so
there's actually a much more popular
google app called tilt brush which is
for the HTC vive it's a really
sophisticated painting tool
this is a little bit like tilt brush but
it actually highlights one of the big
differences between daydream and
something like the vibe which is that
when you're painting in tilt brush you
can actually walk around the room and
see your painting in three dimensions
now daydream isn't going to have this
positional tracking what it has is it
can tell which way your head is turning
so you can't actually see these things
that you're drawing in three dimensions
it's sort of like you're painting flat
on a cylinder it looks really cool but
it's not quite the same thing and this
is sort of why it might be hard to bring
something like tilt brush over to
daydream so obviously I'm not trying
daydream this isn't really what daydream
is going to be like but it does give me
some hope that these trackers could be
pretty good if the final controller is
as precise as this then it's actually
very accurate it's a little bit slow and
a little bit laggy if I move very
quickly in weird directions right now
but I think that you can easily use it
for painting or for selecting things or
for playing simple games it actually
makes me really excited about later this
year
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
