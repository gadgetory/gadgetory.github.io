and we're looking at Windows RT 8.1 or
much less surface RT now as you can see
it's pretty much the same as Windows 8.1
and so they're putting in all the
similar improvements they've detail
recently get the snapping side-by-side
and you can adjust that like so and
you've also still got the desktop mode
and so it's literally still here you're
not going to use the sort of traditional
desktop applications but explorers here
and a desktop version of ie Levin so
kind of similar stuff that we've got at
the moment in terms of performance it
seems a little bit better at loading
apps and loading web pages if we scroll
through here to see it it's kind of
picking up and if we open up the Xbox
music application which is traditionally
this was a little slow to open it's
still slow to open applications and it
takes a little while to sort of render
them here it seems a little bit faster
then I say on surface RT at the moment
mostly still in beta so there could be
additional improvements down the road
and other than that this particular
device doesn't have office on it and but
most of tells us that that that won't be
the case if you install it on your
surface RT today just this particular
one other than that pretty much the same
as 8.1 and not really much much else to
note and that was Windows RT 8.1 running
on the Microsoft Surface RT</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
