experience mars event to pop up in new
york city that's supposed to simulate
what living on Mars might be like and
their piece de resistance is 360 landing
on Mars experience it combines virtual
reality this suspended cable car slash
roller coaster type thing to show you
what it might be like to enter the
Martian atmosphere and then land on its
surface alright we're in the control
room clearly there's a lot of space in
front of me
oh it's preparing for it oh there's Mars
I see it happening here we go entering
that over well yeah entering the
atmosphere is not bad fun thinner than
Earth's but still poses a problem
hopefully our heat shield is holding up
now we're going in oh there's the sky
it's nice and red not I'm gonna settle
oh and we're tilting a lot I don't know
how we're gonna land up right NatGeo is
fictional ship the Dauntless uses
supersonic retropropulsion to land on
the Martian surface
it's what Elon Musk is proposed for
landing on Mars as well it's the idea of
using the engines to slow your fall down
to the planet's surface
so my technical specialty is
on Mars and so the landing portion was
very important to me and I wanted it to
be you know as correct as possible so
everything from the shape of the ship to
have the right lift-to-drag ratio for
the flight through the Mars atmosphere
to the use of supersonic retropropulsion
technology to light up the thrusters
when we're still traveling very fast
towards the Mars surface and use those
thrusters to move to just the right
location on the on the ground at Mars
all of that was based on my experience
designing similar things now we're at a
cab Canyon ok I think we should have
taken some more time to find our landing
spot here it is oh ok ok all right now
we're landing hopefully on a flat
surface flat surface see ok great
we made it Nat Geo and SpaceX is way of
landing on Mars is a great idea there's
a lot of testing that we need to do to
make sure that it actually works and
before we're confident enough to use it
to land people on the surface of Mars
you see landing on Mars is really tough
as we saw with EXO Mars is Schiaparelli
Lander which actually made a new crater
on the surface of Mars because it came
in way too fast but in the meantime it's
still really cool to visualize what it
might be like to land people on the
surface of another planet
oh goodness and my feet are barely
touching
Oh No
I'm having again</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
