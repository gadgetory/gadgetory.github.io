this is the Samsung Galaxy s4 its brand
new flagship phone from Samsung so the
first thing you notice is that it's not
actually that different from the galaxy
s3 it has kind of the same design ID the
same even feel in your hand it's a
little slimmer a little lighter but
basically the same kind of feel there
are a bunch of things that are different
though the screen is bigger it's a
5-inch 1080p Super AMOLED display and it
has a pentile pixel layout which we
don't love but the screen looks great
and it's super high-res and really
shouldn't cause any problems it's also
more powerful than ever it has the
Exynos 5 processor and either comes with
that or a Qualcomm chip depending on the
region you're in comes with 16 32 or 64
gigs of internal storage plus a microSD
slot and it's coming with Android 4.2.2
jelly bean which is the latest version
of Android and not a lot of phones
launched with that which is pretty
exciting Samsung's trying to do a lot of
crazy software things and they really
need power to pull it off so one of the
big things Tim some talked about is the
camera there's a 13 megapixel camera on
the back of the phone and a 2 megapixel
camera on the front and that allows them
to do a lot of different things one is
this dual shot mode where you can
actually see the front and rear cameras
at the same time and they brought some
of the Galaxy camera modes to this
device as well so it's definitely the
most powerful camera ever we'll have to
test it out more to see how it actually
does there's all kinds of wild software
stuff on this phone and you can see just
from all the things you have to enable
or disable that there's a lot going on
here one of the big things is called air
gesture and basically what it lets you
do is swipe through photos or scroll in
your web browser without ever actually
touching the phone so you can just
scroll right through all your photos
without having to touch and you can do
the same in a web browser or you can
scroll through your tabs and it's kind
of a gimmicky thing but it does seem to
work relatively well and it's cool if
your hands are dirty or wet or what
happened
there's also air view which i think is
even cooler so in the browser without
actually touching the screen you just
sort of hover over it and then you can
pick what you want to see and even
Flipboard has done some things with it
so that you can hover over it and see
stories within a particular section
without ever actually having to touch it
one of the biggest things and sort of
the most surprising from Samsung is
health they love putting us in front of
things and and they're basically trying
to replace Fitbit and the FuelBand and
all these different things so there's a
pedometer and a temperature and humidity
gauge inside this phone and it'll
actually track your steps as you walk or
it'll track your heart rate by a device
that works the Bluetooth or it'll track
the temperature and humidity and it'll
tell you all these things about kind of
how you're doing over time you can see
you know I'm weird in kind of an ugly
hotel room so surroundings are poor and
you can track the food that you're
eating and all these different stuff so
it's all built into here and they're
selling some add-on accessories as well
and it's just a pretty clever thing it
seems like something that should have
been built into your phone forever ago
and it's gonna be interesting to see how
this works there's also a group play
Samsung loves doing things that involve
lots of their different phones and in
group play you can set a music or photos
or documents or what-have-you to all of
the different phones at the same time
and it'll sync music so you can listen
as a group and again we've seen a lot of
these features on Samsung devices before
and they're kind of gimmicky and we
don't necessarily use them a lot but
they're relatively clever features so
there's also an IR blaster inside the
device which lets you use this to
control your TV and your whole home
theater and they use some of the same
technology they've used before they're
using peel's TV guides so you can see
kind of what's on TV and flip through
and use it to actually control your
set-top box and there's on-demand
content all this stuff that you can
watch on your phone and then push
straight to your TV it's kind of
approximating airplay plus a bunch of
extra TV Guide functionality and it's
pretty cool and other devices and as a
smart thing to have here so that's
really it this one's gonna be out on all
four major US carriers in the second
quarter of this year it's also gonna be
on some regional carriers and be all
over the world there's no word on
pricing yet except to say that it's
going to be a very premium phone and
this is definitely Samsung's flagship
device going forward and that is the
Samsung Galaxy s4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
