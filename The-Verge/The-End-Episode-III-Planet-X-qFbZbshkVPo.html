give me the concept I wrap English
around it and that's theta talk us first
contacted when i was around seven or
eight years old down in the marsh at my
grandmother's house and that they just
popped out from behind a tree i didn't
feel any bad vibes they were the little
ones maybe three and a half feet tall
not intimidating they took me on their
little ship and checked out how my
joints worked checked on my forehead for
some reason which later I got this very
dramatic scar and I realized that they
had put in some sort of little metal
balls to encourage brain growth in that
area the first thing that came out when
i started zeta talk in 1995 was the
cataclysms that they were predicting the
pole shift and they wanted to create
detail about this there is a rogue
planet coming through that comes through
every 3,600 years or so what it does
when it's a big magnet and as it turns
and points its North Pole toward us we
you know pull our North Pole to the side
and therefore the crust separates from
the core and stays where it got shoved
in this case we're going to have a very
severe pole shift in the near future and
it's going to put a tip of Brazil as the
North Pole and India down to be the new
South Pole this is not a pole shift as
it's frequently used you know the poles
are drifting in the magnetism you know
we're going to the North Pole we'll just
sort of drift somewhere and drift around
this is actual crustal shift the Thetas
are not allowed to tell us when the pole
shift will happen they can only give us
a sequence of events which they have
done in excruciating detail two months
ahead of time we'll go into what they
call the last week's lots of twisting
and turning including a severe wobble
three days of darkness for the northern
hemisphere
fear the Earth's slowing rotation to a
stop for five point nine days and then
the terrible hour of the pole shift when
that 90 degree switch will happen but
they are not allowed to tell us which
year which month because the zeta's
cannot give a date nor can any valid
alien visitors give a date they cannot
and Jesus said young shall know the date
of my return and by that is meant it's a
secret and the reason is if you tell the
date you know to allow people to prepare
the bad guys will take advantage of it
you've got to deal with that ninety
percent of the population is expected to
die and move on to your next incarnation
ninety percent and some of its going to
be drowning and drowning I can tell you
it's not painful and how do I know that
because when I went to talk to mj-12
they had me tortured and one of the
tortures was too pinched my nose hold my
mouth until I passed out and I can tell
you what happens I knew I wasn't
supposed to be killed so I wasn't
anxious the lungs work like crazy you
know and then it's a blackout and then
you wake up after about 20 minutes so
it's not painful if your peaceful about
dying it's it's not anxious and or the
building's crashing down on you you know
clunking you on the head but most of
that ninety percent is going to be
starvation people are going to sit down
be depressed and just give up and just
let them sell starve and by the way
starvation isn't painful you go into
kind of a coma you know so so it's
better if people would get away from the
coastlines and decide to die like let's
the oldsters are agreeing to starve off
and let the food go to the youngins
that's more loving and remember what you
carry forward in your soul the love you
feel that's what's permanent if you want
to do something to help others you'll
get a you'll get a call you'll get a
visit from the good-hearted aliens if
you want to do somebody in be selfish
and greedy or then you're going to get a
visit from the bad aliens that's how it
works so think good thoughts you weren't
really advising people to drought their
dogs were you yeah you were well in the
end the fact is they're gonna starve or
be injured and they're going to be in a
worse situation you just take them to
the vet and they and they give them a
shot you done gone did you do this turn
oddly yes dr. little no Nancy how old
were your dogs when you suck them to put
him down oh this one was only 18 months
because what are you going to be those
dog what if there's a food shortage in
all your neighbors can't go to the
grocery store you know a dog makes a
good meal Oh
make sure your dog is missing the good
guys get to reincarnate here on earth
which is why Jesus said I shall return
thousand years of peace a home for the
meek cetera meaning and the bad guys go
to a prison planet where they have to
live with each other so you didn't have
Genghis Khan Dick Cheney Hitler you know
and everybody trying to determine who
has to clean the toilets right and those
people who haven't really become either
good or bad it hauled off to a water
planet to become a reincarnating in and
octopi and let me tell you that's not as
bad as it sounds I know I was allowed to
I was allowed to go out of body into an
octopus to find out what it felt like
and I was stunned and so sensual I can't
tell you it's actually preferable to
being a hominoid I'll tell you that I
was lined up with all kinds of aliens in
mj-12 facilities I mean weird types big
amoebas you know octopus hominoids you
know from this to that skinny you know
or whatever one guy that I call like a
springy guy he could Boing his head way
up or his arms way out like they were
slinking think I called in slinky man
obviously the government knows and they
lie lie lie why they're afraid of your
messy planning they don't want you may
what are they going to do here's real
estate on the coast everyone's going to
say who's going to compensate us it's
like hurricane sandy in New Jersey in
New York who's going to compensate your
half of a look pick up and go inland and
become a goat herder I mean this is what
the government's got to say to people
and they choke on it and they get these
phone calls and they just deep six you
know they pry to pretend it's not
happening
it's you that it's ignorant and stupid
you don't know what you're looking I am
an astronomer and I can tell you it's
right where it should be that's their
line I think the pole shift will happen
in my lifetime for sure in the first
place I'm being kept alive I I do too
good a job would say to talk to be
clunked out you know no rest for the
weary but but I would say it's AI don't
want to give a timeframe I I don't think
it's going to be in 2013 I think we're
going to have months and potentially
years in which of the earth changes are
severe you know where we have sinkholes
and dropping bridges and blackout but as
one of my best friends says it's all
about spirituality and the satyrs have a
phrase that I put on the website love
will have a blooming going into the
shift with the realization of those with
great love in their hearts that love is
the only thing that matters</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
