SmartWatch the ioniq even though the
company has made work out watches before
this is the first watch that it's put
out that it's running on its own
operating system can run apps can make
payments basically it acts like a
SmartWatch and it has a claim of 5 days
of battery life on a single charge is
this too good to be true ok so if you've
been following fit that you know that
this has been rumored for months and now
it's finally here it's late to the
SmartWatch game and at $299 it happens
to be the most expensive Fitbit ever but
this isn't really about how it compares
to other fit bits it's about how it
performs as a SmartWatch I'm gonna get
the bad stuff out of the way first and
that's its looks it's got a pretty
angulated edges and a big bezel it's
supposed to have a spherical display
it's described as that but it looks
pretty flat to me if it said the design
of this was partly inspired by space
literally space like space exploration
or space and pop culture or whatever
crazy thing Elon Musk has said lately
about space
I get where they're going with this but
personally I didn't really love the
design and this is one of the areas
where this really differs from the Apple
watch and I think Apple has done a
pretty nice job of designing a somewhat
elegant looking SmartWatch and this
doesn't feel that way despite how
unattractive I found it there are a
couple things worth noting about the
builds of it good that used a process
with the ionic called the nano molding
to fuse metal and plastic into one
continuous part which is a process
that's used a lot in mobile phones but
not too often in wearables this is
supposed to improve antenna performance
and therefore improve accuracy
especially when it comes to things like
GPS it has a new heart rate sensor
module you can see the patterns are
different on the underside here when you
compare it to the blaze which was the
previous Fitness watch from Fitbit and
it has 2.5 gigabytes of internal storage
for apps and music let's talk about how
well it works it is a lot of the same
fitness stuff that other fitbit's do but
it's the SmartWatch stuff that puts it
into another category it's running
Fitbit OS which is v its own operating
system this means the ionic can run
third party apps and it's launching with
a few specific partner apps like Strava
and Starbucks and Pandora but the idea
is really that any developer can build a
5th ed app now if they want to the anak
also has payments now so you can have to
pay at pretty much any NFC equipped
payment terminal of course one of the
most important elements of the overall
usability of a SmartWatch is how well
its interfaces design and I have to say
I found the Fitbit ionic to be pretty
intuitive I didn't even need a tutorial
when I first put it on use this physical
home button here to get home you swipe
from left to right to see battery life
you swipe from right to left
to see things like your exercise at a
glance your apps your music your wallet
alarms whether things like that use
these two buttons on the right hand side
here to start and stop workouts the only
thing that didn't feel quite as
intuitive was swiping up for
notifications which goes against pretty
much every touchscreen interface I've
used before but even that I got used to
quickly speaking of notifications that's
definitely another downside to this
Smart Watch they don't really act all
that differently from other fitbit's
before it you can see notifications you
can get them for both iOS and Android
phones and you can swipe them away or
you can opt to clear all of them if you
want but because there's no speaker and
no microphone built into the ionic
there's no way to respond to things like
messages and there are no shortcuts to
respond to anything either so that was
one of the dummer aspect of this
SmartWatch if you've ever used a Fitbit
before a lot of the fitness tracking
features on this watch are going to feel
familiar there are some new things but
first the basics it tracks your steps
your calories burned your stairs climbed
your sleep you have a newer Fitbit it
tracks your heartrate it does that thing
where it auto detects whatever exercise
you've started doing so even if you
didn't manually start an exercise the
Fitbit should probably pick up on what
it was and will categorize it as that
exercise and earlier this year Fitbit
rolled out a whole bunch of new sleep
tracking features there anything really
granular with how you're sleeping but
these are some of the new
first there is the heart rate sensor sip
that claims this is the most advanced
ever in a Fitbit in fact the attic has
something called a relative SP o2 sensor
that measures your oxygen saturation in
your blood that sensor isn't really
being used for anything just yet now
heart rate sensing from the wrist can
always be a little bit of a crapshoot I
have tested it during a couple workouts
so far while comparing it to the reading
coming from a chest strap which tends to
be more accurate and sometimes I did
notice discrepancies between what the
Fitbit was saying and what the chest
strap was telling me but in general I
think you have to test these things over
a long period of time you have to get a
lot of data you should probably be doing
it in some type of official lab in order
to really say how well it's performing
Fitbit is also saying that GPS is more
accurate because of the way the watch is
built in my experience so far distances
on familiar routes were in line with
what I normally see but again I still
have more testing to do there's also a
new run detect feature which not only
automatically recourse that you're
running but records more specific
details like your distance and your pace
your splits your elevation your heart
rate all just when you start running now
if you look at this and you were to
compare to the Apple watch which is a
pretty good fitness tracker you'll
notice a lot of the things are the same
they both have GPS they're waterproof
you can swim with them they track
elevation they track very specific
exercise sessions and they aim to show
you all this information in a separate
mobile app but hands-down the best
feature of the Fitbit ionic is its
battery life if it claims up to five
days of battery life on a single charge
with this thing and that's certainly not
the case with Apple watch which usually
lasts about a day to a day and a half in
my experience I put it on fully charged
on a Wednesday afternoon and by the
following Monday morning I still had
about 25% battery life left but yeah I
got nearly five days out of it which is
pretty impressive of course if you are
using GPS a lot or you have the display
always-on which I didn't you can expect
battery life to diminish
if you have GPS on constantly you can
get about 10 hours of it but otherwise
it's reasonable to expect about four to
five days of battery life with this
thing so where does that leave us
I'll be honest I didn't have super high
expectations for the Fitbit ionic when I
first heard about it and that's partly
because it's so late to the SmartWatch
game and partly because I heard there
were some production issues leading up
to the launch of the watch but now that
I have it and I've been using it I've
been pleasantly surprised by how well it
works but I still have two misgivings
about this watch the first is its looks
I just don't think it's designed as
elegantly as other smartwatches and the
second are its SmartWatch features a lot
of people get smartwatches these days
because they want notifications on the
wrist that they can look at respond to
interact with in some way
send shortcut responses to see calendar
appointments whatever it might be and
the fit that ionic just doesn't do that
it does show you notifications but
you're kind of limited in what you can
do aside from that so I think that's one
of its biggest downsides really I think
this is a Fitness watch first that
happens to have some SmartWatch features
and not a SmartWatch that doubles as a
Fitness watch which is what the Apple
watch has managed to do so I think that
if here's someone who really wants
notifications in an interactive way from
your wrist you're going to want to look
at an Android wear watch or an Apple
watch because you're gonna want
something that integrates better with
your phone and actually let you do stuff
from your wrist but if you're looking at
something that's really focused on
Fitness does some SmartWatch stuff run
some apps and by the way you happen to
really like Fitbit then this is actually
a good choice Jannik the Bionic the
iconic the chronic a sonic boom
the sonic they should have called it
this sonic the Fitbit sonic</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
