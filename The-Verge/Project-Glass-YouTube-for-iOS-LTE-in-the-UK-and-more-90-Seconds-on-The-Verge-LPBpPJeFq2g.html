robertson and we're in the calm before
the storm this is 90 seconds on the
verge in anticipation of Apple dropping
its built-in YouTube app google has
released an all new standalone version
for iphone and ipod touch the new and
improved app uses an interface that's
very similar to the Google+ app the
company says a standalone iPad app will
be due in the coming months meanwhile a
decidedly YouTube free version of iOS 6
will be on display at tomorrow's iphone
5 event and UK carrier EE is set to
launch the country's first 4G LTE
network in the coming weeks launch
devices reportedly include the galaxy s3
and Nokia's Lumia 920 at an event in
London ee CEO Olaf Swantee evokes the
famous Steve Jobs expression and one
more thing when indicating more devices
would be announced shortly that's either
a subtle hint of a 4G LTE iphone or
proof positive that Swantee is well kind
of a troll and finally news that has
nothing to do with Apple here's Google's
Project Glass the company's heads up
display appeared on the catwalk at Diane
von Furstenberg show for New York
Fashion Week a number of photos from the
models point of view have been posted on
Google+ but they're really not as
interesting as you might think
additionally google co-founder sergey
brin explains to the wall street journal
some of the available voice commands
such as ok glass and take a photo no
word on other methods of input but
there's obviously going to be some way
people can take a photo without shouting
and that's it for today's top stories
tune in tomorrow for something entirely
unrelated to Apple just kidding</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
