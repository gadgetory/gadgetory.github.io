here at Nokia's event in New York City
where they just announced this the Lumia
1020 basically it's a fairly normal
Lumia phone when you first look at it
its rounded and has sort of chunky and
big but it feels really good and sturdy
in the hand it's running Windows 8 it
has all of Nokia's here apps they just
announced a new update for maps which is
pretty nice but honestly none of that
really matters on this device all the
matters here is the camera so it's a 41
megapixel PureView camera this is just
like the 808 but they've changed a lot
of things they made a lot of things
better and so far it seems pretty
fantastic so one of the big things is
control on this thing you can see you
can change white balance you can change
exposure you can change everything and
you can see it all on the camera as you
work which is pretty cool so you can see
all of the changes you're making as you
go you can do the same with a bunch of
different things this feels a little
like the galaxy camera used to from
Samsung but in this case it's probably
even easier to use and then ultimately
all it does is take great pictures nokia
has some some big zoom features that
they're allowing you to do both before
and after you take a shot you can look
around it's really sharp capturing a lot
of detail and there's all sorts of stuff
you can do with to edit the photos when
you're done with them but mostly this is
focused on just taking really good
pictures that's why you have sort of
this chunky 41 megapixel lens on the
back it's really the only thing that
changes this from some of the other
Lumia cameras it has a xenon flash which
is nice so it'll actually flash instead
of just bursting light in your face but
it's big and sort of sits awkwardly on a
table but it's all in service of taking
these really beautiful pictures and
though we'll need some more time to
spend of it before we see it really
seems to so far so it's coming to ATT
for $299 and that is the Nokia Lumia
1020</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
