as you all know it has been a
challenging year for Samsung today we
are proud map the beginning of a new era
of smartphone design on era without
edges were limits I give you the Galaxy
s8 and as eight-plus
Thank You DJ the galaxy si will
fundamentally change how you use your
phone by giving you more screen in a
completely new form factor the Infinity
display has an incredible end to end
screen that spills over the phone sides
forming a completely smooth continuous
surface the entire front of the phone is
pure pristine glass which flows
seamlessly into the aluminum shell
we took a five-point inch piece of glass
6.2 inches for the Galaxy S a plus and
we rounded the corners and curved the
edges even with more screen the phone
feels small and comfortable in your hand
but with curved edges we realized that
we could increase the size of display
without sacrificing that comfortable
grip we reorganize the phone's interior
that way we can stretch the usable
surface of the phone over basically the
entire front of the device in fact the
Galaxy s8 is the first mobile device to
earn a mobile HDR premium certification
from the UHD alliance we've teamed up
with Amazon Prime video in others to
bring you HDR content to mobile you can
stream movies and shows like Amazon's
award-winning original series in its
original crisp realistic colors right
from your phone and with the Galaxy S a
there's also a new clear view standing
color some of you might be wondering
what happened to the home button well
it's still there but to give you more
screen we move the home button beneath
the Infinity display
and with a combination of hardware and
software we made sure response the
pressure just like a physical button
would the Galaxy s8 brings together
design technology and user experience in
a device that looks and feels like none
other and you can make it your own by
choosing from one of five stunning
colors when we introduce the
award-winning galaxy s7 camera we raise
the bar for taking photos in low light
with the first ever dual pixel sensor on
a mobile device we've taken that same
revolutionary technology and
incorporated it into the Galaxy s8
I mean haven't you ever wished that you
could take like multiple photos of the
same monent moment and then combine the
best attributes of those photos to
create the perfect shot well that's what
multi frame image processing does it
uses multiple images to reduce noise and
boost brightness when you need it most
we take millions of selfies every day
that's why we made our front-facing
camera even better it now has an eight
megapixel sensor an autofocus that
detects your face so we became one of
the first manufacturers to make our
devices water and dust resistant
fast-forward to today and you can use
your Galaxy s8 inside and outside in
real-life environments without worrying
that a rain storm will ruin your day or
your phone that's why we created a new
10 nanometer smart phone processor for
the Galaxy S 8 that means that 10,000 of
our transistors can fit on the width of
a human hair brazil is a mobile
processor that's faster and more
powerful than any other we've ever made
assuring a new standard for the
smartphone of course when you do need to
recharge we've always believed it should
be easy and convenient of course I mean
we pioneered fast and wireless charging
our newest wireless charging pad gives
you more options letting you lay your
phone flat or prop it up so you can see
the screen we put the Galaxy s8 through
our toughest safety testing process ever
with an eight point battery safety check
that goes beyond the industry standard
because quality and safety is and
remains our top priority
so Samsung we saw an opportunity to make
users lives safer and easier through
biometric authentication now instead of
typing a password you are the password
one of the most exciting examples of
this is the iris scanner which maps your
iris and creates a unique digital
signature and eye print instead of a
fingerprint sometimes you just really
want to get into your phone really
quickly so we've perfected a form of
biometrics that lets you do exactly that
it's called face recognition you just
hold your essay in front of your face
and it will pull up your home screen
instantly you can still use the
fingerprint scanner we've moved that to
the back of the phone to make space for
all that extra screen but the s8 also
lets you check charge of your actual
life or your well-being with Samsung
health we've partnered with leading
online providers like American well in
the u.s. to bring you our new ask an
expert feature you can connect with a
doctor online within minutes at a time
that works for you we are thrilled to
announce the Galaxy S 8 will be
available starting April 21st every
galaxy s 8 will come with a pair of
top-of-the-line ear buds from AKG also
to be sold separately for $99 I could
not be more excited to share with you an
innovation that will completely change
the way you use your mobile phone Meade
bixby it's a new intelligent interface
that reimagines the user explodable user
experience Bigsby understands context it
knows what's happening on your screen
all I have to do is open up Maps
press the convenient bixby button on the
side of the phone and say capture this
and send to Cindy Bigsby understands
when I say capture this that's context
awareness now let's say I have multiple
Cindy's in my phone Oh Bigsby smart
enough to know when it needs more
information and it will let me choose
which what I mean beyond voice Bixby's
intelligence is embedded deep into the
camera and thanks to our partners you
can search for images learn about
landmarks shop online and even translate
languages if you see something you want
to buy just point the camera at it and
Bixby will find it from one of our
partners but Bixby also learns and
adapts to your routine to anticipate
what you need when you swipe to the
right on the home screen Bixby takes you
to a contextual personalized page that
shows you the information you use from
the apps you use on in one convenient
place Bixby will support native apps and
third-party apps like Google Play Music
so with the Galaxy s8 we're fulfilling
the original promise of IOT giving you
access to Samsung and smart things
devices there was single app it's called
Samson Connect but the real power of the
app is that you can monitor and control
your devices from miles away
now even with all of these smart
connected devices sometimes even basic
connectivity can be a problem and that's
why we're introducing Samson Connect
home it's a premium router and IOT hub
in one and it lets you control samsung
and smart things appliances to enhance
your iot options introducing the all new
gear 360 it's more portable with an
enhanced grip that fits comfortably in
your hand it shoots in brilliant 4k
and now you can live broadcast your
experiences in real time on Facebook
YouTube or something we are we've got a
special surprise for everyone here in
the audience today in staff instead of
just showing you the new guru 360 we
want you to be the very first people to
try it out for yourselves what do you
think about that
that was pretty cool right we created
some song deck it's a new productivity
tool that lets you power a desktop
experience right from your phone
accessing samsung decks is super simple
it's literally plug and play well from
my busy work life more like plugging
work he's got multiple windows open
side-by-side and all his essential
smartphone apps like messages calendar
and email we're also working with
Microsoft and other partners to optimize
many more apps for something decks
we've also customized the interface to
run Android OS and a desktop experience
today the gallops aside and si+ offer a
gateway for new mobile life were the
power of innovation imagination and
inspiration will carry us beyond the old
barrier and into a world of unlimited
possibilities
