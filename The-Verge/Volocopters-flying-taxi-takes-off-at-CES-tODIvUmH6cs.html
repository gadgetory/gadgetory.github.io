virgin we are backstage at the rehearsal
for Intel's big CES 2018 keynote and as
you can see I'm standing in front of a
gigantic flying car this is the valla
copter it's an 18 rotor electric
helicopter that will hopefully someday
become an autonomous vehicle something
that you could just hop in and take to
wherever you need to go right now it's
still in the testing phase and the
reason it's here at CES this year is
that Intel Singh working with Bala
copter to integrate all the technology
that it has from its drone division into
this to basically get this in the air a
lot faster I've never actually been in a
helicopter before and this seems like it
would be more terrifying than a
helicopter although when we watched it
fly on stage it was very calm it was
very quiet and the video that they
showed of an Intel CEO Brian krzanich
flying it in Bala copters headquarters
he seemed to enjoy it and it seems to be
a relatively controlled flight to begin
with so I don't know maybe it would
actually be pretty fun let's back up a
second we've actually seen a lot of
volatile assed few years the company
hasn't been shy about sharing videos of
its radical vehicle while they were
testing it it recently got a huge
funding round from Daimler and the
company even struck a deal to bring the
air taxis to Dubai
but the vallah copter has never flown
stateside this is our first good look at
the company and its air taxi in North
America and they didn't just bring the
prototype that flew on the stage at the
Intel keynote they also brought the
production version which is what could
actually shuttle passengers someday soon
okay so now we're here with CEO of ala
copter Florian Reuter and what are we
standing in front of this is different
from what you're throwing off on stage
of Intel right yes so this is the
volocopter 2x it's our latest model the
doors is the most obvious you know
change to the overall structure that
we've made we've set the entire rotor
level a bit higher that's you know to
have more passive safety we now have
more room inside the fuselage and which
we have much more room for the battery
compartment and where you have her
performance and endurance right now so
with the 2x we will reach 30 minutes of
flight
which still isn't where people want it
to be eventually but it is what we can
live with you know based on their
current limitations of battery
technology what is the target for out
there just start those kinds of programs
so the volocopter really is designed to
be used as an air taxi inside urban
centers so we're not targeting that say
you know large longer distances we want
to cover an urban center as good as
possible as efficient as possible so I
believe that with an endurance of about
an hour we should be safe to do every
relevant route in most of the other mega
cities that we want to apply this
technology I've been told by some of the
people at Intel that one of the benefits
of working with electric motors and
building this around electric technology
as opposed to a helicopter which has
many more moving parts and is far more
complex is that something like this
should be actually very easy to fly even
if somebody doesn't have experience in a
helicopter or something that requires a
pilot's license does that mean I could
really hop in this thing and actually
fly it without any experience like that
absolutely it is so intuitive to fly you
can put a five-year-old in there without
any explanation it'll know how to
maneuver this vehicle it is so simple so
why don't you show me what you've got
here is the attraction version so
welcome inside what you see now is you
have a lot of space very comfortable to
sit in this is the autonomous version so
you don't have a joystick here and there
in the regular piloted version you would
have the joystick here that you can then
command the directions in this is where
you would usually find the emergency
handle for the full of aircraft
parachute right so again from a
psychological perspective they explain
how a parachute works on a thing with 18
rotors so actually it is that's the neat
thing about the design of the volocopter
we don't have a rotor covering the the
center piece so if the the parachute
shoots out it of course is wired you
know you know in a way throughout the
entire fuselage so it will hold the
entire fuselage the cabins near with the
passenger inside and actually it's the
it's a ballistic rocket that's being
shot out in order to inflate the
parachute as fast as possible and then
it will you know descend the entire
vehicle in a safe manner
vallah copters far from the only company
working on air taxis or flying cars or
whatever you want to call them this
might seem like a crazy technology but
there are huge companies like uber and
Airbus and plenty of startups that are
soaking up money to try and make all
this happen
the whole idea with this partnership
that Intel announced this week is that
first off it's already been going
they've been doing all this work from
fire copter to integrate their flight
control software as their motor
controllers stuff that they've gotten
real their expertise they've cut their
teeth on with all the drone stuff that
we've seen here this week and they've
integrated all that into this and helped
viola copter really just sort of move
the schedule up on this fantastic idea
it doesn't mean that we're gonna have
flying cars and flying taxis tomorrow or
next week or in the next five years but
vallah copters gonna get there a lot
faster with help from a company like
Intel and on Intel side they get to work
with a company that's doing flying cars
I mean like that's a cool thing to have
in your roster of companies that you
work with when you're a company like
Intel and you're constantly competing
with other companies that are also doing
cool stuff like autonomous cars and
graphics chips and all this stuff so I
think this is the perfect example of
what Intel's trying to show off at CES
this year which is a our stuff is really
powerful but look at the cool stuff that
it can power
tell you what it's tight but this is
kind of cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
