verge I'm here at CES 2018 and I'm maybe
obviously on an electric scooter this is
the relink electric scooter and it's not
the same kind of flashy electric scooter
we're used to here at CES it has a range
of 30 kilometers which is nice but it
has a pretty low top speed and that's on
purpose it's because this is really
aimed at the mobility sector and by that
I mean people who need help getting
around whether that's old people people
who have maybe been injured or have a
handicap and more importantly than all
of that it's small it's relatively light
only about 20 to 30 pounds and you can
fold it up and store it in really tight
spaces take a look all you have to do is
lower the seat then reach down into the
floor of the scooter grab a handle pull
it up and snap its all together and at
that point it works basically as like a
luggage roller and you can even take the
handlebar section and fold that down so
that it fits better in the trunk of a
car
now the relink scooter is being built in
China that they want to sell it
especially in Europe but also in the US
it's gonna cost around thirty six
hundred dollars and it weighs somewhere
in between the twenty to thirty pound
range and it basically has all the
things you'd expect from an electric
scooter a modern electric scooter
there's a gauge on the dash that tells
you how fast you're going how much range
you have which battery is left and it's
powered by two batteries you can
actually swap them out and just charge
them at home you can charge this scooter
right in a wall outlet too even when
it's folded up into that sort of compact
position but what's interesting about
this scooter to me especially is that
this is more proof that this market is
changing because of how cheap electric
motors and batteries have become we hear
the word Mobility thrown around a lot at
shows like CES or even Auto shows and it
often sounds like a really empty word
that these companies use because it's
never really tied to products that are
coming out now it's talking about
self-driving cars that are coming in the
future or shuttles that you know might
only be in big cities whereas something
like this actually attaches some meaning
to that word and I think what I really
like about this idea
is that real Inc is a company that could
actually sell this to someone that you
know who might need help getting around
in the short term somebody who needs
something in the next year or two and
while this might not be the perfect kind
of scooter there might be faster ones
out there might be ones that are better
built this is something that is at the
very least could be sold to that person
who needs help getting around or will
inspire other people at this low end of
the market to make something that's
pretty similar and when you consider the
fact that mobility scooters that are
already out there in the market costs
way more than this it makes that price
tag sound a little bit more reasonable
so for more weird electric scooters
helpful electric scooters self-driving
cars cameras phones everything else
we're doing here this week at CES 2018
