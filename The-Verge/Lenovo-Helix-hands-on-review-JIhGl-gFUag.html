ThinkPad Hilux for a long time after its
debut at CES where the detachable laptop
tablet hybrid was easily one of the best
things we saw all week we waited for the
device six months later it's finally
here but it's not quite what we've been
waiting for
basically the Hilux is tablet but it's a
tablet with a dedicated keyboard dock
which has a big battery and a fan in it
the battery makes it last much longer
and the fan means the Hilux can
overclock its processor and run even
faster when it's docked the Hilux is
many things but it is not well designed
it's full of asymmetry and awkward
angles it's really the furthest thing
from a gorgeous unibody device like the
sony vaio pro or the MacBook Air the
hinge is ugly and exposed as if it's
missing its housing there are screws and
buttons and rubber feet and stickers
everywhere
none of which lends the impression that
this is at all a well-made sleek
attractive laptop there's an awkward odd
flap on the back that sort of covers all
of that but it looks weird and out of
place by itself it's big too the tablet
itself weighs 1.8 pounds and the dock
adds two more it's eight tenths of an
inch thick - and even though the matte
black carbon fiber body feels rigid the
seams aren't connected well enough on
the plus side the helix does get the
benefit of Lenovo's expertise with
keyboards and track pads the curved
concave keys feel great and the trackpad
is smooth and responsive even if it does
have a few of the same quirks as most
Windows laptops there's even a
TrackPoint nub if you're so inclined
though the buttons for track point users
have now been integrated into the
trackpad the display on the helix is
good and bad
the 11.6 inch screen is 1080p which is
great but having that many pixels on
such a small display can actually make
it really hard to see and click some
text or icons or webpages it's hard with
the mouse and even harder with your
finger there's an integrated digital pen
which helps a lot and I found myself
using it a lot more than I thought not
for drawing really but just for getting
around the operating system and doing
some of the small on-screen things that
are hard to do with such small targets
but it's not enough and Microsoft really
needs to improve how Windows handles
high-res screens movies look great in
1080p as do games so you really can't
play many games thanks to the integrated
Intel graphics here actually the biggest
problem with the graphics here is that
they're already outdated the helix runs
a mostly clean version of Windows 8 on
an Ivy Bridge processor last year's
model which really doesn't make sense
when Intel's new hazard chips are
already out performance on the helix is
really good especially when it's
connected to the dock and able to use
that fan but Haswell promises better
performance better graphics and
especially a better battery and the
thing is better battery life might be
killer here because it's already pretty
great we got more than eight hours of
battery life with the two parts
connected and more than five hours for
the tablet alone for something this
powerful with this many features that's
pretty great
here's the thing though it's not
performance that's the problem with the
helix it's design lenovo did indeed make
a powerful Windows 8 tablet which not a
lot of companies have done and it
coupled it with a good keyboard and a
good trackpad but in doing all that
Lenovo seems to have forgotten design
entirely I'd much rather have something
like the yoga which is heavier but much
better-looking and more cohesive or even
the ThinkPad x1 carbon which is just a
thin beautiful powerful laptop design
isn't everything
but your 1600 and $79 should buy a lot
more care and attention to detail and
even if you think this is the right form
factor for Windows 8 I don't personally
but even if you do this isn't the right
way to do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
