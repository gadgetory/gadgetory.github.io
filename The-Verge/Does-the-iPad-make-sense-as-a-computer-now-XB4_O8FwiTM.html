(mid-tempo hip-hop music)
- This week was WWDC
and we saw a ton, and
I mean a ton, of stuff:
that new Mac Pro, dark mode on the iPhone,
iPad apps on the Mac, a watchOS App Store,
and new features for the iPad.
And today, I want to talk about the iPad
because I have feelings,
also questions,
maybe answers,
but definitely questions,
and here are two.
Is it ready to be your primary computer,
and then, is this new
gesture system intuitive?
(quirky music)
So with the first question,
we've got iPadOS, which is iOS 13
but renamed for the iPad, I guess.
Can it do all the computer things?
I mean, if you look at all of the features
that Apple announced in its keynote,
it's like they were personally
responding to our gripes
from our iPad Pro review.
- You can plug as many flash drives
or hard drives as you
want into this USB-C port,
and nothing will happen.
(audience applauds)
- You can now plug in
a thumb drive!
- You can't even import photos directly
into an app like Lightroom CC.
- Sometimes when you're
working with a camera,
you'd like to import directly
into an app like Lightroom,
and now you can.
- The mobile version of Safari
just isn't a desktop-class browser.
- Well, no more,
because we're bringing
desktop-class browsing.
(audience applauds)
(quirky electronic music)
- Now, with all of that stuff,
I don't really know if it's all better
because Apple changed the
iPad at a fundamental level
or if Apple's just
fixing one-off annoyances
we've been complaining about
by just doing whack-a-mole.
We're going to have to
wait for the full review
to answer that question for real.
I should note right now, though,
that I only had a short time
with the new iPadOS directly.
All the video footage that
you're seeing here and elsewhere
is Apple's own on-rails demo.
Anyway, I do think the
new windowing system alone
should make this update worth it.
You have a ton of new
Slide Over app options,
and you can fan them out
or swipe through them just like an iPhone.
You could have a single
app with multiple windows
and even get a view of
all those app windows
just like you can on the Mac.
iPadOS is built so that
anything you can drag,
you can pretty much make a window out of,
and although the first
version of this developer beta
is a little bit buggy,
the window thing, it actually
really did kinda work.
But we need to talk about
the new gestures now,
and that means we get to talk about
grammar.
- [Off-camera] No.
- This is the, look, look!
I got an English degree
(mid-tempo hip-hop music)
and I'm going to use it, damnit,
and I promise this is going to make sense,
so just hang with me here.
First thing, we need to talk about
what all of the iPadOS gestures are
because there are just a lot of them.
One finger, tap.
Also drag.
Also tap and hold to do some stuff,
but it changes depending on the context.
It might be jiggly mode or
it might be something else,
but then, there's also new stuff.
There's a new way to just
drag the cursor around,
but if you do it just so,
instead of moving the cursor,
you can select text with it.
Then, two fingers.
This is new, but there's a way
that you can use two fingers
to select multiple items
on a list by dragging it.
I don't think we've seen all the ways
that this can work just yet.
Now, the other new thing is three fingers.
First, there's cut and paste.
You use three fingers
like you're picking something up to copy.
You do it twice to cut,
and then you do this
like three-finger plop
to paste stuff.
There's also undo and redo,
which is a three-finger swipe
to the left or to the right.
Also, you can hold down three fingers
to get a pop-up user interface
for cut, copy, and paste.
Lastly, four fingers. Just like before,
a pinch will take you home.
It's actually pretty easy to mix this up
with the three-finger thing, but whatever.
(Dieter exhales sharply)
The thing is if we made this
same list for Mac or Windows
and everything that you
can do with a keyboard
and various mouse clicks
and drags or whatever,
it would be pretty long, too,
which is what brings me to grammar.
Okay, so how long do I have
to get into the theory of language
and maybe just a little
bit of bonus semiotics?
- [Off-camera] I'll give you like a minute?
- Okay so, yeah, no semiotics then.
(books thud heavily)
(Dieter groans)
(percussive music)
Think of language
as being on a spectrum.
On this end are really rigid languages
like math and formal
logic and computer code.
If you use the wrong
grammar in these languages,
they totally break and they
don't communicate any meaning.
They form an internally
consistent framework
that runs like a clock,
and you pretty much have to take classes
to learn how to use them.
On the other end of the
spectrum is natural language,
the stuff that you and I speak every day,
like English or Mandarin or whatever.
These languages are really flexible.
Their rules of grammar can bend
without breaking their meaning.
The grammar, though, it's super messy
because we basically make it up as we go.
However, we learn these
languages naturally
just by having people talk to us.
In the middle, you can
think of a user interface
as a kind of language.
It's how you communicate
with the computer.
It has to be really rigid
and consistent like code
because that's how computers work,
but it also needs to be
flexible and learnable over time
because that's how our stupid
squishy human brains work.
So the iPad user interface has a grammar.
It has rules, but where does it fall
on this language spectrum?
Did I do it?
(percussive music)
I didn't do it?
Great.
I was close!
(electronic drum thumps)
So let's answer that spectrum question.
(mid-tempo hip-hop music)
I do think the grammar
on iPadOS is mostly internally consistent
and fairly flexible.
One finger, do stuff.
Two fingers, select stuff.
Three fingers, edit stuff.
Four fingers, go home, I guess?
I don't know.
These different finger
gestures do different things
depending on the context,
which is a little bit of
a problem for consistency,
but hey, this isn't code, so I'm not mad.
But I worry that the iPad's grammar
is too hard to naturally learn.
With the grammar of a
mouse and a keyboard,
you build up more skills
naturally over time as you use it.
You right-click and see a menu
and then you do it elsewhere.
You find the keyboard shortcuts
listed in the top menu.
Now, part of this is that
we've had the desktop around for 35 years,
so it feels normal.
But the truth is that the
desktop UI is super weird,
and we all learned how to use it,
but it has a smooth ramp-up
from basic user to pro user.
On the iPad, I just don't
know how one of these gestures
leads naturally to the more advanced one.
I think once you learn them
all and get good at them,
the iPad can be incredibly
flexible and powerful,
but there's not a smooth ramp-up.
You're going to have to, like,
watch a lot of tutorials
to figure all these gestures out.
(mellow music)
Look,
I know this grammar stuff,
it's not a perfect metaphor,
but I do think it's a
really helpful framework
for answering the question I started with
at the beginning of the video:
is the iPad's user interface intuitive?
Now, I think intuitive is a dumb word
because most people use it wrong.
They think it means something
that everybody just knows inherently.
What intuitive actually means
is stuff that you learn
without noticing that you're learning it.
We all know that the iPad is intuitive
because you can just
hand it to any toddler
and they'll figure out the
basics just by playing with it,
but these new, more advanced gestures,
I'm not sure they're there yet.
I think we might be looking
at the same story as always
with the iPad.
It can be really powerful,
but only if you take the
time to learn its quirks.
Hey, thank you so much for watching.
Let me know what you think
of this weird argument
down in the comments,
and specifically, do you think that iPadOS
makes this a primary
computer for more people?
Also, if you're more interested in an,
like, actually powerful computer,
we have a great video with the new Mac Pro
and a ton of coverage for
that so check all that out.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
