am in Hollywood Los Angeles and the
reason I'm here is because red is
announcing they have announced they're
showing off a new smartphone and it's
one of the most interesting smartphones
that's come out in a long time we're
expecting it hopefully this August and
it's gonna have this for view
holographic screen and I'm not really
sure what that means I'm really excited
to look at it so we're gonna go we're
gonna hang out the fans and we're gonna
go see what's going on here at red
Studios Hollywood so this is it this is
the red hydrogen one I can show you the
back I can show you the sides but I
can't show you the front what I can do
is tell you a little bit of what the
experience of the front it looks like
okay so I've looked at the phone but
more importantly I look at the display
and it is actually kind of impressive
what red has done is they have taken the
standard two camera set up which
everybody does when they're doing 3d and
then they interpolate the stuff in
between so pop up so that when you are
moving the phone back and forth you can
actually see it without having a jump
and stutter like a standard lenticular
display which is pretty neat I looked at
a bunch of video loops which are pretty
easy to do
I also did a live video chat so using
the two front-facing cameras I was able
to see a holographic image of myself and
a holographic image of the other person
that I was chatting the other
fascinating thing about it is that it
has this modular system and I know
modular phones they don't always work
motorola successful essential not so
much project are disasters but what's
interesting about this is the module
that they want to start with is a sensor
a camera sensor that can fit lots of
different kinds
lens mount so if you use cannon or Leica
or Nikon or whatever you'll be able to
attach that lens to one of these modules
and use your existing lenses directly
with the phone but I think even if that
fails what's more interesting about this
modular system is that they're gonna
have it work with redzone ecosystems so
if you have a red epic or you have a you
know weapon or whatever you'll be able
to plug this thing in and use it as the
display and have this phone be part of
it
now the phone itself dude it's huge it's
a 5.7 inch screen but it's even bigger
than like an iPhone 8 plus it's just a
gigantic phone and they wouldn't let us
take a picture of the front of it
because the screen the hologram doesn't
really show on camera but it looks good
it looks like a fine screen and the
hologram thing I don't know if it's
actually going to take off but it is
really clever and I even did a holo chat
which was fun they could actually do the
hologram thing in real time over a video
chat which I was pretty impressed with
so again it's coming out in August we
think and it's be really expensive it's
gonna be like 1,200 bucks or the
titanium version is gonna be like 1,600
bucks it's gonna be a bunch of money so
if you are a person that just wants a
cool phone you know get another phone
you can save a bunch of money this isn't
going to be the best whatever it's gonna
have only a Snapdragon 835 processor but
if you're looking for something that
participates in a crazy wild camera
ecosystem like Red has built this could
be a really fascinating phone for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
