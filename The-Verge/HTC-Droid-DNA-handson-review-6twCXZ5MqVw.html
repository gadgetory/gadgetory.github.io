we are looking at the new HTC droid DNA
for Verizon Wireless the DNA is a first
phone in the US with a 1080p HD display
and the 5-inch super lcd3 screen is
nothing short of stunning it has a crazy
high 440 PPI pixel density which makes
it virtually impossible to distinguish
individual pixels on the screen viewing
angles and color reproduction are also
excellent and the display is perfectly
viewable in bright sunlight we've been
saying all year that the HTC One X has
the best display on any mobile device
but it's pretty safe to say that the
1080p screen on the droid DNA beats it
from a design perspective the DNA uses
verizon's trademark black and red color
scheme that's getting a bit stale at
this point it's not an ugly look by any
means but it would be nice to have a
rise and mix it up a bit and utilize
some more color palettes the back of the
phone is a matte soft touch finish that
feels good and provides enough grip so
the phone doesn't slide out of your hand
so easily the sides taper down from
about 10 millimeters thick right down to
four millimeters and feature red strips
on the side that HTC and Verizon say are
supposed to evoke a sports car the phone
is also pretty light at just 5 ounces my
biggest complaint with the DNA's design
though is with its power button which is
located on the top of the phone directly
in the middle this means that you have
to adopt a rather uncomfortable claw
grip in order to turn the screen on and
then reshuffle the device in your hand
to unlock it the size of the DNA does
make it difficult to perform a number of
one-handed tasks but it's not much
larger than the One X and other phones
with 4.7 or 4.8 inch displays the
coolest feature the DNA's Hardware are
the notification lights which are
located on both the front and the back
of the device the back notification
light is actually really cool and it
means that you can see the notifications
regardless of whether the phone is
placed on its face or on its back also
on the back is an 8 megapixel camera
with an f 2.8 lens and HTC's image sense
processing chip the camera opens quickly
and can take pretty good pictures but
they're not as good in low light as
someone's taken with the iPhone 5 or
Nokia's Lumia 920 the front-facing
camera is also borrowed from the HTC
windows phone 8x and features a really
wide eighty degree viewing angle
powering the DNA is a slot core qualcomm
snapdragon pro processor clocked at 1.5
gigahertz and paired with two gigabytes
of ram most of the time the processor
doesn't have a problem with the DNA
significantly higher screen resolution
but there's instances where it
drugs on scrolling especially in the
Chrome browser but the DNA doesn't have
any trouble with most 3d games and they
actually look really great on its
display the DNA runs Android 4.1 point
one jellybean with HTC's Sense 4 plus
interface since four plus is very
similar to sense for and it features
HTC's custom lockscreen home screen app
drawer and multi-tasking menu
unfortunately Google now is buried under
a long press of the HOME key which is
much less intuitive to use than the
swipe gesture used in stock Android 4.1
battery life from the 2020 milliamp hour
battery is less than impressive and it
was not able to last a full day in my
tests you can't swap out the battery
either so the DNA will likely require
trip to the charger at least once a day
the micro USB port is covered with a
fiddly and annoying plastic flap but HTC
did build wireless charging directly
into the device if you have a qi
compatible car charging pad you can use
that to charge up the phone verizon will
be offering the DNA for 199 with a new
contract on november 21st which is
pretty good price for the features that
it includes the display alone might be
worth it but the occasional performance
hiccups and subpar battery life weren't
some pause before committing to that
two-year agreement if you're a verizon
customer there's a number of other
choices to consider including the still
relevant galaxy s3 and motorola's new
droid razr HD and RAZR MAXX HD but if
you want the only smartphone with a
1080p HD screen the DNA is the one to
get
