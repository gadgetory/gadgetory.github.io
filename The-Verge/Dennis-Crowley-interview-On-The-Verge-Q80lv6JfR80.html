please welcome the CEO foursquare Dennis
Crowley all right copy all right you're
very careful it's like we try to make it
kind of like a difficult for people to
get over we've got you got to step over
that thing you get a step up and that
arm is broken yeah a little mini of
course officially brought back the
broken arm sofa just for you uh Dennis
thank you for coming yeah thanks for
having me in the film site to be here
well uh you know it's it really is our
pleasure to have you and you're here in
New York you're based in New York yeah
we're down and uh we have offices done
it so and now would you say not want to
talk a little bit about I want to get
into the roots of foursquare but yeah
but first I want to talk about the East
Coast West Coast startup battle and you
know it's got very heated can you
trash-talked Silicon Valley at all there
r us right now and can't talk about how
much better New York is for startups I'd
oh I think I like the new york seen a
lot right because there's just a lot
more people here it's like 8 million
people here versus I don't know any
people in San Francisco 15-20 it
considerably fewer the right and then on
top of that like there I like about
building a tech startup in New York is
that you know tech is not the most
important thing here it's like fifth
down in the list we've got like you know
fashion and finance and media and
publishing and advertising and pretty
much everything else except for tech and
tech is like way down at the bottom and
so when you meet people out and you ask
them to beta test those things you're
building will get excited about the
stuff you're building I they're just
regular people yeah like they're not
early adopters and its really i think it
makes it much easier to kind of build
things in this body you're not like hey
I'm doing foursquare you can check in
place you become mayor place so like oh
I'm using a different thing that does
exactly I don't start up the day yeah I
know my start was actually do yeah so I
can't really test it that is the thing
though I mean it is you don't have like
a million different startups all doing
trying to do similar things here it's
like there's a few I feel York sir epson
and maybe you know because we're we're
sort of like a publishing part of like a
publishing startup really I am biased
but I
like there's something a little bit more
like the startups here are much more
real like they're real things like they
involve real world either real world
activities yeah are there things you
actually need for your life yeah it's vs
like stuff like hey what if we had Yelp
for shoes yeah i mean that's Yelp is it
it I don't really do well there's like
no there's like a smaller pool of them
here so like you look at the big ones
and you know where one of the biggest
ones here and then you've got you know
your your tumblers and your etsy s and
your Kickstarter's and your meetups and
it's just like a smaller pool to compare
yourself with and when you look at like
the big startups that are out west you
know it's like it's just a big tech
companies you've got your Google's and
your Facebook's and your twitter is your
apples it's just like a different breed
of big tech company right no but I mean
they've but Facebook and Twitter they've
kind of graduated to a different sphere
of their not like a startup yeah but we
think upon your in that sphere too yeah
I mean like we're not really even a
startup we're like 150 people right
let's over 50 years old yeah exactly
right so like how Wes that's I think
it's still considered relatively small
right where one of the bigger players in
the in the new york tech scene right and
so it's just it's like a different you
know distinction of scale I guess so to
recap the west coast startup scene lame
East Coast art scene awesome is that I'm
hearing sorry I quote you on that I see
I don't want to I don't pooh-pooh the
west coast cuz we have an office out
there yeah yeah so I actually talked
about that the the beginnings of
foursquare forsberg was not foursquare
originally fourth quarter was like you
know if you go way back in the day it's
um you know it's me building software
from my friends I've got laid off from
my very first calm job which was what
well actually my second job so I worked
at a company called Jupiter research
which I was the guy like making
PowerPoint slides and then I worked at
that was your job you were just I was
pretty much awesome era pretty much like
making slides for other people to give
during presentations and things and I
worked at a mobile like product shop
called Vindico that was building City
guys for Palm Pilots and that was at
this company of indigo I really got bit
by the bug of hey you can make stuff
during the day and you go out at night
and you see people using the stuff that
you you know that you were working on
during the day and they're using it on
their palm pilots and like that was kind
of a big deal I know Palm Pilot like
super old school but
but I mean I was like oh my god like you
build stuff during the day and you see
stuff you see people using it at night
like that's incredibly rewarding and so
this idea of just building stuff that my
friends would use and building stuff
that I want to use I just got really
kind of bit by that bug right and you
know so the first version the dodge ball
ended up coming out of that we ended up
can you explain dodgeball hello sherry I
don't know what it is yeah dodgeball is
um you know we I can remember how we
used to pitch it back in the day but it
was just like a basic friend finder for
text messaging and so you know this is
before we had GPS and phones or color
screens or apps in general but you know
anywhere that my my friends in New York
would go out you just send a text
message to like NYC at dodgeball calm
and say I'm at the you know the magician
I'm at Tom and Jerry's I'm at Central
Park and then that message will get
rebroadcast through all of your friends
right yeah we had like a like a poor
man's little social network built into
it and I could it didn't work was SMS
page it was SMS yeah but didn't work
because I no one really kind of knew
what social networks were this back my
2001 people to know what social networks
were like text messaging barely worked
and we kept trying to like resurrect the
idea we did it after friendster kind of
hit pseudo mass-market it's like oh now
we can explain it as it's like
friendster for cell phones and then we
try to resurrect it again when we're NYU
and did it with them you know then we
ended up bringing it to google and you
know i feel like now you know a couple
years later some of those ideas are a
little bit more in the right time right
place right the device is a more mature
like everyone here knows about apps on
your phone you all know that you have
gps like everyone here has phones that
can do these things and so like we're
just you know it's just a much larger
audience dude you've been so you've been
trying to do like I mean you've
essentially been trying to do something
like Foursquare or been trying to do for
square for a very long time for spare
was that what is the year for foursquare
started we started 2009 right and even
so be way before that though you were
kind of trying to find a way to say pan
out of place yeah cuz i'll be all about
it yeah I say you could it goes back to
I 2001 or so right which has which is
insane yeah it mean but it barely worked
wait 15 people usually really really
want people to know where you are well
it's just like it makes meeting up with
people easier and more fun and right so
so so foursquare was a few years ago
everybody talked about foursquare
it was like we're game gamma phi
everything we're going to gamify our
lives like four squares one of these
things where it's like I get
achievements for doing stuff that I'm
doing anyhow yeah I can become the mayor
of somewhere and get bad just for stuff
yeah I mean obviously that stuff is all
still baked into foursquare but it seems
like the last you know couple of years
sir than the last year things have been
moving towards not just about hey I got
an achievement or I'm the mayor of
something but foursquare is going to be
an engine for finding things yeah for
discovery and for discovery and getting
recommendations yeah can you talk a
little bit about the shift or if there
is a shift and what that means to you
you know I don't I don't really see it
so much as a as a ship right so you know
what we're trying to do like the kind of
essence of foursquare is how do you use
software to encourage people to go out
and have experiences that they haven't
had before right and a big part of that
is like the recommendation engine that
we've got you know a whole bunch of data
scientists working crunching the three
billion check-ins to make these
recommendations happen in real time and
there's another part of that the part we
weren't able to do that in the early
days we just didn't have the team of the
town or just we weren't sophisticated
enough to do that in the early days we
were using like basic game mechanics
like the badges that probably most of
the people in this room know about where
it's like can we use software to
encourage people to you know go to
places that they haven't been to before
like initially it was you know I live in
the east village and there's a bar that
I always go to called 7b and it was like
you know this is just my default place
like how do you make a piece of software
that encourages me to go to some place I
haven't been before to bring my friends
there to go to another borough to like
travel uptown to get a group two people
together and do something none of us
have done before and can you make a game
out of that and can that like you know
if you make the game if you design a
game well enough can it encourage people
to do those types of things right we're
finding that a lot of that stuff works
like the game mechanics have worked
pretty well on foursquare like if you
level up in coffee it's like am a level
6 coffee person cuz i've been to 30
different places in New York people feel
some kind of sense of accomplishment
over that right now aki i walked the gym
rat badge for going to the gym you know
ten times out of a 30 day period like
that's it kind of works right do you
ever feel like I'm gonna get a little
bit deep on you here let's do you ever
feel like the idea of gamifying for
adults who'd like going to a bar is very
adult activity right yeah do you ever
feel that the
sure you have a wonderful responses did
you ever feel like in some way gamifying
things that we normally do is a way of
infantilizing us like it kind of making
us like I mean I don't play you know in
my daily life I don't think of the
things I do as an achievement that I
need to unlock or yeah game that I have
to play is there something about taking
tasks or things that we do
recreationally and turning them into a
game that in some way diminishes their
their value or their importance or does
that I think is a big difference between
like trying to turn everything into a
game and try to make everything playful
right so I never I don't ever think of
foursquare as a game right there there's
game mechanics in there but I think of
it as like you know there's been all
these just utilities like things that
will help you do stuff on the internet
for a long time and it's like we should
make those things more fun they should
be fun to use and fun to interact with
and so that's where a lot of the game
mechanics come from I want to make you
know everyday interactions if I going to
the same restaurant by commuting every
day traveling in between cities I want
to make that stuff feel playful and
rewarding doesn't have to be a game but
I think there's it's important to note
the distinction you you think that it's
do you think as people as humans like we
need to be rewarded for doing I mean is
that something that you think is baked
into our DNA that we want to be rewarded
or we need to be rewarded you know I
don't think rewards come in different
sizes and shapes like every time you get
a like on Instagram like that's like
that's being rewarded that's like the
little bit of a dopamine hit right and I
feel like it's like you know that's
that's a multiplayer version of it right
because you post something and then your
friends interact with it and that's two
players interacting you know the
Foursquare stuff was designed to be more
one player like you do something in the
real world and Foursquare rewards you
for doing that and so you know the badge
am Aaron walk you know you get a tip
that tells you about something you
should order at a restaurant like those
are all little dopamine hits in the same
type of way that make people feel good
like hey if I put data into the system
I'm it's enhancing my experience of the
of the real world and so you feel like
and you so you feel like there's a
physiological like that there is I mean
obviously there is you're right about
the dopamine hip yeah but you feel like
that's actually fundamental to what
you're doing that you want people to
feel this sense of hey I've you know
this like visceral sense of hey I've got
something or I accomplished something
yeah it doesn't need to be down to like
the chemical level of it but you know
this um you know I always think of four
squares like we should be able to make
you know these little guides that live
in your pocket like a guide to the city
that basically has all the
that your friends have about all the
places in the world and that wherever
you end up bringing your phone that
guide can come to life and say hey these
are the things that you need to pay
attention to and so it doesn't have to
be like a one of those one player
rewards like a badge or mayor mayor
mechanic right those might happen all
the time but as long as you know I can
be someplace I haven't been before and
Foursquare can surface a little bit of
information for me that helps me
understand that place or make mine you
know my 15 or 20 minutes I spend in that
place a little bit more interesting
again that's really like no one's really
done stuff like that before right we're
showing that when you do it like it
works it works pretty well so you so you
talked about putting data into it kind
of it's sort of incentivizing people to
put data into foursquare yeah we have a
video and I don't know if we can cue
this up or not but it's you guys posted
this thing which is the map of guest
check-ins direct the hurricane do we
have this up so this is it you can see
the dates going by there and you can see
all this activity move literally move
out of the the lower part of actually I
haven't seen this yet this is kind of
Awesome you haven't seen this it's
really crazy cuz you can see them
migrate she could play it again play
again we run that one more time it's
that you can actually see people moving
here away from the water here we go yeah
Amy seems like fading they actually have
that technology yeah do we can't we
replay the video here we go so you can
see this a lot of activity downtown and
then a thread right how I mean it goes
dark yeah well the way the power does
and the way people's ability to get down
there so so this data is obviously very
valuable and I mean you're using it for
stuff that is like hey I love this bar
or this restaurant there was an article
in the believer kind of a little bit of
a mean-spirited foursquare article they
said they're kind of making fun of the
idea that people say it's it's like
saying things like people talk about mac
and cheese in williamsburg it's just
very surface information yeah do you see
that date is valuable I mean what you
just shut what we just showed is
important okay that's like a lot you
know life-threatening situation you guys
are collecting all this information yeah
are there other uses for that data are
there other ways that you can utilize
that data that you can share that data I
think everything that you see going on
in foursquare now like an hour explorer
recommendation engine that's
it's like the the you know that's the
you know all the magic that we're trying
to deliver to people like we we have all
these folks that give us you know a
little bit of information about what
they do every day at the types of coffee
places they go to the different places
to go to in williamsburg please they go
to all over the world and we take all
those check and data points and we can
really we can start making these
recommendation engines that are
personalized to people like four for the
history of local search on the internet
it's always been like if everyone here
goes to you know google or yelp right
now and we search for sushi we all get
the same results like that is that's
broken that's so super broken because we
all have different tastes our friends
have all been in different places we all
had different experiences like it's just
it's very clear clear that that stuff is
going to change you want you want that
to be for a person not yeah well you
just a generalized yeah the big thing
that we're able to do that no one's been
able to do before is be able to have
personalized local search results for
every person for any person at any given
point in time right so Foursquare search
results are different depending on the
intersection you're standing on the the
day the day of the week it is the time
of the day it is like we can potentially
get into things where it's like you know
is it colder than it normally is is it
warmer than a no noise where would where
do people normally go around these times
and so you know you look at those
check-in points there and you know
sometimes people look at Foursquare be
like oh it's cute it's about points and
badges and stuff and like that's great
that like you know people get that part
of it but mean that was four days it
data up there and that just shows like
how Foursquare foursquare in New York is
like a living breathing type of organism
there's all sorts of interesting data
that's being teased out of that and it's
are responsible to take all those data
points and use it to help everyone in
this room and everyone in New York
evelin the world use that to make better
sense out of what's going on nearby
interesting so I we have to wrap up and
fortunately there's a lot more I want it
there's a bunch of questions I didn't
get to but tell me about do you see
Foursquare as a company that I POS like
are you gonna are you if I mean are you
a facebook is this does this become a
public company is that your everyone
asks us this all the time like what when
you guys going to IPO how soon is going
to be it's like one of the last things
that we think about right so our job is
just to build the best products that we
can right now we've got just over 25
million users almost 3 billion check-ins
and
to compete in the scale which we're
competing with like we're one of the
like we're the smallest of the big
companies right now right and so we've
got to grow our audience we've got to
grow the business we're going to figure
out how to work better as teams and
everything and so if we figure out all
that stuff than those are the questions
that we've got to start thinking about
but for now it's just you know how do
you build stuff that's better than the
stuff we're launching today and how do
you build stuff that just people love
using every single day well thank you
very much for coming that's prolly
Rebecca you got to come back there's a
lot more wheat aggressive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
