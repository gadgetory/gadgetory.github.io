bike helmet when I was a kid because you
know it keeps me alive but I never
wanted to it was big and ugly and made
my hair look funny but there are people
trying to solve that we're here at the
Polytechnic Institute at NYU to talk to
dr. Nikhil Gupta who's worked on helmets
for Olympians the military athletes of
all kinds and basically his goal is to
make the safest best looking lightest
coolest helmet on the planet and it all
starts with fall so okay so first sort
of a very broad level what happens in
this lab what are you guys working on in
here well we work on understanding how
materials absorb energy and that's a
very important application when you look
at helmets you are looking at a very
small space in which a lot of energy has
to be absorbed we don't work on
individual products we mainly work on
developing materials and finding out
what kind of loading conditions those
materials will be working well in so we
have six different kinds here right so
what what differentiates I guess sort of
my scientific knowledge is lacking so
what what differentiates sort of one
phone from the next so there are a few
things that you can look at the forms if
you look closely that the cell size of
these forms is different that means how
big the pores are on these forms and
that kind of determines the density of
these materials okay and how much energy
they would absorb is related to the
density of a form the denser the foam is
it may absorb more energy compared to a
much more lighter weight forms okay but
now we have new methods of making forms
lighter but increasing their energy
absorption capability so some of these
fancy forms not these ones but the ones
that we are working in developing new
ones might actually involve things like
carbon nanotubes or nano fibers it's
just so which keep the forms low density
but at the same time they absorb a lot
more energy than the traditional forms
dr. Gupta told us that what he's testing
isn't how aerodynamic your helmet is or
how cool it looks he's not testing any
particular helmet at all he's focused on
foam every kind of foam you can imagine
at about 10,000 other kinds too phone is
the backbone of your helmet it's what
absorbs the impact when you fall off
your bike or get punched in the head and
depending on what you're doing you need
something very different in his lab dr.
Gupta test the power of foam over and
over he's constantly trying to find how
much of a beating a certain type can
take what if there's a pebble flying at
it at 100 miles an hour or if you're on
your bike skidding along the ground on a
hot summer day what happens then dr.
Gupta knows the effects of temperature
vibration and time he also knows what
happens if you fire a gun in terms of
its ratio of density to strength the
phone he makes can be stronger than
steel of course everyone needs different
phones though dense foam is heavy foam
and dense foam might not be what
protects us best anyway
dr. Gupta works with the military and
Olympians and regular people like me
he's designing armor for the military
that's both incredibly light and
incredibly strong he's worked at the
Olympic boxers who need a helmet that
will take repeated abuse he's also
worked with equestrians who need to be
able to fall off a horse and survive
those riders need a helmet that will
take huge impact once rather than lesser
impact over time or Olympic cyclist who
spill off their bikes at huge speed and
skid along the ground each needs a
different kind of foam for a different
kind of impact dr. Gupta is making sure
helmets do what they really have to do
keep us safe</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
