checking out German startup pipe which
lets you transfer files up to a gigabyte
in real time with friends over Facebook
let's check it out pipe lives on
Facebook because there really isn't much
software involved it's all done on pipe
servers and they also didn't want you to
have to friend people like you might on
other services where you share things or
transfer files pipeworks on top of
Adobe's real-time media flow protocol
which means that all you do is install
the app takes a second and you're going
click friends up in the top left corner
pick a friend you want to share with and
they don't need to actually be online
and facebook chat for it to work but
they do need to have this window open
all you need to do to transfer file is
literally just drag a file from your
desktop into the pipe and it's going to
ask Jordan for permission as soon as I
click send file now on his screen he's
going to see incoming file transfer
you're going to accept the file and as
you can see progress is symbolized by
that bar which is the same on both
screens because pipe is uploading and
downloading at the same time in real
time peer-to-peer computer to computer
there are no servers in the middle to
ever store your file once the files
complete you can just click save as
again the company says that the one
gigabyte limit for file transfers is due
to the size of your browser cache if you
try and send a file that's really big
you generally get an error so this one
is just under 700 megabytes even though
that file wasn't the full gigabyte the
company stated it says your browser
memory is full please try restarting
your browser and this is after I just
cleared my cache pipe isn't trying to
beat Dropbox or any other large-scale
file transferring solutions all its
really trying to do is let people who
are already friends on Facebook transfer
files without installing any other
software and there's also 128-bit AES
encryption so your files encrypted
doesn't live on any servers pops in pops
out and that's it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
