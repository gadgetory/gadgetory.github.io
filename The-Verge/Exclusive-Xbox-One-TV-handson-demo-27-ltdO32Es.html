here in Redmond Washington Xbox Studios
with Jeff Henshaw who's gonna show me
walk you through the Xbox one dashboard
for the first time I'm really excited
about it we've actually put a cover over
the Kinect sensor
which we're now going to dramatically
remove it's gonna see me and
automatically walk in the end and I've
already set up some preferences here so
it's saw me logged me in I picked hot
pink which I think was the right choice
and Here I am just at the the home
screen of gas wasser looks very familiar
very much like the 360 and I've been
banging around it without actually any
help because it's just no trouble
picking it up at all right so I can just
say Xbox watch TV watch TV that's right
and then I can say Xbox Xbox one guide
you have to kind of end a sentence
before you start saying Xbox so there
was a kind of it needs it needs to
listen you so Xbox one guide and there's
your programming guide I mean I actually
just want to stay right on killing
nightmares I don't know why I'm watching
what's on the Discovery Channel
it's gonna jump to the Discovery Channel
and I can just say watch the show mm-hmm
watch this channel and it's gonna change
the channel right to the Discovery
Channel so this is the thing I haven't
been playing that which is it's showing
me the Comcast guy but it goes right we
are we are definitely watching TV right
through your Comcast box that you
already had in your living room yeah so
I mean that's the TV integration is
there the guide looks really pretty out
channel so I can say Xbox guys stopping
us all my senses Xbox one guide Xbox one
guide doesn't like this Xbox one guy
that goes and I can go to one of the app
channels right I can say what's on Hulu
actually you want to hop over to AB
channels first oh you wanna say ok AB
channels I did it for you the controller
we both did it the same time so now it's
showing me this is right built-in the
guide it's showing me what's on all
these various services including the NFL
via of an NFL partnership and what's on
your SkyDrive which is very interesting
so this is my SkyDrive which should are
you load it up that's your camera roll
if you're Cloud Strife Xbox go to
Internet Explorer jump right in Internet
Explorer it did a great job we have
we've loaded a great website here called
the verge so just loading up and that's
the only website there it's really there
are no other websites so we loaded up
the story from the verge of the
background and then I'm holding
controller and I can use this as a mouse
and I can just press a and click on the
link so we can go back to our home page
here but the most important thing is
even though you've watched TV yeah used
our electronic programming guide you've
seen what's on Discovery Channel you've
got Internet Explorer you've done all of
those things we have with your voice
your game is still running right so I
started playing Forza 5 before any of
this happened I logged out in the middle
of a lap and now I can actually it's
Forza Motorsport 5 yep so I can say Xbox
go to Forza Motorsport 5 Xbox go to
Forza Motorsport 5 a.m. and it's right
back on the track where you sly dog
dropped me and I'd literally just
switched I'm playing in I'm terrible at
this game this is the worst yeah but the
fact is the game was still running and
you did all these other things and
hopped right back into it hold on I
gotta crash this car so that's the Xbox
dashboard as far as I can tell it's
running very smoothly right now it's
what's still you got about 27 days
before you launch you to something it's
running super smoothly you can jump back
and forth between games and sort of a
shared app windows 8 ish experience and
the home screen really fast and
everything is working as far as I can
tell just as designed although there are
still some some glitches here and
learning how to use the voice commands
you're saying takes god I am just
terrible this game we provide to excite
some on-screen guides to help people get
started with it after half an hour so of
using it
people tend to be pretty comfortable
with it right so that is I'm gonna keep
playing this game that is the Xbox one
dashboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
