Galaxy Note pro Samsung is great at
copying other companies and mimicking
their cool features but it had one
really good idea that no one's been able
to copy it making everything huge this
is a twelve point two inch tablet one of
the biggest I've ever used and for all
intents and purposes it's just like
every other Samsung Galaxy Note tablet
except you know bigger the note pro is
11.6 inches wide and eight inches tall
it honestly feels a little like I'm
holding a television it's surprisingly
thin actually at less than eight
millimeters but at one point six pounds
it's just about the heaviest tablet
you'll find it's made of Samsung's
traditional cheap plastic either white
or blue but it feels a lot better than
some older tablets it has this fake
stitched leather coating on the back
that doesn't look or sound like a good
idea but it makes the note Pro a lot
more comfortable and pleasant to hold
it's thin enough that you can kind of
dig it into your palm and hold it in one
hand but that gets tiring really fast
this thing is meant to be held in two
hands and probably not even held at all
but used on a desk it's also meant to be
used in landscape mode the twelve point
two inch 2560 by 1600 display is really
beautiful though it's the same
resolution and a little larger than the
note 10.1 screen which looks a little
better as a result for watching a movie
having so much screen real estate is
really great so it can actually be too
much for a game I got dizzy playing
asphalt airborne which was just stuttery
enough and so close to my face that I
got a headache the screen is obviously
ridiculously tall in portrait mode there
is one time it's useful though if you
hold the tablet in portrait play a video
in the bottom half and do something else
in the top it's almost like you're using
two tiny tablets side by side it's great
the Galaxy Note pro runs a heavily
customized version of Android 4.4 kitkat
with Samsung's TouchWiz software layered
all over it
the most useful addition is the
multitasking the note Pro actually lets
you run up to four apps at once dragging
them all into place one by one is kind
of a pain but once things are set
they're really easy to move around and
adjust it's not exactly smooth all the
time but it's honest-to-goodness
multitasking which a tablet like this
which is clearly designed for getting
things done really needs the other
useful addition to the standard Android
tablet experience is the s-pen which has
always been the hallmark feature of Note
devices here it's the same tiny pen as
ever and it works impressively well it's
responsive enough that both writing and
drawing are smooth and accurate the
problem with the s-pen and actually with
the multitasking too is that there's
just not enough to do
to the multitasking only works with a
handful of apps so you can't pin
Evernote next to a browser and take
notes that way
they're only clunky workarounds and with
the pen the only real benefit over your
finger is if you're using a few Samsung
blessed apps like s note or action memo
when you first pull the pen out of its
slot in the top corner of the tablet it
pops up the action command menu which
offers a few things you can do you can
draw a rectangle on the screen and open
an app in that space you can take a
screenshot and draw on it or quickly pop
up a notepad it's handy and I found
myself using the pen basically
constantly when I was using the note Pro
but it's still way too limited in almost
any other app I'm stuck just tapping and
swiping
there's also basically nothing here
taking advantage of such a gigantic
display Samsung's Flipboard powered live
tile Style magazine UX homescreen is
neat but it's huge and just shows news
or your calendar
it's like Windows 8 but without a lot of
the options or customizations Samsung
did make some changes to the OS itself
to better suit such a big screen there
are bigger settings menus a huge
notification pulldown and a horizontal
multitasking window across the bottom of
the screen and of course that's all in
addition to the standard blooping and
rippling of nature UX Samsung's real
focus here is on the business friendly
features that seem appropriate for a
device with Pro in its name there's a
utility built-in for sharing your laptop
screen on your tablet one for sharing
your tablet screen on your laptop and a
couple of apps for running meetings the
note pro is designed for work and it
does feel more productive than most
tablets its keyboard is huge and easy to
type on the pen is handy in spots and
the multitasking helps to but this is
not a replacement for a laptop or even
really a competitor for something like
the surface pro which is a full-fledged
PC and a tablet body it's just a tablet
basically it's the same things that Note
10.1 only bigger it's fast and
responsive thanks to an X eNOS processor
and three gigs of ram the ram also helps
a lot with multitasking but there's
nothing that really differentiates it
from any other Samsung product other
than its sheer size and starting at
seven hundred and forty nine dollars
you're paying a lot for a little more
screen real estate it's not going to
replace a laptop or even really let you
leave it at home the no pro is great for
meetings and it's great for watching
movies and for everything else it's just
exactly the same as any other tablet
only bigger and heavier and more
expensive
there's a million miler businessman out
there who might get a lot from the
Galaxy Note pro but most people won't
get nearly enough
