we're here in Barcelona for Mobile World
Congress and we're checking out the
Samsung Galaxy Note 8 right now you note
8 is the latest member of Samsung's
Galaxy Note family and obviously by its
name it's got an 8 inch display which
kind of sits in between the note 2 and
the note 10.1 which have been previously
released for specs wise it's got a 1280
by 800 pixel display it's pretty thin
it's only about seven point nine five
millimeters so it's under 8 millimeters
thin and it's really light in your hand
of course it is all plastic as many
Samsung devices are it's kind of got
that glossy typical Samsung finish on
the back here we've got a 5 megapixel
camera well up front there's a 1.2
megapixel camera the device is powered
by a quad-core Samsung Exynos processor
clocked at 1.6 gigahertz and it's got 2
gig to gigabytes of RAM and Samsung's
gonna be offering this in 16 or 32
gigabyte versions of course since it is
a Galaxy Note it comes with S Pen
functionality which you can access with
the s-pen digitizer here what is new
about this is that you can use the S Pen
on the hardware keys which you couldn't
do on the older Note devices so that's
new for the Galaxy Note 8 a couple of
other things are new software wise
Samsung is bundling the awesome note
software which is a note-taking software
that it's been pretty popular on iOS
this is the first time it's on Android
and Samsung is including it with the
note 8 for free so the other new feature
here is the ability to hover over
content when you're using a third-party
app the first time app that's optimized
for that is this Flipboard app that's
been optimized to be able to show you
headlines while you just hover the pen
over the device without having to click
into it Samsung says it's going to bring
this to other apps in the future the
other unique part of the hardware here
is an infrared blaster on the side
samsung has included a version of the
peel software so that you can control
your home entertainment center and
television using the IR remote
on the side of the device it's the same
software that's HTC is actually using
for its sense TV product on the new HTC
one device the note 8.0 also features
samsung dual view feature which we saw
on the note 10.1 and also on the note 2
it's much less lag with the note 8.0 in
this mode then we saw with the note 10.1
so it seems that Samsung has improved
the software greatly here samsung isn't
quoting a battery life for the note 8
but it is saying that there's a 4600
million about our battery included
typically most companies say that will
last about a day but we'll have to see
wow this runs when we actually get a
tester unit in for review the Galaxy
Note 8 international version can
actually make phone calls so you can see
it's got an earpiece here and there's a
microphone at the bottom so if you
really wanted to you could use this as a
calling device with the 3g equipped
model samsung is also going to be
releasing a Wi-Fi version and an LTE
version the company says that the note
8.0 will be available by the end of the
second quarter this year but it's not
yet talking price and we don't exactly
know the final specs for the US version</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
