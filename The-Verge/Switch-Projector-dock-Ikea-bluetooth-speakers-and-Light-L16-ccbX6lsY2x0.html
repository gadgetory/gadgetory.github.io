live I'm Ashley Carmen Paul Miller's
here I'm Paul Miller you probably are
noticing right now that new AI is not
here that's because Neil eyes a dad
happy lie and he's spending time with
his baby not with gadgets which is
definitely for the best so we're gonna
start out with high M today but right
after hi I'm we're gonna Jake on he's
gonna talk about Android P so get ready
to speculate about what that P stands
for then we'll have Sean o cane here
with some crazy camera and also Jake
will be back again with an Ikea speaker
it's gonna be a good show right not yes
that's Neal I likes to surf a full show
hi I'm you have things on this table I
have things on what are the things on
this table so the things that we're
talking about are two new pico
projectors little portable projectors so
we have this which is the anchor nebula
capsule which is kind of your like
bread-and-butter pretty standard
portable projector as portable trick
portable projectors go and then we have
a little bit weirder which is the yes Oh
Joe I think it's oh-ho
I think it's oho oho okay yes oh-ho
oh-ho they they really reach for it on
that name which is a projector built
into Nintendo switch doc so you've seen
the switch doc this is hunk of black
plastic now imagine it's slightly bigger
with the projector two cooling fans a
speaker and a massive internal battery
how big is the battery on this so the
battery on this is twenty thousand four
hundred million hours which is extremely
big if you recall a couple weeks ago we
had switch accessories we had that giant
battery pack that Creighton had so it's
like that big so it's it's got like in a
hundred and thirty dollar battery pack
built in it is this charge your switch
or is it just
powered the projector so we can charge
your switch it can actually it has a
separate mode over here where you can
put it into battery mode where it just
turns into a battery pack and you can
charge very large I mean if you're
trying it anyway so here we go so yeah
you've got a plug
we've got ports so you got power in for
USB seeing which a is great because us
PC is great and the switch charges with
us PC so you can just use the same
charging cable you have so you could use
like a like fire TV yeah always got the
archives handy dandy fire TV let's do
this without blinding Paul I'll get you
I'll get you a screen home and you have
our camera people all of whom I have
already brought to be clear the regular
switch doc no projector nobodies just
okay and again these are actually pretty
similar projectors this costs 350
dollars it's about the science of Serta
cam it's actually we measure this super
point of super portable it has this cost
this cost fifty dollars more than this
this has battery that's four times the
size and works with a switch so you know
trade-offs yeah and this is tiny and you
can fit in your pocket this also runs
Android TV so I'll turn on a few minutes
but this has like Netflix YouTube
everything built-in the switch has Hulu
you can you can watch the real magic is
doing with the yeah let's swap that in
let's get the switch going this seems
like the solution all my problems
honestly because I have a switch I
cannot manage a whole projector setup I
don't really have a TV at home so this
actually seems like exactly what I would
need yeah I mean I'm really just a big
fan of this in general just because the
switch is already so portable right so
your your focus again with adjusting
focus there are buttons it's actually
the thing I don't love about this is
that you just click the button like a
thousand times to get into focus
yes there's no remote there's no
projector settings for the things I like
about this is that actually both these
projectors have a cool thing where
they'll adjust to the angle that you're
putting it on so it's a level screen so
if I put it like an angle it knows how
to compensate for that and just keep
unfortunately it only does that
vertically not horizontally so but this
is on and we're just gonna drop our
switch in just like we would with the
actual docks extending the fun of
Nintendo switch oh and here we go
dang so you can just jump right in so
has built-in speakers yeah it's got
built-in speakers there's also an aux
port if you want to you know extend
speakers a bit and it's like a regular
switch and net yeah that was like simple
simple setup I can see this is the
studio have you done it have you tried
it in the dark yeah in the dark it
actually looks pretty good so this is a
200 lumen projector this one's about a
hundred neither of them is outstandingly
good like relatives like big
professional projectors I just knew them
is like super outstanding relative like
actual projectors but for a small
portable projector you know take on the
go for playing a game of Mario Kart on
your rooftop with all your trendy
friends it's through I've heard that
third-party docks and things like that
have been tricking the switches yes is
that something people need to worry
about with something like this I mean
there's always a concern when you're
using a third party accessory on 90%
sure Nintendo hasn't authorized this one
I'm more ok with this for a couple
reasons one is even compared to the
switch dock you're putting this in
relatively if you look you're putting
the switch much farther in so there's
less chance of it like damaging or
scratching up your screen and to
the issues with the bricking was really
I think one specific Nyko dock which I
actually have on my desk and have been
afraid to plug my switches before maybe
don't do that yeah this was an IndieGoGo
project which is usually kind of a red
flag here not even kickstart this
IndieGoGo is usually more this is really
 but it's really shipping and go on
Amazon and actually order one I think
they're currently backordered but you
can order one on Amazon it'll be
shipping with prime shipping I think in
a couple weeks
or how much it's $400 which is the catch
the other hand this is again this is
kind of you know your base model this is
three hundred and fifty dollars this has
a battery that's one quarter of the size
and you can't just drop your switch in
and like going back like in the original
switch commercial they had that like you
know you trendy hipsters on your roof
heels on your reclaimed warehouse roof
in Brooklyn playing playing switch games
this is like this is like me the
evolution of that tree we're not only
not only are you showing up at your
party like the coolest guy in the world
Paul with your switch it's ready ready
to lead a game are you there with your
with your giant block projector yeah
suddenly everyone's enjoying well I have
I did in Manhattan I have logged a huge
projector up to a friend's roof before
just to watch Netflix
yeah that was seems like it'd be easier
now with this this kind of thing now
this is Android TV this is a set this up
too so how do we turn this off there's a
power button on the front it's just a
switch oh that's a switch pun not
intended sorry I think I kind of
reviewed this yeah I had a lot of
problems with this remote so this looks
like such a simple room it looks so
simple is it if it looks like this
remote which is arguably this feels
awful there's a tiny infrared sensor
here
on the back it just you got to be like
direct shot so you doesn't work well
with the bank shots right I guess with
like a portable projector that's more of
a concern because you're going to be
like moving it around a lot yeah I mean
this just runs Android TV which is good
try this just try this what's the
resolution on this one the chat wants no
so they both have the same resolution
they both natively project at 854 by 480
so not like great resolution but it's a
small battery power projector that you
can carry in your bag and take anywhere
how many lumens this is 200 lumens
that's 100 lumens so again neither these
are breaking any records in terms of
projectors you're not gonna you know
install this in your home theater is
your big cinema quality projector but if
it's a thing that you just stick in a
bag and take with you to your rooftop
parties like find this in college I
would have failed out of college okay
let's do this remote demo it works I
mean I'm literally pointing it directly
at it but there we go okay I'm back here
I'm already I'm already not yet like I
think three feet I think three feet for
a TV remote is reasonable statute to
expect it to work the nice thing is
there there is an app so you can you can
control it over Bluetooth mm-hmm that
works great it's also great for like
typing us can you show that app in the
overheads oh sure sure so you're just
moving around with your finger so like
the Apple TV app app actually yeah yeah
this is like a like a cursor kind of
thing that's really cool so this doesn't
have any app at all there's basically no
controls on the
on the Oh yo oh whatever we decided to
call it you can adjust focus with these
buttons on top you can adjust volume of
the internal speaker and that's it is
there's no remote there's no controls it
is designed to be as plug-and-play as
the switch itself is like you just drop
it in and go and hope everything kind of
works mmm and it mostly does would you
buy this yourself now that you are have
succeeded at college you know upstanding
professional citizen so here's the thing
this cost more than a switch does this
cost $400 so you could buy a switch you
can buy a second pair of droidcon for
the switch and you could buy a game to
play on the switch for less than buying
yeah but if you were gonna play on a TV
and you had to buy the TV that's true I
guess relative to TV so it's definitely
more of like a fun luxury it's it cost
like $200 I could see maybe doing it
yeah oh you also you do just get a huge
battery yeah I mean it is it is
basically in $130 battery pack like we
had a battery this big for the switch so
you are getting that out of it which
isn't bad but it's it's definitely so a
little expensive at this point God
family it's just a cool like people are
finally doing interesting things with
this which this is this is the do more
things like this developers if you're
listening and hopefully a Nintendo
doesn't break it and hopefully a
Nintendo doesn't break anything
awesome well hi I'm thank you so much
for coming on now we're gonna go to I
don't know maybe a part of the show you
probably like a circuit breaker so Jake
is gonna talk about Android PE get ready
to speculate in the comments with Jake
here we go what's up Jake a month ago we
put up a first look at Android P when
Google released the Developer Preview
and basically all of the comments on
YouTube or a speculation about what
Google is going to name Android B it's
like that time of year it always happens
debate over what the net
desert they'll choose is going to be for
the name of the property since we feel
reduced go through some of the favorites
that were in the comments and talking
over the first one the number one most
popular comment was Android pancake and
I'll tell you all this is actually just
a bad yes because it's not a dessert all
Android operating systems have a native
desserts and pancake is not pancakes
what about when they have whipped cream
on them yeah if you Mickey Mouse
pancakes Mickey Mouse if you know how
you shape the pancake it still is a
breakfast but if you have a great dinner
and someone's like would you like to see
the dessert menu it's full pancakes that
are sweet and delightful you say I'm
sorry I don't eat my own desserts for
dessert I think that would be strange if
somebody offered you cereal for dessert
would you still a breakfast food okay
there are better office in pancakes are
delicious people are in the chat are
saying pancake equal breakfast thank you
commenters for once alright what else we
have number two another really popular
when we saw was popsicle which I think
it's a very good guess but here's the
thing popsicle is actually brand name a
registered trademark of whom the
popsicle in people I don't my feeling is
like where you kick out you recognizes
brand names I did not even realize that
pop school was a brand name like the
generic is ice pop so it'd be a lot of
work for Google to get the permission
for like nom oh right I feel like it
would not be as like worth it that's
that's my feeling against pops okay what
else we got
we have some good and bad ones
peppermint it's fine thanks I am really
I like eating honestly a lot of people
and then
are saying peppermint really which I'm
shocked I think parents really I just
think a peppermint pattie like the candy
the candy little ones those mints are
absolutely now dessert so that is our
qualifier here no well but this is
honeycomb a dessert I mean so lame
dessert and similarly one of the worst
versions of Android oh yeah all right we
also have popcorn no it's not unless you
put chocolate pieces sugar on literally
any we're getting so many crazy ones in
here happy seed muffin panna cotta
these people are trolling I wanted
pineapple upside-down cake that's was a
bunch of pineapple suggestions coming up
we have a bunch of us a potato this is I
mean a delicious food but not not
working for for a dessert I drew a pie
yeah I mean I feel like it's a little
short feels like you like someone in the
chat says pumpkin pie I have a theory
that they might not want to do but cut
any anything with a double P the
alliteration is good the alliteration is
good but if you think everybody
abbreviated Android Ice Cream Sandwich
is ICS and here you're going Android
nobody's gonna call it Android double P
it's gonna be that's my only my my
reason why it might not be that enter
pineapple we got yeah that's that's a
clear fruit I think fruit is another
thing
yeah stache accessorize your malicious I
like this one because think of it do
pistachio ice cream sandwich pics and
then say Samsung upgrade to pics or it
didn't happen right you could have a
great crowd there you know market
what about pecan
another nut again pecan I think pecans
are traditionally seen a it's very I
don't think that's true of any not a lot
of oil yeah I and and likewise peanuts
are like if you're approaching dessert
you know you're just warming yourself up
we actually find yes so Google IO is
coming up in a few weeks is the
beginning of May mm-hmm but we're not
looking at the name and Google usually
introduces some of the more
consumer-facing features in the spring
or then put out a public beta so we'll
start to get a sense of it but pretty
much every time they don't actually put
out the final name unless you're they
did like a special event yeah or yeah so
we're probably not gonna actually find
out until the fall usually around the
time that the pixel comes out that'll be
around September October and that's when
we got the phone name although sometimes
they'll you know might do some sort of
gimmick around the spring to kind of
vote on the name or get people
speculating so it's not unheard of I
will say my favorite one is up here kind
of I'm kind of feeling pop-tart also in
some cases a brand name what part well
it's definitely definitely a brand name
yeah it's pop pop tart crossovers now at
my bodega so I know that the pop art
brand is willing to diversify okay yeah
are you a pop fair shape I can't really
thank thank you Paul this is been
incredibly helpful let me because
there's new cameras desserts are you
buying Dunkin Donuts at your bodega
why are you biting don't you notice at
the bodega I just have noticed that
Dunkin donut pop-tarts it's like a
vanilla latte pop-tart okay okay all
right we're down Shaw no Kane is here
Shawn what you know we're good we're
heated what's going on one of the
weirdest things I've probably ever
reviewed for The Verge this is the light
l16
as you can see Paul cam this is a camera
with 16 cameras on the front of it wow
it is quite the thing to behold costs
$2,000 1950 I'm being a oh you're
basically buying 19 cameras a hundred
bucks a camera right anyways it's got
five 28 millimeter wide angle lenses
okay
mixed in here five 70 millimeter sort of
mid-range lenses and six 150 millimeter
telephoto lenses and these are all
essentially the same kinds of camera
modules you'd find in a smartphone so
like that size you can actually see the
151 s are laid out with mirrors in there
and they're making I don't know if you
can hear the noise but I might be able
to get the yeah there we go you can see
a movie it's to focus because they're
all coming from sort of slightly
different angles so to make sure that
you have the subject in focus they're
all just mirrors a little bit so yeah
the whole idea with this camera is that
it essentially is mimicking having a
mirrorless or DSLR camera with a 28
millimeter 250 millimeter zoom in and
lens and the idea being that you know
you're saving space go have the giant
lens out here this is something that you
know more easily slips in a bag or a
pocket and it's actually simulating all
those focal lengths in between so if you
zoom to 40 millimeters it's taking
multiple camera sensors at the same time
all images from those camera sensors at
the same time combining them all on the
fly
and rendering out something that looks
like it would have looked like if it was
a 40 millimeter lens how do you zoom
with this so it's got a five inch
touchscreen LCD on the back mm-hmm
camera over here yeah so you just touch
on the screen it's giving me some mic
haptic feedback right now which is
actually kind of nice so you know for
sure that you're zooming if you're if
you're not really exactly pretty
responsive it's pretty smooth it
actually just runs on Android you can
show you somehow notice you can just pop
out of the camera app and it has like a
tray of things so yeah I'll take a photo
people are saying you're triggering
their trip of phobia sure yeah what is
it tryptophan of closely gathered holes
I believe yeah you should go read the
review because we're not gonna be able
to cover all of this here now because
there's a lot to this thing and have a
lot of thoughts about it but yeah sorry
there's a very trip debit triggering
really I just want to see it in action
like which one do I look at yeah yeah
it's definitely not the most like it
doesn't put your subject say to use and
I found it pretty good for you know like
street photography it's kind of slow and
thoughtful when you try to take a lot of
it's not it's not like it's pretty nice
yeah for in here and so what you can do
is so this is showing some sort of like
low megabyte preview on the camera you
can actually tap this button to process
it it'll run through it'll combine what
was showing you was one of the images
tap this process button you give it a
few seconds it'll combine and make a 13
megapixel image image so you can
actually see it looked that air quality
now there's more detail in the hair it's
not as like artifact II on her face and
if you have an Android phone you can
then Bluetooth share it out
oh it which is nice what about if you
have an iPhone or an iOS device iPhones
can't handle Bluetooth file transfers so
yeah you're kind of screwed that
from getting a photo from this to
Instagram if you have an iPhone is shoot
it on here off loaded under your
computer like connect it and put it on
your computer run it through their
desktop software save it out get it back
to here iPhone and then on Instagram so
it's not the most mobile friendly setup
and so you said the the version that
this process is like 13 megapixels yes
no the desktop software can process like
a way higher yes it's capturing so much
information because it's capturing from
up to 10 different cameras at any given
time when you take a picture and so the
ultimate combination of that can be up
to 52 megapixels if you run it through
the desktop software and you can export
that as a JPEG you can export that as a
dmg raw file and then take it to
Lightroom and do more fine edits there
which is cool
problem is the desktop software is
pretty slow it's still in beta and I
give this company a lot of credit
because they put actually a lot of
updates out already on both the desktop
software and on the software on the
camera the firmware but yeah it's you
know it looks like lightroom it's got
your filmstrip here at the bottom it's
got some basic editing on the sides it
has some other special effects kind of
like what we used to see with that Lytro
camera actually we have a lighter I was
gonna add you about you can't you can
sort of mess with the depth effect you
can so initially this this camera came
out like I know six years ago and you
can take a picture and you could refocus
it yeah after the fact thanks to some
really interesting properties of physics
yeah the problem with this was that they
never figure out a way to make it so
that that worked like outside of their
own proprietary format you're doing in
bed light to his own
so this you end up with an actual yeah
you could go in here it's you know for
something that's kind of far away it's
not really going to be too great but you
know a closer image you could probably
try and blur it you can change the
f-stop yeah you can change the f-stop to
give it some like background blur see
it's it's just a little slower like this
doesn't look that impressive to me and a
lot of people want to know whether this
is better than a high-end smartphone one
person particulars asking about the
pixel to I know you're gonna get to this
but we want to know yeah so it it's hard
especially this um what we're showing
here what I found out after you know
that's really bashing my head against
this this desktop software is that what
it's showing us right now is uh is
already a sort of dumb down preview so
when you export the image you save it
out even as a JPEG it'll look a lot
better than what we're seeing right now
which is always frustrating but at least
it's got some better detail than what
we're showing you yeah the the depth
effects stuff is kind of tough if you
didn't have the thing that you wanted in
focus right in focus it's gonna kind of
be a little bit rough but the quality is
you know in sunlight it can actually be
pretty great in low-light it can impress
too it's it's always a little bit maybe
more than a smartphone when it gets it
right
just because it's working with so much
more you mean image data it's just never
really clearing the bar it's never
really making that leap from smartphone
to like a mirrorless camera or an aps-c
Kinsmen sensor camera and and the
process of working with these images is
just like it's you can see it's like
loading every time I pull its gonna do
that because it's really seamless on the
fly which is like really frustrating so
like you got to wait for it to sort of
pop in that's that's pretty good but
like you zoom in it's got to reassemble
it no it's great if you make an edit it
blot you can see it like blocking in the
changes so that's just like a real big
choke point for it and what I found is
that you know it's it can really impress
you some of the images it takes can be
really great but it's kind of in the
same way that like pictures from my
iPhone can be really great and it's not
certainly is like a consumer product I
don't think it really justifies the
price even though it performs better
than
I think I thought it would it I just
found myself rated with it can you think
of someone this would be useful for or
is it just a tech demo it's just like
I'm not hit at the future of camera I
think if it had more mobile features
like if you could really get it you know
really hook it up through like a mobile
app to your smartphone if it had that
sort of pipeline if it was a little bit
better in fast situations you know it's
actually really not that far off like we
saw the first prototype of this thing
back in 2015 October 2015 I think and it
was at that point it was like still just
it was like the circuit board of like
all the camera modules and like things
weren't even connected like it's really
crazy how far it's come and it's a
polished piece of hardware so it's
actually not too far off and I think you
know that they're making changes to the
software and the desktop and on the
camera is a good sign like the people
who do buy this are gonna see it get
better okay it is so software which is
all smartphone cameras yeah and sorry I
mean I think there are people I don't
think that you should go out and buy
this camera as opposed to like the
premise that they that they lay out that
this could replace sort of like a camera
bags worth of lenses doesn't really hold
up like you're still gonna be better off
the difference between this and like a
Fuji film X t20 with a zoom lens on it
space wise actually isn't that great
like and you're gonna get far more
reliable consistent quality out of that
or a camera like that where this really
makes sense is like in a in the context
of smartphones and I think that's really
what their goal would was with this was
prove that this works and I think they
did I'm really impressed that like the
cameras didn't miss a line or you know
like the the software works the way it
does and if you can downsize that from
16 cameras to five or four three fit it
into a smart phone like and give some of
these benefits like a hundred and fifty
millimeter zoom on your smart phone
without it being digitally that's really
is that kind of like the future we're
starting to see with for example just
the iPhone the dual camera is obviously
everyone's getting dual camera a twenty
pros got 4000 camera yeah I think triple
selfie camera is I totally think this is
where this is all heading like
Google's already doing crazy work with
software on its pixel phones with just
one camera and so the more cameras we
see on these phones if you get companies
that know how to handle the software to
do sort of tricky things like this I
think we're gonna see a big explosion in
value there cuz they're just so like the
physical limitations of building a
camera the size that fits in a
smartphone are so concrete that like
we're already up against them right you
can't really get the aperture any lower
you can't really get this you know it a
bigger sensor in there so something like
this is a really good idea and I know
that they've been in talks with some
smart phone makers they've been telling
me that they're you know hopefully gonna
have a phone out this year that uses
this technology I think like Lytro we
saw them making those promises back in
2015 or not even promises but proposing
that idea and it took them until 2018 to
really get it out in front of people and
maybe they miss the boat now because
they're now there is like themselves
with three cameras and we are starting
to see this commit like in 2015 it was
rare to think about multiple cameras on
the back of a smartphone now we're
getting it like as it's it's table
stakes right but I'm excited to see this
idea keep going forward in the
smartphone and sort of form factor I
also think some other really crazy
stuffs going to come as well like if you
think where is it
there are a lot of 360 cameras out right
now I don't really think there's a lot
of value in them but something like this
which is the Rilo camera mm-hmm what it
does is lets you basically just capture
360 degrees and then reframe your shot
on the fly on your phone I think this is
300 okay GoPro zoom the same thing with
its fusion camera and you know we're not
far off from getting this down in this
like this getting this down into a form
factor that fits on your smartphone and
then all of a sudden you're using your
front-facing camera your rear-facing
camera okay like a 360 sphere and then
you just you know figure out how you
wanted to frame it later I think there's
some really cool stuff coming to like
the mobile space with these as like
indications of it as far as consumer
products go it's not not quite bad I
think it's so cool that they pulled this
off I didn't want to put this on
paka I know we got a clumsy aspersion in
the world I have somehow not broken the
glass on the front of this thing or
scrap well Paul was gonna break it for
you looks great all right Sean well
thank you so much for coming on the show
this is sick glad we got to demo it and
now everyone's favorite part of the show
oh that's right it is everybody's
circuit breaker
I did another explain yourself this time
it's about space law with Lauren crush
space earth you need a license now
probably thanks to the Tesla stunt blame
Noah in a 26-year old law by Lauren
grush space expert it doesn't say that
but I know okay Lauren
explain yourself
my crush I want to know the truth about
spaceball there's a lot to go over what
do you want to talk about well I read
this article on the verge that you wrote
about how Tesla was in trouble for
taking video in space
kinda because it's illegal to take
pictures of the earth illegal basically
you have to get a license from the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration if you want to take
pictures of video of Earth from orbit
it's known as remote sensing so if you
have a satellite and you want to take
pictures of the ground you have to get a
license first from NOAA and SpaceX was
not getting any of these licenses
because these are just they've been just
putting cameras on their rockets but you
know everybody saw Star man in space so
it kind of got people's attention this
is like to stop people from like spying
or something right it's based off an old
law that the US was concerned that maybe
you know a US company would put up a
satellite and they could go take
pictures of troops overseas and then
sell that information to a foreign
entity but you know we're getting to a
point where there's so many different
companies putting stuff in a space and
they have all these different
capabilities that there's debate about
whether or not the law is necessary
anymore or if we should update it so
this got me thinking what other space
laws am i I'm just thinking you know
let's say I built a rocket that can go
space and I get in the rocket I go space
who's gonna arrest me well first you
need a license from the Federal Aviation
Administration because you want to make
sure that your rocket does not hurt
anybody on the ground or destroy
anybody's house that's very important to
me very important you need a license
from the FCC to have access to the radio
spectrum in order to communicate with
your vehicle while it's launching and if
you're putting a satellite into orbit
and then if you were going to take
pictures of Earth you would need an
extra license from NOAA as well but
other than that I'm totally clear I can
do whatever I want
ah I mean you do have to go through a
payload review through the FAA if you
are bold about your intentions of
messing stuff up in space the State
Department will probably step in and say
now what if I build a real such a good
rocket and I go to the moon or to Mars
I've heard at least maybe the moon it's
kind of like Antarctica
the US has these obligations under a
treaty known as the Outer Space Treaty
and they don't want to mess they want to
get other countries mad at them so if
you're going to the Moon or Mars the
u.s. is going to want to know that
you're adhering to certain parts of the
treaties so for one thing planetary
protection is a big one you'll want to
contaminate other places with your human
germs because that can be really bad for
studying these places or what if you
introduce some weird space bug that
grows out of control and then comes back
and hurts us later on what if I just
want to plant some potatoes
you probably need you need to talk to
the State Department about that why even
go to space there's all these laws why
even try it's like UK you have these
laws for how to get to space but then
once you're up there
there's not a lot of regulation SpaceX
has been putting cameras on its rockets
for how long and the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration just
noticed and it was like oh that's
probably not okay so what you're
recommending is that I just try to fly
under the radar and try not to get
caught I did not make that
recommendation I officially thank you
that was explain yourself I think we
really got to the bottom whatever we
just talked about
we're back and Jacob the other side no
hard feelings about the disease it's
well some of us were right I brought you
something not Android related these are
speakers from Ikea there are kids very
first Bluetooth speakers which is also
just kind of weird because Iquitos
technology now and this has been
increasing over the past few years
several years ago they started building
qi wireless chargers and two things
you'd get like a lamp that would you
could put your phone on it with charge
they didn't really look that good
but you could do it then like a year or
so ago they released some wireless
ladies they had a whole system at this
hub had this weird dimmer thing I tested
up didn't work great but it was one of
the cheapest options you can get mmm
which is really what I kids been doing
it's been trying to just bring smart
technology down to a lower price make
sense it's like you and now they're
starting to get two speakers so these
are the first Bluetooth speakers we know
they're partnering we're so knows in the
future so in I think next year we're
expecting probably some Wi-Fi speakers
that have sona's compatibility or
something like that I was working with
teenage engineering on some more stylish
audio gear this is the start they're not
listening to you with these ones these
are dumb
these are yeah these are our Bluetooth
only yeah this is these are the dumb
speakers there's no microphones no smart
assistant you can plug your phone into
it or you can hook it up wirelessly and
that is it and these are really
bare-bones products this one's $49 this
one is $89 they meant to be portable
what's intriguing is this one has to be
plugged in this one comes with a power
cord
it's plugging by default but this is
Ikea it's kind of modular and weird as
you would kind of expect so what you can
actually do is there's this slot in the
bottom we have this coin here and you
can actually plug a battery pack I think
I locked it instead of opening it
there's this giant slot or a battery
pack to be plugged in yeah there for you
and it's like it basically looks like a
you know a portable battery for a phone
book and it's specifically designed fost
though that's another $20 so if you want
to use this wirelessly your haven't
bought any more for the yeah which I
mean is kind of a neat feature that you
can add that on but also then you're
getting into like a kind of a pricier
range and sort of the thing that I've
been wondering is you know what exactly
is the target market for IKEA speaker I
don't know who is maybe we should just
talk about like how these sound before
we get in yeah I want to see and someone
does want to know do you have to build
them I am very excited about this part
yeah so there is the ridge there's
there's a limited amount of assembly
there's a handle really basic assembly
this one has a handle you loop it on and
both of them have these detachable front
covers actually if you look way better
without them because then you can see
the speakers on the front there's three
drivers and this one too and that one
you kind of really have to dig in there
this fabric cover it feels very like
it's trying to be with that trend like
the Google thank you
yeah and and it looks a little bit like
the echo and stuff but it's not really
working for me on these these are very
like IKEA bare bones basic style I think
I'm sure that these are designed to fit
inside your cube IKEA storage units
everything fits together exactly and it
seems to be like you're already at IKEA
you're already shopping and like I need
a speaker so we kind of listened to him
earlier and our opinions were were mixed
I've got I got verge gas queued up on
here they yeah this is probably not
going to the most demonstrative thing
but it's gonna be the least one to get
us demonetised or whatever i'm youtube
so they get they don't get super loud
they get like loud enough probably but
they sort of get distorted at a higher
noise Paul you think they're awful I
think is that I really really hated
especially over Bluetooth I do agree
with you that once you plug it in with
an audio jack which you know good luck
to you I think it sounds a lot better
yeah I feel compression of sounds so is
really much sloppy and it's kind of a
painful like like a just please don't
hair with each other or anything right
it's purely just one off yeah no is one
off like you connect to this you have
like one in your room and that's it let
me see if I can play something else for
like two seconds that will be a little
bit clearer as music can you also show
us how this knob works as you want to
see someone use the knob
yeah the knob I mean it's it's spinning
it have fun that's that's what it's
there for
like
I love Drake and I'm sure his label
loves are playing him here really
enhance though it's true yeah I I don't
know I feel like these will work for fun
if like if you just like need music for
a party this is I don't think this is
like for close listening if you're
buying your speakers at IKEA you're not
trying to close listen you're just like
this will look good in my room yeah it
can do the bare minimum which is pairing
my phone and play music yeah it seems
like I need a speaker for my bedroom I
don't know if you're a measure of
already yeah exactly I think this would
work for that but at that price range
you probably could get a better
Bluetooth right that's a thing this is
$89 and I I'm not sure it's like a weird
balance like this one's this is not
portable either you can probably get a
pretty good portable one like at these
prices too so it's it's definitely go
weird I think I think like the Google
home and the echo what they make they
black and like as perfect speakers they
have like really high quality audio
because it's all coming over Wi-Fi like
much time bluetooth thing to know of
course they can cost a little bit more
yeah but I I do think these both of
these speakers sound way better with a
novel yeah it's weird cuz you upgrade
these by plugging away a chromecast
Audio or connecting like an echo dot at
that point like you're spending so much
on these things but I didn't just get
like a normal echo I don't know if that
would really be so much better we've
done necessarily an in-depth listening
test on either of these yet but look
when you just carry it there's a guy
with four Bluetooth speaker
speakers hanging around his neck like a
chain it was amazing that isn't you can
show that off with two of those exactly
I just right there
well Jake thank you for bringing on
these speakers or are they out yet yeah
these are entering stores now I think
you managed to buy them online because
they're in limited quantities at the
moment but this is gonna be in a Kia
stores do we say what they're calling
them oh they're called they're called an
Emmy I mean I don't know has maybe
twenty and thirty okay there's no accent
marks but they're all all caps okay all
caps any be enemy any be yeah awesome in
this alright well that's it for circuit
breaker live thanks for watching and
we'll see you next week same time same
place
bye Paul again and I've just been trying
to think of a good name for a spaceship
company Paul's astronaut up sending
launcher he up since it launches
astronauts Paul yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
