verge lounge
we're sponsored by Ford they have a
Mustang we've been doing verge casts
everyday and we thought it might be fun
to do another one but make it sort of a
special edition so we're calling us a
virgin table and rather than the
standard verge crew we've got some of
our friends who are what would you call
it guys on YouTube famous youtubers also
super hardcore into gadgets
unapologetically just love them some
gadgets so we thought it might be cool
to just sort of hang out talk about the
gadget we saw at the show and how things
are going so I am dieter bone on the
executive editor for The Verge calm and
let's go around the table and guys
introduce yourself my name is marques I
make youtube videos as we all do at
youtube.com slash mkbhd that's about it
yeah my name is Austin Evans I make
videos that are slightly less good as
marques and my channel is Austin Evans I
also make videos John short for Jonathan
I like the Bulls and youtube.com slash
TLD can we talk about this hat that
you're wearing before we get into
gadgets I wasn't prepared for that but
we can it's a very nice is it not hot
walk here on the show floor wearing that
thing it's it's comfortably cool right
now yeah
okay see nice here yeah it's a good hat
so yeah we're walking on the show floor
what have you guys what like how's the
show floor been for you is it does it
seem super crowded as it seemed are
people like costing you everywhere or
you just sort of just having a good time
or what I this is my third CES okay and
I feel like every year you try to you
have a different strategy I guess for
one-man band you kind of have a
different strategy of what you want to
see I'm surprised there's as many people
here on today definitely it's slowed
down by now so I guess I would say yes
it's more crowded than I thought it
would be but I've made my way around all
three centers I've seen a lot of stuff I
don't know if you guys have any
specifically awesome things that you
want to talk about that you saw yeah I
was a little bit behind but I finally
just played with gear VR about an hour
ago what do you think I was really
surprised so I've been a guy who I like
I tried oculus the original I loved it
you know the Developer Kit to morph is I
just play with the Rays
OS VR and all these things in they're
great they're great and I put on gear of
yard with like very low expectations
like that's just a phone like yeah
Google cardboard is cool but it's like
you know whatever so I was expecting
something like that and I was really
impressed that there was a game I'm not
entirely sure what the name of the game
was it was like a spaceship shooter and
basically the entire controls were like
you're just constantly moving forward
you move your head and you're able like
because there are no tethers with gear
VR you can like spin the chair around do
everything you're always flying whatever
direction in there a little touch pad on
the side that you can shoot stuff with I
just want my my footage the footage
without shooting was hilarious
I was finding people who are doing
Brandon vr things and they were just
kind of like you know moving around and
looks weird but playing this game you're
flying forward and you're just kind of
looking at things that pass you but you
have a swivel chair so you're actually
like swiveling around really fast and
impossible whole folk looking ridiculous
yeah be easy for you do you guys find
that there's enough content enough stuff
to do in VR to hold your attention
beyond a tech demo ask that man need to
be our master not yet I mean I've I have
the oculus the developer kit too and I
play with it sometimes but I mean unless
you're really into like you know the all
the demos and all about the little
things like a lot of the games I've
played with are very much like the okay
look this is a game we poured it over to
oculus it works it's kind of cool it's a
better experience but not it's not quite
there yet for me so for me it's
definitely the the tech demo the kind of
the Hey look look you got like friend
over or something play with this look
how cool this is
and you put in the closet for like
another month right the most fun thing
to do with VR is hand goggles to
somebody and watch the music oh yeah
that's that's awesome
that's not my line I stole it from Eddie
Robertson I can't that's true
so you guys do a bunch of phone stuff
right I thought that's like I love
watching your phone videos uh not much
in the way of phones now G flex 2 G flex
2 what happened the whole lot of yacht G
flex 2 yeah no that was easily the most
that was the most requested thing I've
heard people that want to see a video
about is that phone and then little
murmurings of other things right but
phones you see the bigger phones getting
their own events their own announcements
so CES has become a place for the lesser
known brands and lesser known phones
to rise up from where they were before
so I would you guys take the G flex 2 as
you like it I thought it was really
comfortable yeah I reminded me of the
Galaxy Nexus yeah same same exactly the
same yeah and it it feels kind of
restrained to me like they like LG's
figured out that they can just you know
it's an ostentatious phone right it's a
giant curved phone which is crazy but
that it's not like blinged out look at
me I'm full of chrome it's just sort of
a chill cool phone I think that's good
for it yeah if they want to make this a
phone that people actually want and want
to buy it's a lot closer to what the LG
g3 looked like and I think that was a
really popular phone it doesn't have the
same you know beautiful tiny bezels but
but it looks like like I said people
were saying look like a oneplus one and
it looked like a lg g3 on the back and
those are phones of people already like
using so yeah the g3 from before was
huge and this is actually a smaller
phone which makes it I guess easier to
pocket easier to hold up your face
without looking ridiculous so I actually
haven't seen the G plugs to yet but I
did play where I'm with the original G
flex is the screen any better because
that was the big thing for me the screen
was a little rough on the original key
flat screen of the last G flex was a big
plastic AMOLED 720p screen up and the
screen of the new G flex is a slightly
smaller slightly less curved 1080p
display okay I think it looks a lot
better yeah for sure
two thumbs up okay so what else what
else you guys find on the show like
what's your what's your favorite gadget
we should we should go around the table
and do favorite thing at the show the
most fun I've had here is actually off
the floor was where's Sam he'll agree
with me the Z board - yeah talk to me
about that that was sick so it's lighter
faster charges faster and like I played
with it before and I've kind of been
okay with it yeah but this was the first
time I've got to use it like as
transportation so like we're going at
Downtown Vegas and I could really see
being a means of transportation so that
was kind of cool because we get so
discombobulated with tech and chargers
and headphones so it's kind of cool to
bring that tech into something that you
can go outside mm-hmm I get a little air
right around so that's probably the most
fun I've had at CES so far so is it so
I'm a giant klutz oh I tripped on the
way over here on the thing I can't do
anything and I used to ski
I was a kid but I don't know is it any
easier to handle the case or I I mean I
think because it's it's a little more
intuitive it seems like if you have it
just the slightest amount of like foot
coordination that's all you need
so I mallet I mean you're in yes but I
don't ride a skateboard and like five
minutes in like we were flying down the
streets yeah how fast were you going
the new one goes up to 24 miles per hour
whoa whoa that's fast yeah I almost took
an old lady out but you know it happens
sometimes worth it I had to bail on it
so it was the lady or the board so he
can bail at 25 miles now yeah hey whoa I
wasn't going 24 he can go up to alright
I mean I think maybe Sam will go 24 I'll
keep it like at 15 yeah I know that one
of my favorite things that I saw I
actually like to talk about two things
there's a BMW stuff that was outside in
that tent yeah and then there is some 8k
TVs I saw today didn't think I'd think
that much of them but as for as much as
I see 4k stuff in 4k TVs the 8k TVs
looked a lot better than the real a TVs
yeah and these were at like 89 90 plus
inch TVs from 10 feet away yeah
and looked a lot better than 4k TVs so
what kind of stuff are they showing like
they're showing these slideshows they
had this one text demo where you could
read a whole bunch of text and at the
bottom there was this tiny text and you
can literally walk all the way up to the
TV and read the text on the screen if
you wanted to that was cool and
basically photo slideshows because at 8k
no one has 8k video but you can show
these 25 like sure they did have to make
a video they had some from this one
Japanese 8k camera that's somewhere in
Asia right now that there are four of
them exist in like one Japanese news
agency has three of them yeah they like
all their footage from them but it looks
awesome we actually see it yeah yeah so
that actually looks significantly better
than 4k so super expensive though yeah
wins a TV battle this year I have my
guess but I'm curious here what you guys
see there's a lot of cool stuff at sharp
not none of the TVs that I think are
like coming out that were really that
impressive like but they had a lot of
different interesting panels like they
had the one that wraps around the pole
like I think it was like a forget it was
like it was a super like hard bend
around the pole
well they had some of those like
completely Bessel list displays likes
like gauges and that kind of stuff
they had 120 inch 4k TV they had 8k
stuff a lot of stuff I don't know if I
could pick a single thing but they had a
lot of really interesting stuff and a
lot it was just like look this is the
concept if people actually want to buy
it you know let us know when you might
make it happen but it's more just like
hey look we can do this now you know hit
us up you want some
we got them I think I like the the new
Samsung TVs the best I mean the the one
that eBay our design is just amazing but
I was expecting this quantum pixel
technology to just be a complete and
total nothing I expected to be just you
know a gimmick and it didn't I wouldn't
be able to see the difference but I feel
like I could I feel like it got closer
to the dream of having a LCD panel that
looks more like plasma you just check
those out I did a video on it that was
uploaded last night just explaining what
it does and what it is but I saw some
some Samsung quantum dot TVs that looked
really good unfortunately I couldn't see
them next to a regular LCD TV so that
source rate in the demo the footage
looks amazing but how much different is
it really um but yeah I was gonna say
sharp had a little bit of everything at
their booth they had that 8k that OLED
they had a lot of curved TVs a lot of
flat TVs saw a lot of curved keys yeah
there's a lot of cares a lot of curse I
have not heard a single television
producer utter the words 3d once
nobody's like they're Dale might be but
from what I've seen they're all like
pretending like it never happened no
there's like here and there the the
occasional my glass is free JD yeah it's
like it's dead huh I'm happy I'm happy
yeah remember that great of an idea it
was just you know guys come on that's
all that looks like you do yeah yeah yo
oullette yeah beautiful all that is is a
future of TV is the feel because it's
too expensive okay it looks so much
better than everything else the blacks
the also I saw these the BMW m4 and
their booth have these LED taillights
and the thing I think of when I think of
LED because I'm messing with so many
phones is not very bright
Rosalita tends to not be as bright but
then I look at these oil edy TVs and
they look awesome and
have you know pitch-black blacks and
these vibrant colors and super awesome
contrast ratios so I'm a fan of the O
LED TVs uh we never got around to your
favorite gadget was it the gear
it was the gear as well as those - yeah
the BMW stuff was there's a lot of
really cool stuff on the I don't know I
think my favorite thing was in the BMW
booth they actually had these I think
was they had the i3 which was not only
driver well driverless basically you
could hit like the button on your Smart
Watch and actually be able to see like
okay look I want the car to come up and
pick me up and so just you see it
driving like the wheels spinning like by
itself and everything and then also the
crash avoidance doctrine was wild after
he had the best demos of anything they
had the one for a Smart Watch thing that
summons the car i sat in the backseat of
it and basically the ladies like closed
the door behind me so I got the camera
set up and I was waiting for it to like
get summoned and basically the wheel
snaps into place and slowly starts
rolling and that was weird because I was
in the backseat of a completely unmanned
car yeah you don't think that's going to
be a something you're going to do but it
was awesome and then a crash avoidance
thing where basically I sat next to the
guy who pointed the car at a barrier
floored it and didn't let go
and we didn't crash into it it slowed
itself down stopped and he showed me he
after we stopped he floored it a couple
more times in the car didn't move so
that was pretty awesome that's wild yeah
man okay so mine because I have a huge
long history and I'm a big dork is
probably the webOS watch if you could -
guys it's like they get out on the in
the parking lot out he's showing it
they're showing it you know they can
unlock the car or whatever so app wait
ow d is the first one to show this off
Howdy's the first one to show it off
they first showed it off they wouldn't
say what it was everybody assumed it was
Android wear and then somebody reported
it was Android wear and then my old guys
back at Android central went out there
and like went into the settings and it's
webOS whoa yeah
and you know it probably won't come out
for forever they've got to do a bunch
more work on it but it was really fast a
really nice screen and it's just you
know I've gotten Estelle Joe because I'm
a big old palm fanboy so yeah and also
the palm brand so I was bring upload
about this don't even he's gonna leave
termite I didn't say no no it's so yeah
we talked about it yesterday so it got
sold to Alcatel or no TCL and they make
Alcatel phones and they just want to
like have people help them figure out
what to do with it so they haven't
actually announced anything they just
bought the name like it guys what's up
now they bought the name and said we
tell us what to do we don't know we know
you guys love palm wow it's a good
strategy so was there anything else
besides the name that they buy like
there's not much left of counter is a
webOS one to LG and they're making smart
watches and TVs with it and all the
patents went to Qualcomm and you know
all the employees left so what's left is
the names it wow I wonder what's left of
that name like how feel like some people
will probably know it but I don't know
how much value really is in that name
yeah I think that old dudes like me like
take like you guys the you guys know
like blackberry has got some really
hardcore fans right like take that and
cut it by like a quarter and that's
probably it but the problem is you can't
really use palm or webOS devices anymore
so they're they're dwindling really fast
so there's just not that many fans sad
story dangered species yeah have you
guys heard that you can buy a fake Apple
watch like yes here yeah it's like 35
bucks I think it's somewhere I get dummy
yeah I mean yeah is it functional yeah
yeah well no it's like it like tells the
time I don't I haven't had a chance to
go see it we're good we're actually to
put a story up about there's a few of
them out there yeah I need trying to
hunt one down yeah she do a video about
it
maybe Owen craziest gadget so my
craziest gadget I didn't get to see it
but it was a it's a band-aid that you
put on a baby and then it tells the
temperature of what the baby's over the
course of like 24 hours so if your kid
has a fever instead of like freaking out
and checking the baby's temperature
every five minutes you can freak out
every three seconds there's a battery
there's a battery in it yeah it's just
it's a disposable thermometer that you
stick to a kid and it will last for 24
hours whoa all right it's like kind of a
good idea but also kind of a freaky idea
because the kid will be a cup upset
you'll become obsessed with the shirt
kid oh right but I suppose it's better
than like you know having a thermometer
oh damn so say that I was about to say
we were over we're marques and I just
like an hour ago we all oppressors
yes so you know those telepresence
robots that can you go around well
there's like that 20 foot tall one of
those driving around their booth it was
good though because you didn't notice it
at first there is all these telepresence
robots that are like 5 feet tall you're
kind of talking to these people they
have the webcams and you're rolling
around like alright I guess I kind of
understand this booth and then you hear
a voice from like the ceiling and you
look and you just see these big wheels
and there's a gigantic one rolling
around
I guess jolly Jolly the Jolly Green
teleport it was weird the ridiculous
thing I may have ever seen it CES period
westrom like there's a guy looking up
his like and like there's a camera like
facing down so like the guy like you see
he's like on the screen up top you can
leave looking down at you and he's like
moving towards you just like there's
this giant robot coming towards you it
sounds terrifying we that wins for me
you see anything wild Jonna crazy wild
they have vibrating Bluetooth controlled
underwear is that for reals that do
before what I think it doesn't
yeah and then also a couples ring tell
me that they didn't have like a demo
station the lady was straight-faced like
giving you the talk like you can
apparently control it halfway around the
world so but but three quarters of the
way around the world not someone knows
how I get it that was definitely the
craziest weirdest thing but like they're
selling that stuff yeah
all right Wow Wow yes no gadgets are
back there's all kinds of weird gadgets
just like people have figured out that
they can like cram things together put a
tiny little chip on it have it talk to
the cloud and just make weird stuff
again it's kind of exciting yeah
and terrifying so what's your guys's
strategy for covering the show like for
The Verge it's shocking ah we've got a
huge team we've got a huge great video
team and so we just descend upon the
show and go every which way but you know
you guys don't have huge teams and so
I'm sure everybody's really curious to
know like when you come in at the show
what's your tactics for you know finding
the thing you want to find showing your
fans things they want to see yeah so
yeah as far as I know most of us shoot
our videos by ourselves so we're used to
being a one-man crew so come out here
and there's a ton of stuff to shoot you
have to find other ways to do it so
we're collaborating with each other were
each other's cameraman we're each
other's sound guy we give each other
ideas we collaborate on other stuff like
that so it kind of works helps to have
other people who are like-minded maybe
now we don't work for the same company
in our part of the video team but it
kind of works that way where we know
what each other likes because we make
tech videos all the time right yeah for
sure like yesterday we went and we
pretty much been all day shooting a
couple videos on your channel like it's
nice to be able to have a some backup
you know like usually we're all by
ourselves it's like oh I've got to go
focus the camera but like we're all just
roaming around looking for cool stuff to
do I think for me especially considering
that we are by ourselves and that we're
having to do everything ourselves it's
like there's very limited times it's
like okay try to find those few things
that are worth doing the videos cuz it's
like I can't do I mean I still one
editor yeah like I'm this is day three I
have one video up so it's like any Hotel
Wi-Fi and so I'll oh oh yeah we should
talk about that you should mention what
happened what it took to get that mkbhd
video up last night well it wasn't that
bad of a story basically I had a 900
megabyte file to upload and the hotel
Internet is three down one up on Wi-Fi
if it's working well yeah so I got I
started uploading this file and it says
something like ninety nine minutes left
and then I tethered on
Lu's iPhone for a while with which was
getting like seven down and up on
t-mobile hello
so that's shorten the process by a lot
but but it also took ten hours to render
that video it did take ten hours to
render that video on a dual-core MacBook
Wow
worth it so the the trick I've learned
is get if you can get into the press
room or you can wheedle your way into
the press room which is a thing I did
the first year ya get there at like 7:00
a.m. which is when it opens and they
they probably still have it you know
they've got laptop stations they've got
a printer which is insane but there you
go if you need to print something but
then they usually have got at least one
row of desktop computers walk up to one
of the desktop computers and just you
know steal the ethernet ah yeah there
you go don't tell me about that usually
you're finishing editing and you you
don't know everything you're done
editing and you just want to upload on
the spot right so wherever you are let's
go get that upload data and that can put
you in some weird spots yeah I mean I
think the the biggest thing too is that
it's nice being able to be a little
relaxed because I think so everyone out
here is just like shoving videos
everywhere so it's kind of cool being
able to like pick and choose and maybe
not rush it out because everybody's
going to see the videos from every other
tech blogger on the planet right right
you can kind of pick and choose what's
good and then but really put the time
and effort to make that worth watching
and I think that's really the approach
that every single one of us takes and
yeah because I mean you look at like I
was looking at your sub box the other
day and there's like there's like five
or my sub box is is a collection of
things around CES so if I've heard that
something's at CES like LG G flex 2 and
I go to my sub box and I see that first
video on it the other nine videos about
the LG G flex 2 are probably the same
video so I'll just kind of watch the one
that's there and then just leave so when
we're making content we're kind of
thinking I want to add something to that
but I don't want to make the same video
so we're just trying to find other ways
to add value add information at an
experience that's what we're
collaborating yeah having other opinions
about stuff so that's a lot of fun yeah
doing the interesting unique step as
always I think to though like it's
always that same like surround yourself
with people better than you like it's
cool like you just want to be around
talented people
yeah step your game up so I think that's
the biggest thing that we've learned
collaborating is like just vamp off each
other and it ends up making better
videos yeah do you guys find your like
editing differently like I don't know
I'd like actually let me ask a better
question how do you shoot VR and have it
not just be a you know dude going like
this oh that's that's it that's all yeah
and all you know wider just get wider
that's it
Jan out pan out yeah all the way out for
something like that you're just gonna
have to talk about like look at this was
good this was bad this is how it feels I
mean that's that's kind of a hard thing
to get across on video but uh yeah I
mean I think people get it I mean people
have kind of got an idea of how it works
and you know some people may have tried
this or you know try like Google
cardboard or something so like usually
they'll have an idea of what you know VR
is gonna look like but it's not it's not
the easiest thing for sure well yeah I
found that all the VR stuff I've tried
if it's not oculus it's behind oculus
right oculus stuff yeah and his
experiences were awesome and then the
other stuff I think I won't even name
drop but like razors demo was just not
good it was bad
well I mean I'll give some credit risk
try I understand that aren't they trying
to say that like this is just like a
development kit to proof millinery so
here's a but here's a bad one that we
built try and build some and you know it
feels a lot like the original oculus it
feels right there yeah like they're kind
of starting in the same spot of you know
where let's let's give this try the
hardware's not finished and there's
there's a lot still to be worked out but
yeah I mean it's it's decent but I mean
you know it's oculus they're they're ass
I mean have you seen doc dose booth I
have not it's huge
I've been I've been afraid to go there
because I know I'll get lost and I
haven't set up an appointment to see it
oh yeah there's like a two-hour line day
yeah play right now yeah like last year
they're in a little tiny meeting room
remember we take a look at it and did a
little video and now it's just like have
they won a huge booth it's like all the
ceilings like wow there you got that
Facebook you know what it is
yeah but well guys I think we are close
to wrapping up so I wanted to give you a
chance to like just talk about your
channels a little bit just because you
know we're gonna put this out on the
