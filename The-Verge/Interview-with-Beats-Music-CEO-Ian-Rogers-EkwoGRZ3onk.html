today beats is launching a streaming
music service making it the newest
competitor in an increasingly
competitive market I'm talking today
with Ian Roger
CEO of beats music you chat about how
they plan to stand apart from the pack
and why finding new songs to love is
actually harder than ever
what is beats music beats music is the
first music service that's actually a
service and not a server in the sense
that it's of service to the listener you
open it up and you're five seconds and
one hand from hearing something that
makes you want to roll down the window
and crank the volume to the right so
there is a lot of competition in the
space obviously there's established
players like Spotify there's big tech
giants like Google and Apple jumping in
what do you think it is that's gonna
differentiate beats I think you were
talking about it just a little bit now
but is it mostly gonna be that angle of
discovery and curation that's gonna set
it apart from the competition yeah I I
gotta be honest I don't really think
there's a lot of competition for what
we're doing I mean there are other
streaming services out there and I think
the services that are out there I've
answered the question of what is the
next format okay so not to take anything
away from them I think you know
establishing a big catalog and giving
access to a big catalogue of music is is
a great first step the subscription
services that are out there today are
great if I have a copy of my favorite
music magazine in my hand or if I'm also
you know looking at pitchfork com the
vision is really putting those two
together and you open up an app on your
phone and you hit play and you're like
oh man that is incredible
so I'll push back on that a little bit I
mean when I'm playing around on Spotify
a lot of times I check the pitchfork app
on there and they upload you know their
their favorite new music so I discover
new stuff through Spotify via pitchfork
you guys will have the same kind of
tastemakers on their Rolling Stone in
pitchfork and double-xl I guess one of
the things that beats was talking about
which team unique was having you know
this group of 30 or 40 human curators
who were gonna be pushing out new
playlist all the time you know that I
might discover somebody who's really
tuned in to my taste or showing me new
things who are these humans that you
guys are getting in there and why do you
think they work better than stuff that's
algorithmically generated yeah so we
have a great editorial staff as a woman
named Julie pilot who leads our curation
and music and relations staff and then
we
got plugin Hoff who was formerly the
editor of pitchfork who leads our
editorial staff and then to go through
that whole staff I mean they're
incredible we have Karl chair I used to
be a double XL Suzy Cole was a program
director at the last rock and roll
station on the on the planet the riff in
Detroit we have are in Timmerman's who's
the pop music correspondent for CNN ken
Tucker in Nashville fuzzy fantabulous it
was 17 years on power 106 in LA Cotte
who am I forgetting Mason Williams
from-from rhino I mean there and I'm
forgetting people but there's there's
there's more so they lead that each of
their respective areas but they have
then they reach out to the community and
bring more people in what do you think
about how beats will work in terms of
the value for the label or the artists
you know a lot of people have criticized
the streaming services Spotify in
particular but all of them for not
giving enough back to the artists who
are being streamed you're gonna have the
same approaches everybody else or are
you gonna try something different
well it's different in a couple levels
first of all because we don't have free
it's actually fundamentally different
alright so if you look at if you look at
the services that that have free
streaming it pays the free streams pay a
lot less so since we don't have a free
service we actually pay more on a per
stream basis a lot of the services that
we've been talking about who are
competitors here in the states and also
in Europe and maybe some of the ones
from your coming here now like Deezer
have struggled to turn a profit
I guess long term do you think that
beats the streaming music company and
beats the headphone are synergistic and
you don't expect beats music to be a
profitable company or do you think long
term you know the streaming service will
be able to be self-sustaining and
profitable the streaming service needs
to be self-sustaining and profitable we
are a standalone company we spun a
company out of Beats Electronics last
year so we are a sister company of beats
but you know it needs to have its own
piano and stand on its own two feet
it's really not a complicated business
though I mean I think that others have
made it complicated by spending hundreds
of millions of dollars a year with this
free feature that's really kind of a
marketing feature but the paid
subscription model is pretty
straightforward
there's margin and every subscriber and
you've just got to scale your numbers
your number of subscribers larger than
your fixed cost base it's really more
about how do you scale it because it you
know if you if you can't scale it to
millions of subscribers then the
business doesn't work but I really
believe that you know between the
product we have the brand that we have
the partnerships we have and then what
we are capable of internationally that
you know we can invest in this business
and grow to you know tens of millions of
subscribers over the coming years and I
think that's all the question I had one
that came back to me you said that
you're planning to pay the Indies and
the majors the same which isn't like
your competitors does that mean you're
gonna have more kind of obscure indie
stuff I find that a lot of times I'm not
seeing the artists I like or the labels
I like on the streaming service it's a
it's a really great question I think
that I'm a mix so excited about our
catalogue and our team for a couple of
reasons to come back to the the the
curators that you asked me about earlier
two things first of all we've actually
removed millions of tracks from our
catalogue I don't know if your if you've
kept up on what's happening with this
people with the spammers in the
catalogue but it's it's real problem you
have people that are uploading
sound-alikes cover versions karaoke
versions trying to insert themselves and
get plays and make a couple of pennies
here and there and and it's just
confusing for the consumer right you
know I was doing this thing on my
seven-year-old and wanting to hear
thrift shop and Here I am on MOG our
service and it was difficult for me to
tell which one was the real song right
and we actually ended up listening to
one that turned out not to be the right
not to actually be Macklemore so we've
actually we've gone to pains to get a
lot of that that bad content out the the
truly it's spam
so that that's one side of it we
actually care enough we're not like who
rose the most tracks right it we want to
have a great consumer experience so
we've gotten a lot of that spam out on
the other side of it because we have
these curators with that what we're
doing is that gives us a lot of
direction in terms of what catalog are
we missing all right so we're not trying
to say oh let's go get those guys
because they've got a million tracks you
know when you have a curator like des
magazine which is core metal what you
find out is the metal record the metal
labels you don't have really quickly
right because those guys come in and
they go these on the top these are the
40 metal records in 2013 that matter and
then you know okay well and then you
find out oh we're actually missing that
label that label that label and they
might be small labels that only have a
couple of you know that have a
relatively small roster but those but
put the roster is good because there are
small selective labels that are to a
core audience so I think because of our
curators we actually go after catalog in
a different way than our competitors do
because we're not on a race to you know
who can who can do a press release with
the most tracks it's it's who has the
music that people care about what else
see you've been listening to over the
last year I'll I'll point you to my best
of 2014 2013 listing you'll have a
mixtape on there that I could probably
go to my profile at I am CR on beats
music and I actually do sort of a weekly
or maybe twice a monthly mixtape and you
can you can hear you know what I'm into
from Aretha Franklin and just lying the
family stone - you know Kurt Vile -
Mastodon well thanks for coming and
chatting with us today and I look
forward to hearing it thanks for having
me appreciate it</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
