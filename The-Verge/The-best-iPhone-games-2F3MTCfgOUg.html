tell you about the games that should be
installed on every iPhone desert golfing
is a game about golfing in the desert
that might sound very simple because it
is at least for the first 18 holes but
then you realize by hole 19 and a hole
20 in hole 100 and hole 200 and hole 300
that golfing in the desert is kind of
meaningless and so are video games and
so is everything so why is it fun well
on a very basic level hitting a ball far
away from you and into a hole is just
really pleasing to your senses I can't
really describe it any other way but
then there's the mystery of it what's
gonna happen on a hole 250 - will it be
anything like 251 there are these slight
tweaks and variations that gradually
appear throughout the game and you can't
help but wonder because the desert ever
end Angry Birds is well very popular you
probably already have it installed on
your iPhone but if you don't you've
waited this long to play it well that's
kind of awesome because in all the years
since Angry Birds released its company
Rovio has been adding more and more
futures and levels to it for free so
right now if you get Angry Birds for 99
cents you're getting pretty feature-rich
game full of levels and things to do and
lots of pigs to hit because that's what
you're doing Angry Birds you're a silly
little bird or Birds who gets thrown or
catapulted at pigs how this became the
most popular game in the world for a
brief period of time is beyond me listen
I know that tiny wings is going to look
like a shrewd calculated play at making
a lot of cash off the Angry Birds
phenomenon but I assure you it is not
that it's basically my meditation game
as a little cute bird I go up and down
on the same Hills over and over again
collecting coins and speed until night
comes I fall asleep when you think of
Grand Theft Auto on iOS you're probably
going to think of grand theft auto san
andreas or grand theft auto vice city
which were the two big games released on
the PlayStation 2 I don't recommend that
you play them with a touch screen
instead I recommend that you try grand
theft auto chinatown wars which was
actually developed for a mobile system
Nintendo DS and for a touchscreen
it's a top-down game like the original
two grand theft auto games and it's much
easier to control it's also very strange
and violent and surreal I don't really
know how to cut through the approval
process for the App Store which is
usually more critical of these things
Steve they're cops can't tell me I'm a
cop killed don't put that in the food
you super hexagon is a reflex game which
is to say you have to have really good
reflexes to play it or you actually be
able to be trained to have really good
reflexes maybe that's the better way to
describe it because you stride out on an
easy level trying to move a little
triangle through a maze but it's
wrapping around you it's kind of hard
and you get a little better and a little
better and things get a little faster
and a little faster until your freakish
superhero who can move a triangle around
a maze
why do that why do anything we talked
about this video games they don't really
serve a purpose and that's kind of
what's magical about them
