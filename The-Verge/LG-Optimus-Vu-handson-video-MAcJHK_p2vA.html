optimus view this is sort of their their
entry into the tablet phone hybrid space
and i'll bring out a galaxy note a
samsung galaxy note for comparison get a
sense for the difference in the size
here obviously the view looks a lot
bigger but it really isn't it has to do
with the fact that this is a 4 by 4 by 3
inch aspect ratio versus the galaxy
notes which is a little bit wider it
depends on what you like but i will say
that the optimist view kind of comes off
as more of a tablet than then the Galaxy
Note does I would say the galaxy note is
more of a phone view emphasizes the
tablet angle comes with LTE eight and a
half millimeter thick shell so as you
can imagine the the ratio of the surface
area of the phone to the thickness
really makes it feel extremely thin I'll
show you the stylist here kind of a a
blunt point unlike the Samsung which
uses a pointy ER tip on the S Pen but it
works just as you'd expect
and one very cool feature of the view is
that you have this dedicated button on
top to go into a drawing mode you can
erase
you can get rid of the background if you
don't want that so if you're safe
annotating a screenshot you can keep
that background say oh there's there's
the oops there's the comics icon but if
you're just taking a note you can do
that around back you have a camera with
LED flash as I mentioned 4G LTE and for
capacitive buttons along the bottom no
soft buttons there so that's a quick
look at the Optimus view</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
