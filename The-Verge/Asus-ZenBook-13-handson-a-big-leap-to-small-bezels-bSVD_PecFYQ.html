2018 and with me and I have 2017 in
December and the reason I have it is to
show you the difference to the 2018
nowadays a bull 13 inch laptops but as
you can tell there's a massive
difference in size and as because it a
Susu shrunk down the business all around
the display is second down to much less
than a centimeter on all four sides
I don't need a backpack for this thing I
can just carry around oh man these
stylish and stuff it's like a book size
it's impressive it's good technology
moving forward
the Nueces symbol also keeps the webcam
and a chopper to display where it
belongs and it also has IR camera so you
can do windows
hello authentication that it plays a
nicer they're brighter than the old
generation and the laptops are just so
much smaller you basically lose nothing
and gain a tunnel goodness okay alive
you do lose something you do is USB a
port you still get USB and USB see and
you can charge with USB see and you no
longer have an SD card reader it cannot
read microSD aside from you super
obvious upgrade and display the keyboard
is awesome even proved and that has a
backlight and it's not the old classic
type so that's some significant upgrades
and a sushi is also adding it's a go
lift hinge design which basically tilts
the bottom part of the laptop just a
little bit up so it makes it easier to
type one and sinks the display down a
little bit this really contributes to
the whole sense of this being a bezel
let's display again it has a few
millimeters of bezels but you really
don't notice them when you actually use
anything and it's really advanced look
and feel it feels like it's super
high-end premium where is the Zenbook
line the non pro version isn't really
issue since top-of-the-line stuff which
is pretty cool you know it's a high-end
feel in a device that is cheaper so
she's going to use em book 13 14 and 15
and 14 inch is actually smaller than its
previous 13 so that's how big of a leap
and it has been between 2017 and 2018
all of them have Intel hn4 processors
inside of them and you can get them
started $8.99 up to 1199 that's with a
16 by 9 1080p display again the first
line you can get a touch screen option
and dependent I would really want to
upgrade more anything else is the RAM
which has the 4 gigabytes really not
sufficient for most people otherwise the
standard spec is pretty nice you get a
much better display a better keyboard a
backlit keyboard and of course just a
much smaller
or comedian compactors unlike making the
laptops any thinner which delivers small
if any benefits reducing the bezels
reduces the footprint of the entire
machine makes it that much more
convenient portable and easy to move
around without needed to carry a big or
technical backpackers and I'm really
liking this trend which mirrors the one
we already have with smartphones so
these are a Seuss's new laptop february
serie diva 2018 for more from the show
and for other beautiful lovely amazing
advanced technology keep them up to the
road</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
