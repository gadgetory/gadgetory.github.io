the verge on the floor of CES day one
and I'm here with Ralph de la Vega ATT
CEO of mobile and business solutions
thanks for joining us great to be here
thanks very much atts had a business
show so far announcing a whole bunch of
different things but we're here to talk
about your smart cities initiative can
you tell us a bit about that we we love
what we're doing with smart cities
jordan you know we're a global leader in
connected devices connecting more than
25 million devices so we're taking that
expertise that we have developed over
the years to connect any number of
things helping enterprises to be more
successful and improve their performance
to cities so cities can be what we call
smart cities that operate smarter
infrastructure smarter transportation
systems in a more sustainable fashion
got it and that's interesting because
well not everybody interacts with a
business 18 teens got a lot of customers
but it's not a hundred percent but
everybody has to interact with the city
whether its water or sewer or traffic or
something like that how's this going to
help the average American well I think
this is the beauty over because I think
the whole effort of the cities that we
have announced as spotlight cities which
include Atlanta Dallas and Chicago it's
all focused on what we can do to help
the citizens of the city enjoy their
life better whether it's reduced traffic
better ways to find parking spots a more
sustainable water system I think it
depends on each city and each city is
having a slightly different focus the
kids that we can bring to the city a
complete end-to-end solution working
with partners like GE like Cisco and a
number of others it's it's interesting
when you think about efficiency you
don't usually think about government
services so this seems like an area
that's right for opportunity is there
anything that you're most excited about
yeah I think transportation you know all
of us have the experience of sitting at
a traffic light there's no traffic and
you have the red light and you sit there
and you sit there and you wait I think
we can make those a lot smarter so that
the infrastructure connectivity to cars
in the future will eliminate some of the
weight that we have an improved traffic
patterns so that citizens can move
around easier with less congestion in
the
cities so this is a long-range vision
for you it's a long vision also for the
mayors of those cities the thing we're
also looking at by the way our smart
airports all of us spend a lot of time
in airports right and finding a parking
spot getting around knowing when the
flights leaving things that are really
common place I think we have an
opportunity also to make them smarter so
it's going to be an incredible
opportunity for cities including their
airport operations to be improved got it
and one of the unfortunate things about
cities that might cause some trouble for
you is their lack of funding a lot of
cities even for essential infrastructure
improvements just don't have the money
to do it how do you going to overcome
that let's see the beauty of what we're
showing the city is that the same things
that we're doing for enterprises and
enterprises make their investments
because they feel they can get a return
on that investment so I think what we're
showing the cities and this is a key
aspect of everything we do is if they
invest in in a certain technology we can
show them how they're going to get a
return on that investment to improve
their operations long-term and that's
the same aspect that we use for
businesses today so it's showing them
how to use the business processes
including the securing of the funding to
get these initiatives going that have
nice payoffs over the short and long
term with the company if they spend a
lot of money with you and don't get a
return it's the shareholders that hurt
but with a government it's the taxpayers
how do we ensure that their money is
being spent wisely well this is where I
think there's a lot of oversight and for
example in Atlanta we work with the
mayor and the City Council working to
make sure that they're comfortable with
the proposals but we're bringing
proposals that have been proven to work
in enterprises so it's not like we're
drawing things that I've never been
tried before we know that when these
things get implemented we find out
better ways to run enterprises and I
think there's much better ways to run
cities as well every major city has
issues with their water systems many of
them are old and aging and so I'm going
to start to leak after they start to
leak it's catastrophic right when you
have a major break we have technology
now that allows them to better monitor
those five so they can give them the
right maintenance before they cost a
catastrophic failure so talking about
cities you guys have announced some
other things here at the show include
connected cars you know I think you're
up to nine major manufacturers now have
nine major manufacturer week we love
what's happening in the car space Jordan
you know the cars are getting so smart
today that in the future they'll be able
to talk to each other to talk to
infrastructure and to make our driving
safer i really think that what customers
are asking for today is more technology
in their cars to make it more effective
and safer and i think that's exactly
what the car manufacturers are giving
them so one interesting thing about cars
versus the cities is the cars are always
moving so they have to be Wireless right
and we're all worried about getting
enough bandwidth on our phones and
making them work is having all this
stuff in the city's going to impact that
no no I don't think so i think we have
playa bandwidth and these kind of
services are short bursty streams of
data so that's not very very demanding
of the data stream it's the key is to
get the right data on a real-time basis
you know monitoring rivers monitoring
streams monitoring the quality of their
water systems that can be done
relatively easily with cheap sensors
they just need the connectivity wired or
wireless to be able to to get the data
and then to draw conclusions from that
data whether something has happened that
is catastrophic or it's just a small
leak or something that is a minor got it
it's 80 and the partners are you guys
focusing on hardware are you going to be
doing analysis and helping cities make
better decisions from a political level
which is where the biggest mine no I
think what we're into solving is their
issues into and giving them a solution
that addresses a problem that the city
has identified as a key issue and
solving it into and not just by
ourselves of course with our ecosystem
of partners including some of the ones
that I mentioned thanks very much 18
tease got a busy week here at CES and so
do we stay tuned for the verge for a lot
more thanks round thank you thank you
very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
