and liftoff a year in space starts now
Kelly Kornienko and padalka on their way
towards the International Space Station
hey guys this is sean on the verge and
we just watched three astronauts take
off for the international space station
aboard a 300 tonnes soyuz rocket as the
43rd mission to the international space
station but this is no ordinary mission
to the astronauts are actually going to
go to the station to live for an entire
year scott kelly and mikhail kornienko
won't walk on this earth again until
March of next year and that blows away
the previous space station record of
seven months setback in 2007 when Kelly
comes back he will spent five hundred
and twenty-two days off planet more than
any other American now the world records
are actually held by a couple russian
cosmonauts one of which is actually
spent over eight hundred days in space
and that record is going to be broken by
a third crude member gennadiy padalka
now we've been sending astronauts to
space for about a half a century to the
space station into the moon so we know a
lot about the effects of microgravity on
the body and they're not great radiation
exposure is a big worry but so is muscle
and bone loss to the point that
astronauts actually spend about two
hours every day working out on
custom-built zero grab the exercise
machines but now we can measure these
effects better than ever and if we're
ever going to get past low Earth orbit
we're going to need to know more about
what happens to the human body in space
that's what this mission is all about
NASA will be studying a number of things
in the coming year like micro gravity's
effect on swelling of the brain vision
impairment muscle and bone loss and more
now what's even cooler about this
mission is NASA's also going to be
studying Scott Kelly's twin brother mark
here on earth he's a retired astronaut
himself they're not going to be in the
same controlled environment but NASA is
going to be able to use observational
research to understand on a genetic
level what happens to Scott Kelly's body
while he's in space for a year so
hopefully NASA is going to learn a lot
in the next year with this mission
because we're going to need that
knowledge if we ever go back to the moon
or go even further to Mars NASA wants to
send astronauts to orbit the red planet
in the late 2030s and there's a whole
new set of challenges awaiting us so the
more we learn closer the better off
we'll be out in space otherwise we're
just going to be stuck sending robots</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
