2016 and I am driving an LG rolling ball
now this isn't going too hot at the
moment because the software is really
quite dicey it's kind of like the Spiro
kind of like the bb-8 drone except a
really drunk one you know it's got some
great Dicer controls but that being said
the difference with this is that it
connects to this LG's new g5 flagship
smartphone and you can throw it from
anywhere so you just hook this up to
your wireless network at home and you
can control it wherever you are well we
have an internet connection you go
backwards and forward controls and
left/right etc to direct the camera as a
camera a megapixel stills 1080p videos
they can record for you it also has an
infrared sensor and v1 so you can
control things like audio players TV
even your air conditioning at home
volume switching channels etc a speaker
and a microphone so you can talk to pets
oh it has a special button which when
you press it the rolling bot just kind
of goes crazy starts using a laser
pointer a red laser pointer so it's just
jumping and bouncing around and starts
to exercise your pet so LG says it's a
form of pet care when you are not there
very simple interface there's a
button which just pops the motor so it's
kind of fun you kind of get the hang of
it after a while I have actually managed
to do a lap of this whole course that
I've set up here it took me about 30
minutes but I made it you know as a
device it's not coming out anytime soon
the LG g5 flagship is coming out in a
couple of months time in April but this
is five or six months away LG is still
developing it still working on it so
might be a while but LG is committed to
the concept and we should be able to see
the rolling ball with us at some point
later this year that's it from the LG
rolling worked here at LG's booth at MWC
2016 but stay tuned to our youtube
channel youtube.com slash Laberge for
more</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
