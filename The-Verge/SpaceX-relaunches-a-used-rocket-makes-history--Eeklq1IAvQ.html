it's got a fresh coat of paint you'd
never know that it's already been to
space
so it's 6:00 in the morning we're on our
way to see a man about a rocket we're
here at Kennedy Space Center to see
another SpaceX Falcon 9 launch it's a
pretty standard launch for them but
that's kind of the point they're sending
up a satellite for the company SES but
was extra special about this launch is
that this Falcon 9 has already been to
space this is basically the entire point
of SpaceX landing all of its rockets for
the last two years they're trying to
perfect reusable rockets so what is
reusability well it's just like it
sounds
it's reusing your rocket after launching
it seems pretty straightforward but
expendable rockets have been more or
less than norm since the beginning of
rocketry once a rocket takes off it's
essentially treated like trash parts of
it either stay up in space or fall away
to earth and break apart in the ocean
the problem with that is that you're
throwing away a very expensive
investment with each launch rockets cost
tens to hundreds of millions of dollars
to make and with each new mission you
have to make an entirely new rocket but
reusing rockets especially the most
expensive parts like the engines and the
propellant tanks can help reduce those
hefty costs but it's not so simple as
just bringing your rocket back from
space in order for a rocket to get to
orbit it has to go incredibly fast
thousands of miles per hour fast to
achieve orbital velocity you're talking
about you know seven and a half
kilometers per second which is wicked
fast and to bring something back from
those speeds you have to kind of reverse
the process you have to get rid of all
of that energy which means a lot of heat
a lot of deceleration a lot of pressure
that all has to be managed there are a
lot of techniques for bringing back
vehicles from space such as using wings
like the space shuttle or parachutes but
what SpaceX is using is a technique
called supersonic retropropulsion it's
basically using the
it's propulsion system what takes the
vehicle up to bring it back down again
SpaceX doesn't save the entire rocket
though it saves the first stage the 14
story core of the Falcon 9 that holds
the main engines and most of the fuel
once the first stage separates from the
top of the rocket it makes a controlled
fall back to earth fuel leftover from
the launch is used to reignite the
engines on the rocket in a series of
burns to help the vehicle re-enter the
Earth's atmosphere and then slow down
for landing grid fins attached to the
rocket help to steer it during the
descent a big benefit of this method is
that it can be scaled up if you want to
build a bigger rocket which SpaceX
definitely wants to do the future Falcon
Heavy is basically three Falcon 9 cores
strapped together and all three are
designed to come back to earth SpaceX
extreme landing 13 of its rockets and so
far eight of them have touchdown
successfully this one is the second one
they've ever landed it sent cargo and
supplies to the International Space
Station in April of last year and then
it returned and made the first-ever
drone ship landing and now they're going
to try and do that whole process again
this one is going to attempt a drone
ship landing for the second time this is
a pretty straightforward launch for
SpaceX it's sending up a satellite for
the company ses which is based out of
Luxembourg and SES has been very vocal
about wanting to be the first ones to
fly on a flown booster and they're
pretty confident that it's going to go
just fine let me tested this thing we've
run these engines up we've looked at the
airframe we've looked at all of the
various different components on this
thing and this thing is good to go this
we don't believe we're taking an
inordinate risk here a lot of people
compare it to flying a plane right you
wouldn't want to throw away your plane
after it flies from New York to Los
Angeles of course a plane doesn't have
to go to space and back it doesn't have
to deal with the same environmental
conditions as a rocket each one of these
stages the tanks the structure the
engines themselves they're going to have
to be inspected by the people by the
same people that built them in the first
place
re qualified for flight probably through
some ground-based testing before they go
again so we're not talking about
you know landing a first stage and then
within hours or minutes launching that
first stage again Plus these stages
won't last forever CEO Elon Musk has
said that parts of the Falcon 9 can be
used up to 100 times but he expects
between 10 to 20 relaunches for a single
stage however if refurbishment costs are
only about a few million dollars then
SpaceX could see some cost savings most
as a part of the whole foundation from a
more standpoint use of the boost age I
represent I counted up to the 77 cost of
the flight
SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell says
that she expects a 30% savings for
customers that launched on reused
Rockets though SpaceX is only offering
discounts on the order of 10% for the
time being we did receive this guy
obviously to fly this there was some
interesting there was some incentive to
do so
but it is not just the money in this
particular case it's really let's get
this proof-of-concept moving someone has
to go first here still when we're
talking about millions of dollars that's
not an insignificant price dip and any
way we can lower costs especially for an
industry as expensive as aerospace means
more companies can invest in space in
the long term it's long been believed in
the in this by the space community that
if we can make our Rockets reusable we
could greatly reduce the cost of access
to space we could open the space
frontier oh my goodness Vogel has
configured for flight minus 10
nine eight seven six five four three two
one
liftoff of Falcon 9 the world's first
free flight that mogul class rocket in
the tower
whoo
today so far is a successful launch of
Falcon 9 carrying SES 10 first agents
separated from second stage that's what
you see on the left-hand side of your
screen that's the first stage coming
back down one
it's been 15 years to get to this point
taking us a long time a lot of difficult
steps long way but I just incredibly
proud of space 16 or able to achieve
this incredible milestone in the history
of space we still don't really know that
economic implications of reusable
rockets yet but no matter what this is a
watershed moment for the aerospace
industry a vertical take-off rocket that
can achieve orbit has never really
launcher a second time before so no
matter what this is a really historic
moment for the space industry rocket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
