2014 Game Developers Conference and I'm
here with project Morpheus Sony's
experimental PlayStation 4 virtual
reality headset so the thing I'm trying
out right now is a game called or a demo
called the deep it's developed by the
London studio and first thing I'm
noticing is that the screen is actually
fantastic there's a sort of screen door
effect that I've tried with earlier like
oculus rift demos
there's also pretty fantastic positional
tracking I'm able to sort of lean over
and it feels as if I'm actually looking
over the side of this alright so I'm
playing a build of Eve Valkyrie which is
a CCP developed game that we've
previously seen on the oculus rift so
it's a space dogfighting game and one of
the things that's interesting about it
is that it uses the headset to lock-on
so if I spot an enemy I can use head
tracking and it'll find them and then I
can fire some missiles so actually the
thing that makes this so good for VR is
the fact that the gaze tracking is
actually totally vital so I'm playing a
castle sword and punching demo basically
and the thing that's unique about this
compared to the other demos I've played
is that it uses the Move controller the
end of this demo is that you get eaten
by the dragon and that's one of the
things that virtual reality does really
well is a sense of sort of imminence of
things coming up and getting right in
your face so when people talk about
immersion that's really one of the
things that immersion means right now I
think a better field of view is also one
of the things that's going to improve
immersion on this right now I mean it
definitely feels like you're there but
it is like you're there wearing a
spacesuit this was great so
unfortunately I did just accidentally
punch someone which may be one of the
hazards with multiplayer here one of the
things that's actually interesting is
that you can see what the person wearing
the headset is seeing obviously not in
virtual reality but this opens up a lot
of sort of interesting spectatorship
opportunities or just asymmetrical game
one person can be playing on the screen
and another on project Morpheus it's not
going to convey the whole experience but
you'll be able to look and say oh this
looks like a fun game this looks like
something I want to try out for myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
