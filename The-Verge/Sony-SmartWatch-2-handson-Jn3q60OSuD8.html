look at so many SmartWatch to smartphone
accessory this was first shown up in
June here in London but today we're
looking at the final retail units which
will be available in the stainless steel
bracelet here on the left and sitting
the silicone black one on the right the
colored silicone cases on the side that
you can see those be available with
separate attachments again end of
September for all of them so what's open
from Sony here she's going to give us a
quick walkthrough of the interface and
what this actually does for us so Sophie
can you tell us what we can do with a
SmartWatch you definitely see basically
SmartWatch 2 is like a second screen
feel smart phone to your Android device
so what you want is basically having on
your race notification like SMS email
know who is calling you were you able
actually to answer calls may cause
directly from the watch without having
to take your phone out of the pocket if
I take for example the co log you have
the possibility of your favorites the
whole call log phone book would also
insert phone number so that you're able
to call out from watch you would still
need to have a headset were you able to
initiate handle calls directly from the
watch without having to take your phone
out of the pockets ok and you pair these
via NFC if you be happy and if she on
the back of the device so if you have
the NFC enabled on droid devices you can
pair it very easily if you do not have
that you can just pay via bluetooth and
here you can see all the notification I
have we have more than 300 applications
into the place so it's up to you to
download the application you believe
makes sense for you lifestyle we're
working with fantastic for example for
more sports user case and we have of
course all type of mystification like
facebook emails SMS calendar calendar
reminder but we also have offline
functionality like
if you want to start your alarm on your
list this message to is water-resistant
so no problem to wear it at any
occasions it's ip57 okay what is the
price the price for the silicone strap
version is 179 you also recommended
retail price and for the metallic strap
stainless steel is 199 years hey phoE if
you want to get some of the colored
silicone strap wanna buy the sequence
track that available without the watch
separately it's called AC 20 with the
name of the product and it's about 1900
all right and these releasing by the
understated left September awesome so
there's a sony smartwatch 2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
