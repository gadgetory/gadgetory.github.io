and run Teton Gravity Research and we're
media company we do action sports
entertainment we had a fairly wild
upbringing you know with the three
brothers and it was always like just
adventure and trying to you know create
cool wild different stuff and always
stayed really close with my brothers and
you know fortunate enough to work with
them all today so this is a photo of my
younger brother Jeremy Jones and myself
in still Vermont in the early days
basically my dad had gotten us these
boards and we really liked it it would
ski all day and the mountain would close
and then we would put on the headlamps
and hike up behind our house you know
just any little hill we could find and
build kickers and stuff that's how in
1986 and 87 that's how they do it you
know we were fortunate our friend Doug
Coombs had opened the first like
commercial heli ski guiding and in
Alaska and we were fortunate for him to
take us under our under his wing and
give us jobs at the time we couldn't
really afford to pay for a bunch of
helicopter time we were just ski bums
and dishwashers and Jackson Hall and
we'd spend all of our money just doing
our own personal runs and exploring the
Chugach range and then we'd be out of
money and we've been we'd hitchhike to
the nearest fishing port and hop on a
boat and try to make some money and you
know keep keep the whole dream rolling
you know at that point we were kind of
low-level pro skiers ourselves and no
one was really capturing that Alaska
movement that was really a big part of
our whole DNA me and my brother and
another guy I'll pull the in commercial
fishing money about our first our flex
16 millimeter camera and said screw it
let's make
those early days of hanging out the side
of Hailey's I think really taught me a
lot in aerial cinematography for one you
have to see the vision of what you want
to do is just move in space and then you
have to communicate that to your pilot
the continuum is really cool because
it's our first film so it was like you
know super indicative of the time for us
it was 18 years ago and we didn't need a
ton and we had this vision to make
movies and make films and I was still
skiing from the camera and me and my
brother and our other partner were
trading the camera back and forth we
just had this idea and vision and really
wanted to set out and chase it down and
go after it it was a really special
special phone for us you know playing
with technology and and and watching the
world evolve and change and kind of you
know seeing what's relevant and how that
can help us do what we do is really cool
I would say 18 years ago when we started
TGR we started rolling the cameras and
really haven't put them down we you know
through this thing out there not really
knowing what it would do the last eight
years would be like the most dynamic
constantly changing evolving times ever
