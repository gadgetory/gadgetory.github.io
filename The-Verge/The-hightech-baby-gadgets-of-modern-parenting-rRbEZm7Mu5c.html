the verge which means he's pretty dialed
in to the cutting edge of tech but when
he gets home from work he's a dad and as
far as parenting goes he thinks of
himself as a Luddite
except when it comes to occupying his
kids with an iPad I feel embarrassed to
be a tech writer who has barely any baby
edges I mean I guess I think that for
the most part I assume technology can
add a lot of pleasure value to my life
but also a lot of work
my oldest is now almost 10 and so when
she was first born it was like whoa
video monitors so we've come a huge way
and I think absolutely it's making
parenting easier this is Liz gum burner
when it comes to combining technology
and parenting she's pretty much an
expert I'm the publisher of cool mom
pics Network which includes cool mom
tech which is a site that we design
specifically need to present tack tech
tips helpful resource for parents from a
parenting point of view cool mom tech
pegs itself is a site that gives parents
common-sense information about tech you
can go there for information about
educational toys calendar apps that keep
your family organized and private social
networks that let you share pictures of
your kids with family it's technology
applied to parenting in every way
imaginable
moms really want things and dads that
are practical that have a purpose in
their lives that will keep them
organized that will make their life
easier that will make them feel cooler
that will keep their kids entertained
they're very purposeful I think with
their technology choices are there like
certain tasks that you wish were just
easier changing diapers making bottles
giving baths I could I probably go on
for yeah last night I had to get up at
3:00 in the morning in the dark and try
to warm up a bottle without making any
noise and that was pretty tough if I had
a bottle that I could just like shake to
activate right a couple minutes later
would be warm that would be amazing so
Oliver is opening the yeah Mogo self
warming baby bottle the bottle uses pods
filled with a salt and water solution
that with a shake can warm up a bottle
in about four minutes my kids need milk
all the time when they wake up before
they go to bed sometimes in the middle
of the night I spend a lot of time
filling bottles cleaning bottles heating
up milk and doling it out this would be
great because I can just put the milk in
shake it up and there's a little
chemical reaction with salt and water a
couple minutes later the bottle is ready
to go I could also see it being really
great for road trip when I'm flying solo
without my wife and I don't have a stove
handy the only thing that really bothers
me is having to use these bulky plastic
pods and throwing them out after every
use that that feels pretty wasteful to
me we use a baby monitor but we're
definitely set apart from people who
have much more intense baby monitoring
setups the with a smart baby monitor
gives you a high-definition view of your
baby while she's sleeping the app can
send you automatic alerts when your kid
is crying and you even have the option
of talking to her a huge part of
parenting especially in the early days
is training yourself not to rush into
your kids room you know the second you
hear them cry so for me not having tons
and tons of data about them was actually
a good thing but I just used this
withing smart baby monitor and now that
I've tried one I could see how it would
sometimes save me like in the middle of
the night I hear him cry okay or it's
like stuck in the crib I need to go in
is he about to fall back asleep great
I'm not getting out of bed it feels like
the kind of thing you don't need but
once you have it you could never go back
to living without it we've always done
like baby lead feeding where whatever
we're eating they eat but I think there
are definitely lots of times when we're
eating something that isn't quite right
for them so if we had some that we're
eating and then you could just like
steam it or blend it up and it would be
a lot easier for them that would be that
would be great but Beata
baby cook pro is what happens when you
combine a steamer with a food processor
it's designed to help you make baby food
quickly all while minimizing mess I'm a
pretty terrible cook but to me this
seems like kind of an ideal way to go
about it a lot of the time I'm looking
through the fridge thinking okay what in
here can my baby eat with this you pour
in the water you do a little chopping
and voila you've got mush that baby
could ingest this is easy to clean it's
kind of like a one-pot meal honestly if
I was still a bachelor
I might use this
now when I first said Oliver and I would
take him out for a walk by myself like
in the carrier I would stop at the end
of every block and like check to make
sure he was breathing which is totally
crazy like there's no reason to do that
but you do do that like you feel you
know neurotic about all this stuff yeah
no that's true the MIMO smart onesie
sends information about your child's
breathing patterns body position and
body temperature right to your
smartphone to me it epitomizes the
conflict that I have around baby tech
would it be awesome to know when my son
is getting a fever in the middle of the
night absolutely but I've also gotten a
lot of alerts while I've been testing
this saying he's awake when he's
actually asleep that he has an
abnormally low temperature when he's
fine and then just the app disconnecting
at random and now he's stopped breathing
if I relied on it and took every warning
at face value I feel like it would end
up adding a lot of stress to my life the
hard thing is that there's more out
there to sort through you know there's
not like the one baby book from dr.
Spock or like the one highchair that
everyone gets there's so many options
that the hard part is wading through all
of it and that's what I found - I would
go on Amazon and there would be hundreds
of options it was overwhelming and I
wasn't sure which one to pick so a lot
of times I would just fall back on my
iPhone you know it could be a gaming
device if the kids are bored it's a
white noise machine if we need to sleep
at somebody else's house it's a baby
monitor and a pinch I mean there's just
an app for everything at this point I
feel like screens are just a part of
people's lives
Glenn Whitney is the president of the
National Museum of math in New York City
he spends a lot of time thinking about
what it takes to keep kids engaged when
broaching complicated concepts this
means that he knows a lot about how
children and parents interact with
technology there's a lot of different
ways that people learn people are visual
learners people are tactile learners
people are auditory learners so we try
to use touch and sound and sight you
know the more ways of experiencing
something the more engaging it is you
can create a similar environment on an
iPad and a good piece of software can
really get you engaged and and and get
you wanting to explore it's that it's
creating that drive and that curiosity
that I think is really at the key of
getting kids to to learn more I have an
iPad one we spent a lot of time
researching which apps to get him when
we spend a lot of money on some very
fancy apps in the end it's kind of like
a kid with a cardboard box he prefers
the free ones that we think are junk but
I do see him really learning about
letters and shapes and colors all kinds
of concepts while he's playing on there
you know the flip side of that is I go
into his room in the morning and before
he says daddy I love you it's want my
iPad want YouTube and you know then I'm
pretty sure I failed as a parent the
tablet can be a great parenting tool for
videos for the car you know it takes the
place of a lot of other devices but as
long as it's not be expensive your kid
also interacting in the real world you
have to look at it with a critical eye
and say you know what's what is my child
or what am i you know really doing or
giving it out of this particular program
if you're looking for that active
learning it's the question of how does
it get you involved I think sometimes
the technology can be the substitute for
parenting and iPods not a parent like
parents are parents so while technology
can do some things that make your life
easier I think it's a matter of finding
the balance between all these amazing
tools that can be educational and
support us as parents and support our
kids growth and then using the old
school stuff like kids still like to
play with the cardboard box more than
whatever can do that that will never
change</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
