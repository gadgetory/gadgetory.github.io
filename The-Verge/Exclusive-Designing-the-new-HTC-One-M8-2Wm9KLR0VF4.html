smartphone critically praised for its
design build quality and performance but
unfortunately for HTC it didn't turn
into a huge sales success the company
still has declining market share in
profits now the company is ready to
release another new smartphone also
called the one we're here in San
Francisco at the companies wanting Co
design studio to talk to the industrial
design team behind the new HTC One and
to find out what HTC is bringing to the
table in 2014 the new one is a
refinement of last year's successful
design it's softer and more coherent
looking with more metal and less plastic
it's a better looking phone than last
year's model and it's rounder edges make
it more comfortable to hold in your hand
HTC wasn't content to write out a
familiar design like Samsung did it
built upon last year's well-received
phone and made it better and really it
had two HTC doesn't have the same
luxuries as Samsung the screen has been
bumped up to five inches though it's
still 1080p resolution and the entire
phone is a little bit taller as a result
the display looks really great as wide
viewing angles great color reproduction
and no visible pixels the phone itself
is upgraded on the inside too with a
Snapdragon 801 processor bigger battery
two gigabytes of RAM and 16 or 32
gigabytes of storage both the new one
and the model before it were designed
right here in San Francisco by one and
company the firm the HTC purchased in
2008 and turned into its own internal
design studio before that one and Co was
involved in a variety of projects
everything from digital cameras and
smartphones to furniture and even
snowboard boots
I run the user experience and industrial
design teams at HTC which is basically
it's comprised of essentially three
locations there's the Taiwan team
obviously that's where our headquarters
is so we have a fairly substantial
and user experiencing there we have the
team here in San Francisco primarily
industrial design although there are a
few user experienced people and then my
head of user experience is based out of
Seattle so drew Bamford is vice
president of user experiences based out
of Seattle I think one thing you don't
realize as a consultant is how much
happens on the back end and how many
leaps and hurdles and travails you have
to kind of get through inside of
corporations so I think that's it's very
rewarding when something comes out if I
think about the HTC one last year having
that focus having moved inside of HTC
having that focus really let us deliver
and just a really remarkable phone last
year's model debuted HTC's ultra pixel
camera to varied successes and this year
the company is once again betting big on
the ones camera the new one has a
secondary sensor on the back that
accompanies the for megapixel camera it
acts a lot like a light row camera
providing depth information to do things
like refocus images after the fact or
give pictures of 3d like effect we
essentially use a stereoscopic optics
system that allows us to basically
define or assign range to every pixel
what that allows to do is then take that
information we can actually reinterpret
that for various applications when you
were developing this camera and coming
up with these concepts and the ideas did
you see a need in the marketplace that
you know people wanted to be able to
refocus their promote Oh after the shot
or was it just kind of like this can do
this and it's really cool and you know
what we're gonna throw it in there and
it's gonna be fun focusing your focus
actually is an issue extremely fast
autofocus you know that needs probably
been met one of the sort of big
shortcomings that we felt in the optics
in smartphone cameras is because the
extremely small TTL that the absolute
necessity having a thin optic stack is
that you can't get those sort of the
gorgeous shallow depth of field shots so
you can actually no use that information
it's like super compelling portraits or
actually replicate the sort of thing
you'd get from extremely essentially
unattainable glass you know a small
thing
HTC tells us ed it's also completely
revamped sense for the new one it runs
on top of Android 4.4.2 and features
various color coding for different types
of apps the entire OS feels cleaner and
flatter and things like the camera app
interface have been simplified and
cleaned up a lot blinkfeed has been
expanded with data from Foursquare and
the one now has built-in Fitbit
integration to track your steps and
movement throughout the day the one can
also be woken up with a double tap on
the screen and there's gestures right
from the lockscreen to launch apps or go
directly to your homescreen HTC is also
debuting a basic flip cover case for the
one called dot view it has a grid of
holes that see through to the ones
display letting you see time weather or
notifications with just a glance it's
whimsical and fun and injects a little
bit of personality into the device but
more importantly it also gives HTC yet
another marketing point like Zoe and
blinkfeed and boomsound and ultra pixel
the company wants people thinking about
and talking about its phones you
mentioned that you learned some things
from last year's model and applied it
into this year maybe could you get more
specific into that initially we had some
supply issues that's we've now the
supply chain is up and running and we've
solved a lot of those those issues and
so that's that's one of the big things
just operationally we're able to execute
on it number two is if you think about
just going from 70 and 90% there's
another antenna breakthrough that's
happened there where we can actually
have even more metal on the product we
don't have to have that plastic sidewall
anymore we can actually bring the metal
all the way up to the front surface of
the phone and it's actually I mean it's
quite challenging a lot of people don't
know this but there's more than 10 super
sensitive antennas inside these phones
so somehow you look at this phone you're
like where where are those antennas
actually broadcasting or are they
actually coming through as much as there
is to like with the new ones Hardware
design and really it is nice hardware
wasn't a problem for the company last
year HTC is far enough behind Samsung
and Apple at this point that shooting
for the stars probably is in its best
strategy the company could carve out a
comfortable third place position much
like how Microsoft is trying to do with
its Windows Phone platform the third
place is dangerous it frequently means
that customers aren't necessarily
thinking about your product when they
walk into a store HTC can't afford to
wait for customers to be pleasantly
surprised and they pick up the one
that strategy didn't work last year and
it likely won't work this year competing
with Samsung's marketing machine is by
no means easy but it's what HTC has to
do the road ahead is an uphill battle</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
