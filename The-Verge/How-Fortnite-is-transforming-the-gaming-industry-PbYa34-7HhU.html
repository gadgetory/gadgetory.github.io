planet right now even if you don't play
games that much you've probably seen a
fortnight clip or two on social media
and heard about the game's meteoric rise
but beyond being super popular the game
was also incredibly important to the
future of the industry for tonight is
impacting how modern video games are
developed and how they get popular stay
relevant and make money so what's the
secret to its success let's take a look
at the ingredients or for tonight that
have turned it into such a big hit and
how that formula is changing pretty much
everything about online games in 2018
well you might not know about for
tonight is that it's been cooking for a
while years in fact the game was
announced way back in 2011 and when it
finally launched last summer it didn't
even include the battle royale mode that
has made it so popular the developer
Epic Games saw a big opportunity to
capitalize on a trend set by the game
club G and so it iterated quickly in
released a version of four-night that
painted 100 people against one another
in a big sprawling environment the
result is that now for Knight is played
by tens of millions of people and it
makes a fortune for epic every month in
April the game made 300 million dollars
that's more than the New Avengers movie
made in its opening weekend this game
has gotten so big that some people in
the industry I think for Knight may
become a generation defining title think
something like Minecraft so what makes
fortnight's special why is it so
successful and popular and why are
people spending so much money on it the
answer there is a bit complex involving
into how video games typically get made
and how they make money also how that
process has been changing over the years
for fortnight it's important to
understand that it's not doing anything
super new it's not the first
free-to-play game certainly mobile games
predominantly from Asia figured out
years ago that if you gave away a game
for free you could charge players small
amounts of money to make their
characters like unique 4 egg is also not
the first game to be treated as an
evolving service instead of like a
one-off product names like destiny
overwatch World of Warcraft they've been
doing this for years but most
importantly for Knight isn't even the
first Battle Royale game they copied
most of the gameplay from pub G which
itself is based on earlier game mods
like dayz
before tonight is the first free-to-play
Battle Royale game
and is updated almost daily it's super
polished ones well basically every
platform including phones and it has a
very cartoony art style that appeals to
all ages which is great for parents who
are worried about video game violence
the ingredients were all there and epic
was just the first one to do it well
they didn't set out to make the biggest
game in the world but they did anyway
because they were willing to take risks
and evolve if you play a lot of games
like me you're probably hooked on
fortnight and like me maybe you've spent
a little bit of real money on the game
or maybe a lot of real money so here is
my whole vault of emotes that I bought
there's of course the disco dancing one
to go with my disco dancing character
it's those little floss dance you can
even do the Snoop Dogg drop it like it's
hot dance so why are we you and me
spending so much money on a free video
game well in fortnight most of the money
that you spend is spent on accessories
like costumes and hang gliders and
pickaxes that don't help you do any
better at the game but they do help you
stand out on the battlefield you can
make yourself look like a swamp monster
or a disco dancer or even Keanu Reeves
from John wick you can also spend money
on water called emotes which is just
industry speak for really silly dance
moves I think is particularly good at
designing new emotes they're always
pulling from popular memes and
encouraging the community to even submit
their own but where epic was really
smart was in creating a system for
players to unlock some of these items
without spending any real money they do
this by borrowing a lot from
role-playing games where you use XP to
level up and you complete challenges to
progress essentially a system that
rewards players for investing more time
for instance epic sells a three-month
subscription service for $10 called the
battle pass with its own set of unique
rewards and only by playing the game
pretty much every single day can you
unlock every costume and dance I
subscribed to the battle paths for three
seasons in a row now because I play at
least a little bit every day and it made
sense also I needed the John wick skin
because reasons I think it's always
adding new and wild stuff to the game
for free like jet packs and shopping
carts and new experimental game modes
that keep it fresh every week lately
they've been going even further by
crafting elaborate storylines for fort
like the meteor crash that happened last
month they give players lots of
narratives to invest in and talk about
online so sure the game is done really
well people love it but does that mean
that every game in the future is just
gonna be a reskin a fortnight no there
will always be a place for those big
franchise games they come out once every
few years and really make waves like
Grand Theft Auto or Zelda or the new God
of War but because for tonight is so
popular it's hard to imagine the best
bits that it won't be copied like
gaming's biggest players this is
something totally new this is doing
battle royale the blackops way I'm in
this day and age the most popular games
the ones that people talk about and play
every single day you absolutely need to
be fun to watch and for tonight is an
amazing spectator sport it's everywhere
on social media with clips flooding
Reddit and Instagram and Twitter for
night viral moments they're legendary in
the community and it's really really
huge on YouTube and twitch take Tyler
ninja Blevins
the most popular twitch streamer in the
world ninja who's a former Halo Pro
ditched his eSports career just when
fournaye was getting big and by the
spring he was making hundreds of
thousands of dollars a month
playing for night for upwards of 12
hours a day on Twitch then in March
ninja played with Drake yes that Drake
it was a huge milestone for fortnight
and gaming culture and it happened in
the middle of the night with no
promotion nobody really saw it coming
and yet more than 500,000 people tuned
in to watch it live it really marked the
moment for a night felt like it was
going mainstream with so many people
playing this game these streams have
gigantic built-in audiences before and
is creating a whole new class of
internet celebrity on YouTube and twitch
that's because for the really good
players porn and is a great tool for
creating viral clips of high school
plays and other really shareable moments
for you or me watching somebody else
play for a night is just as entertaining
as watching a TV show or sport and if
you watch you might just learn a few
things too so the game industry is
watched all of these shifts happen over
the years the push to make games more
streamable to turn them into
free-to-play platforms and everything
else that fortnight has really
now all these companies are trying to
make sense of it and adapt but just as
for tonight came out of nowhere last
fall and surprised everybody some new
game or concept might do the same to
fortnight the better yl John R won't be
the hot new thing forever and game
design nowadays it's all about copying
iterating and finding a new way to do
something better for epic if it wants to
continue making the most popular game in
the world
it cannot get complacent they have to
remember that taking risks experimenting
and listening to players is why foreign
aid got so big in the first place for
the rest of the industry it would be
smart actually just copy for tonight but
to really learn from epics willingness
to adapt that might be the most
important lesson to learn from for
tonight's success for more gaming news
and stuff about fortnight and better
flossing check out polygon comm where
they're better at dancing alright good
I'm really hot in this jacket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
