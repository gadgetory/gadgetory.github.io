and you're taking a look at the first
moments of infinity blade to a game due
on iOS on December first it's a hack and
slash adventure the sequel to the
original infinity blade and picks up
right where it left off it's developed
by chair entertainment published by epic
games and is built on Unreal Engine 3
and as you can take a look right here
we're in a Japanese garden with cherry
blossom is falling from tree using
beautiful light streaming through
running it on an iPad 2 and an iphone 4s
simultaneously two different copies of
the game a chair entertainment says both
will run at a locked 30 frames per
second frame rate as far as gameplay is
concerned Infinity Blade 2 is a lot like
its predecessor you're armed with
variety of malaya weapons typical swords
you attack block ferry and use magic and
special attacks the objective generally
been to break the guard of your opponent
and while they're stunned defeat them in
a variety of nasty melee waves the
difference is here or that the enemies
have a lot more moves at their disposal
typically and it's a little bit harder
to tell what kind of attacks they'll
throw out and you to have a few new
moves and a couple of new weapon types
of your disposal instead of your
standard sword or shield you can
dual-wield a pair of blaze what they
have a large axe or club for a heavy
meal I weapon infinity blade tues worlds
is beautiful even if your job is to slay
it's more dastardly denizens we
particularly enjoyed the level of detail
here with particle effects like
individual cherry blossoms falling from
trees or you take a look below this
bridge the koi swimming around at the
pond it's a bit of a toss-up between the
ipad 2 and iPhone 4s
an iPad it's easier to make up a little
details but on iphone there are fewer
visible jagged edges we're not going to
spoil any of the plot of infinity blade
yes there is some story this time around
but we do think to be valuable to show
you the game's first boss minute because
this is where gameplay and graphics
really come together have a look
this is what I will leave you to it
thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
