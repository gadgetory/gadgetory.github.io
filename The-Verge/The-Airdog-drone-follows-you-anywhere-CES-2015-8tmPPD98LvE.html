hanging out at CES 2015 we're checking
out the air dog drone so tell me who you
are and what we're doing here today hi
my name is Edgars I'm CEO of the helical
aerospace industries the company behind
the air dog and what is air dog area is
where unique drone it's a drone that can
fly up to 45 miles and follow an athlete
in action sports and shoot down a video
so we developed our own dedicated
tracking device we call ollege and thats
that makes huge difference than only
with this dedicated device we could
achieve the precision agility and speed
needed to follow really in action sport
and so is the drone moving value and
also the camera are they moving
separately independently or together
they are moving up barclay physics
together the drone is doing the yaw
moment and but the camera kimball is
pitching the camera and so it can follow
you if you're out I know you're doing
motocross yesterday when you're
skateboarding here but what if you're
doing motocross when it runs into a tree
I mean how does it know how to get out
of the way of that stuff what we have
developed is a software-based obstacle
avoidance solution so if you know that
then you're a mother Kris track for
example you have some buildings and
trees we simply use your smartphone and
draw in a map those areas you mark them
as no-fly zones and the drone will know
that it should not fly into these zones
do you think this is where the drones
are headed like the next big sort of
development for consumer drones is going
to be the follow me feature not
necessarily only the following features
we call airdog a personal drone and with
personal drone we mean that it's a drone
that that's something you
you just are not amazed by its
capability to fly and you don't fly it
manually but it does something useful
for you so it's your personal drunk okay
great thanks that was air dog here at
