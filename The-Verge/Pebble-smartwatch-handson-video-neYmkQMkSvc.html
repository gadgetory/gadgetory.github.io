and you are looking at the Pebble watch
a really big success story from
Kickstarter
we'll find out that it is ready to ship
it's going to begin shipping to the
people who backed the project all 85,000
of them on January 23rd although it's
going to go through batches and take
some while to get through mass
production they do about 15,000 a week
and if you're not familiar with it it's
actually pretty cool it is an e-ink
watch and it's a smart watch that hooks
up to your iPhone or your Android phone
and as you can see it's actually
relatively small it just has a few
buttons you've got an up/down and a
select button and then over on the side
you have a back button and a little
charger port there and that's actually a
magnetic charger kind of like a palm
beer if you remember that it just clicks
on there and begins charging it and it's
an e-ink screen so it's reflective but
it does also have a back light so you
can light it up so you can make sure
that you see it and the interface is
actually really really simple you just
go back and then you can go up and down
to select your apps and amongst those
apps are just a bunch of different watch
face options so there's a text watch
face option or fuzzy time bunch of
different watch faces and they've got an
SDK out for developers that they're
working on so developers can create
their own watch faces so for example
here's a binary clock if you're into
binary clocks I can't read this and it
has a few other features in terms of
being a SmartWatch the first of which is
you can directly control your music it
just does this right over Bluetooth and
you can just hit that and it'll start
playing your music and you can maybe
hear that the background you can go to
the next song just like any standard a
Bluetooth headset that's how that works
and you can also set alarm directly on
the watch if if you'd like to do that or
you can also just jump into settings
here look up your Bluetooth and a couple
of those settings change the size of the
fonts and whatnot but the real action is
with notifications so the whole point of
a SmartWatch is that it's connected to
your smart phone and when you get
notifications or text message alerts it
shows up on your watch you can read them
quickly and more to the point you can
feel them so this watch vibrates and
when something comes in you
more likely to gonna feed on your wrist
than you would in your pocket so text
message comes in you can look at it
really quick
it'll dismiss on its own automatically
or you can back out of it and then the
next one will come in and you know same
deal and it has buttons over here and
you can actually scroll through to read
the whole iam home or at least some of
the text to see what you've got here and
then you can scroll back and actually
speaking of that the interface is
actually pretty neat pebble tells us
that it's kind of inspired by the
original Mac that had a black and white
screen and you can see the way that
they've got sort of little dot matrix
gradient here and just you know some
pretty good-looking icons so in terms of
basic specs it has a 144 by 168 screen
and it has a battery that should be good
for around seven days of battery life
and then you can attach a little
magnetic charger and it should charge
itself back up in a you know one or two
hours or so of course it uses bluetooth
4 to connect with your iPhone or your
Android phone and it also can do over
the year ROM updates over Bluetooth and
so Ron update gets pushed to the app on
your phone and then that can get pushed
over to the watch and pebble is actually
promising to release updates as often as
two or three weeks which is a pretty
cool so we should see some more features
coming relatively soon we know that they
had a partnership with RunKeeper so we
would expect that there'll be some
fitness apps here that'll be integrated
in and presumably an expanding ecosystem
as they go along
actually one feature that they just
added to it which is pretty neat is a
feature where you can just tap it to
turn on the back later even shake your
wrist so you can flick your wrist for
just tap the bottom of the watch and
it'll turn on the backlight which is a
little bit difficult to see on that dark
watch but if we go to something a little
bit brighter like that and then we let
it timeout flick my wrist turned on the
backlight so there you go that is a
Pebble watch a huge Kickstarter success
story and it is shipping to the backers
on January 23rd it's going through that
batch and then presumably it'll be in
wider retail not too long after that
