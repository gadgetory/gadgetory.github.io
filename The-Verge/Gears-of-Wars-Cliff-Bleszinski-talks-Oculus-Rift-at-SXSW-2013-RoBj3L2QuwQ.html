hanging out with Cliff Bleszinski at
South by Southwest he just got off the
oculus rift panel so actually want to
ask you is what was your first
experience oculus how do you get
introduced to the head side okay so I
know Brendan rebe who's the big guy over
there because he worked at guy kinda
course he worked the Scaleform which is
the UI system that epic and everybody in
the industry used he's a very smart
businessman he has a tendency to find
something good latch on to it and ride
it up and just make it a big thing which
is what he did with those previous
businesses so he came to epic and he
actually brought what was their first
piece male version of it which was so
just like trashy rig it was so sad hey
I'm walk into the room with mark rain
and I'm like what is this thing it's
like literally like you know those old
school theater glasses the little old
ladies would have right oh this is a
wonderful production of Phantom of the
Opera right that's what it looked like
but you put it on and immediately you're
like oh okay I could see you know you
ignore the fact that it's not attached
to your head the fact that the tracking
stuff i could i'm like i felt like i was
just gazing into a different world right
there and i felt like i was there like
teleported and immediately right and
that was when i was like okay this might
have a lot of potential and then when I
saw the later versions of it is when I
really started to click from you and I
was incredibly impressed the set up what
was your first reaction like to meeting
palmer luckey ah he reminded me he was
kind of a half way between myself and
tim sweeney a little bit you know and I
saw have this like young budding
designer who's doing it because he loves
it and I was like wow okay we're gonna
be seeing some great things from this
kid in the next 20 years and starting
with this and you know it's the classic
American Dream everybody talks about oh
the economy is not doing that well you
know you can't really get a job and
here's the kid out of his own garage you
put this thing together himself and he
should be an example for the youth of
America yeah I don't know where that way
anything so you were just on the panel
talked about like different genres that
would work well obviously simulation you
actually mentioned stimulation and some
kind of word fashionable way what
Turner's do you think specifically word
would work the best here we're actually
be better than ever before I think
exploration genre right and i deluded to
like the Miss type game and I believe
Paul was mentioning that that actually
be kind of a lonely experience which is
a very good point I think horror could
be good but i think the horror could
actually be too intense for most people
like i was saying slender man is already
scary on a monitor imagine if you turn
around slenderman's right in your face
like people would like throw the headset
off and stomp on in the ground I think
those are kind of games have to be
patient with
wonder if maybe some sort of fighting
game experience could be very
interesting you know it's got a
first-person yeah and you know movement
would be an issue but in fighting games
are basically just going like that right
so if you depend on how close you are in
bobbing but again you'd have to be
careful with physical fatigue and so I
think when it comes down to flow games
games such as a flying games driving
games or scuba diving ish games I think
those could be very very compelling and
I think those are the genres I think had
the most potential right obviously put a
lot of life changes is here your huge
investment oculus are you gonna be
developing for it and what can we see
from that right now my plans of what I'm
working on are still way up in the air I
mean my agents talking to different
people and there's certainly parties
that are interested but right now I'm
enjoying just getting up and pissing off
the entire internet every day by
blogging so we'll see all right cliff
thank you so much good seeing</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
