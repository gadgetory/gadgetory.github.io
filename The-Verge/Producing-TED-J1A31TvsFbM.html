world around seven years ago it seemed
like the stupidest idea that anyone had
ever had essentially that I was putting
on tape lectures why they would sort of
look at me with this sort of pity we
felt that the ideas deserved a wider
audience than they were getting and so
when we launched TED Talks our true
mission was to figure out how how to
better spread ideas through the world
what is Ted Ted is a conference sure
it's more than that it's an idea
actually a collection of ideas and
people people and ideas people with
ideas people who are here for a number
of days to talk to other people about
ideas those people also have ideas and
there's people here who help the people
with ideas tell their ideas to other
people and we're going to find out what
happens when all of those people and all
of those ideas get together in one place
and start doing things with one another
one of the things we really pride
ourselves on is how much effort we put
into preparing speakers so we don't just
choose to speak and put them on stage we
have a very deep editorial process very
similar to the way an editor and a
writer would work together when you give
a talk at Ted there's a very specific
format they want you to tell a story
they want you to engage the audience
which in science is something we don't
normally have to do and so they help us
to realize the story and to come up with
new imaginative ways that we can tell it
as an engineer and a computer scientist
we don't typically get a lot of training
in how do you present yourself and
present your work and tell a compelling
story and that's one of the most awesome
things that I've been able to take away
from this experience it's actually
extremely difficult to try and condense
a decade's worth of work is actually
extremely hard so we were really trying
to make the speaker's rockstars to shoot
them with tight shots with moving
cameras multiple camera so that we could
get you know a great edit that's the
kind of thing any filmmaker
would do but at the same time we didn't
want it to feel very false we wanted to
feel authentic and real and intimate and
so there's a balance we're always
striking in the in the filming process
we don't cut out a lot because they sort
of bring their own genius but we do sort
of try to make them who they wanted to
be when I stepped on stage you know so
we don't really change them we try to
make them the best them things need to
have a filmic layer but less sweeping to
me it's more personal a little more
rough around the edges it's okay if you
get a close-up of someone who's not
beautiful because keeping it sort of as
real intimate is great because you just
want to get out of the way the idea and
let people access that idea with this
little barrier a little film between
them and the idea is possible so what's
the biggest challenge it's at a you know
at a conference of this size a lot of it
is like the numbers game you know we
have so many machines down there so many
moving parts that it's kind of a
mathematical probability that
something's going to fail and so a lot
of it is just making sure that we have
backup machines we have backups of
backups of backups because this time at
the ted conference is so crucial for us
it's when we're getting all of our
material that we're going to use to put
ted talks out you know I'm an Internet
the rest of the year see you guys are
running windows that X pisses all of
that XP shop okay the media cave is the
official name for this them it is called
the media caves there any thought to
actually doing a cave like structure at
any point or we thought about it but we
found that it was probably gonna be too
expensive too time-consuming yes so okay
so how many people do you have down here
how many workstations how many people
you can give me rough ass I mean we'd
see we have I think somewhere between 16
to 20 people after each speaker gives a
talk we actually try to turn around
their talk by putting them on a thumb
drive so that they can actually
copy of it to review and to make sure
they like what they're saying okay so if
I'm a speaker and I and I saw completely
I can be like don't put that on line
because i hate though in the history of
Ted I don't think we've ever had a
speaker say like please don't go I
didn't know I didn't know that they
actually got an option big production a
lot of pieces a lot of moving pieces
it's a bit like a puzzle a puzzle you've
got to put together very carefully
active with a puzzle could explode and
get glass in your eye because their
puzzles made a blast did I mention that
the fact that there are limitations here
in terms of Uranus space you know it's
an auditorium you've only you've got
nine cameras but is it are you battling
the limitations or is it you know do you
like working within them I think the
limitations are exactly where the
creativity starts happening a lot of the
speakers talk about what constrained
then actually liberated them I'm more
excited about the said than I've been in
a while and I think it has to do with
the worldwide Talent Search that we did
in 14 cities around the world a kind of
open call for speakers which was very
risky so we have 33 speakers here who
were chosen from those auditions and
they're bringing they're just people we
wouldn't have found any other way at the
heart of every TED talk is a really
passionate speaker and I think what the
great TED Talks tap into is this very
primal way of connecting a single person
standing on stage locking eyes with you
telling you what they believe in can
impact you in a way that almost nothing
else can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
