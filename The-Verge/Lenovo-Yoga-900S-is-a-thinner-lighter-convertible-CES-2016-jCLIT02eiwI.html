at sea yesterday and the Nova is
introducing its new yoga 900s you might
have heard of the 900 from before so it
came out in September this is a smaller
version slimmer lighter and they've
actually Lenovo switched out the Intel
Core I for a core M this time so you can
get up the core m7 the big difference is
twelve and a half inch display q HD
resolution
obviously the chips chipset but the main
thing is literally that it's a lot
lighter and a lot smaller and thinner
frame and you can all see it so yoga so
you can obviously flip it over and lay
it flat just like you do any any yoga
and you can also go into tent mode all
that sort of stuff
it's got like a sort of kind of fake
leather palm rest here it feels quite
nice and the keyboard spacing is pretty
good it's an unusual sort of keyboard
that you'd expect on a yoga really so
they're gonna release it in this gold
car and there's also a silver variant as
well so they're the gold a wrap all the
way around and actually on to the key
borders around the other thing that
really complements this particular model
and just any sort of yoga or any PC in
general which is new yoga Mouse this is
it mouse mode you get standard sort of
start button and right and left click
and then you just twist and then you've
got a remote and you can turn up the
volume
pulls media fast forward or that sort
stuff so it's kind of different and this
will work on any PC is bluetooth or
you've got the dongle as well okay so
that was a quick look at Lenovo yoga 900
