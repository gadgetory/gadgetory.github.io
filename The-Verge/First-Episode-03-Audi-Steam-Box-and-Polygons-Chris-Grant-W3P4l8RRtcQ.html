body and he's making a steam box this is
first
I'm Josh Topolsky I'm Ross Miller and
this is day two of the show floor day
day three three ZS up first no okay two
of CES yes day three of first and the
six or seven of us I've lost count of
how long I've been in Las Vegas but I
but what I do know is I'm now an escort
so you know it's all really working out
pretty well you must've had a late night
then I had a number of late nights due
to my new job as a as a female escort
that Bechet it was also a female female
escort I mean female you know let's not
get bogged down in the details so
basically you're a female pretend to be
a male pretend to be a female escort
that's something like that okay I mean I
don't know everybody seems to enjoy it
that's the important thing
we're exhausted sigh we're very tired we
are this is day two of the show floor
being open we have been here for quite a
while covering the show yesterday was a
massive day for us our our biggest day I
think yet with a ton of stuff funny
stuff
weird stuff it's been very surprised fun
I've been having a season yeah I have to
say I mean you know I am NOT I really I
try not to sound like I'm cheerleading
see yes because I think normally we come
here and we're you know we see this as a
mission we got to get through we have a
really good time with our team this year
everybody was saying oh it's gonna be a
bad show and things gonna be terrible
and it's you know hardware is dead and I
actually think it's been it's just a
really fun amazing I think we're looking
like this show different than from years
past yeah it's just we're looking for
the weird more than we are like they say
we're not looking for a door were years
past that I just think that I think you
get that you know I think just in
general the public gets Sony's gonna
talk about 4k TV or whatever and there's
gonna be you're gonna get the press
stuff the regular press stuff and then
you've got to find the other stories
that are interesting here and I think I
think we've been doing that and that
that's really interesting to me but and
we'll get to that and we'll get to value
and we will sorry yeah we're gonna talk
about valve in just a little bit but
we've got some headlines you've got
headlines up the first thing yesterday
t-mobile made a huge push first carriage
really wanted to get past number four it
made a bunch of big announcements first
and foremost LTE and it'll be its first
market is here next week
a hundred million people by middle of
this year yeah you know that is that
that that that LT is going to be
interoperable with AT&amp;amp;T
I don't think what's do we know I don't
think we know but why are they doing
this they're just making a new variety I
mean you know it's just I know why
they're doing it
I think it's the worst I can't we
intervene here it's all the same LTE can
we make the right it won't feel correct
are all the same 4G
well no but you know Verizon has their
CDMA and there's GSM right right but now
we don't have that problem LT is like
different bands different spectrums it's
it's all over the place okay fine
point is no you can't have this
beautiful hippie dream world of HD Voice
HD Voice yeah it's now HD Voice
compatible if you have a galaxy s3 or
the 1s you can start using it yeah I
still never use HD Voice Chris Chris
Ziggler says that it is an incredible
innovation that we just can't appreciate
you how much I just don't make phone
calls III do everything I can to avoid
threat calls I mean I don't like talking
if there's any way I can get out of
talking on the phone I will use that
technique I'm faking my own death
holding someone hostage saying you know
I can't come to the phone because I'm in
a hostage situation why would you take
why would you hold somebody hostage if
you just wanted to avoid a phone call I
mean like there are easier ways again
it's like look I want to I want to talk
to you about your hostage situation but
you need to join this group mates right
and the last new day was unlimited data
completely unlimited data without
contracts starting at $70 a month yeah
the big thing of course is you don't get
a subsidized phone but t-mobile has been
doing a great job not doing like half
the new customers or contract free from
the some of the newer plans they've been
doing I mean t-mobile's really pushing I
was like were the new unique carrier you
don't want to contract you want limited
data these are the buzzwords we always
talk about one in yeah I actually find
these announcements
totally boring can I be honest this
based on what we've been seeing here
this to me is one of the least
interesting I mean this I just kind of
does nothing for me okay it's the in
fact I feel dead it's wow that was that
that booze didn't want to go away right
well that either you're bad at throwing
those or you really gotta check them a
little bit of both no all right this is
going to bore you just as much we're
gonna get through it all right it's the
Wall Street Journal digit times in
Bloomberg trifecta of rumors cheap
iPhone okay so here's what I think it's
interesting okay first off they say they
could be a cheaper iPhone with a
polycarbonate body it might be you know
some new material that's easier to
pretty cheaper and easier don't call it
something new but it look awesome and
new but it'll be an iPhone 4s
oh boy carpet yeah they'll call it you
know apple apple carbonate bicarbonate
yeah but so what I think is interesting
about this is that historically for us
Apple has disrupted CES with with news
and no you know it's just they do this
they love to do this they they have
there something that happened somehow
you know this somehow this got leaked to
The Wall Street Journal you know we
don't know how they have very reliable
sources they've they're pretty much they
don't publish an Apple rumor unless it
turns and it turns out to be true but
you know they always disrupt this show
with news what I thought was interesting
is that yesterday on our site this news
hit and I looked at our traffic and it
was the seventh most traffic post at
prime time during the news which i think
is kind of incredible when you think
about Apple's presence in the industry
and that everybody said this show was
going to be dead and when I looked at
our front page what was rude trending
was actual newsroom from this show I
agree but let me play a little bit
devil's advocate he's doing hat to bad
had Apple done a special event
announcement like we do every year it's
totally different
that totally different I mean and they
said we're doing it we're all in the
event please join us
tune in if it had been like tune in this
show would have been over in one second
because everybody would have started
working on their editorials about
Apple's TV initiative what I also
thought was interesting is at the phone
itself is whatever
Apple's gonna make a cheaper iPhone I
think they're great I think no one I
think here's more of the horse or we can
get great smartphones into the hands of
the people better off we'll all be
but what I thought was really
interesting was this rumor happened and
then 15 minutes later
Facebook issued an invite to an event
right and I have I wrongly feel that
they must have been waiting to see if
Apple was going to do an event and they
were like well they're not doing it
let's let's do it it's a CES tradition
that Apple will screw it up somehow with
an announcement this time baby this was
this was a spike right a little
disruptive disruptive spike but it
wasn't a it didn't obliterate the show
right but Facebook is building something
new
it's bigger than Facebook we'll find out
later they've managed to like everything
I don't know what that means that's not
even funny
all right never happened last story
before we can get to the bigger things
it's actually I think this kind of fell
under the radar
wall we can't believe we're talking
about what we are talking about what
because they wanted a talk about Huawei
yesterday we talked about the device we
have a we had actually have Sam back for
doc here he spoke oh that's right what
the head of consumer electronics richer
you had quite a few interesting things
to say yeah let's let's talk to Sam Sam
are you with us hey yeah I'm him hey Sam
hey Sam Sam you uh you met with the he's
the CEO of Huawei he is the head of
consumer like cata consumer electronics
at Huawei because they also do heavy
industry I would assume yes their
Chinese company can you tell me a little
bit about about what you guys talked
about yeah we're chatting so I mean the
news here is if I want to hold that mic
a little bit closer to your mouth so
how's this a lot better it's a lot
better so the thing here is he he was
very bullish and confident he was trying
to convince me that Huawei makes the
best phones in the world
he called out Samsung he called out
Apple and he was telling me that
basically the new phones that they
announced yesterday the ascend mate and
the d2 they are the best phones in the
world and what's interesting there is
that until now the company has been very
much it sells a lot of phones but not in
the high-end at all I mean I don't know
about you guys the only guy I know at
the Hawaii way phone is Paul Miller and
that's because he doesn't use the
Internet
so I mean that's that what you just said
is 100% accurate
but medically accurate but hi I'm just
wondering what do you get I mean you
used the phones right you saw them do
you feel that he has the stuff to back
up his his talk does he do they make the
best phone so they better than Samsung
phone I mean so the ascend mate has a
6.1 inch screen right it's not going to
be the it's certainly not going to be
the best phone for everyone in the world
anyone with pockets for example but I
mean it's the quality I would say is
from what I from what I used it seems
like comparable to a Samsung phone or
something it's their plasticky they're
not they're not like super super
high-end but they feel pretty good the
build they don't flex or anything and I
mean the real issue is they're not going
to be sold in the US and that's because
the the u.s. perceives Huawei as a
potential spy well right this is the
thing he says that I'm making that up
I'm not just being racist or something
that's that's the the there's some
concern that they are going to
infiltrate the United States yeah he
absolutely said that and he said he said
the US carriers he's spoken with him
they're trying to build a relationship
and carriers actually like how his
product but he says that there is
influence from the US government and
that there are trust issues and they
need to work they really need to sort of
work hard to get away as an accepted
brand as a trusted company in the US do
you um what do you make of his Steve
Jobs comment I mean the Steve Jobs
comment heat so the actual comment he
said Steve Jobs is gone now there is a
lack of innovation and I mean basically
he's trying to put the phones in the
same conversation as Apple I mean right
i I mean is he trying to dry he said no
and thank God we're Huawei is here to
deliver the kind of innovation that that
Steve Jobs would have delivered well
like a 6.1 inch exactly Tim Cook is
clearly incapable lives what is there
six momen what is their skin called what
is the name of their skin emotion UI
emotion UI did you feel moved by it I
was not used it I was not moved I would
say one one thing that I thought was a
great
you have the 6.1 inch phone but there's
like a one handed mode so they shrink
the keyboard down and they shrink the
the keypad down to sort of go into the
bottom left of the bottom right corner
so you can actually use this gigantic
phone in one hand fairly comfortably I
mean it's it's still you could certainly
can't cover the whole screen with your
thumb like you can with an iPhone for
example but it's a pretty thoughtful
innovation they've clearly thought it's
not like Samsung for example who just
like they've released the car accident
they they blow up the Android UI to a
huge screen well it has actually thought
about how people might use this device
and I was quite impressed with that so
it sounds like we've got at least one
new Huawei fan in the world Sam
yes well I'm gonna come that yeah all
right well we gotta move on but Sam
thanks thanks for joining us did you was
there anything that no Sam thanks for
joining us and we'll see you later in
the trailer for our cocktails
thanks a lot uh what I find interesting
this is what the historical thing I'd
like while what could be the point where
agency was years and years ago I was
just about to push I agree with you a
hundred percent I just think that what
I've seen of their products there's
nothing notable about their products and
they feel completely anonymous HTC
actually had started pushing a really
interesting and aggressive and and
different industrial design they started
doing something that made you go wait a
second well these guys are making really
nice phones they started doing sense
when before there was really an idea of
I mean they'd been doing since it was
originally called what was it called I
don't remember it had a different name
anyhow the point is maybe was just
called sense but they were doing
skinning me on Windows Mobile and they
brought that to Android that was really
the start of this whole skinny fat
skinny trend Tom you know so I think
they had some real stuff to bring to the
table Huawei is just a me-too they're
like oh you did a big phone we did a big
phone you guys have a have a you know
it's got pen input we have a pen input
you did you win this phone we got a
Windows Phone
it's just wondering when these kind of
like their their big companies and make
a lot of money he steals and I was like
they were doing phones for other people
really kind of count on where their
carriers wanted to get their branding
but now while Huawei wants to be its own
company once I have its brand in front
right no matter how big they are that's
a huge struggle right and it's funny
like baking
I gotta tell you I gotta tell you really
do that I mean huawei's got an uphill
battle with that name in America I mean
if we still are unsure if we still are
messing it up average Americans are not
going to that's just a nightmare they
just need to change the name to like a W
or something all right well we should
move on yeah I'm gonna try this card one
more to get here we go that was not that
was a strange I gotta say that was trait
toward that was change that right it
almost took off my goes to face almost
his eyes buddy got any more of these
yeah just watch it all right what else
all right anyway let me get that uh we
had this is a cool report from yesterday
Chris niggler risked life and limb oh
yeah to let a car park itself yeah well
he said in the pasture see this is
awesome Isis uh this to me is really
future is the future yeah check check
out this video Chris Engler and Audi and
when we come back
Chris rad nice yes this is Chris Sigler
with the verge and I am in the passenger
seat of this car I'm not driving why not
because it's Saudis self-driving car
you'll notice that there's nobody in the
driver's seat about to go on a wild ride
through the parking garage of the
Mandarin Oriental got some sensors set
up around here these are laser scanners
that help the car figure out where to go
and then it goes on a short path maybe a
100 150 feet out to the front we get out
then the car turns around that part has
to be done by hand with a real driver
and then we drive back in and the car
backs into the spot it's a little scary
this is our robot overlord future in
action it's happening right here in Las
Vegas little terrified let's see how
this goes
so it's slow this is not like a Google
car this is not like the car that Lexus
introduced yesterday this is going five
miles an hour through preset course
howdy plans on getting there they want
to get to a full like highway experience
in fact they're only the second
automaker to have permission in the
state of Nevada to drive on highways
with self-driving cars but this is not
that this is just to help you park the
car without having to be in it
imagine you're at a mall you're at a
some sort of shopping center bought your
smartphone hit a button the car comes
and picks you up that's what this is so
it's pretty awesome not gonna lie for
the time being I'm okay driving the car
myself parking really isn't that big of
a deal
but you know if I have to pay another
100 200 bucks to get this feature on my
next car I might do it out he's thinking
10 years out for this so we'll see how
that goes all right Audi let's go back
to the Convention Center and we're back
with Chris grant editor-in-chief of
polygon calm and world-renowned hip hop
dancer look it up
that's crazy before we get into into
talking about valve and theme and
statement valve
I can't they come up with some other
less mechanical it's fine if it's their
thing that that what were you just
saying about the the auto parking the
auto auto parking all this effort you
see a long time these cars that can auto
park or parallel parking it's like just
just learn to parallel park yes so much
engineers can come so I Drive up to you
right that's the other thing you can
leave a space you can leave the space
and come to you that's some Batmobile
stuff right cool right exactly so what
you would say just learn to walk yeah
also get a pair of shoes look if you
know we still be in the caves Chris I
feel like we talked about this last
night but um anyhow we have you here
because we're going to talk about well
before I talk about you want to talk
about oculus at all any good I mean
we've yeah all you talked about last
night so you guys so maybe you didn't
you see last night or hear about it I
tweeted about it
and and we we had a magical experience
here we had a chance to play with the
oculus rift which is a virtual reality
headset that was a Kickstarter project
which is now there it is right there as
soon as you say that it's like don't go
no really yeah and we've been talking
about it it was like non-stop 24 hours
straight now because we actually got to
try this in the trailer and it is an
incredible totally futuristic
cutting-edge breathtaking exhilarating
experience and Chris and I both had our
first trough eyes on if you will with
with the oculus really yeah and it was
crazy I mean what are your what's your
take on it I think it was um personal
especially I think was the promise of
virtual reality that we've heard for a
long time it was the first time I've had
a 3d gaming experience that I thought
was worth anything yeah I got 3d TV with
gaming don't care anything it really the
first thing I think they did the same
thing for both of us they tell you when
you first put it on the table look to
turn around all the way around you can
turn your head all the way as far as it
can go and it just feels like you're
looking behind you yeah you know and how
here it is here's some here's some
footage from the live show on the on the
I mean nothing can do it justice
I mean you can't but but look at but
look at what do you see the motion of
the of the game here look at how much
more real that looks
then what you'd normally experience in a
game the way you're moving around
because when you move around with the
controller your control you're very
metered in the control when this thing
is on your head you can it actually
looks more like a handheld camera who's
the Texas adding the wave the footage is
moving when we had it on the kept asking
us to roll our heads you know like this
yeah because if it rolls you can like
it's not a camera angle you're used to
seeing games where you sort of have a
horizon right I mean you can you know
it's you start to do things like peek
around corners they had they did this
thing where they had there was some
sparks flying off of them they show this
person actually was even more
interesting this just sounds like the
hippies thing I was like I just watched
a fan like a minute as well just the
fact you can look up
what I thought was interesting is not
just the sparks falling down you know as
you're underneath it but there was this
little area this little vent area next
to it that you could kind of look into
and it just felt like I'm looking into
something in reality I know it's a
really really incredible product they're
starting to sell Deb they're selling
death kits for it which include the the
goggles for 300 bucks all right I don't
have a price yet I don't know I don't
know the price but I think it's gonna be
affordable it's before it's me I think
there's some there's my some chatter I
like what we saw was a very low
resolution but it's so incredibly
immersive because it's super responsive
yeah like it's complete depth of feel
you can't see like the black bar that
takes out really something and I think
that what do you think about gaming and
we're talking a lot here about gaming
which is you know this valve stuff is
why you're sitting here you know this is
another piece of that puzzle that when
you start to think about all these
pieces we're putting together you know
technology in general looks exciting but
gaming especially is getting really
weird and cool but interesting it is so
let's talk about valve it is an intern
story here because there's no public
presence and I think it's actually one
the most interesting stories of see yeah
they were at see us last year as well
right and and in fact when we we talked
about the steam box the rumor of the
steam box what we heard was at the CES
they it the Lasius they were showing
this kind of reference hardware to
people and saying this is what we want
to build you know to partners yeah
exactly right and now we like now
they're being way more open about like
their meeting with hardware partners
they're sending the outlines Gabe Newell
valve CEO and basically just the for
presence of the company sat down just
about 45 minutes and just kind of
outlined everything they're doing what
is the steam box what are they being
very controlling of what do they want
partners to do yeah I mean it's it's
broad its far-reaching the general gist
like the poetic version of this is good
better best yeah good is a $99 console
it does local streaming you know better
it's as tightly controlled this is the
specs we want it's a $300 box you want
to do it with us we kind of tell you
what it is yeah and best is anything you
want like is right we're gonna build you
want to build your own right make your
system
and turn it into a steam box no problem
exactly like disk drives they said you
know manufacturers don't put disk drives
in but they're loud they're expensive
they increase the size of the box so
it's like that's kind of on the high end
right right right I mean I think it's I
think it's brilliant I mean what what
you know my question is does this have
can this have an impact on the on the
community on the gaming community as it
is now on the industry and we've got
some pretty entrenched players right
Sony Nintendo Microsoft they're
obviously not going anywhere anytime
soon so how does the steam box matter
can it matter on a grand scale or is
this much more of a niche product I
think it's gonna be interesting you see
PC gaming kind of growing in popularity
right now for a couple reasons one we're
the end of a console lifecycle a lot of
people are looking for something new and
exciting and more powerful and you're
seeing it on PCs if you compare far cry
3 on a PC to far cry 3 on your Xbox it's
kind of night and day it looks
incredible on computer indie games
there's all these indie games coming out
that are overwhelmingly on PC if they're
not on your phone and a lot of those
games don't come to your console so if
you have a box or device that makes it
easier to play that stuff you can play
it on your television your living room
valve told me yesterday that it was
their customers that told them they
wanted the steam box that they wanted to
play their games in a living room
they're doing it they already have an
Xbox so valve is in always reacting to
what our customers already do they
already play games in their living room
so the question is how do you make the
PC experience work in the living room
and that's what they're trying to do I
mean to me and I
obviously not the core audience of a
specialist but I really love the idea of
look I don't want I don't want a game on
a desktop I want to sit down in my own
with my big TV with the great sound in
my living room and play games but if I
had the opportunity to play better
looking games more immersive games games
with that are bigger because there's no
limitation on what you can do or how big
it can be games that are cheaper and
cheaper and and of a wider variety in
the sense that there's no barrier it's
real barrier to entry for developers you
know to me that's like it sounds like a
dream come true I mean I would love to
stick that under my TV and and use it I
feel like there's got to be a market for
that I think that it's gonna be about
some of this is gonna be about the games
they need to deliver something this is
your pitch for valves to do another
half-life they need to do half-life they
need to do the third half-life and that
doesn't mean it doesn't sound right and
and and make it exclusive to this thing
or or just do a bigger game than
anybody's done before a better game I
think this sandbox is gonna live outside
of steam or just be another extension of
the platform
I don't measure them fragmenting anyway
I think it's like no I mean they'll have
to go how they're not going to not make
it available to all the users obviously
I just think that you know there needs
to be some incentive for me to go
alright you know there's no for me there
isn't Center for the broader audience I
think you need to say how can you do it
I I'm just really excited that that
there is the opportunity for this
innovation I think you know we're
talking about you know what led to the
before the show started we time that
would led to the oculus rift and about
this global situation you know with with
cheaper cheaper parts better parts
open-source really taking over really
becoming mainstream in many ways you
know with Android and I think this is a
product of that in many ways not of
Android but of just this feeling that
the stuff is cheap enough it's easy
enough there's an audience there that
really cares about it because the the
technology or the gaming audience has
grown so big
and Sonia so mainstream and I think it's
really exciting time for this stuff
exactly here's here's something else
that was kind of interesting about what
he got into with that not so much just
that like we're gonna go on the big
screen but like this is our chance to
say you know we're not necessary half
the keyboard mouse we're not gonna sleep
of the gamepad we want to find a new way
of like really interfacing with these
games like it's really thinking like
long and hard it's definite not motion
he's not a huge fan of Kinect but there
was a long time biometrics the idea like
your wrist kind of you know kind of
tells what you're about to do it
actually I mean this is true Chris valve
has been working on they've been
experimenting a lot from what we
understand the company likes to
experiment right they're a private
company they've got basically one owner
they are really originated it's the
highest-grossing company per employee in
the country really the world yeah that's
crazy
they only have a hundred employees and
them so they have the luxury of taking
all the time in the world on the steam
box or it's rumored for a year and
they're like like we're not in a rush
right and so they have a whole team
that's doing rnd on things like
biometrics they have whole team that's
doing work on them just actually they
have a whole team that's doing work on
education and gaming and figure out how
we can use games to work in education
why because they're interested in it I
think they said like like one person
basically could ship a product at valve
normally it's like a little later on to
science a there's almost no bureaucracy
there's almost no kind of organizational
structure so yeah if you can convince
enough if you're a person of great
koomer who started big picture which
became steam box you guys have a piece
on him you should check it out so tumor
uh so great Coomer I choked up about
this piece is here and so he started it
was you know basically his idea he was
one of the first champions and he just
had to convince a couple other people at
valve that this was a good enough idea
and as soon as you have some buy-in from
a couple people now you've got a project
that the company can look officially
sanctioned it's a big picture started
about two years ago and it's kind of
grown into this this effort right the
steam box effort yeah the most
interesting thing is that the steam box
effort isn't just this kind of idea of
part
without side hardware manufacturers and
trying to get almost outsource the work
and convinced the alien wares of the
world or the ex I threes of the world to
them to create a steam box for you but
valve itself wants to make one I think
Gabe was pretty specific when he said
we're gonna make one we're gonna ship it
it's gonna have Linux on it if you want
to put Windows on it you can and that's
kind of a crazy idea right yeah like
that was not a hardware company yeah
it's it's um it's a really exciting
development I think and I'm just glad
that they're now talking about it you
know because I think there are all these
rumors we talked about it you guys have
talked about at the time and it's like
just say if you're doing something or
not give us some sense of what's
happening that gets down to like the
idea that valve does probably incumbent
need to market it like they don't have
the same effort where it's like okay now
we're gonna tease it we're gonna
announce it we have a big event that
just kind of right but I guess this
maybe we would not even be having this
conversation
have we not harassed gave them giving us
this interview essentially you know it's
luck of the draw and yeah we I think we
need to move on do you need to move on
fortunately I would like I mean Chris
was actually the verge cast last night
and I thought it was brilliant brilliant
performance of the first cast and I
would like to to spend the rest of the
day talking to you say when we're done
here
cancel might want please do but thanks
thanks for coming on right and and
you're here for the rest of the show

it on the video here oh it's still there
we'll come back tonight laughs tomorrow
night every single night George Katz is
like a is like a vampire that you can't
you can't even stake it in the heart it
doesn't have a heart and this would be
my guitar was broken and this is a
vampire weak by its vampire girlfriend
right we also have top-shelf in the
afternoon nineteen ninety five times a
day first tomorrow is our last first
what was our last first is that right oh
that's first to see yes last first of
CES but well how are we gonna celebrate
we need to really think hard well by the
way we'll take suggestions YES on ways
to celebrate our final first of CES
first last first lap last first last
part first first last last for first
last first last yeah
how to actually say that with me crazy
and that would be really uh anyway
doesn't shows I'll be updating the show
floor oh really yeah those we need more
news today we're out on the show floor
this is the day where we really start to
find the stuff that you haven't heard
about yet that that maybe you didn't see
a press conference honor that you know
and here's one if you don't see it you
know watch the ESF in years past you
might have seen it but we got Dante de
Rossi our star reporter because our this
is our weird our Vedas are very weird
well you just check it out yeah a face
cake it's called face cake I've just
stepped into a dress here at CES 2013
this is a virtual signage prototype that
they have here from face cake it's
called the face cake swivel we saw us
last year but was is using as a Kinect
and they've designed this too they've
scanned these clothes and the idea is
that when you're walking down the street
you might see you might see this signage
and you'll decide that you'd like to
step into it and see what it's like so
if I step in I could check out this
purse and I can add a necklace and I
could even switch hands face cake is
hoping that retailers and other
advertisers will be using these signs
and malls and even in their front
windows to get people not only to view a
photograph of the clothing or the
accessories but they'll be able to
actually try it on and it's not in any
stores yet at the moment but they plan
on improving it and I'm sure they're
shopping around the signs based on the
same technology we saw a last year from
face cake which is the face cake swivel
a virtual dressing room that lets you
choose dresses and suits and ties that
you'd like to try on they've also
announced here at CES a face cake swivel
up close which is designed for you to
try on makeup in a very similar fashion
as ecology itself is based off of a
Kinect sensor there are breeding body
size and they're they've already created
models in house they've created models
of clothing and accessories and they're
mapping it onto your body the sign
itself is designed for retailers or
advertisers that would like to not only
show static imagery on digital signs but
they'd like to try to get people to
actually try on these clothes without
even stepping into the store of course
we haven't seen this yet in action like
in reality but the face cake says that
they'll keep on working on and they'll
keep on improving it of course swivel
ran a trial the technology but this past
fall at twenty Bloomingdale's and if
you'd like to try it out yourself we
were told that they're going to start
running it later this year and on that
note you've officially been first 'add
we'll see you tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
