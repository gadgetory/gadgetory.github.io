spaceship - it's the vehicle the company
will use to replace the old spaceship -
which crashed in 2014 during a routine
test plane this vehicle is basically the
same as its predecessor it's a space
plane that will launch and return to
Earth the same way but there are a few
key changes mainly to make it safer and
to prevent in-flight nerve now this
vehicle is the one that Virgin Galactic
will use to potentially send people into
several space someday together we can
make space accessible in a way there's
only being dreamt of before now and by
doing that we can truly bring positive
change to life on Earth she assisted to
fly not just once to space for perhaps
thousands of times reusability is key
space riders become a regular affordable
activity Virgin Galactic is the space
tourism venture British entrepreneur
Richard Branson it's one of a handful of
companies racing to offer private
citizens the chance to escape Earth's
atmosphere since the company was founded
in 2004 hundreds of the rich and famous
have paid the $250,000 price to reserve
a seat including Ashton Kutcher Leonardo
DiCaprio and Justin Bieber but the
company has been beset with delays on
Halloween in 2014 one pilot was killed
and another injured during a test flight
of spaceship two above the Mojave Desert
an NTSB investigation found that the
cause of the crash was due in part to
pilot error it marked the first time
someone had died during a private space
flight test and the company's only
vehicle at the time was completely
destroyed since the accident
Virgin Galactic has been working hard to
build a new safer version of spaceship 2
the space plane is designed to take six
passengers and two pilots in a
suborbital space but rather than
launching from the ground like most
rockets the vehicle is lifted up to an
altitude of 50,000 feet by a carrier
aircraft called White Knight to their
spaceship to you deploys and ignites its
rocket engine for 70 seconds during a
crew flight the vehicle is meant to
speed up to above Mach 3 and reach a top
altitude of 70 miles high this allows
passengers to experience a few minutes
of weightlessness and step orbit then to
re-enter the Earth's atmosphere the
vehicle must reposition its wings
it's a manoeuvre known as feathering the
pilots must pull two levers while in
space and the wings move from their
horizontal position to a 65 degree
upright angle this helps create enough
atmospheric drag to slow down the space
plane during its descent the wings
eventually shift back to their normal
position so that spaceship too can by
two arunda the feathering assistant is
crucial for spaceships to safe descent
but it also helped cause the 2014 crash
one of the pilots unlocked the
feathering system too early during
flight this caused the wings to shift
prematurely even though the pilots
hadn't pulled any levers and the wings
are only meant to shift in space after
the engine is cut off and the vehicle is
moving much more slowly instead the
wings rotated when spaceship 2 was
accelerating at transonic speeds placing
too many g-forces on the vehicle and
causing it to break apart one of the key
differences with this new spaceship -
that there are fail safes in place to
prevent the pilots from unlocking the
feathering system too early we've added
in a mechanical system that prevents our
pilots from inadvertently whether
through a mistake or anything else
during this very brief period of the
flight where you don't want that feather
to deploy it makes it so you can't
deploy
during that time period without making
it so that during all the other places
of flight when it is a safety system
without making it so you have to you
know click through three computer menus
in order to activate something that you
want to be able to activate in a hurry
but whether or not these changes work
remains to be seen
flight testing is scheduled to take
place later this year and that's when
we'll really know if this is the safer
vehicle than before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
