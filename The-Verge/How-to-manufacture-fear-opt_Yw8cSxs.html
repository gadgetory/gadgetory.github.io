time of the year we get our way to get
scared
but we really think what's going on your
mind and bodies so why do we get scared
and what does it take to manufacture
fear
to see all of this in action we are here
at the Eastern State Penitentiary in
Philadelphia which hosts a haunted
attraction terror behind the walls in
the fall eastern state was an actual
prison until 1971 and he was abandoned
for years which makes walking three even
in the daylight kind of terrifying
we're walking to the second attraction
of terror behind the walls which is
called the machine shop
that's Amy Holloman the creative
director here at era behind the walls
Eastern State Penitentiary you can see
is a perfect setting for a Halloween
event because species like this we don't
really have to do anything to we just
have to put lighting dessert showcase
this crumbling cellblock architecture so
at one point there was a whole wall here
like we're looking into the back of all
these individual cells I think that what
keeps people coming back here and so
emotionally engaged in this space is
that it is kind of the closest thing to
time-travel that we have and when you're
here you can't help but think about the
people that were here you look into
these cells and your mind immediately
starts thinking God what would it have
been like to be in solitary confinement
that's my geek hair a sociologist who
studies the science of fear the way we
understand each other
you know empathy is is by recreating
those feelings ourselves so when we look
at people for example screaming in an
fMRI their brain has a certain kind of
signature and when you look at someone
who is thinking about somebody screaming
or watching someone scream those same
areas are activated so in a very real
way we we come here and we actually
experience a little bit what it must
have been like to be here
all right so we're gonna enter the
machine shop now so in this room we're
setting the story of the machine shop so
you'll find one of the members of the
machine shop who's looking in the mirror
here they're actually in the midst of
shaving their head when you come in and
they see you through the mirror and it's
written they start earlier when I think
about designing I think about what we
know from a lot of the psychological
testing that has been done on the threat
response and what is really effective at
activating the sympathetic nervous
system in the lab so for example we know
that the the looming threat so things
that that are coming at our face really
messed with our our threat response I
mean it has this you know effective
feeling like time is flowing it's just
terrifying and that makes sense I mean
the things that we're afraid of are
typically those things that can kill us
really effectively and really quickly so
this is a dark corridor here there's no
actors here it's sort of helping build
your anxiety as you're stepping into the
next room there is a laser sensor on the
floor down here so as you walk past this
it makes these crack and sparkle or sort
of shock wave sound is really a great
way to activate the sympathetic nervous
system by using sounds at different
frequencies and especially sounds that
have a lot of cultural significance to
so something like a crying baby or a car
wreck or chainsaws you know those things
will you know tap into our experiential
knowledge and and and get us going okay
so we're about to go Andy I know what to
expect so it should be fine
I know we're denoise azar I know
I know what's gonna happen so I should
be fine but it's these actors are really
scary okay I'm sure this really when
we're afraid some of the chemicals that
are contributing to a positive feeling
are the endorphins dopamine oxytocin
serotonin all of these things are
ramping up our body some bringing down
our body after we're scared and they can
contribute to a positive feeling there's
real psychological benefits to scaring
ourselves in fun and safe ways because
we can know rationally and logically
that were not in danger when we walk
into a haunted house it's flickering
lights and here's the guy who's shaving
his head I hope he's not turned we can
tell ourselves nothing in here is going
to hurt us
the monsters aren't real but because I
throw a response system is evolved to
protect us we have this ability to kind
of suspend our disbelief and forget that
we know we're safe and really feel like
we are you know in a threatening
environment so then you see this really
great kind of transition where we will
scream when we're startled and then
start laughing when we remember oh wait
you know this is a haunted house I'm
here to have fun and and in that moment
we are you know kind of in a way
hijacking our threat response and
reinterpreting it as as fun as
excitement and it becomes just a
positive high arousal state rather than
a negative one it's hard to scare people
effectively if you're just going in
right away from a psychological angle
because people are still in that heavy
thinking mode and we want to knock that
out we want to kind of knock out their
critical thoughts so they're fully in
their body
fear is not all bad it's not all bad
it's not all good it is and it's it is
something that we can't avoid and it's
something that our life literally
depends on I'm sweating a lot
rationalizing it and knowing why fear
happens and what happens to our bodies
did not help at all I thought this I
thought he was over I knew I was in a
safe environment if it's still like
everything was still walk or you need it
to still like makes me like scare and
jump and this people are still looking
at me and there's the really creepy
oh the guy with the guy with the axe or
the hammer big guy by the furnace that
was scary he's huge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
