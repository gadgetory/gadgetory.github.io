played I'm gonna be really embarrassed
if I can't so hey it's Tommy from the
verge and we are here at CES 2018 with
four theists in artificial intelligence
power ting-kwong robot from Imran I'm
here with Mike Chen and he's gonna tell
me all about this wonderful machine so
clearly this is probably not something
that I could have like in my house can
you explain what do you see this kind of
technology being applied for so the ping
pong itself is not is not really we
don't sell ping pong robots at the
supermarket what we are trying to do is
share our vision for how technologies
like this in AI in robotics in sensing
can be applied to real societal
challenges and improving human skill the
artificial intelligence in this case is
working in conjunction with sensing
technologies there's three different
cameras inside the head there to
recognize the person the player as well
as the ball right the ball location as
well as how the player is moving and as
you play it'll actually adjust to
increase the rallies with you so you
mentioned that the robot is able to
determine the player's skill level when
you played against the robot how did it
the trivet know I just got to play it
this morning right before you got here
and I haven't played in like 15 years
and I was like at 45 so it's only it
goes to 0 to 100 so 45 I'm sure I'm
surely be much better I'm really nervous
I don't know what how good I'll be ok
what's my skill level oh good
so I don't know if you guys can hear but
this robot is speaking in a really
high-pitched voice to give me
encouraging messages and the LED screen
in the net actually flashes it's really
nice messages like this really is fun
I agree thank you the level is getting
higher
so that's what happened I beat a ping
pong robot well not really it took me
several tries and I learned a lot about
myself through this and yeah there's a
really good experience I do it again my
level went up to 72
I started at around 55 and through hard
work and determination I improved so
thank you for feeis</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
