and I'm using the Z nama smart shirt
motion controller it's a smart shirt
with sensors that lets you control a
character in a video game by moving your
real body so this whole product category
they're calling East skin now Xena ma is
a company based in Tokyo now they've
been developing these Iskandar shirts
for the last couple of years for a
number of different use cases
this one very clearly looks like it's
for gaming but they're also developing
ones for fitness so they have pants and
fleece is for runners and other and
other athletes they also have one for
health care so they have sensors built
into the middle of the shirt for
tracking your respiratory system for
doing EKG tests this one I'm wearing
right now basically has a bunch of
sensors only for controlling movement so
it takes the movement of my arms my
chest area my shoulders translating the
ingame movement for a video game
character so that when I move like this
my character runs when I jump in it
senses that my body is going vertically
it'll make my character in the game jump
in the virtual world now this shirt may
look like kind of like a spider-man
costume crossed with an Iron Man suit
but actually it's pretty practical each
one of these silver lines here are
sensors and these sensors go all the way
from the wrist all the way up to the
chest area all throughout the torso and
they communicate or they send data to
this thing right here this module right
here which has Bluetooth built in now
this then translates the movements my
body makes to a PC or smartphone turns
them into in-game movements now the game
itself is pretty rudimentary they're not
game developers they're making smart
clothing but they did make a pretty
challenging game it was a quite an
intense workout you really have to move
your arms fast and jumping in the mix
there is definitely not easy I don't
think I'm gonna work out this hard and
see yes ever again and I kind of don't
want to
now the movements aren't super super
natural the first time I played the game
I tried to move my hips I tried to move
my shoulders and the cofounders of the
company here told me that's not exactly
how it works it's really more about
moving your two limbs your arms in a
very very even consistent motion
and then speeding up as fast as you can
to kind of make your character run
faster but the game itself is more of a
proof-of-concept zina mother company is
planning on selling this shirt for
around four to five hundred dollars for
consumers but that's coming later this
year there's no release date yet and
they haven't locked down pricing right
now if you're a developer and you want
to develop apps using the East skin
technology you can buy a shirt and and
get access to their SDK for $5,000 if
you want to see more embarrassing videos
of me covering the cutting edge smart
clothing and CES check out the verge

I don't know it's it's definitely the
tightest shirt I think I've ever worn in
my life</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
