this is the Nokia Lumia 1020 this phone
really comes from last year the 808
PureView which was a fantastic 41
megapixel camera basically soldered on
to a cell phone from 2003 the 1020 takes
roughly the same camera but this time
graphs it on to a smart phone that
actually belongs in 2013 it's roughly
the same size as the Lumia 920 which is
to say it's thick and heavy and
generally large even though it's
slightly thinner than the Lumia 920 its
rounded in unibody and really well made
except for the huge bump in the back
where the camera lens is the lens is so
big that it keeps the phone from sitting
flat on a table so it wobbles around a
little bit when you put it down it also
makes the phone kind of awkward to hold
since there's no place really
comfortable for your fingers to rest on
the back all the way down the spec sheet
the Lumia 1020 is just like the Lumia
920 it's 4.5 inch 1280 by 768 display is
every bit as good with great colors and
smooth animations and thanks to some of
Nokia's proprietary technology it works
even if you're wearing gloves and even
mercifully outdoors it's a really good
display despite a few issues with colors
and viewing angles
the 1020 even has the same processor as
the 920 though it does have twice the
RAM even the button layout is the same
with power volume and camera shutter
controls all inside the only button that
even feels different is the shutter
which is much more sensitive and
responsive than it used to be it makes
half pressing to focus actually
achievable where it was kind of clumsy
before and that's not the only great
thing about the 1020 s camera either
pretty much everything is great it
shoots 3438 megapixel images and they
look incredible from the colors to the
dynamic range to just the sheer size
it's almost hard to believe these
pictures come from a cell phone it's the
best smartphone camera I've ever seen
and even better than a lot of pointing
shoes it's not great in low-light
there's a lot of processing which makes
pictures look really noisy and soft even
though they're impressively bright but
it's still far better than any other
phone practically speaking you don't
need to use 34 megapixel images unless
you're printing billboards but taking
such big pictures lets you manipulate
them after Nokia likes to say it
reinvented zoom but basically all it's
done is give you huge images with which
to make slightly smaller images within
the Nokia pro cam app itself you can
crop rotate and save pictures after you
take them it'll save a smaller edited
version alongside the full-size shot you
can only get at the full size images by
connecting your phone to the computer
which is a shame I'd love to upload the
biggest twit pics ever but I can't
program also controls everything about
your shot from the white balance and I
so to focus and the flash it's a xenon
flash by the way which means that
instead of basically turning on a light
it actually flashes which is great
propane is really fast really simple and
really smart you can see every change
you're making in real time so you'll
never get a shot that's too dark unless
you want to and everything's colored
exactly as it looks
video looks great as well you can shoot
in 1080p and thanks to improved image
stabilization and a surprisingly good
microphone it's a great tool for just
whipping out of your pocket and filming
the pro cam app is pretty intense and it
can slow down the phone a bit but for
the most part the 1020 is really fast
and smooth scrolling multitasking even
playing games and watching movies
Windows Phone 8 devices tend to be
pretty fast no matter their hardware and
thanks to a Snapdragon s4 processor that
10:20 has pretty solid hardware better
than if it's good to the phone so big it
has a pretty hefty battery inside and it
easily lasts a day and a half I got two
days using the optional $79 camera grip
which adds battery a grip a tripod mount
and an even better shutter button if you
want to take a lot of pictures you
should definitely get the grip
unfortunately what the Lumia 1020
doesn't have is a lot of apps beyond
Nokia's pro cam and a handful of its
other apps the ecosystem situation is
getting better and better here but it's
still a long way behind Android and iOS
and there are a lot of key photography
apps in particular from snapchat to
Instagram to Google+ that are really
noticeably absent what good is taking
great pictures if you can't do anything
with them I'll just say it I wish the
Lumia 1020 was running Android it has
more apps and a better sharing platform
which give you something to actually do
with your photos other than drag and
drop them onto your computer but Nokia
made its bed with Windows Phone 8 and at
this point all it can really do is wait
for the apps to show up luckily for
Nokia and for Windows Phone 8 users the
Lumia 1020 is one of the best Windows
handsets ever it's big certainly but the
cameras are really really good reason to
buy this phone even at $299 plus a
two-year 80 contract on the other hand
it adds a new viable option in the
Windows Phone 8 race next to the
gorgeous Lumia 925 there are more good
Windows Phones than ever and that's a
really good thing but until good phones
lead to good software I'm still gonna
find myself wishing Nokia had picked
Android</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
