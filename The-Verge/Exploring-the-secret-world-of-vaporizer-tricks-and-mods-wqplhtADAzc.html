with Girl Scouts of the USA and tootsie
roll industries over illiquid flavors
that taste like the respective cookies
and candy but while cease and desist
letters may force those flavors off the
market vapors still have a ton of
options that's actually a big part of
the appeal of vaporizers choice we're
not talking about the enjoy type e cigs
that look and taste like regular
cigarettes this is about more elaborate
vaporizers that can be taken apart
modified and accessorized to produce
what those in the community call mods
first there's the liquid there are more
than 1500 companies making a liquid and
ever more creative flavors cinnamon
toast crunch cinnamon red hots Sam's
right bake it good juicer whose mother's
milk
carrot cake I can taste the frosting
okay some people mix their own varieties
by combining liquid nicotine artificial
flavoring and a base of propylene glycol
or vegetable glycerin all of which can
be bought online you can actually get
the glycerine at Walmart because it's
also used to make cake icing propylene
glycol can be bought on Amazon where
it's advertised as an ingredient in
shampoo a warning adding alcohol to your
liquid will not get you drunk it will
just make your throat hurt many vapors
don't stop at playing chemistry however
there's also the device itself which
consists of a battery atomizer and other
hackable components hobbyists may tamper
with the atomizer to ensure a more
satisfying puff or alter the heating
coil to change the temperature of the
vapor these tweaks supposedly produce a
better flavor and smoother drag one
popular goal is to make the cloud of
vapor as big as possible some people
will even use a reader to check the
vaporizers ohms which will tell you how
much power you can use without burning
all the flavor out and permanently
frying your vaporizer v cigs and ecig
liquid aren't regulated by the FDA and
modifying the devices at home carries
risks there have been more than a dozen
documented cases of e-cigarette
explosions in recent years which makes
the thought of messing with the battery
a little scary
meanwhile a liquid can also make you
sick if it comes in contact with your
skin and please please don't swallow it
other than that padding</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
