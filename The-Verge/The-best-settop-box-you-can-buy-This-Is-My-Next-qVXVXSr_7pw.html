cord cutting hasn't exactly taken over
yet but eyes are also good that you're
done watching Shahs of Sunset reruns
just because there's nothing else on
Netflix Hulu and a thousand other
services are engineered to solve this
exact problem to put huge libraries of
anything you might want to watch just a
click or two away if you want the most
content and the best experience you
really need a dedicated set-top box if
you want access to the huge world of
streaming content there are exactly four
dedicated boxes you should even think
about buying at the end of the day
though the Roku 3 is the best choice
it's the right set-top box for the most
people the one with something for
everyone the biggest thing Roku has
going for it is content it offers more
to watch than any of its competitors and
it's not close Netflix and Hulu Amazon
and YouTube Showtime and HBO GO anything
and everything you can think of each
comes as a channel which you select from
a grade on the home screen the interface
isn't beautiful but it's simple and
usable and it's a window to a truly
outrageous amount of content the Roku 3
also has a nifty Universal Search option
which makes it really easy to find
whatever you want to watch across all of
those channels and there's even a
headphone jack in the remote so you can
watch without disturbing whoever's
sitting or sleeping next to you and you
can also replicate a lot of the
chromecast features with the Roku
streaming straight from the Netflix or
Hulu app on your phone to your Roku 3 a
couple of the other boxes have prettier
or faster interfaces but you buy a
set-top box because you have things to
watch the Roku 3 has the most things to
watch and all the features it needs to
make watching easy it's the best set-top
box out there right now but it wins only
by the slimmest of margin
if Apple ever decides the Apple TV is
worth real time and effort if it fixes
the interface for YouTube and adds
content sources like Amazon it could
really quickly claim the throne that's
because it has a truly killer feature
that no other device can replicate
airplay airplay lets you play Netflix or
Spotify on your TV sure but it also lets
you send almost any photo video or audio
from another Apple device to your
television it'll even mirror your screen
on your TV and do some cool dual screen
tricks if you're playing games airplay
is system-wide its built-in for anyone
with an Apple device and it's a really
incredible tool but the Apple TV hasn't
gotten a real update in a while and it's
showing its age apple's interface and
remote are a little too simple and
there's nowhere near the breadth
content you'll find on the Roku 3
airplay is an unbeatable feature and it
really wouldn't take much to get Apple
TV over the top but it's not quite there
yet the same is essentially true of
Amazons fire TV the fire TV has lots of
content Hulu and Netflix and watch ESPN
and basically all of the basics
except HBO GO it's also really fast and
has this amazingly great voice search
function just hold the button on the
remote say movies directed by
Christopher Nolan and you're off and
there's all kinds of cool ancillary
features like x-ray and IMDB on top of
whatever you're watching even Amazon's
games usually a mess on a set-top box or
pretty fun but the fire TV is missing a
few apps it's content library isn't huge
especially if you're not and don't want
to be an amazon prime subscriber and the
handy Universal Search doesn't tie
together services the way the Roku 3
that Amazon was late to the set-top box
game and could absolutely fix all of
these problems and it does have a solid
base to build on Amazon could make real
moves here and win in a big way but it's
not quite done yet
that brings me to chromecast the crazy
cheap crazy simple model with chromecast
there is no remote there's not even
really a box you pick what you want to
watch or hear on your phone or tablet or
laptop and then click the button to
start it playing on your TV it works but
only in a few apps for now and it's
nowhere near as simple or as pervasive
as airplay and truthfully there's
something nice about having a remote and
about being able to sit on a couch next
to someone and scroll through options
together chromecast potential is big and
it is cheap and easy a way to watch
Netflix as you'll find anywhere but it
still feels like kind of a hacker's
toilet ok so those are the big four
the Roku 3 is the best of the bunch but
they all do the job your only real
mistake would be buying anything else
set-top box has changed fast and when
Android TV comes out or when Apple or
Amazon or Google takes its next big
swing things might change again
but for now you should be looking for
the best mix of content features power
and simplicity the Roku 3 offers the
best mix of all for the little guy wins
