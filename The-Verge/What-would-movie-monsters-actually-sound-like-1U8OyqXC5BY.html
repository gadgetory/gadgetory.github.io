uncharted island where animals have been
completely out of proportion over the
last eight years this mega monsters
seemingly become larger in each film
more fears and visually this large
beasts are loosely based of real animals
but what about the sounds they make we
want to find out how accurately sounds
are what would a giant beast actually
sound like the very first thing that you
have to say up front absolutely is we
know we're not making documentary that's
Stewart Sumida a paleontologist and
animal Anatomy specialists worked on
Kong Skull Island and has advised
filmmakers on dozens of movies so people
can quibble all they want about the
biology of the creatures in some cases
like the lizard eruption things are
completely fictitious creatures but you
want them to feel like they live in the
universe that the movie is portraying
and in the case of the title character
there is no eight that looks like after
she walks like a man but he's not a
gorilla he's King Kong so he's the
different species first the movie is the
point he and others make is that these
creatures don't actually exist but they
still need a sound that feels real or
even if they did once exist like the
dinosaurs in Jurassic Park what they do
is sometimes I'm realistic
you ever noticed in the movies Jurassic
Park and others when they're chasing
down human prey they roar at it which is
ridiculous he's right that's Phillips
Center associate professor of biology at
Fayetteville State University no
predator vocalizes when hunting they
hunt as silently as possible you are
pounced on before you even know you're
being hunted but it's a movie and that
scene wouldn't have been a scary the
t-rex save time in fact even when sound
designers could pull from similar
real-life examples they often reach for
the unexpected like a hatching Dino egg
from Jurassic Park these large ice cream
cones will end up being the egg cracking
sound paleontology have been trying to
figure out what dinosaur
the light for decades it started to get
an answer because the vocal organs used
to make sounds like the vocal cords in
our throat are mostly made of flesh and
flesh does not fossilized so for clues
scientists look at dinosaurs closest
relatives birds and crocodilians which
yes includes proper dials birds make a
variety of high-pitched chirps but if
you look at the larger birds like
ostriches emus and cassowaries they make
rumbling sounds that are lower in
frequency
some scientists leave these low
frequency sounds are probably more
similar to what dinosaurs must have made
the other Dino relatives like crocodiles
and alligators make booming
low-frequency sounds as well that's kind
of different from the high-pitched
screech of velociraptors in Jurassic
Park isn't it obviously there were many
different kinds of dinos and they all
sound different but scientists have a
better idea about one type in particular
could have sounded like duck-billed
dinosaurs that's because these animals
at a large hollowed crust on top of
their heads when the dinosaur breathed
the air went through the tubing's inside
the crust and it resonated making this
very low-frequency buzzing sort of sound
kind of like a didgeridoo
in 1978 very wise Hannibal and master
students at the University of Toronto
created a prototype to replicate the
sound one type of duck-billed I know the
Paris rock was it was made of PVC the
same material your home pipes hang on
when you blow air into it you can
basically hear what the duck-billed
dinosaur sounded like while breathing
other scientists then replicated the
sound using computer models and this is
what they came up with nice now let's
compare that the same diner in Jurassic
Park the lost world now in this scene
though the diner is in distress
so it's calls could sound completely
different that one is just breathing the
fumes sounds are more high-pitched the
filmmakers actually recorded cows
through long tubes and the sound
actually doesn't seem too far off to me
but the more scientifically accurate one
is deeper and that makes a lot of sense
all these dinosaurs lifted really
heavily for static fireman you know
chuckles that's Thomas Williamson
curator of paleontology at the New
Mexico Museum of Natural History and
Science
so these low frequency sounds are
actually detect amount of travel the
best through different sort of habitats
so movies aren't focused on the
picketing accurate sounds for a lot of
reasons when it comes to giant creatures
and monsters it's just better to shut
off the science part of your brain if
you can same goes for all the tarantulas
and the Sharktopus is in the movies
these are creatures without any vocal
cords so come on every cute spider I've
seen in the movie chirps like a bird
