start over yeah hey and welcome to the
verge cast for the week of March
fourth 2013 I'm Josh T'Pol's I'm Paul
Miller and we're Virg Cassie and I
already explained this the first time we
did this but I'm going to explain it to
you again because that's how much I like
you and care about what you know we're
verge casting from my office my
unadorned empty office in the corner of
our new building which we just moved to
in midtown Manhattan and our studio is
not ready yet
still being prepped next week still
being massaged and practice on next week
we got Janice and yeah so we're very
chaste for my office and we're doing it
via Google hangout and we're also doing
like an open mic very cool so I wrote a
song about yeah future you wrote a song
about is I can't your job Carter slash
Lauder now Paul is the only person who
liked the John Carter movie right you
liked it no it's pretty bad you did I
read the book it was terrible I was so
rooting for you know here's the credit
here comes the lake fan here's the
problem
Mars has two thirds the gravity of Earth
you jump on Mars you don't go like 50
harder to jump no it's easier to Joey's
gonna jump but let's say it's but it
only has a third less gravity wait are
you saying your biggest problem ours
October but the ones I will not allow
was that but you're supposed it's only a
third less gravity yeah it really made
it seem like it was like half as much
gravity and the fact that he was just
walking there's alien race is battling
for nothing you know what I didn't see
it can you please stop eroding the plot
of ground Carter oh yeah see it
I'll say but you have to watch it
there's a great any other time springing
to read the story about like how that
movie failed but he's not sorry with
their first trailer which oh here I want
to correct they think it's kind of cool
I want to correct this myth so John
Carter was horrible
promoted right unmitigated here's the
thing though I read that article and
it's all about how nobody knows what
this no one's ever read this book right
nobody knows about this they know don't
hear the movie they the trailers are bad
and they don't know the intellectual
property it's like a triple whammy
it's never gonna succeed but but i but
meanwhile meanwhile we know i've read
the book yeah
i've loved loved the director i've seen
all over the trailers multiple times
went to see the movie and it was
horrible and it deserved to fail
yeah but sure it was terrible let's just
say it was a bad movie whether you
whether you watched whether you watch I
hate the setup by the way I'm really
uncomfortable right now I want
everything why don't you look at us okay
yeah I don't know where to look that's
part of the problem I guess
okay I don't think that it was a bad
movie I don't know why we're talking
about blowing it out I have the new I
have the new game yeah I have it I'm on
the list you know about it what do you
want to know who doesn't read Facebook
very often this doesn't seem like a big
change damn it how many how many photos
of me lies relatives can you find go
right go everyone's graph search can you
grab some photos of photos while you do
that the top of Nilay Patel of the
photos by photos of me and Nilay Patel
yeah that's what shows nude photos of
the hotel taken in Brooklyn yeah
riding a horse how does it had a big
event they said we're gonna make it more
like our mobile I wish I could
screenshot and they said something
really weird which I thought was
interesting for Facebook which was we
are a container we are we don't make
content we're container of other
people's content yeah and we want to
show that as beautifully as well it's
like everywhere and then dr. Berg's lion
was we're want to be the best newspaper
in your life or something
everybody wants to be the best newspaper
yeah cuz newspaper what a great business
to aspire do you want to be the new
crumbling local news I just really ups
my New York it was called a portal yeah
known for this you go there that was
your homepage
Yahoo get all your news get your weather
maybe look up movie time see how many
emails you serve your friends maybe open
up an I am window
short scores yeah I just think you know
if Facebook wants to be in the portal
business hmm yeah the social portal
that's what they are that's what they
are I'm seeing by the way I can see
beyond you a new chair for my office
that is being built yes yeah I just
think everybody wants to be they want to
make their spot inescapable right this
is just Facebook's like next move to try
to get you to keep looking at Facebook
as much as possible yes sticky but
what's really interesting to me and we
were talking about what's going on was
its it this is a second big product
launch Facebook's had yeah tablets which
it's about Facebook's core business but
where their numbers are going down right
yeah they know that people are using
Facebook on phones and tablets more but
they're like all this relentless focused
on the desk I mean I think I think it's
a really tough I think it's really tough
and Ellis just wrote this huge thing
about how teenagers aren't using
Facebook and I have to say I think it's
really tough to be a social network on a
platform that isn't hold into you know
it's all about being in apps you know
and not every you're not gonna have I
mean you don't want to go into an app a
Facebook app to use other apps you know
it like you want to Instagram like
you're gonna do go Instagram you know
you're gonna you want to tweet something
you're tweeting like if you want to post
your I don't know how many people are
really posting to Facebook that often
there are now ways to do it from within
iOS from within Android that doesn't
require that you go to Facebook to do it
so you're not coming to see their ads
right not seeing their their content
they want you to see and I think it's
like kind of a big problem for them so I
think yeah and I think what this is all
about is it they're making Facebook
nicer to look at so when you go to it
you're like you see more of the photos
yeah you see all this content people are
can you tell me the basic what did they
change they made newsfeed
they made their newsfeed they made it
more visual they like change the way
it's the split they they move where
you're like chat window is like they
moved your chat and a bunch of other
stuff to like a left ya know it's
actually a little bit more like the
Android app it's a lot of the iOS I said
it where it has like a slide I showed
all the screens and I don't want to move
to a parody of these well that's logical
because if they can teach you how to use
it on the desktop then you'll know how
to use their mobile a level of comfort
and it is a better design like it looks
better I have to say is a serif font for
headlines which is totally weird most of
my are like a good number of my friends
don't use Facebook or like they use it
very very sparingly my sister is
probably like two thirds much like the
gravity of Mars she's like two thirds
never on like quit Facebook she's like
oh I got Facebook back for now and then
she quits it again right but I see my
friends scroll through Instagram all the
time well they do it they don't pull up
Instagram and check it in the other way
yeah they just sit there and look right
and I just like that it solves a lot of
like things that when you want to know
about this slide a bar over or when it's
a graph like glass or text all over the
place create a text messages you're
getting email you're on Twitter like
it's nice to just have a place where
it's like thing is happening there's a
photo of it I have my discrete group of
friends yeah and it's like really basic
it's really and I do think like you know
as we as Facebook tries become in all of
these things like Twitter is a little
bit pushing into this like
all-encompassing like social network I
think we are starting to people are
going like well I don't really want the
all-encompassing this is overwhelming
it's overwhelming and it's just I don't
order has a problem at all right they've
moved further and they move further and
they're doing crazy thing now and more
snippets part of an article right but I
think do are they're very comfortable
with Twitter because like unless you're
in a small class of Twitter users it has
tens of thousands of followers you
pretty much to know everybody whose
fault you can look at the list there
they are all these people but if you
follow two minute this has happened to
me if you just are naive and follow too
many people I've done too many German
requests no no quitter you on Twitter if
you follow too many people it gets
really overwhelming yes and it's it
stops at a content coming in
that album is Facebook's Pro knows about
it's come in I think people just don't
want to share to the I think people are
afraid of Facebook I think when the data
goes on a Facebook there's a little bit
of that I think there's certain types of
sharing the Facebook it seems to be
perfect for I mean some of the things
that I've seen are like events like
family events weddings babies like
there's these things where it's like you
want to have a bunch of photos you want
people to be able to go oh my god that's
a cuter I can't believe you wear that
hat or whatever and like event it's like
really good for it I think for
individual outings we've started to
acclimate to like a more of a more of
like a micro yeah blogging sort of thing
where it's like you want little spurts
of you want to know a little bit like
here's a picture from last night or
here's like I'm wearing this jacket or
whatever where it's not like here's a
gallery of things or here's like a bunch
of texts about it or let's have a
conversation about it son was like let's
just I just want to share this one thing
with you then get on with my life right
I feel like in a way that's like vine
and snapchat have are both kind of
reinforcing this idea that people want
to they want to get in get out and get
all their lives III think it's the exact
antithesis of Facebook where you don't
want to live there yeah of that it's
opposite of that frictionless sharing
thing that Facebook does so yeah which
by the way the other day i was listening
to literally for work i was listening to
a selection of really really bad pop
music and people were like cali choice
or other people started like tweeting
cuz they could see my scrub my scrub and
and it was like four or five tweets like
oh yeah listening to you know britney
spears whatever i'm like yeah i am but
like i don't see how that's actually a
very useful interaction like what i
would I realized is like this isn't
it's not doing anything for me except
like people are like oh do you mean the
information that's shared passively by
passive it passive sharing right and
all-encompassing are two things that I
think we are discovering are somewhat
less desirable Facebook assumed they
would be some other some other passive
stuff is stuff that I want to look back
on like I know people are talking about
how the you know Instagram stuff is geo
tagged yeah so it can be helpful you
know like like first as my sister went
to England a year or so ago and you know
took a bunch of photos and I'm think
that's all geo tagged so if I wanted to
like find places she'd been to I
probably do that and that and and and
and I'm really interested in stuff like
you know like Foursquare getting to know
like if my friends like restaurants and
things like that right finding
recommendations but I don't need to know
that like do you think of like Yelp and
Foursquare's discreet things for those
right yeah you think of like Yelp is
like a discrete you go find that's
another thing where you're you're
choosing very specifically I want to
share the specific type and amount of
data I also think this part of Instagram
where it hasn't blown up I mean it's
huge it's huge but it's not a billion
people know it is it's a billion people
okay
it's huge but it's not right is that it
is that it's Trimble it's not like
nearly but you can share like you don't
remember when everybody's pissed their
parents came onto Facebook yeah not
everybody's parents are an Instagram
yeah not yet so you can share with kind
of a small nap chats like trending or
vine or whatever whatever your parents
is isn't on every day is it on it
depends on if you think of your parents
as a singular or it's actually really
good for it like how many parents are
there if you have more than one I I have
one parents I can't I can't tell
anything to my parents without my
parents knowing oh you have a they're
like and they're like yeah a unit that
where you can't share secret if I call
them on the phone they and they get
together in a room and talk to me Austin
yeah my parents love to get on the phone
too close to 90
well this is several months ago so I've
got a surprise probably probably 90
million monthly active hi more
registered Instagram is growing
I think Yelp I think the point about
life what's the billion think the point
about recommendations like food
recommendations is like I think you know
in the same way that I don't know I
don't like want I don't want to have
like an Apple car and an Apple phone and
like an Apple house and like an Apple
camera like I like to have I think
they're well I mean I don't want yeah I
don't necessarily want to have all of
the same thing I don't think that
everybody's all like that Apple would be
good at making every product I don't
believe that like I don't think most
companies be good at making every
product you know Apple really sucked at
what making social network yeah ok great
data making social network bad at making
web stuff yeah I think bit bad at email
and calendaring stuff really not bad at
maps and by the way and we've talked
about this a lot but it is that eCos
address book applications but yeah it is
that that lock in really good at making
faux leather apps Facebook wants to do a
desktop phone would like to be we'd like
to be there for everything but I think
what human beings really want is like
the things that are best for those this
and that's what they're gonna use and
like people I think gravitate and like
the simplicity of a single use
application because you know what it's
do you know what's doing and you know
that like the data is it's all meant for
that yes
you know like Instagram and there's not
there's not more to the story you shared
a picture you maybe said something about
it that's the it says where you are
that's the entire interaction it so
single-use makes total sense
super easy to process it's like when
you're presented with this myriad yeah
these myriad options and ways you can
share and ways you connect things it's
like I think it becomes overwhelming I
think the moment has a little problem
for Facebook I think they're both a
portable of course are portable portable
they support they were giving a portal
and I think it is so here's dangerous so
that's the I also very very portable but
that's what they did space what they
said we want to be in the newspaper for
you yeah but people have newspapers they
don't and they don't want to read people
to wanna read The Verge on Facebook they
want to see a link from the verge and
they're not like pulling a hoe please
join but they were I think what they're
saying is this is I think all these
single-use apps are great but I think
their point is
we can pull in all that right we can
pull in Instagram it's what so happy and
so predominant yeah all these other
networks oh he has to connect they don't
you don't want to open up your facebook
browser into your Facebook feed and then
get off the internet that's not what
people do and that's what they're going
to do and then like apps if apps are any
indication and phones are any indication
like they're also not going to do it on
their mobile devices right like it just
isn't how we want to interact with it I
want to sit down at your like world
terminal experience world stuff and then
they turn it off it's like you can
purchase it you wake up at the mortgage
filter on your you turn on your like
Facebook terminal yeah Facebook PC or
whatever it watches you for the rest of
the day like Facebook it's all it's
pulling it all the stuff like was like
it's like you would be mistaken if you
felt that that's what Google was doing
because it is right you know those are
their googles to an end it's it's right
Google's building plus is this layer and
it's like it was like not working well
that's the so we're talking from our
perspective of you know and a lot of
people we know perspective of wanting
variety and always you know choosing you
know like I'm not gonna do my photos on
Facebook but I'm good in though I'm
doing on Instagram right but it totally
still makes sense for Facebook to cast
as wide of a net as possible yeah
absolutely makes sense for them teachers
I'm assuming this reporter I don't know
very soon because you're angry it's
because wrong wearing headphones can't
hear ourselves I didn't hear you know
Adrienne's she's writing a report in the
metaphor that was in it I was reading
just reverse that Anna was Facebook
wants to be bigger than a container they
want to be it's it's it's it's right its
own its facebook wants to be the social
network of record yeah just went up so
in there she says Facebook wants to be
not just the biggest container but like
the container ship
I'm worried you've got all these
single-use apps and Facebook is where
you you go and you can see all the
things that people are sharing you can
see all the photos for Instagram that
they're using but they will be so big
that companies like Twitter will have to
integrate your photos go on Facebook
yeah they do I know they own it but they
took yeah you think should you answer
that all or nah I think you can
disconnect it yeah well I mean kids
because cuz I am as a lot of you afraid
to God
okay if you're like I'll see people
they're like they like this Instagram
photo and the Instagram photo appears in
their feed like if you like something
but I think you have to specifically
tell to do that I'm not really sure by
the way this is why Facebook is a
problem I don't know really know if the
Instagram stuff will appear
automatically or if I can turn it on and
off or if it's just on certain actions
like lights like that's the worst not
not know Facebook has turned into like
some weird combination windows its
windows it's an operating system its XP
where it's like what how do I make this
thing stop appearing how do I change
this I turn off Mac where do I adjust
the time like I don't understand
double-click the no but you put an old
person in front of XP for the first time
to ask them to do anything that involves
changing anything and you put it over in
front of Facebook the first time
immediate dong pics here's what I want
to know and then I want to change topics
but here's what I want to know since
Facebook has changed its search yeah
I've done more Bing searches because
you've just been letting because I'm
like because I'm like trying to research
that it can't do and I'm delete ok fine
bings traffic has got to be like
skyrocketing right now yeah it has to be
it's gotta be I want to search on
Facebook it automatically also searches
if you if you do search on Facebook so
search let's say like hold on I'm gonna
can't type hurt a lot let's just say um
Paul Miller press there's another Siri
button on that line offline okay so Siri
100 is 10 so if I buy a shoe button Paul
Miller offline news okay if I search for
this like he doesn't find anything and
so this brings up a way it's like web
search and so like it's another click
over and it kicks you over to Bing
either and you agreed to do that on a
regular basis sometimes I just do it
like out of habit like I want to see
what results it pulls up because I'm
like looking for it yeah and it's
happened a number of times and I'm like
oh yeah I just Bing but that's be the
best thing in the world for being I'm
sure I mean I think Microsoft got an
incredible slam dunk or or Bing is just
really confused cuz being is always
having the search for random people that
it doesn't know yeah I don't know I
don't know the people are using uncle
Steve
they're probably not using but I have to
have to imagine there's some kick up
this hey Bing Bing Bing it okay so what
else we have topic was uh well you went
to Ted oh yeah I went to wrote a feature
would you say you're an influence I
would say that no I would say that well
my Klout score I think I've been active
at Ted Ted is so so I went to Ted all
last week and I'd never been out only
seen the TED Talks online which
everybody has seen and everybody loves
right if you'd like to hear smart people
talking you like bite-sized intelligence
it's like it's like it's like you know
I'm not going to college I'm not gonna
learn this thing all the way through but
this person is gonna like make me feel
that I have yeah
like that I can now speak with authority
on you know the maybe in rituals oh it
was so much racial of fraud based on a
20 minute talk is so much authority so I
know everything I know about Dinah so
what I did here's what you don't here's
what they don't give you you don't see
talks on is like the Ted experience like
what it's like to be at Ted and what I
and what I realize is that at Ted it's
it's like you're in this and I use this
metaphor the snowglobe metaphor but I
you it's like you're in this world with
all these people really smart really
talented really rich really famous like
the most famous most rich most talented
weirdest group of people yeah you'll you
know that may ever assemble which to
their credit is like I gotta say it's
kind of amazing that you can get you
know Ben Affleck and Bono and Bill Gates
and me and I know I'm just like random
like journalist guy there and like all
these weird you know I meant like a ton
of journalists they're in a ton of
artists you know Amanda Palmer where
she's known more Rowley Amanda
Palmer and you know that's her that's
her that's her name yeah see you're so
I'm so now that I've been there so has
no one by the way not listed as Amanda
 poem or on any of the Ted stuff
that's just a man upon but you know like
these you know all these weird people
together and and like performers young
musicians
jugglers jugglers no they have like an
alien dance crew I met I met movie
directors likes directors their movies
that you know that you have seen that
are like you love no you specifically
really yeah yeah and like so it's just
weird understand of JOHN CARTER know
what Harry Potter like Harry Potter
so I'll just say I'm gonna say it's a
music movie means leave it at that
recent recent music movie
anyhow so but the pitch perfect know
also is my plan is that you're in the
magic way you're in this bubble love for
as it like is amazing but the thing
that's weird about Ted that you don't
know the I'm just gonna say this really
quickly and then we can know all their
lives they eats like you're in this
bubble with all these people and you
don't really leave you're in this
convention center you're in this arena
for like a party you go to the aquarium
for a party at night they have parties
and weird things and all of the hotels
like for hotels this and it's like in a
mile radius and you don't you're not
supposed to go really you're supposed to
be there the whole time yeah and it just
becomes like this weird like get up at
like 8:30 in the morning and like off to
some sessions then you're like mingling
and eating all day and then like party
at night and then like cage match it's
like and it's like 2:00 in the morning
you're like I'm still with all these
same people attack like what's going on
like we're still hanging out and every
is like talking about the ideas and it's
just this weird like utopian like this
yeah micro world that's created for a
week and then it's gone lame is no I
kill you damn dropped all those other
assholes
well you're oh those are people who are
not-- so you're not supposed to talk
about who's there oh director of Never
Say Never who's an awesome dude really
nice guy I shouldn't have said that I'm
gonna be banned from dad for life now
that's the other thing they're like
scary though but they will ban you and
Matthew I mean it just sounds like some
weird combination of like a floating
island nation state yes plus like oh
really
Randy arrived it is a very autonomous
zone which is the the anarchist a writer
Hakim Bey coined in 1991 which is
basically like this kind of like this
this nation state that rises up
that's like seeking secret it's a place
of lying sad a you know some kind of
like sort of traveling ban it's like
it's like Bernie man Bernie man but like
really organized Bernie man burning man
meets like andreas fascists burning kind
of yeah it's like it's like super elite
Burning Man with like but with a point
mm-hmm Bernie's like but like I got some
mescaline let's go out to the desert
no this is like this is like I got some
ideas let's go to Long Beach yeah you
know it's moving to Vancouver next year
which by the way I think is even more
isolated Cooper kid yeah which i think
is like even more isolate its like there
is no LA you can drive to you know the
closest city is like Victoria or
something Thank You ver and then like
Victoria is like not too far away but
like there ice went to Whistler which is
that same Vancouver that was a pain in
the ass Whistler is where they're gonna
have Ted active no that's so hard to get
to is hard enough like hard enough to
fly into Vancouver and they you have to
drive to Whistler and you just want to
kill yourself beautiful so you see
Whistler ski town right yeah okay so
anyhow but it was really interesting and
I have to say like it's no accident you
have an opportunity to go to Ted I
recommend it but what the way I ended up
on is that like it is people like a lot
of people that week especially people
who were new we're like this is kind of
like a call yeah you know cuz everybody
who works there is like kind of
preaching the gospel Ted I interviewed
June Cohen who's Chris Anderson's
right-hand man and she's like speaks
very emphatically and very excitedly
about like the ideas that are gonna be
said at Ted and like you feel like
they're caught up in the excitement of
the almost kind of a religious feeling
change the world we're gonna change the
world
yeah and it is but it is like it is like
a theist cult is how I started thinking
of it and like a like a cult of
questions right like like if and I say
this in the piece if religion is like we
got it we got the
like you want it you want you want to
know what's going on in the universe
like here's the deal then this is like
you want to know what's going on in the
universe like we don't know but here's
some possible ideas like here's some
thoughts on it and you know maybe one
guy says one thing that's like again
we're opposite of the guy to me sounds
like like a weird island nation state
crossed with like the hippie assad's
College of the Northeast yes exactly
it's like it's like and you never leave
and everyone's there yeah College quad
but like with much older people yeah
like a frisbee yeah but there was
like that going on there were people
like there was I saw no no I'm not
kidding I think there I think there's
definitely somebody hockey exactly and
it was like people like meeting and
eating and just moving and there's
coffee everywhere coffee everywhere
there are so many coffees they pour over
coffee like whatever you want like 15
different types of freshly brewed teas
like crazy teas from like the mountains
of China and they're like the people
there are all really no no so I'm like
really thirsty yeah right for it
oh look I'd like to move on I read my
piece it's got insight ed the smartest
bubble in the world oh that's not a
factoid that is a factoid it's not a
fact dumb bubble that would be you know
no offense but the Teletubbies home is
kind of a topic we ran a bunch of weed
it'd we had an Elizabeth spires piece
which I've now told us how her name is
pronounced I've heard many yeah many
variations right but she ran a piece on
on on this kind of weird backlash so
actually I want to talk about I want to
talk about that I don't even tell you
about what it is that's fine there's
something here that I think is very very
interesting something in the room he's
got something good to say Josh say what
the backlash is but I want to go ahead
so
she ran he saw on this backlash about
rumor some IOC of Yahoo saying everybody
has to come in the office and it's
actually very interesting that we ran it
us this site ran it we have now moved
into this office and I'm like watching
our team Cheney very egotistical pointer
Mike okay you just had a baby I just had
a baby I think what is saying in a
roundabout way what me a lie saying is
that it was an interesting it was
interesting that last week we moved into
our new office where we were like hey
everybody come to the office yeah peace
we have a new big office that we want
people to be at and and Yahoo copied us
know I know I haven't been on the
internet but I'm just guessing the
backlash is that she decided to do this
because she's a woman there are like no
the backlash is there's all sorts of
different levels of backlash but there a
lot of it is like the tone is right a
lot about like her being a woman and not
in the very specific kind of woman and
then she there was this interview where
somebody asked her she was a feminist
and she said like that she wasn't and
that's like cause all this hubbub and
there's just like the tone of a lot of
the conversation about her and Sheryl
Sandberg like there's never been a woman
before but in the tone of the
conversation is all very confusing right
so Sheryl Sandberg ER is a CEO of
Facebook put out a book called lean in
which is all about how women should be
how women lead can women lead right and
in her recommendations is Elizabeth
points out our piece are like super
non-controversial it's like women should
be more aggressive should ask for what
they want they should know that there's
pay inequality in America yeah they
should demand to get paid more like it's
not do all of these stuff that if a man
had written the book and said the same
things people would just be either they
would ignore it or they would say right
great
points but when it's but when it's a
woman writing it all of a sudden people
are like how could she yeah how dare are
you so Elizabeth's piece addressed how
both of these women are being judged on
like different criteria than men but the
the Marissa Mayer thing to me is like
yeah it was a broken company like it
doesn't work it's like full of people
who aren't doing anything good yeah it's
not making money they're not innovative
for her to say you all have to come into
the office and we're gonna sit in this
room and like work together to figure
out how to make our company better is
the least controversial thing and I'll
say this and I'll say this the second
that I heard the announcement it seemed
obvious to me having worked at a company
having worked at a company before which
is very wander around dreaming where
where yeah where where where there were
a lot of people who worked there and a
lot of them seemed really incompetent
and like they weren't doing their job
and people would like phone literally
phone it in and also figuratively phone
it in and when you get to a certain size
I think it can be very hard to see who's
like great and who isn't that's it like
despite your evaluations which can
obviously be like yeah you know these
like written evaluations that these big
companies do I think that I do feel that
there is a there is a motivating factor
here and I think we I feel like we wrote
Ben might have written something about I
can't remember when she first made this
announced to get rid of the people it's
like it's really about weaning the
people who aren't great performers but
oh she's trying to figure out and
there's like how could you do this and
the truth is like how could you not the
bedside manner sucks that's the problem
like the truth is like he could have
probably done we'd been done in a more
tactful way so hey wait Luca three
things so first she had to don't just
shut up shut up four three three things
well the first year really fast so she
had two metrics that she used one was
that she has all these remote workers
and she noticed that many of them were
like not even logging in to the VPN
right so she these people are off doing
whatever at home they're not like on
Yahoo's time right second is there's
like a lot there were a lot of people
getting paid by Yahoo I like founded
startups yeah which is like a huge
problem right yeah and rate or great
problem a lot of people doing Bing
searches and a lot of people doing
banging banging and then the third one
which is what Ben was saying was this is
a really great way to essentially do
layoffs without having to wait right
because because you'll find people who
are like I'm not doing this I'm out of
here
or yeah the people won't actually live
up to the requirements and your second
point because I think when you have a
big company you have a lot of deadweight
be also
most of your good ideas are in the
brains of those people who want to do
startups yeah and like you know I worked
at a company called AOL and interns that
we left if I had an idea for a startup
you know what I would I could not have
done is had that idea implemented at my
company if I had an idea for start-up I
would have to quit my job and go make
that company right cuz it and and what
you want is you want smart people to do
a start-up inside of your business I
mean that's what I write Google and
there have been a lot of ideas that I
really liked at Yahoo that haven't ever
like you know Yahoo essentially should
be Instagram right now if they done
Flickr well you know right well I mean
this is like a corporate culture thing
like it's hard to break off it's easy to
say yeah this thing like Flickr is like
all-encompassing I mean just do not get
in the weeds on that but it gets a
little bit hard to say like they have a
lot of great products and they've had a
lot of great ideas and they always die
because they don't quite go all the way
through with them right I haven't seen
any good ideas for a while but like I
remember like three or four or five
years ago a lot of cool stuff would come
out of Yahoo and they'll be honestly I
think there is something on the internet
that that I'm sorry I was it'd be a
little I just wanna like take a break on
that point for just one quick second I
do think that like people who are native
to the internet and use the Internet
have a tendency and a desire to move
away from old products that have been
improved upon and I don't think they
have any allegiance to those products
beyond their utility it's almost
something that in their lives and anti
legions because you can't understand
that the old thing could do it right I
mean I mean at the end of the day like
people who are like in love with
technology in the internet who use it or
maybe not even a lot with it but use it
need it there their goals are like
they're beholden to like I think for the
most part finding like the best tool do
the things they want them to do and if
they think it's one if it's like and
there's so much competition and so many
new things on the internet all the time
that if there's one thing that you don't
like about the old thing you're just
gonna go like I'm gonna use the new
thing like repairs
you know like especially if it's free
mm-hmm you know Yahoo is free to use
like if something free comes along and
it's better you're like I'm just gonna
do that
that's how Google's wit that's how they
one search you know that's how chrome is
that's why I'm using Chrome right now
and that's and it's just Google products
all sorts of things that's the iPhone
nobody was like I'm never giving up this
Palm Pilot they're like oh that's better
Thanks I'm gonna go to there is there is
an aspect of I mean if you if you look
at how Silicon Valley works if you are
people with ideas and those people so if
they have a good enough idea and it
looks like they can implement it they
get millions of dollars from some way to
finish that point they get millions of
dollars from somebody and they create
that product and if in and I think there
should be erotically
there should be a way to be inside of a
big company have a great idea looks like
you can execute it you get millions of
dollars from your big company called
Yahoo yeah you launch it unbranded or
branded yeah and it's a good idea and
then people will you incentivize people
I know I think it's actually I think
it's a really cool idea I mean I don't
know if from a businessman why you
actually were using incentivizing we're
using Google hangout right now which was
developed in a sub incentivizing your
employees and giving them ownership of
the things they make and thinking like
you can add value to the company that
you work for and also like line your
pocketbooks had become like an
entrepreneur in some way is a really
awesome idea I just don't know if like
logically that makes any sense right
that's why people are like I'm outta
here to start my own call so people
create great things inside of Google
Google and they do and I think Google
has a is a is a much newer company right
and they are much better at incubation
up to the surface
we know there's actually a we ran a
second piece o generally which is very
interesting but what actually happens in
these companies is that these founders
leave they build their businesses and
then they Akwa hire back because that's
how that's how the cycle actually works
right right you leave Apple you build a
company and then yeah but but maybe
there's a mom maybe a job maybe there is
Yahoo wants to have any chance and with
it becoming a gut it's all about
mitigating risk for good company so you
say go here's you know go start a
company if it's any go by
yeah but but maybe there's a smarter way
to do it I would just say yes that's how
it works
but even but Yahoo's chosen but Yahoo's
sucking and maybe there's a smarter way
to do so maybe so I hate for me like I'm
kind of like a baby
I don't know I'm kind of like a loyal
list type of person like to be honest
like if if if I had felt like AOL if I'd
had an idea and someone would allow me
to build it into a product I would have
been interested in that you know like
there's I like the idea of working for a
company and being a part of a company
and building a company I think that's
cool too
nice little hat you got there I was
popping a little bit yeah I it was I spy
so let's talk about it it'd be better
building this fantasy world of big
companies investing in people that way
because what the market is chosen is to
mitigate risk we're letting you go start
a startup and buy your company if it's
good and that's how big companies and
that's why you spend a billion dollars
on Instagram and that's why that's where
I Instagram right if this program hadn't
worked it would have cost Facebook five
million dollars in experimentation yeah
but but they couldn't oh right but I
mean so there are really two paths right
there's like the path to so I want to
just stop I want to when I get back to
our actual I'm really thirsty do you
gonna leave
I know it's not your job but I tried to
drop a hint earlier but I'm so thirsty
he did try to drop a hint you were okay
let's get back to the place dude please
I think there's something collected in
both of these thirsty for debate so
weird that's okay go ahead both of these
pieces are the reaction to them from our
readers and from the world reflected
something that I think you just brought
up which is if you have a good idea the
tech community will just give you
millions of dollars right that's an idea
and you have the ability to EXCI with
that that
fine but those those are all like
objective criteria but we ran another
piece this week which is all about how
female founders or companies have to
fight harder to get venture capital yeah
male founders I wonder what a structural
problem yeah because it's because it's
like a bunch of it's an old one old
white men yeah Ronnie and they have they
have control that's the people that they
feel I'm inai I mean this is not some
you know not that and then I think
that's even further amplified by the
internet which allows a bunch you know
our we know the demographics i graph our
site is like wealthier 18 to 35 year old
men right that's like the core hand with
them very handsome and cavity and it's
growing a is growing but that's like
that's the big trunk in the middle yeah
and for those demographics are real and
that means one type of site what I've
read it attracts one kind of person
first for them to say if you come on to
Reddit and your ideas are good we'll
support you is like completely ignorant
of the structural reality the brevity of
the which is thousands of years of
subjugation of minorities and women by
right essentially and so you man I doubt
I don't see color or gender in this
space right but that space is a
reflection of reality no no no I read
her ready read it sees color and gender
but even though they insist that they
don't know about the nature of humanity
which is they see I think it's about
actually the nature of discussion on the
Internet well there is Dom there is this
like we're colorblind
yeah you know I know right exactly and
it's like yeah but you're still on the
PlayBook of a structure that was built
thousands of years before you came into
typically with the least nicknames on
reddit you can typically tell if it's a
girl
violin takers was a guy just kidding all
I'm saying is I actually do you think an
idea from anybody on reddit can do
pretty well that's fine but like read
it's a bad example right it is a lazy
it's like a forum I wasn't like right
journal is a very different thing
starting it because you miss
having a go here yeah I think I think
it's all it's it's yeah but but in a and
you don't solve the big problem without
the people for edits the without the
community right it's the least nobody
it's it's it's a spectrum right it's
it's a gradient of behaviors it's you
can say with the reaction to our piece
about the big problems yeah
from people on the internet was why do
these problems exist I don't even see
them your action to why were there no
women at the Sony event was you know a
thousand comments on our site that were
well maybe there are no women qualified
enough to do the job you know I'm in
computer science class and that's crazy
combination at the Sony event piece the
what was the event well they were okay
so I needed ps4 the ps4 event right and
there were they probably had people they
probably had how many people in stock
1918 from a variety of from from does
like a dozen companies not just Sony
people I would get if like Sony just
happened to not have any females in
those positions they wanted to put on
stage I get it but like not one company
had one woman yeah that could speak
about their product on stage of the
event like it just seems really weird ya
know and and and and by the way people
are like you don't have any women on the
version has like the verge cast is like
a show it's like there's no women and in
poison like a poisons a band they
started the band it's like four guys and
like they're poison right the verge cast
is us for the most part like we do have
and we do it we do have we had agreement
on the merge cast you know we try to
keep it this group of three sometimes
we're trying to keep women down we try
to keep women down but the point is it's
like a we're like a band you know we are
but I don't think so I think we're
curved am I happy with the amount of
women we have in in in you know roles
here in senior roles or whatever it no
am I happy with the amount of minorities
that we have I mean you know we have
Neil I and then that's very much it like
you know we're not we're not perfect and
we're also working against thousands of
years of like the structure of society
right but but I think no one's perfect
but I think the first step is saying
like yeah you know we can be better
saying like but what's the problem it's
a meritocracy everywhere look
the internet only thing worse than what
you're describing of the Sony event yeah
I didn't see forcing women on stage is
is that because I have seen the Harry
and a lot of of gaming announcements at
Microsoft and Sony have done we're like
here's our our token woman right who
enjoys fit fitness apps and no andreen
is just as bad as I think it's
definitely worse and I would definitely
I'd rather have a reflection my favorite
thing at the gaming at gaming
announcement things whatever you call
keynotes gaming keynotes and I've been
to a lot is when the guy who is the
number one guy at that company or that
are building that game the guy or woman
but it's typically a guy who's heading
that project walks out on stage and
plays his game that means a lot to me
and so I wouldn't want a woman trust
them to that role and so if the only
games the question is not about them
it's not about how you put out on stage
the the bigger question and the
fundamental question is how are we being
are we building industries new
industries that are as open and
welcoming to women and minorities as
they should be I think people on the
internet keep going of course you're on
the internet it doesn't matter like it's
all equal everybody's the same
and like the actual thing that's
happening in like the boardrooms and
like the the the offices of the world
that are actually where these companies
are happening is the is the old-school
stuff that's been going on for 500 years
or longer or whatever then we have a bad
disconnect because you go like I want
and you're like nothing's wrong it's
like there's a war going on and you're
like I can't see the war so there's also
and I will say this this idea of the
enforced meritocracy of the Internet is
is flawed from conception because if you
say you come on the internet you have a
good idea you win it's who is the judge
who's saying that requires ideas and it
requires more than just a good idea it
requires a lot of really hard work like
you don't write you know the Internet is
just a is a slightly different version
of life which is yeah you have more you
have I think you do have more
opportunities if you have an idea to
that idea heard and to make something
out of it but it doesn't mean that if
you have a good idea that you are that
you are going to make something out of
it that people are going to care it just
means that you have an opportunity I
will agree I'm sorry I'm stuck I and I'm
sorry because I haven't been part of
this larger discussion that happened on
the internet play and wait and I page of
the New York Times in the Wall Street
Journal yeah it's this is like a panning
out what anyhow be your pull it to your
point your point the the I I literally
do not I I will totally agree that there
are way less women in the video game
industry then then there should be maybe
and that I would like to see and even
could be but I do really do not see any
systemic of effort or or or reason why
they can't be well I think the there is
no there is no I think that I think all
right on its face on on its face yeah
it's probably true but the I mean we're
getting into like territory which is
like the structure of business and let's
just say let's take America for a moment
but if this is all over the world the
structure of businesses in the world and
in America and the ways that we have
learned to interact have I mean there
are deep reasons why like women are paid
less but the man in the same position
the game why it's harder for women to
get into those and also like in terms of
our education the types of ways that we
push people into what types of
industries we push them into
dramatically I and what is like an open
and accepting industry for women to feel
that they can go into versus one that
men feel comfortable guidance it's just
the way most men don't want to go into
the industry of fashion I'm sure most
men you know don't think of that's an
open welcoming industry that they can be
part of right and be an you know like
there's this there's no like a bunch of
guys in fashion but yes okay live in New
York like you're a weird guy so you know
people in fashion but the typical like
out in the in the Midwest people aren't
like I really want to go into fashion
like for men that's not a job that seems
like a job for them just like many jobs
are
historically we were like pushing people
towards these things because it's like
kind of other structure of society which
is like fundamentally unfair but two
groups I do think there's something so I
can't speak to all that were in like the
edge we're in dangerous territory I
don't think we're in danger we're saying
really obviously I can't speak to the
education side of you know what people
push towards I can't speak to larger
corporate structures because I don't
understand the right but I will say as a
you know especially knowing a gamer
community and the gaming industry is
relatively young and you see you may
have people kind of creating can I pause
okay I think you have people creating
just relatively new companies that are
that they can kind of form in their own
way and you know totally companies like
valve I mean this is a very new joshan a
lot of how many women they're at an
executive level how many women are there
I mean there are women hired like
there's a breakdown but I I'm just
saying there's you can create a woman
but the societal woman and you show up
for that I don't yes you have a real
time right they know you are absolutely
100% wrong it's because you're you don't
know what's been going on right and i
thats well it's like I'm now I'm like
frustrated with it because there's like
an entire set of like tweets and
articles as hashtag one reason why which
is just women in a games industry
complaining and noting the problem I to
make games we put in I think what I
think but I think what he's saying the
only thing that well but suppose like
the opportunity to have a new company
that thinks differently is there because
we're creating these new industries but
the reality is that there are like the
game's layers not a new societal issues
that are causing like companies to be
formed using the same bad broken tactics
that we've been using for like forever
in business which is like a suck which
but bullets just does subjugate women
and minorities basically like whether we
like it or not right and I'm what I'm
saying is like it's great you know I
don't think that people go into
interviews at ei
wherever in like there's like a oh your
woman get out of here I think that
there's a real tendency to say I think
this is why you know Nvidia Nvidia at
CES perfect example they're their
keynote with the girl with the with that
you don't remember I was PTA Jen son had
had this girl come out and he's like
take a picture with me and I'm gonna
take my jacket off and she was like he's
like you're a gamer right and it was
like this totally awful and ends like
just that that is even exist that
there's that even though they're like
gross sexism so human but that but that
that speaks to us I should walk this
back with that is very the dad overt
sexism speaks to a much more subtle
underlying sexism that just kind of in
facts why you shaking your head at me
right now okay they just they just kind
of why because it's not that we're
discussing it yeah I thoroughly enjoy
yeah you seem I seem very upset about
I'm very upset because it's it's your
said appalled I guess a part of this
I've missed that discussion I'm very
naive on this I just the most of the
gamer culture that I see and I
participate in seems very welcoming and
very overly I think of the gamers I
actually let me put it to you I see
sometimes in gaming to be honest I see a
more in an inclusive community that is
more rapidly welcoming of somebody who
might get the best I think you're
looking I think you are you looking at
the best of the best and I think I think
you are online gaming is a average craft
world that built a shrine to you I
participate in all sorts of I think I
think if you asked if you ask my wife
like what what is it like playing xbox
right she would say in a year old racist
screams no no I mean and that's the
market I dance dolls no but I think Paul
and I'm not trying to defend him you
know that we're attacking him but to
this point I think Paul is is and I
think that it gives you a bad
perspective on this you are not an
aggressive hardcore gamer there's types
of games that you like that are a little
bit more indie a little bit more weird
and I think you're exposed to a part of
the industry that is more progressive
at least in terms of its demo right you
know what I mean like there are a lot of
there are a lot of female players of
World of Warcraft like we know that and
I think that that is a more inclusive
demographic but it doesn't it does not
reflect in the industry that is making
World of Warcraft I think that's the
problem like the there are female
players and female developers and there
are women who do these things it's just
not truly reflective of the industry
right I think there and that's that's
the problem no and in games are big
business with a lot of money and
technology's a big business with a lot
of money and that amount of money just
attracts assholes yeah so like you might
also just you might believe is we are
rolling off of a model that's an old
model I mean right building business is
why for example we're sending a lot of
people at South by Southwest this and I
went last year and I couldn't stand it
because it was such a in its core you
know South by is supposed to be a it's
supposed to be Ted writes for ideas
everybody's here they're happy that's it
let's go to a bunch of nobody's happy
the celebration of the of the tech
community startup and I walked around
basically meeting a much people dudes on
the startup bus yeah right which is like
which is and they all thought they're
gonna get rich and look read I mean I
have to say like read you know when Kara
Swisher writes about you know the pig
pile of Silicon Valley yeah you know
she's talking about an old boys club
she's talking about the the like almost
literally is the room with the guys
smoking cigars and no women allowed like
that's a real thing and it's how do I
get to this room yeah invite where they
drinkin can I have some brandy but
anyhow but look even that kind of joke
is so sexist we're horrible sexist and I
feel terrible the truth is like we are
not as advanced as we'd like to be let's
let's put it that way the tech industry
thinks it's a lot more advanced than it
is and that's the problem I think the
problem is everybody in this in
congratulating us we're right going like
I'm color blind I'm blind to gender like
I don't care about this stuff but like
actually in your actions and the
statistics don't even come close to
reflecting that and so that's a problem
I think like being aware of it being
aware of it is how you start to like fix
it right you say like is there a problem
not being as inclusive as we can be can
we find ways to involve more people
different kinds of people in this
because like they can bring something
new and exciting to it and we're
ignoring that because we're working off
of an old like playbook right I think
that's the start and then you know I
don't think there's like you need
there's not like affirmative action in
the tech industry like that you need to
like force people into jobs just think
you need to recognize it like we're not
as it we're not as like socially
sophisticated as like the tech industry
wants to be like you want to be this
colorblind like everybody wants to say
like we're colorblind we're gender blind
let's just do this thing all together
let's hold hands and jump into this
exciting new abyss of Technology but the
truth is like we're working off play
books that are like you know the oil
tycoons working on the same place I'll
just say I'm I'm optimistic because the
gamer community I see the people are
creating the indie games right now and
the people who are going to be leading
the industry in the future seem to be a
lot of pretty great interesting people
and I think we do have an opportunity
this does this industry does have an
opportunity to fix a lot of what has
been broken for a long time in in this
equality yeah conversation although I
will say they are they need to think
about it for us to do it beyond the twos
on stage criticism on ps4 event which is
our surface yeah but our biggest like
context or content criticism was all
these games look like shooters they are
driving game and honestly like you know
what if we have a lot higher the same
guys to make your game yeah are the same
types of guys to make your games
you're only gonna end up I like it I
like a game where you literally autosave
it but they are there like year you know
the government surveillance or whatever
you know that's that's we're now a hard
right turn yeah that's where the money
is but at the same time at the same time
Sony promotes the has in house some of
the best most artistic interesting
developers as well probably they were a
lot to do things other than make
Killzone 30 I mean III mean I mean
journey red flower yeah there's a huge
gulf between I just want to say like
getting more specifically little babes
play on that but there's a sort of
extreme there's a you go
these like whimsical cartoon games and
like games about real things like you
know and when you look at their room but
look look at movies you know there are
movies that are serious adult movies
they're about human drama there
sometimes they're violent sometimes
they're romantic sometimes they're about
a mystery there like all these wild
places that movies go
you know sometimes they're very meta
like their commentary social commentary
so like all of these things in games
like really and then there's like also
cartoon movies there's like
wreckit-ralph and there's you know all
these different types of car challenges
has exclusively that whatever that Ellen
Page game yeah but the Ellen Page game
at the end of the day it's like you're a
girl you're gonna use superpowers you've
got to kill these copper but it's like
if you're gonna compare Sony and
Microsoft sodas way further I'm saying
just taste terms you know not way
further a little bit further just take
the games what is it all what does
Microsoft have this is what let me just
see the pinata stop can I can I stop
this one I'm just saying that there are
like there's a whole Gulf of like places
the games don't go Sony micro every I
evaluate and like and we're safe and
like what we really need I think what we
really want is more people more
diversity more ideas like I don't care
where they even come from like just
let's like be accepting of them this is
a totally different topic God we're so
off topic and I have to go because I
actually like meeting in two minutes
very much whoa bother blow everything
she's getting is his facial implant I'm
getting I'm finally getting the if I'm
gonna get the ability Josh has Google
Google the last two play-doh which is
gonna go go can we talk about it yeah
you we didn't talk about last week on
the rich cast because you did a big
feature then you weren't around Google
glass oh yeah never-ending series of
watch rumors from every company yeah
like two minutes and then I have to go
for what so like um it's like not that
jarring I think people like to have make
this assumption that when you're wearing
it it somehow creates them like head
like overlay on your vision your field
of vision it's just like you're using it
and there's a little thing up here and
if you look up you see it and if you
don't look up
glass cube do you like perceive that
cube really class no ecstasy no not
really
you know once it's on you're not
thinking about any member so yeah I mean
like in my memory of the experience of
using I wasn't like things hanging over
my eye it didn't feel like that you know
it's there yeah but it doesn't feel it's
like wearing glasses like I see the rim
of my glasses right now right and maybe
I'm less sensitive to because I wear
glasses all the time
but I see my glasses all the time like
over here like there's my glasses like
yeah they are there right there so it
was a lot it's a lot like that yeah
except it also shows stuff in your field
of vision right and it's just this thing
this little information
it's cube yeah and it's like it's here's
the thing I probably wouldn't wear
Google glass yeah in its current form
unless and I was in very specific
situations like dire straits if I was
playing jamming with dire straits yeah
maybe the tab I need to make sure I
could see the notes of money for nothing
ya know in certain situations I kept
doing something crazy or like taking a
roller coaster or I don't know like
there if I had kids maybe we're like
video for the road to video and pictures
and stuff like there are times like I'm
looking at my dog and I'm like man I
wish I can take a picture this right now
like a biast is that but primary
application on camera I think it's it's
no I think that it's the camera's a big
piece but I think also this kind of a
non-intrusive
message notifications not intrusive like
you get a text message in here like that
instead of going like that I think
that's a big deal for them would you
rather go like that or like that for
people listening would you would you
rather look at a watch or out of
distraction you know I think taking your
phone out unlocking it and like looking
at the thing is a huge distraction also
like physically disruptive to what
you're doing I think this is less
distracting but also so much is looking
at a watch me looking at watches you
know it's not that hard I do it all the
time sure but is it as easy as doing
this
you know it's not so here's the thing at
the end of the day like there are the
big things the big questions are like
they look goofy right people are like
they look goofy but if they don't look
good if you then I think let's just say
they're gonna be there was did you have
to refocus on the thing yeah it kind of
is like it's off its faucets it feels
like feels like it's like you're
focusing on how do you do you wear
glasses how does that work for you my
prescriptions not super strong okay but
they're where in lieu of glasses well
they're working on a version that can
take so they have a thing that I put on
these sunglasses that kind of like twist
and they snap into the frame okay and so
what they're doing is that they're
working on making versions of that for
prescription lenses so you can get a
prescription lens for it and stick it in
your the holy grails to integrate it
right into the holy grail is like I go
to buy these glasses like you want that
with Google glass or without what it'll
be an extra thousand dollars or whatever
the price five hundred dollars five
thousand people gasp I'd be like that's
awesome because they have you don't
worry about it because I don't have to
worry about if I want to use it I can
use it like would you not want some
extra help like if you're walking around
I don't want to get your eyes and
glasses and swatch their right and what
are the coolest very romantical one of
the cool side ever do use you know but
you know I could never tell the color of
people's eyes like bluish green bluish
gray brown really I have no idea scream
what colors would your blue eyes know
they're like I grew up and I blue eye
they look good smoke here they're like a
smoky blue yeah Josh what color eyes
they're like greenish one of them looks
different colors you look like a snake
all just said and I quote you look like
a snake I'm terrified by the way Chinese
astrological sign snake year of the
snake you look like The Witcher all
right it's time to close this anyhow
that's the verge cast of this week I'm
sorry if you'd like to get I get
turn-by-turn directions yes well that's
nuts gonna say is the coolest thing is
like you get at yeah the Train you're
walking around you're like how do I get
to there turn my turn right here like
you're does the only thing I'm worried
about is like whether you have to
refocus your eyes it's not it's not like
a crazy because like it's like I'm
looking at you and
looking at the wall and back it's like
not it's not even that much problem you
know what emerge get just a little
feature request yeah I would kind of
like if you had Google glass and it was
in your actual glasses if it would I
think Google glass needs some outward
focused aspects to let people know
Google glass is doing things I think it
needs a record light shows you can see
the light on but it's very subtle I
think a red light would be probably yeah
a red light because I think it's really
rude right well that's it I was gonna
say the other big thing is like are they
cool but then the other question is like
privacy that's really different the
other thing and I went in and I went out
our box and filmed and nobody said
anything if if you have what you look
like the Terminator I was like if you
say something to me I will blow your
head off but also like if you have
glasses it'd be cool if you have turned
my turn I'd almost want the arrows to
show up your vision yeah just ask I want
to see if you're looking at something
else other than the ultimate the ultimat
yeah okay that's yeah I you know okay if
you can have a little like LED thing
that says like using turn-by-turn like a
little scroll a big okay that's average
