miller and this is 90 seconds on the
verge epic 4g touch ultra HD LTE hyper
turbo remix edition version 2.1 epple
sold over 5 million iphone 5s in its
first weekend that's 1 million more than
the 4s sold at its launch last year but
the year-over-year growth doesn't look
quite as impressive several early
adopters are reporting seeing scuffs and
scratches out of the box if you happen
to be one of those unlucky iphone 5
owners go ahead and go to the apple
store and try to return it for an
exchange jellybean is now coming to the
galaxy s3 I'll be it slowly Poland is
the first market to receive the Android
4.1 upgrade other markets are being
gradually rolled out later the company
is also committed to bringing Android
4.1 2 15 other models including last
year's galaxy s2 and galaxy note 1 the
timing of all the updates of course
depends on location and carrier just be
sure to director blame accordingly
finally another Facebook privacy scare a
news story first posted by Metro France
alleges that private messages sent in
two thousand eight and two thousand nine
or now publicly viewable on some users
timelines facebook says it has gone back
and checked on every reported error and
so far has found no proof of private
messages being exposed the company
instead points to a change in behavior
back when friends group for smaller and
you couldn't comment on specific wall
posts an entirely unrelated note myspace
today is teasing a new design the timing
could not be better and that's it for
today's top stories tune in tomorrow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
