food
it's what sustains us it comes from the
earth it comes from the seas now it
comes from science
this is Soylent a scientific looking
amalgam of protein flour vitamins and
minerals that first made waves is a
crowd-funded project last year a project
whose goal was to straight-up replace
food yes all of it
technically Soylent is food just not any
kind that you're used to eating on a
regular basis it's supposed to give you
pretty much everything you need to
survive and nothing else there's no joy
to Soylent only purpose it's just cheap
nutritious liquid that dispenses with
the entertainment and social aspect of
eating and gets down to business
subsisting on Soylent cost less than $10
a day here in New York ten dollars is
good for a couple packs of gum so full
day's worth of calories for that amount
of cash is actually a really good deal
and if you're in a time crunch it just
takes a few gulps to put a meal down of
course the first step to eating Soylent
is getting it and right now that's very
hard it turns out that the promise of a
mega efficient no-frills diet has a lot
of people buzzing and the hype has left
the company with a backlog that runs
several months long you can make your
own Soylent or some variation of it if
you're enterprising enough to dig up and
deal with the mess of the ingredients
they offer a whole DIY site with forums
in fact but that defeats the purpose of
saving time with ultra efficient
nutrition in the first place
anyway once you dig up some soil in the
next challenge is making it the product
ships to you in individual packets one
per day seven per box
the company also ships customer is a
2-liter pitcher and a metal measuring
scoop the pitcher is key in fact you
don't need the scoop at all unless you
want to futz around with making
individual servings but you're better
off just dumping an entire packet into
the pitcher and filling it up to the top
with water you have to be careful here
because the act of dumping the bag into
the pitcher causes little plume of
Soylent powder to form the company also
ships matching bottles of a fish oil
canola oil blend that looks a bit like
those little bottles of shampoo you get
in hotel rooms you're looking at a full
day's worth of everything that has to go
into your body to keep it running or so
Soylent says 2010 calories of beige
liquid
once you clean up the mess you shake the
picture for 30 seconds
I found that shaking usually opened up
some air bubbles in the powder which
means you have to add a bit more water
as you go when you're done you stick it
in the fridge let it sit overnight so it
gets smooth and you're ready to have all
your biological requirements met with
just a few sips you just have to get
that whole pitcher down by the time you
go to sleep now the moment of truth the
drink since soil it first made headlines
you've probably read some pretty
disgusting descriptions of what this
stuff tastes like don't believe them
it's not bad it's certainly not
delicious but it's not going to make you
gag the best way I can describe it is
like if you took a few spoonfuls of
peanut butter in a blender with a lot of
milk it has some richness and creaminess
to it and just the tiniest hint of
sweetness
it tastes like sustenance I drink so
England for a full month and let me tell
you it gets boring it's doable like I
said it's not gross but there's a social
aspect of eating and drinking that
Soylent simply isn't built to provide
fortunately if the experiment was pretty
painless apart from some occasional
digestive discomfort
I felt healthy the entire time and I
never really felt hungry there's a ton
of protein in Soylent so I guess that's
no surprise over the course of the month
I lost somewhere around 12 pounds but my
usage was a little extreme the company
says they don't imagine most people use
it as a 100% meal replacement the way I
did they see it as a convenience thing a
breakfast here a lunch there and when
you want to eat real food you go ahead
and do it in that regard Soylent isn't
all that revolutionary you can walk into
your local grocery store right now and
find an entire aisle of meal replacement
bars and shakes but Soylent seems to be
both cheaper and more nutritionally
complete than most of them would I do
another 30 days stint on it absolutely
not but could I see myself drinking it
here and there
and Italy assuming I'm ever able to work
my way through the waiting list</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
