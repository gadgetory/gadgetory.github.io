with dave ondal who is the co-founder of
central standard time very cool e-ink
watch the CST one hi Dave thanks for
coming to talk with us today yeah thank
you um so tell me where did the where
did the idea for this for this watch
come from well I've been a been working
on it for shut up I've been working on
the csto one for about a year now and
I've been I worked a lot with e ink on a
lot of the other work that I do I work
at a design consulting firm called the I
do and so I came across their technology
which is this thin flexible yank display
that's segmented and I was always drawn
to it because because it's segmented you
can it's super robust super low power
and it's flexible what does that mean
segment segment instead of pixel based
so we designed a series of segments so
kind of like a seven segment display
would hold if you look at old digital
watches they have the 7-segment it looks
like a figure eight we made our own
version of something like that for this
but that allows us to render the numbers
a lot better and so if you design the
segments properly then you can have this
really thin really flexible super low
power display and we always thought that
there could be a really cool product out
there that then used something like this
on in kind of a fashion type object so
so when was that when you were first
thinking of me I was like do you
remember how training for January in
2009
we worked on a project with bug labs and
we came up with a concept to have a thin
flexible display on the side of their
their bug let their bug base unit and we
designed a segmented font for that and
my buddy nix and Betty my partner Jerry
O'Leary the other co-founder we all
worked together and we develop develop
the spot for that and I always wanted to
use that font so we that kind of was the
genesis of this where it was in the back
of my mind since 2009 and then when the
i found this microcontroller from epson
that had everything i needed in it for a
watch that also had an e-ink driver I
saw that press release and I kind of
thought all right well it's time to
start working on this now and what made
you like think watch like you know
watches aren't like in 2009 especially
like people aren't thinking what is like
a cool thing I think people were kind of
thinking and watches we're gonna you
know kind of fade away yeah um the way
that we got to watch was the the font
needed to be in order for the font to
work it needed to be fairly large so in
the one we created was alphanumeric and
so I wanted to have so it need to be
about this big in order for the the font
to work with the display and I was just
thinking through different things that
we could use for this for and I thought
it would be really cool to do a word
clock so when it was off your wrists and
and on the table it would say you know
like 1230 and letters and then when you
put on your wrist then it would change
so that was where it came from and then
as we got into the constraints of the of
the project we found that it would be
better to just focus on the time and
just think about the minim like the most
minimal expression of the watch right I
think it works and so you put it on
Kickstarter yesterday yesterday and how
much money have you raised on
Kickstarter say just over 130,000 in
ours would that be we launched at five
o'clock yesterday so and it's now
109 okay so that's pretty incredible
yeah what made you decide to put the
project on Kickstarter um well we we've
got minimum manufacturing volumes I
always I designed it and worked on it
because I wanted to see it made and
we've got minimum volumes that we have
to hit so the best way that we found to
do it with where we're at is to to
launch it on Kickstarter and get backers
and did you expect it to what did you
expect well honey I mean I hoped that it
would that it would get funded soon but
I didn't expect it to be as quick as it
is now um so the big innovations here
there's like a micro cell battery that's
very thing can you talk about that alone
yeah it's a the company is called 'the
energy and they make a product called
micro energy cell and what's really
great about it is that a lot of
conventional batteries will after a few
years are not going to be very good
anymore and they won't hold a charge and
that would be bad for this because it's
not replaceable so you're watching it
would be dead but the synergy will last
at least 15 years maybe even more and
it's it's a much more robust reliable
battery under flexing than than thin
lithium polymer batteries right so we've
we've actually built a rig where we had
this flexing for a thousand over a
thousand times more than this all the
way to flat in it and it was still doing
fine this rig tell me about this rig
this is back in Chicago good what is
that the rig actually just goes like
this well that's not only was itself but
in the we glue a battery to a piece of
stainless steel a thinner piece and it
just rolls it and then on rolls it rolls
it unrolls it
just and then I'll do that for a certain
amount of time and then I'll test the
battery see if the battery still
performing huh and you actually built
that thing right yeah what is your shop
look like in Chicago it's a so my work I
work at I do and though I work in the
Chicago the office of I do yeah we've
got a nice workshop and a little
electronics lab that I just took a serve
a servo off the shelf and connected to
an arduino board and built a little
rigged or actually I didn't sorry a
colleague of mine Gary he's working with
us built the rig for us and did the
arduino things I gotta give him credit
for that that's cool um so originally
you said this was developed for bug labs
and you guys are still working at I do
yes what are they supportive of you
having the side project yes ideas a very
supportive they want to see people
following their passions and they want
to keep people happy and if you if
you're a designer you're always coming
up with with ideas and if you weren't
able to follow them then it would be a
frustrating yeah and they probably all
want some of these watches yeah there
are a lot of backers an idea already
uh-huh and mine turned black I think
does that mean it's sorry mine turned
black I think or was that the way yeah
it flashes when it updates the time
right so when you're looking at it looks
like it's just static but and then
you're kind of surprised every time it
changes to the to the next minute so if
you want to demonstrate it to somebody
for the first time you you might have to
wait 60 seconds hmm but it's definitely
very cool looking um so there's a patent
pending on this device yes we've we
filed a design patent in a provisional
patent for flexible a watch of this
nature mm-hmm and I've heard a couple
people say it kind of reminds them of
slap bracelet yeah you guys hit them
before yeah I mean that's a that's
something that it's it is very similar
width thickness as a slap bracelet but
we didn't want to go for something that
was kind of novelty like that what's
right more of a nicer object than that
awesome well it looks great and super
simple minimal product that is it's
definitely getting a lot of attention
and excitement here at CES and so thanks
from so much for coming on to talk about
it okay and one thing that I wanted a
bunch of people in the Kickstarter said
that nobody nobody actually shows the
thinness of it so I wanted to do that
take this time on the camera so it is
thin yes that's the thickness of the
watch itself so all right great thanks
so much okay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
