of course a little bit bigger than the
nine point seven inch iPad pro but due
to the bezel size the screen is 20%
larger but the more interesting thing
about it other productivity features
that you get with iOS 11 and iPad pro so
let's check those out first thing you're
going to notice is that there is a dot
just like you would have on Mac this is
a new way to basically get to your apps
you can tap on something in the dot
opens the app and then if you swipe up
select another app drag it and get you
to your multitasking mode close it just
by going like that you can either press
the home button to go back to the home
screen or if you're in an app you can do
this kind of four finger swipe up it's
taken me a few tries there we go
to get to all of your your apps these
are your recently opened apps down here
these are other ones that you might
probably use these are all Apple apps so
that's probably the most notable new
thing about the iPad there is the dots
on it now another thing that you can do
now on iPad that you couldn't do before
is you can drag and drop apps so you can
move them on to the dock you'll notice
that the little X didn't appear because
you're not deleting an app you're just
moving it so you can do that you grab
another one would off of the dock you
can also do dragging and dropping from
within an application to another so for
example you could open and see here like
a Wikipedia page right
you can start an email and then you can
select like a hyperlink and drag it over
like that or select a block of text copy
it
well let's not dragging and dropping
idle but you can do this take a picture
you do this a lot of people are talking
about files which is kind of a new
management system for files on iOS it's
where all of your files will go by
default on your iPad and you can do
drag-and-drop here too this is kind of
interesting if you select one that you
want to drag into another third-party
app and then you just tap others it
automatically adds them to your
selection you can put them somewhere
else
basically third party app developers now
have access to a set of API is that will
let them build an extension into this
files app so you can use other cloud
storage services over here and then
because this is an iPad pro of course
people want to know what's new with
tencel what can you do with pencil this
is kind of interesting
so you open notes and you press down on
pencil here in between some sort of text
you get this block here where you can
start writing and let's say I were to
write the verge she might have heard of
then if I were to close notes and I were
to go to spotlight search and look for
the verge it might take a while to index
but you can see here my note actually
just came up so it's doing handwriting
recognition now for spotlight search in
a way that it didn't do before
yeah you see their mind is press down on
that that's weird
okay obviously this is data still seems
to work out so this is the new 10.5 inch
iPad pro there's now 12 point 9 inch
iPad pro 10.5 inch this goes on sale
today which is Monday it starts shipping
next week it starts at six hundred and
twenty nine dollars for a 64 gigabyte
model and then it goes up from there
it's also available with cellular
service so more information check out
the verge com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
