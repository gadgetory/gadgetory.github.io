the gadgets I use on a daily basis they
are the ones that make me most feel like
I'm living in the near future that may
sound like hyperbole but putting on
headphones and having music pump
directly into my ears without any wires
getting in the way is just fantastic
it's the freedom and convenience of
wireless headphones that draws me and
countless others to them there are lots
of wireless headphones out there but for
this guide we focus on the on ear and
over ear styles the best wireless
headphones do four things they connect
your phone reliably they're comfortable
to wear for a long period of time
they're compact enough that you can
shove them in most any bag and most
importantly they sound nearly as good as
wired headphones they also should last a
long time between charges nobody wants
to have to charge their headphones as
often as they charge your smartphone out
of all the headphones that we tested one
model stood out from the rest the
Sennheiser mm 550 X the mm 550 X satisfy
all the things we're looking for in
wireless headphones gave a strong
Bluetooth connection they're comfortable
to wear for a long time they fold up
into a really compact shape and slip
into your bag and they have a great
balance sound that doesn't favor too
much bass or too much trouble the MM 550
X have active noise cancellation
built-in media controls the option to
use them wired if you're on a plane and
a battery that's rated for 20 hours of
use I was able to go multiple days of
wearing them on a long commute without
having to recharge them in between the
MM 550 X also offer the option to swap
the battery for spare when it dies which
no other brand of headphones we looked
at provided but as you may have noticed
the MM 550 X aren't really the best
looking headphones and they kind of look
goofy on your head they can also be
difficult to pair to your device the
first time you use them but fortunately
you only have to do that once the MM 550
X are also expensive sitting at the top
of the field in the headphones we tested
but a sound comfort and performance are
what you're looking for in a wireless
headphone the MM 550 X can't really be
but if they're too expensive for your
tastes and you're not a fan of their
retro done wrong aesthetic you should
check out our runner-up pic the Bose
Soundlink the sound links are an on-air
design but they are the most comfortable
headphones I've ever worn pillowy soft
ear cushions and a compact lightweight
design fold it up they're even more
compact than the MM 550 X and they're
significantly less expensive than the
Sennheiser's the boses also have a great
sound though they're a little heavier in
the base than the sentence they also
have a 15 hour battery and a voice
guided hearing system my only real
complaint with the sound links is the
lack of active noise cancellation and a
weaker Bluetooth radio that had more
interference and dropouts than the
Sennheiser's the rest of the field has
some really good headphone options but
none are as great as the top picks
the new beats solo2 wireless sound great
and they last a long time between
charges but they're not nearly as
comfortable to wear for long stretches
as the Bose Soundlink sanitizers mm 450
X are the smaller cheaper on your
versions of my top pick they sound great
and offer many of the same features as
the 550 X but they're not as comfortable
to wear as the Bose Soundlink and also
the same problem of being as ugly as sin
Heiser's larger headphones samsung's
level overs have great sound quality but
they're huge and not very portable their
touch space controls can also be kind of
finicky to use similarly the parrot Zik
to have clumsy touch-based controls on
their ear cups z2s offers some
innovative ideas but in order to control
those features you need to use the app
which is annoying and they just don't
sound as good as other things Jabra is
Revo Wireless are adorable good-looking
set of on-ear headphones they sound good
but they're a bit too bassy and they're
not nearly as comfortable to wear as the
bose sound waves but if you can't find
the bose is in stock the Jabra Rivas are
a good alternative pick if you're
looking for a solid on your headphone
sony has a whole range of wireless
headphones but none of them really stood
out compared to the rest of the field of
the sony's the mdr-1r dt sound the best
but they're larger and clumsier than the
Sennheiser's at the same price wireless
headphones are all about freedom freedom
from tangles freedom from accidents
freedom from wires they're great and
eventually everyone will be using
wireless headphones instead of Wired
ones but if you want the best wireless
headphones today the Sennheiser mm 550 X
are the ones you should buy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
