the project Fiona this is the world's
first tablet designed specifically for
PC gaming so what does that mean this
means you've got the power and
performance that you need to be able to
run all the best PC games these core
titles like space marine and locks -
company Heroes
Firefall these kinds of things what
we've done here is essentially taken a
high-performance PC and packed it into a
tablet form factor adding these controls
to the side to give you the ability to
play all these hardcore PC games this is
a windows-based system so you're looking
at typical Windows operating system with
the razer software running on top of it
that allows it to interface specifically
with the games the games - the shell and
then launch these games and be able to
interact with them via the controllers
so this is a great PC gaming experience
using a tablet so I'm going to launch a
game here and we'll just go through some
of the some of the action of that and
get an idea of what the controls are
like
so we've got a mouse here bound to the
right stick but this is a configurable
option so you can you could have this
bound for example to be just like the
Xbox 360 so you could have the Xbox 360
controls that you're familiar with to be
able to navigate through the game and
the future opponents etc so what you're
seeing here is high-performance PC
gaming so we've got all the ability in
here to run a full Windows operating
system and the appropriate level of CPU
and GPU so this is a powered by Intel
and gives us the the horsepower that we
need to be able to play these these core
PC games</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
