we're taking a look at the Nexus 5 the
new flagship Android phone from Google
as with previous Nexus phones Google
says this device will push Android
forward and be the best representation
of what that mobile OS can do it comes
with the newest version of Android 4.4
better known as KitKat coupled with by
far the most advanced hardware the Nexus
lineup has ever seen
the Nexus 5 shares a lot in common with
LG's recent flagship g2 though there are
notable differences here as well LG was
also Google's partner for last year's
Nexus 4 and there are some similarities
though it's a pretty different device
from a hardware perspective the phone is
pretty stacked it has a 5-inch 1080p
display Snapdragon 800 processor 2 gigs
of RAM and 16 or 32 gigs of storage the
display first and foremost is gorgeous
it's big bright accurate and incredibly
crisp although it does appear ever so
slightly washed out compared to an
AMOLED display or even the iPhones
Retina screen a lot of what Google is
doing with KitKat is designed for big
displays like this and the Nexus 5 shows
it off perfectly the body around the
display is nice too but it's not exactly
what I'd call i catching it comes in
black or white I prefer the softer
cleaner matte black version and it's
mostly just a rectangle it's got curved
sides in a more angled top and bottom
and fits really nicely in your hand as
long as you have a big hand but it does
feel better than a lot of 5-inch phones
although it is pretty big coming from
the Moto X or the iPhone it'll be a
noticeable change the phone is
surprisingly light though just a hundred
and thirty grams and impressively thin
at eight point six millimeters it's made
of plastic but it still feels pretty
good I wouldn't say it's machined
beautifully like an iPhone 5s or the
Lumia 925 but it isn't that cheap
plastic of the g2 or the Galaxy s4 also
thankfully it doesn't have the problems
of the Nexus 4 namely the glass back
which broke really easily and was
extremely slippery on flat surfaces
Google really picked its spots when it
came to making design choices that you'd
notice for instance the big ring around
the camera lens and the white speaker
grille on the otherwise black front of
the white model those details plus the
carved Nexus logo on the
are really the only indications that
this is something other than a standard
slab smartphone personally I like the
clean lines in the simple design but it
would have been nice to see a little
more creativity though maybe the
do-it-yourself motox colors and apples
gold iPhone have spoiled me the designs
real purpose though is just to get out
of the way to show off KitKat the latest
version of Android it may just be a
point update but there's actually a lot
going on some of the aesthetic changes
really have to do with Android looking
good and working well on big screen high
res phones there's also a new condensed
version of the Roboto font that's used
system-wide which looks really nice
icons seem a little bit bigger and
cleaner in the new OS and everything has
been tweaked or polished a little bit to
get more out of those large displays
also nearly all of the tron influences
we first saw in android 3.0 have been
excised and what remains and is new
actually seems to have more in common
with recent efforts from HTC on the one
that it does with previous versions of
Android 4.0 things have been lightened
tightened and flattened in all the right
places making this latest incarnation of
the ever evolving software feel really
fresh and it's not just cosmetic Google
search is all over KitKat more than ever
Google now is a left swipe away from
your home screen as opposed to the
gesture that had brought it up before
and all you have to say is OK Google to
start doing a search when you're on the
home screen the voice activity that
features are nearly as powerful or
useful as the Moto X but they're a nice
touch here and they're definitely an
improvement to what you could do with
Android before this version you can now
search keywords right within the dialer
of the phone which is sort of like
having a phone book in your phonebook
it's pretty handy there's a new unified
file picker and there's a unified way to
print from your phone or even control
your TV Android is tighter simpler and
more unified everywhere and though the
general UI hasn't changed dramatically
the visual tweaks and functional
additions continue Android done a really
smart path the new hangouts could be
viewed as the flagship feature of KitKat
it now integrates SMS and it's the
default messaging app for Android which
means you can send text instant messages
voice calls and video calls all from the
same place it's a great idea but a
really clunky execution if you're
talking to someone via hangouts and then
you text the
via SMS it starts an entirely new
separate conversation I got stopped up a
few times when I was testing the phone
just trying to figure out what was going
on where my conversations were happening
couple with the fact that Google still
doesn't group separate accounts into a
single stream it makes things really
puzzling at times hangout issues aside
KitKat is a really solid improvement and
the Nexus 5 shows it off well key cats
also designed to be used on lower memory
devices but that's not exactly a problem
here with the Snapdragon 800 and two
gigs of RAM the phone screams it plays
heavy games well opens and closes and
switches between apps with no lag and
while there are still some minor
scrolling issues when you're trying to
tear through a long page particularly in
Chrome that seems more to do with buffer
and then it does actual graphics
performance in fact a big deal has been
made out of the Android scrolling
problem but nine times out of ten the
Nexus 5 feels considerably faster than
most devices I've used and that includes
the iPhone 5s and while Google still
can't match Apple's best-in-class
touch response times the difference in
my opinion is negligible all of the
software improvements coupled with the
strong hardware of the Nexus 5 make it a
really fun phone to play with on
brasstacks tough call quality is solid
though the speaker could be a little bit
louder even coming my hand around it
didn't produce sounds that were loud
enough to hear outdoors I think it needs
to be pointed out that data is massively
improved on this phone over the Nexus 4
thanks to the merciful edition of LTE
out of the box for AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile and
Sprint here in the US Google wanted to
make a phone that shows off Android and
I think it succeeded but in doing so it
may have overlooked two of the biggest
requirements of making a truly great
smartphone namely a good camera and
consistent battery life during my time
test in the Nexus 5 battery life was all
over the place
the first couple of days I used it I
only saw eight or nine hours before I
had to put it back on a charger the
following days it got better 10 and even
16 on one day but those are pretty
inconsistent numbers and then there's
the camera which was a problem with the
Nexus 4 and is a problem again here now
it seems to me that the eight megapixel
shooter is capable of taking really
beautiful pictures in the perfect
setting but in so many settings it's a
huge step down from something like an
iPhone
5's Lumia 1020 or even the Moto X it
takes photos and video with too little
contrast too little saturation and too
little color when you can get the camera
to focus at all low-light performance
isn't exactly poor but getting it to
snap the picture you want at the moment
you want will drive you nuts
the camera app can be absurdly slow to
focus and even slow to launch in the
first place which makes the Nexus 5 as a
camera an exercise in frustration it
instills basically no confidence so
you'll find yourself just expecting to
take a bad photo side-by-side with
almost any other flagship phone it's
camera doesn't hold up Google says that
software not hardware is to blame for
the weak performance but that doesn't
change the fact that out of the box
using the camera on this phone almost
guarantees poor shots which is ironic
for a device which Google's marketing is
a picture taking never miss a moment
phone I spoke to reps at Google and they
say that fixes are coming and that the
focus time and low-light performance
will improve but there's no word on how
soon that'll happen or how good these
tweaks will be and if you buy this thing
right now
the camera performance leaves a lot to
be desired if Google is really serious
about the Nexus program it needs to
build more than just a great way to hold
the latest version of Android in your
hand it needs to build the best
all-around smartphone one that actually
competes for the hearts and minds of
customers who would otherwise buy an
iPhone or a galaxy s4 Google has gotten
really close with the Nexus 5 and if it
can fix some of the problems that I've
seen with the phone particularly the
camera it could be there but it's not
there yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
