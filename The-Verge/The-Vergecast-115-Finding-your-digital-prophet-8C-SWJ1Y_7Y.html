the week of March 10th 2014 I'm Josh
Topolsky
I'm TC Sonic and this is my third week
in captivity
please help and I'm Katie yeah Katie
TC and Katie how much you favorite
people to do the verge cast with I look
like there's an oil oil spill on my head
with this hair with my hair it's getting
really long it is getting long here's
the question how long will it get
pigtails long I'm thinking mini pony
yeah like Jared Leto yeah I want to have
like a Jared Leto style hair situation
this hair is very long I'll never be as
beautiful as Jared Leto but I can have
long hair like him I want to be like he
looks like a beautiful horse running
through the fields of like know like a
tiny little pony like a pony who look
like a beautiful yeah
I think oh we're drinking yeah look look
at him
he's a beautiful man you don't have hair
I need to get some highlights he has
really nice bone structure looks like
Gaius Baltar he really does let's have a
little clink of the old
cheers cheers Cheers Canada when you
Cheers
Charlie sorry sorry sorry our guests
please forgive this intrusion on your
personal space someone asked me to wear
this hat today who's someone who's that
someone actually live there live special
lady maybe special dude special broham I
mean I'm not judging I'm you know
whatever is I'm cool with why it's
borough man borough man he just tweeted
ugh so glad you're a cowboy I'm an urban
cowboy oh yeah my boots today trying to
bring my bolo tie but yeah this is
this is the verge cast man that's it
what did you guys want to talk about
today um well there's lots doc I think
right yeah what are we talking about
just before we started rolling I was
talking about I was talking about how I
wanted to murder TC and I was a saint he
was like please kill me that's what he I
mean he wasn't like and I don't think he
was joking it was like I'm ready to be
done with life I've had it why and then
um and I was saying how amazing it would
be if I killed him live for real on the
verge cast like that like widen that be
a podcast you'd never forget we had a
spirit that would be really easy to
convict him a giant spear unless it
could be there was some that's like on
The Good Wife you know you are 20 there
would be a scene there's like he killed
him on the vert on the verge cast and
there's like there's video 20,000 people
a million people watch it it's 20
thousand by the way don't worry it's not
a million but it would be like the wedge
cast or something something like that
right and then we look live but then
like The Good Wife be like wait a second
that knife wasn't even his and like his
hand it's like look it's been edited or
something and then she'd make out with
her with will hey brother alert okay
maybe no they make out they do oh I
haven't seen that again I'm happy I
haven't seen it yet do everything
spoiler and they show it on CBS which I
thought was shot on you catch up so
watching scandal full full frontal
nudity a clip just a random clip from
the trailer for The Good Wife John show
the nudity it's such a good show though
everywhere that's it's incredible it's
unbelievable it's on CBS at Network
known for several horrible horrible
programs I hear it's better than house
of cards
I actually think look house of cards is
very good I think some of it strays into
a level of incredulous yeah you know
nests yeah that is pretty I find it a
little bit sort of meander e me Andrews
I think well that's not my main issue
when he kills the president but that's
the thing about house of cards like that
could happen on that show yeah and
they'd be like yeah that's a totally
reasonable plot point Frank Underwood
puts ricin in his stevia multiple choice
I hope by the way I hope you're not
watching this Virge guys for any
information about anything or any real
conversation important opinions though
so Katie we were talking about your
haircut you said you get your hair cut
by woman named Leticia yes and in
Brooklyn Heights and and I was like oh
you're wearing a Brooklyn you gotta like
you're like showing off your Brooklyn
street cred
yep Annette's I went to one game a year
and a half ago how was it it was okay
yeah me too I'm a big fan I have their
t-shirt you see jay-z no jay-z was not
there he's it every it was for every
game it was for Karl's birthday does he
like the Nets no we just decided
together that we were gonna like the
Nets and so we both bought t-shirts well
they're awesome they're they're all they
give all black uniforms there in
Brooklyn mm-hmm they just seem really
cool they all listen to I'm trying to
dear Huff or whatever I don't know
they're all really into Interpol they
don't know what a nerd my references are
all I've been sleeping a lot what's a
cool band now they're buddies like it's
like indie but they're cool the National
no doubt now the Nationals like really
popular yeah they're too popular they
actually play they played at the at the
BART they did but I didn't go because I
was like I'm not gonna see them at
 Berkeley I gotta say something
about the National I really have a new
fruit it's too big a venue Ivany I
agreed not intimate enough for me
because you're into that intimate indie
vibe
here's what I want to say about the
National oh I didn't realize number one
number one they're from Cincinnati I
didn't know which is a tough place for
anybody to be from and I think people in
Cincinnati will back me up on this
they've been at this for a long time
ninety nine is when they formed Wow
so just nothing but respect for the
National also the lead singer if you saw
him on Saturday Night Live they were
just on with Lena Dunham he is a dead
ringer for Randy Quaid in Independence a
particular Randy Quaid it independence'
here yes can we get it close up on him I
mean he looks so much like Randy Quaid
from Independence hey can we get it can
we get a shot of red yes just get in
there can we get a side-by-side of Randy
Quaid from Independence Day plays I'm
just gonna wait there like live I love
that they're doing this live aliens so
my favorite
sounds like that's what he sounds like
exactly I'm supposed to be the person
keeping us on topic today and I'm just
gonna let everyone know I'm not gonna do
my steel what's the top first topic
what's the topic we're supposed to talk
about Austin Texas they're so South by
Southwest is brand hellworld
help brand out world where's my
side-by-side this is nonsense
what's worse watching this or listening
to it being in it
Wow Oh John you don't like I'm sorry jot
the in in the control booth I was just
taught being in that room is the worst
you know what you don't okay I'm happy
in there the perpetual bottles forcing I
mean it is your job but you're getting
paid right now to drink wine and just
like talk about whatever you want yeah
it's amazing you guys happens off camera
so me just asked if I completely have we
completely given up on the illusion of
discussing tech on the first cast I
think I think you want to talk about
tech I think that I'm like not going to
talk about a smartphone for don't talk
to me about it like it's got to be a
really interesting development in
smartphones to talk about it yeah I
don't know I'm just not interested in
talking I mean I can certain technology
like like I would talk about the well I
mean it's not really a tech story but I
would talk about what Casey wrote at
South by South by Southwest Interactive
which is supposed to be this place where
like you know beautiful amazing new
ideas about like the future of our world
are born is actually has actually become
this like really weird brand like you
know it's like called it an orgy yeah
and a rollicking corporate brand orgy
yeah which i think is like totally valid
is this guy Mark littell wants us to
talk about tech doesn't use
capitalization when spelling his name
who is he Dana Boyd yeah here we go look
at this no I'm telling you he looks like
him you say it's the wrong angle
yeah well disappoint we get him in the
in a plane or something flying into the
alien I got what you need john-boy I
suppose you got the right image I got it
he really does look like him anyhow
so we're talking about Oh South by
Southwest so yeah the thing is I mean
it's not a surprise I think this has
been this way for a long time but it's
just say it's just like a it's just like
it's my brand it's just a clusterfuck of
brands and it's all really nasty lame
 it's like this guy's Shing me from
AOL do you know this dude this digital
prophet
this guy's like my least rate and by the
way I'm sure he's a really nice guy and
I feel bad saying this because I'm sure
he's a lovely man but he's like he calls
himself a digital prophet or that's what
AOL calls them or something can we get a
picture of shinny up on the screen view
screen here we just get shaky just do it
Google search for Shing II it's really
great if you could just get an image of
him up I'm not gonna talk though there's
an image of Shiggy on the screen I don't
like to put people on blast but it kind
of looks like what Sonic the Hedgehog
would look like if he was a human being
I imagine super excited about everything
I feel like well he's profit is profit
is profiting mm-hmm off of the digital
fourth to be digital your son your signe
speaking it's a better image of shinging
this is too dark I need to see Shing Wow
there he is can we get audio on this
this is him profiting right to being a
prophet profiteering look at those nails
is he largest contributor to stress
today is media overload we know that
there's a challenge in terms of
attention but if you do get it right
mind share equals market share hmm and
that's where consumers are going to pass
your brand on nice oh it's Katharine
Hepburn and this is it when you obey all
the rules you miss all the fun I think
what we need to do is get into a fast
experimentation mode the platforms allow
us to do that because you fundamentally
have between 6 seconds and 13 hours to
tell your brand story today you're not
limited window to how you tell your
brand story you have these different
brand expressions today these different
engines to tell your story yeah so I
would love he is employed he's employed
by AOL as far as I know and he's these
amazing his title is digital prophet of
course it is and he's talking about how
you can get your brand just jam on your
brand get it jammed up into supper this
area
here's the bill the most striking image
actually Valleywag Sam Biddle
I think posted this it was a it was like
a picture of Chingy on Mashable's like
wrecking ball there it is it's like it's
like a sandwich
of garbage it's a guard I'm sorry shakey
I'm sorry I know you're a nice guy but
you're a human being and I don't want to
diss you like you're I'm sure your
lovely man to hang out with but like
your stuff that you say it sounds really
horrible and you're I'm not gonna you
know teaches own your look is your look
like whatever but you know being called
a digital prophet and saying like
brand message or whatever it is the
worst so I mean is that is that a text
conversation I don't know hey wait a
second buddy ever get you jr. over here
changing my title to be Freddie not
following Chingy anyhow so that may be a
tech story I'm just I think you know
that's the kind of texture I'm
interested in is like how South by
Southwest went from like a really cool
interesting group of people telling each
other very interesting stories and
sharing knowledge to you know an Oreo 3d
printed Oreo like marketing machine and
and in Casey Newton one of our writers
wrote a really cool story about by the
way I'm not like bitter this sounds like
bit I'm bitter or whatever like that's
just no but that's just like one small
part of like what's going on in the
world that to me is and I think some of
like you know why I don't want to talk
about like the new smartphone or like
you know I don't wanna talk about like
ios8 leaks except I will say there's
this like marker man from 95 Mac had
these like nine had these uh ios8 leaks
and they're like they're gonna they're
gonna have like text edit or something
or it's you know some really sad stuff
they're good walking public transit or
public transit directions and maps like
it's just the saddest update you can
think of too because all this stuff is
incremental like and that's why like you
don't hear us talking a lot on the verge
cast anymore about these like weird
little incremental like hey there's a
new 6.5 inch smartphone like we're very
you know I'm sure there's a set of
people as interested we'll cover those
when appropriate we review them when
appropriate building on when it comes to
the verge cast
like you know I don't want to sit here
and talk about a 6.5 inch screen on a
smartphone unless there's like a really
good reason to talk about it I kind of
do
looking you know what this is the this
is the sleep sleepless mind of a baby
daddy what is happening anyhow should we
should wear appropriate my man we all
though wait mark littell also points out
that he came up with drum roll as a
replacement for verge cast it's pretty
good I thought you were you were not on
our side but now you maybe are on our
side
yeah that's pretty awesome yeah anyhow
but so what's in the news kee what do we
have our own tech is dead Tech is is
tech dad is tech dad there's no more
technology it's all been done I don't
think it's true there we go there we go
yes that's more yes I still feel like
you got the wrong image on the right now
look he looks like Randy Quaid okay he
looks good there okay Katie that's
enough
maybe you got back off that wine a
little bit we don't want to we don't
want anything embarrassing to happen
here like the entire thing we wouldn't
want that to happen
okay so what's on our list yeah she's
pretty early today hey you don't know
cosmos cosmos Katie did an amazing
interview with Neil deGrasse Tyson he
came to our office our student and sat
down with us and obviously a super
fascinating guy brilliant dude we
interviewed him I interview them a
couple years ago on on the verge the
first season upon the verge and he was
so were you there yeah I wasn't yeah he
was like so engrossing I don't know if
he did this with you I don't because I
don't know the whole thing but he would
like and I was like we got to wrap up
it's like 45 minutes outside we got to
wrap up he's like no and we talked for
like another 15 or 20 minutes cuz he
just wanted to say more stuff he he's so
smart and interesting that it just makes
you feel like it made me feel like the
dumbest guy in the world I didn't feel
done okay okay as you're like talking to
a peer yeah he's like super yo it's an
awesome kind of like super in your face
like he ya know it's like it's like you
want him in your face yeah do some
people you're like dude get out just
stop yeah he's like he's like he's
evangelical scientist he's extremely
intelligent but I also find him
extremely kind and
thoughtful no he's yes yeah totally and
like very easy to talk to you like I was
nervous this was the first one-on-one
like sit-down video interview I've ever
done and I was very nervous but we made
eye contact the whole time it was that's
good we drank wine you did yeah yeah
she's proves my theory that you have a
drinking problem
no I mean so I'll drink to that right
and we want to do this every time
sorry why why shouldn't we do it every
time huh let's talk about more tech no
but so Neal okay dr. Tyson of sudden
Neal AB doctor is a huge wine buff which
I found out when I interviewed him for
The Verge 50 and he hated he hated your
wine he did hate the wine um it was
thinking about the kind of wine he's
training cuz let me tell you I know
right so he has the money to buy red
wine he has a wine cellar at his house
god I'm so envious and so I said to the
the guys buying the wine I was like get
something nice they got a $32 bottle of
wine I'm like okay fair like that's a
nice bottle of wine by my standards and
he took one sip and was like yeah this
could use another eight years another
eight years he and he would know and he
would know he tell you someone discussed
it buy the wine he's dream but he drank
a full glass he drank a full glass and I
did not because I was trying to it was
like 1:00 in the afternoon
being unfashionable yeah that's all I
was gonna in my week would be sure dude
I mean he's gonna get in he gets into
some sick limo and just goes to his next
I saw him outside leaving and he got
into it big like a not a Hummer but like
a like it like a suburban yeah that new
or nesco he's a total player I mean I
mean that's I only like suburban is
apparently like that's the car like I
now get Ober once in a while I'll get an
uber black car and a lot of times they
send because they have like uber T uberx
uberx a new burger opening I don't know
it's got Bentley anyhow but but they
send Suburbans all the time that's what
you're like huge
maybe he got an uber I don't know anyhow
he was getting into a car yeah and then
what he had an interview with People
magazine probably very different
interview I bet right but he talked a
lot about wine that was probably most of
the interview off-camera
gave us lots of good wine advice mm-hmm
but you know and also said some really
interesting we should use this without
advice today with this bottle of wine
that we're drinking God knows my wines
little but I can tell you this is crap I
like it okay
shout out to Justin yeah why Brad but
borrow bad just said he was gonna fight
somebody way out hamburgers is he
trolling us on Twitter yes this is the
worst charge cast African I just we
started trying to say before we started
we were having like a really great
exciting conversation and then something
happened during the intro that just
threw us off
it was TZ stupid hat yeah probably
anyhow noticed all right honestly though
spacetime Odyssey cosmic let's okay have
you seen it you you know washed it right
I've only only started watching I didn't
fan I'm have a baby
alright well I'm gonna talk to you
understand - oh right yeah go ahead you
guys talk what did you think what do I
want I thought it was fantastic I
thought it was really great to UM I was
surprised at how closely he stuck with
the Carl Sagan like I mean it like the
cosmic calendar yeah the spaceship of
the imagination it was all like I'm not
gonna say ripped off he used the word
borrowed sort of like as an homage I was
a reboot like a very literal sense yeah
he said it's a continuation it's like
the second season of cosmos but it's
thirty years later which I did not know
was was what they were gonna do I think
the most controversial part of that
first episode though was the the
religion yeah yes segment I mean he's
clearly a hardcore atheist definitely
he's very statements to that effect
before and he's unabashed
in his sort of you know science as
religion viewpoint and I mean I don't
think religion in the sense of like
worship it but just you know I really
appreciate the the fact they included
that thread though because I think one
and it was very clear at the end when he
talked about Sagan and what Sagan's
mission was and you know how this is a
very practical thing it's not just like
oh look at these cool NASA photos right
like science is a real thing that
it improves our lives after all yeah
it's a real thing yeah it's real it's
important
not only to improve our lives but you
know from a nationalistic standpoint
right you know it and no that's that
that's one of his huge trips and one of
the things he talked about when he was
on the verge and I know that he's he
speaks about often is this concept of
the love and appreciation and need for
science as like an underlying driver of
like who like in America who we are and
what we do and what will build and how
like we will you know it's not about
just about like hey it's like cool to
experiment and find something out it's
like hey this stuff actually leads to
legitimate new areas of exploration of
business of it of intellect and it's not
and that drives like a nation or a world
you know forward yeah and I think that's
true you know I think a science
underlies its you know so many of the
advances of civilization you know I
think about like longevity and I mean
health in general just full stop like
anything related to health is like that
is science in action that is you know um
that is like really insane progress
we've expanded expanded and extended
like the human lifespan by 40 years or
something in the last hundred years
there's you know 250 years or whatever
it is just because like we know we've
learned things about how stuff works and
like you know learning about how things
work and taking that apart and utilizing
it is uh there's you can't put a price
on it
you know it's the most valuable thing
I'm really glad they you know opened
with the cosmic calendar concept because
it's like one of uh you know just
putting a historical perspective in
there is is so important you know just
the idea that in 500 years we went from
like inventing the first telescope to
putting someone on the moon yeah
absolutely no it's crazy I mean it's
crazy the things that that it even in
the last hundred the things that have
occurred in terms of discovery are
astounding well when also that when put
in in perspective that that's what it
was what like five minutes at the end of
an hour right like all of meaningful
modern history was like six seconds or
something right in the bridal that's in
the final hour
right it's just it really is uh I mean I
hope I don't know if it's happening or
not
I do hope things like this spark a new
appreciation for I feel like we went
through a period and I'll just say like
the Bush era was the was the you know
pinnacle of just utter ignorance and
stupidity amongst like the populace of
America where it was like just denial of
facts you know and like are up from
different mark government down to like
just edit the average citizen we were
like denying truth and facts in
replacing it with I don't know what
greed there you know like just forced
ignorant
if purposeful ignorance I don't really
understand it because to me you know
like it's the most disturbing thing in
the world to imagine that like the
president the United States lied about
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq to
like spark a war which we know basically
happened for real like definitely
happened and you know I think that if I
were a part of the the populace that
voted for that guy and like was like
creationism and all this other stuff
that was happening during that time I
would feel like this wine is definitely
having an effect as I'm way down a
rabbit hole like progress no it is real
it is real and we're and we're still
coming out of this like period of just
like like sustained in unbelievable
ignorance that like it's like either
you're not paying attention or you don't
care or like you're you're just doing it
to be an asshole like you're being
ignorant to be an asshole like I think
that we're still coming out of that and
I really hope that things like cosmos
start to help to shake more people out
of this weird trance they've been in
about you know what I think the Internet
is like one of those tools where it's so
easy to convince yourself of that you're
right and that the things you believe
are true because there's a bunch of
people on the internet who are like yeah
you're right those things you believe
are true and finding truth and finding
and real answers to real problems is
like the basis of science you know and I
think it's so important that we actually
put value in that like consider that to
be a highly valued thing I mean I don't
know I don't know what the solution to
that problem is I mean a TV show
like it's a great show I enjoyed it a
lot from what I've read the ratings had
not been what they were expected to be
um which was disappointing but ya know
you solved that problem right like
NASA's budget this year is is flat again
it's you know the same culture here
a huge deal actually like a network like
Fox like that's one of the things that I
was most excited about right this was
far and away the biggest launch of any
television show in history yeah it's
weird like Fox put so much myself on for
American Idol and write Family Guy and
also Fox News it's it's known for like
the most destructive force in journalism
since I don't know like Hitler
controlled Fox News but it's all the
same except for the daily daily it is an
amazing beacon of light and otherwise
gloomy yeah plays yeah but um you know
rip-rip daily good year but ya know Fox
definitely has to pay it back and that's
what they're doing now I just think I
just think it's so crazy to me that that
uh we have this um almost like a real I
don't know it I don't know if this isn't
true in other countries I can't see I
don't wanna speak for other countries I
live in America and I've grew up in
America but it does seem like and I
don't know if this happened during the
Reagan years and then the it sort of got
solidified in the Bush years but this
like appreciation for it's like a
willful ignorance that is almost like
it's not cool to be smart it's not cool
to know things like it sucks like you're
a terrible person if you read books and
I think that that really has cemented
itself in some part of the firmament
some part of the the the layers of dirt
that we stand on I don't know what I'm
talking about right yeah you know I mean
I'm probably not I mean you know
knowledge is like scary you know like
the thing about atheism and religion is
that you know it's it's speaking as an
atheist yes it's scary to go like oh
yeah like there are no easy answers like
there isn't a simple like God's got it
why do you think I have a drinking
problem no tell me about it like I
sure you know as you recognize even the
heaven that exists above the planet
where there's lots of no voice
breathable cream cheese and so soft
ready to go at any bagel that you choose
no matter what better for what type of
bagel that was racist you know
everything bagel onion bagel raisin
bagel cream cheese on that no one's
gonna stop you anyhow your bagel heaven
was a timeout it's just scary you notice
to go like hey I don't there's God
doesn't have it cuz he doesn't exist cuz
he has it made up idea because like you
know anyhow I don't be I'm getting right
now I'm eating so many death threats and
hate mail I can't keep up with it but
here's what I'll say about it kinase si
I'm talking about atheism and I'm sure
people be up in arms but the most
controversial thing that I've ever said
in public is about being a vegetarian
that's like far and away like right now
if I was like meat eaters are terrible
way more controversial than like God is
dead or whatever it is is this a real
thing what is this this is bagel heaven
that's heaven this is real that's how I
learned was an ad is it a print ad what
is that it's an ad it's insane
well here's the thing like everybody
that I'm probably within this group as
an agnostic atheist but mmm I you know I
had you know everything
I'm writer than you are what was I
saying believes in God like completely
disavow science like that's a completely
no I agree I agree any otic no totally
true you know connections just that the
Bible contradicts all scientific
discovery so yeah but not everybody
believes the Bible literally know what's
then what is religion I'm sorry like I
have to ask that question you don't
believe that
okay literally like what is the Bible's
purpose but you like if you're is if
you're usually accessing community
involved in all kinds of but you know
that things that are unrelated to the
scientific method know I'm and there's
like obviously sometimes good
but like you know not to murder people
without the Bible right no it's called
morality yeah yeah like you don't need
the Bible to tell you not to steal from
people I do maybe you do oh boy I should
not be going down this path where's Paul
Miller when you needed this would be a
great conversation for him is this the
commercial did you have this in mind
when you were talking about cream cheese
heaven looks like Sandra Bernhard's
simplest Derby cake this beautiful
beefcake they're gonna be watching her
brought to you by was just like
Philadelphia Philadelphia Cream Cheese
yeah it's creamy there's a light it's
heavy
what's Philadelphia Cream Cheese is
tagline I need to know right now a
little taste of heaven I'm pissing you
off right now I'm sorry I was seeing
tweets from people who are like I've
I've listened I always want to say if I
offended you at all that was not my
intention if you are a Christian and you
believe in science that's wonderful I
think that's great I do think there's a
I do think at some point you get to a
what what is religion if you are a
believer in science well you're not I
mean like here's the thing there's a
difference between what you need
Christian who is you know totally
comforting I agree I wish I wish I could
be comforted by religion the way that
other people are me too
I mean I'm sure that like look when the
when I feel like bad turbulence on a
plane I get really religious really fast
because like you're like well you never
know I'm go the planes going down so I
better just be like the only time I'm
religious the only time I feel even the
slightest hint of religion is the plane
terrible turbulence of the plane it's
like white-knuckle turbulence and I'm
like I'm like all right God I know you
don't exist but if you do I don't want
to die you're like the worst kind of
atheist I am terrible can't believe I
admitted that you sand foxholes I don't
that means I don't know what that means
that means when you're on an airplane
that's going down you're not an atheist
because you lose grasping you like I'll
take anything you know so be threw me a
parachute I'd be like cool I'm out of
here I mean I'd be I'd be calm and I'm
cream cheese color because I wanted so
badly they Diaz jumping out of the video
jumping out of a plane is terrifying to
me but I would happily take a parachute
if I felt my plane was going down yeah
think about that let that's due for
a minute I try not to fly are you
finishing oh it's the worst okay fine I
hate it yeah
all right that is it atheism or religion
this ones this is the worst virtue I
mean when I say it's more is this great
we come back we're gonna come back this
every week my tech what's going on with
tech tech cool smart fun do you think
God would use a usually he wouldnt have
to worry about much at six point three
screen yeah curved curved keep the glare
of heaven out izzy cream cheese
reflections
well he's what he's checking his google
gallup on the eighth day God created man
wants us to move on what about we could
do speaking of airplanes we could do the
Malaysian tragedy a weight went down J
Wayne does not like this conversation
not surprised that's not the worst verge
cats never happened I've been worse I
think this is great I'm having a great
time
whatever doesn't matter to me so there's
this airplane that was in the sky and
then it didn't land I mean this story's
fascinating there's some let's talk
about this this is not is this actually
is a bit of a tech story I mean what
about ten I mean here's the thing about
tech like let me just say this so I can
just get it out in the open like the way
the verge thinks about technology is
that it is deeply connected
intrinsically connected to so much of
like what is going on in our world that
like we're not this isn't about tech
it's like hey there's this gadget over
here it's like this stuff is all strewn
in in together it's all connected
and so this Malaysia Airlines this
millage airline story is really
interesting because there is a there is
a a you know news aspect to it like oh
my god this planes missing and did it go
down
what happened but the actual story is
like how did it go missing where did it
go
what do we know about it how do we track
you know it's really friendly it
actually reminds me of the movie contact
where Jodie Foster's falling you know
and at the end through that balls boiler
and they're like yes boiler for a movie
from the 90s it's a great by the way 15
seconds yeah and then they were like oh
wait
the Inbal recorder had like 24 hours a
time chili chili of scandal okay spoiler
alert on scandals I've never seen a
single episode and I know Carl's like
you scandals the best it's Tara Carl
talk about is that's his voice is it
terrible it looks terrible it's amazing
it looks like oh did you like she's good
wife like you'll love yeah oh really
yeah alright I'll watch it seriously you
think it's bad I think it's terrible
shut up
sorry I just caught this headline on our
site Disney is releasing the EDM album
with remixes from Avicii in caps oh yeah
sorry who Disney Disney what the Walt
Disney Company Disney Walt Disney
Corporation I know if you like the
Little Mermaid
you'll like Skrillex Wow Wow hey what's
the name of the crowd of the Little
Mermaid Sebastian hey Sebastian sleek
the Sebastian right just like snippy
snip remix it's examples of Sebastian
well I guess Disney did Tron well they
didn't a she funded and release drawn
yeah yeah yeah this is the come on let's
talk about something Malaysia Airlines
yeah so where the fuck's that plane
where where is the plane so we're
talking to Chris Ziegler about this he's
actually Chris's are like an airplane
buff yes he's an airplane nerd like he
knows stuff about airplanes that you
that you can't even begin to imagine so
now he's actually working on something
right now like a story about uh
something about what's there's a new
discovery that that this there are
electronics trans that were transmitting
on this plane or from this plane for
five hours
after it kind of dropped off of radar
interesting fact like he drops off a
radar 100 miles outside of Malaysia
right I had no idea that when they're
when they're over the ocean they're
flying blind we're just like terrified
hey hey just check it out I mean I
assume that they're they can see other
planes but in terms of never leaving the
continent yeah you don't want to do that
you don't wanna same but um but so so
the story's got a little bit more
interesting because there's this now
they're saying like hey the plane it was
like hey the plane went into the ocean
it dropped from radar and it probably
crashed and they just can't find it
right now they're saying well there's
five hours of transmitting data past the
point where it dropped off a radar and
what Chris was saying to me which I find
fascinating is that it might have landed
somewhere they're like what are you
doing what's happening can you stop that
we're on we're on now we're on a
national international broadcast right
now I'm Metis whispering trash talk you
trash talking
this is outrageous Katie what did you
say he's threatening are you threatening
her the worst she threatened her be
honest absolutely not the same
accusation she levelled last she's it's
a black listen people's lives are at
stake here they're not at stake I'm
pretty sure like all right we don't know
what I was saying is Christmas like we
don't know what happened this plane it's
possible could have landed somewhere
yeah that's all ages is unone know
that's a possibility in that creepy no
no or somewhere else
if they manage them you know might not
be identified yet I mean we don't know
it could yeah it's on the Lost Island
because that doesn't exist
wow this is really intense you know why
because it was from a TV show yeah I
mean I didn't watch a BC it was
interrupted by commercial here's a
golden so like this whole thing from the
stolen passports go on to now like
wasn't anyone else just like how the
hell yeah finally that happens all the
time though people edit yourself on it
hell how the heck
I'm Katie that's great okay how yeah
keep your language nice and clean on
this verge cast we want you to say
anything that was off-color uh go on I
was just like really taken aback by the
fact that you can steal a passport and
then fly take an international flight
somewhere well I mean and I'm not that
simple but like apparently it happens
all the time no I don't know you have to
you have to so I'm just sorry somebody's
tweeted some he was standing behind you
standing behind me you just that was a
made you look moment no something's like
who's the person here's they say I just
got trolled why is that same guy been
standing behind the glass near Josh the
entire podcast tired of seeing his ass
literally oh it's Evan he's got a nice
ass though yeah it's pretty good that's
technically a violation of you said
you're gonna murder me earlier we have
this this ass comment on record for HR
now Wow you're gonna you just self doxed
yourself believe me there's plenty of
pleasures passing plenty bad stuff on
record for me okay who is doing this
this woman Trisha neter
is doing drawings of people members of
the verge have you seen these oh this is
creepiest thing I've ever said she just
did one can we get this up kids let me
just look at who just tweeted at me in
this image first up it's a great drawing
it's disturbing it's upsetting
but I like it there it is Queen zoom in
on that is that you I know you tell me
yeah that's definite is it mirrors it
randy quaid i think that's you or the
lead singer of the national yeah now we
got to do this went very well then
dieter oh it's on the top what did you
two do to the top here would you just do
a job no you drop it's coming up it's
coming up okay great dieter bone bone
zone
he was almost on this but what is this
erielle is hold on do I follow her by
the way I need to I didn't I can't
believe I wasn't so erielle our new
writer just dissed me on Twitter she did
Josh is lack of cream cheese add
knowledge makes me wonder if the quote
cream cheese taught me about heaven
Canadian specifically I like ya cream
cheese heaven it sounds you know I
didn't run this ad in America you know
we know what real heavens like we don't
call you ride on a gold she ride up a
gold bus do you rember this article it
was written in like the Atlanta Journal
hey guys hey you know I saw you saw that
I did you got another setting kitty
don't don't don't do an f-bomb to him
just quietly on the verge cast that's
not right who taught you it's a Canadian
manners I guess is what we're seeing
here I don't think she's a real comedian
really please elaborate on that say
sorry enough I say sorry constantly why
don't you say it like sorry you say the
f-bomb sorry that's our Joshi talks a
lot yeah well I'm sorry you know what
I'm the host and I mean we're
traditionally I am the host of The Verge
cast well you're very talkative
I am talkative it's probably because I'm
Jewish well I was raised Jewish
well socially socially culturally Jewish
religiously a theist hmm which means I'm
just very nervous
mm-hmm right yeah so apologies to your
dad if you're watching my Katie's dad
yes I'll let Katie talk more your
daughters normally very nice Katie why
do you run why don't you run the rest of
this thing okay great whoo thank God
take a break
Phenom I right cheers Cheers huh
bilateral Cheers
do we want to talk about gas leaks yes
oh my god
yeah I'm terrified I'm super-sized
listening to NPR today and and ER it's
funny um
WNYC which is the NPR of course I was
listening to NPR right so it's just
stereotype but cliche Jewish New York
elicits that be are like okay they were
like they had a they had a show on a
couple days ago is about the the failing
infrastructure of New York right and
today they're like yeah this could be
evidence of the failing infrastructure
of New York I live in a house that was
built in 1860 you do yeah yeah for real
it's SuperDuper old I think now it's
just like everyday like my family's
going to blow up he
tene 60 yeah that's like civil warrior
yeah it's really old are you two like
are you kidding me that's when it was
built we have like records yeah it's a
it's actually what's interesting about
my house is that Thomas Ricker who lives
in Amsterdam has a very similar tiny
house I have a very tiny house and
Thomas Ricker's that's so upsetting can
we get that on screen plays the dieter
image totally unrelated to my house and
two explosions please get the dieter
graphic on the screen immediately I
won't say another word until it happens
there we go
that by the way that was the longest
moment of silence ever in the history of
The Verge cast in the history of Josh in
the history actually yeah my uncle used
to pay me money to be quietly how long
he'd be quiet I'll give you a dollar if
you mean quiet I was a terrible kid
terrible adult what are you gonna do
anyhow so yes so there was this terrible
huge explosion in Harlem East Harlem
apparently a gas leak leveled to
building seven people are dead I mean
just look at this I mean just it is
breathtaking that that that something
like this could happen it's not it
wasn't new it didn't happen on purpose
it wasn't planned there were no
explosives in this building as far as we
know at this point and I think probably
for real Ariel our new writer who did a
great piece about how this happens and
why this happens which is really
interesting but it just made me feel
just utter and constant fear now about
yeah my house exploded yeah it's
especially insane is that apparently
they have been like reporting the smell
of gas or a gas leak for like two weeks
well but before this happened so what I
read which was very very sad was a woman
talking to the New York Times and her
husband was unaccounted for and they
lived in one of these buildings so super
sad but she said to them something along
the lines of we thought we smelled gas
before we went to bed then it went away
so we just went to bed and then the next
morning there was this explosion and I
think in terms of aerials piece what was
most disturbing to me was I think it was
something like 35 or 38 percent of gas
mains in Manhattan are made of chrome
what is the make up some some whatever
the material is that makes them more
vulnerable to these cracks and predate
1960 in other words they're outdated and
they are vulnerable to cracks that's
terrifying no it's it's that's
terrifying no I mean the the on NPR they
were saying that the average age of the
mains in New York is 56 years Oh
old yeah just really old and they're
made of you know this what is it
cast iron cast iron and that's what it
it's not Chrome no not chrome I'm
thinking about problems what you put on
your wheels from asthma quit now is a
browser yeah it's an internet that's
weird that my reference point was about
wheels yeah and your suspicion of touch
you tak-tek with Tech Talk Tech Talk
right there but uh so anyhow it's just
terrifying since my house is a super
duper old I'm just imagining everything
in it is ready to explode at any given
moment and you know today we had our
heat on and it's making some weird
screeching noise it's hot water heat
it's not gas or anything but it's making
some weird high-pitched screeching noise
it's like goes that here we go yeah
we're gonna blow up so it's a terrible
it's a terrible tragedy and a shocking
story and also like I think not to get
all political on you yet again but is a
demonstration of the need for us to be
concerned about the infrastructure in
America not just you know this is a this
is a privately owned company that is
responsible for these gas lines but you
know they're responsible to the citizens
of this city it's a public utility
there's a public utility but I mean my
Kannada stand has the privilege of me
it's National Grid National Grid I think
no it's carnage it's kinda doesn't do
gas gonna do do they they're my guess
they do gas mmm-hmm I thought they only
did electricity very confused
at any rate also I've been drinking at
any rate this wine is really effective
and I have to say it's Justin hi and
alcohol content I don't think so I just
didn't have messing me up so the thing
is a little high
the point is it's like infrastructures a
real issue I mean there have been front
line act I think actually did a great
piece on the infrastructure if I'm not
mistaken a couple years ago I could be
totally making that up but there's
definitely you know our roadways bridges
brand of course it's like we're
literally America is like falling apart
and think about how much money the
federal government spent on public
projects that may have you seen year's
national park building international
look at look at there's a great chart of
the of the spending
our budget in the u.s. look at the look
at the budget for defense spending
versus the kind of thing the spending
we're doing on things like
infrastructure it's depressing
that's insane he didn't say yeah and
like look so far you know I don't know
I'm not gonna get into terrorism and
stuff but we've had you know 9/11 is
awful but uh it's just such an but this
is off but this is you know it's this is
awful - in like a hundred of these is
even worse and like if the
infrastructure doesn't get if we don't
care about it we don't think about it
like a hundred of these is what seems
but it should be such an obvious and
like uncontroversial point that like
this this public stuff that we spend
money on as a society enables us to do
things privately right the interstate
highway system right now that wasn't a
button that wasn't like you know a
company like Google or Microsoft saying
oh we need to build some roads it was
all of us together I mean this gets to
the you know this is kind of leads back
to net neutrality and talking about like
what we value here and how we manage it
I mean I think net neutrality is a great
that's the Internet is a great example
of the next infrastructure crisis in
America where it's where it's um
massively needed utility for all
citizens of this country and of all
countries we have the ability and the
opportunity to make it a a widespread
easily accessible open thing and the
direction we're headed is you know the
the FCC in cahoots with you know private
companies is managing it into a private
expensive service which will be
controlled by people who have interests
outside of what citizens the citizens of
this country need they're controlled by
by monetary interests and in the
interest of making money and getting
paid for everything and so it's like
it's like one of these things it's like
we can't keep up the infrastructure we
have that is shared and we can't build
new infrastructure where we need it
things like an open and free internet
like what is what is the future of
America if we don't do so no one gives a
 about science right this is why
this is why the space program is being
taken up by Elon Musk right and Jeff
Bezos because NASA gets
17 billion dollars a year I'm not saying
they're not profit I'm not saying they
don't want profits from that stuff but
they're gonna at least that will drive
them to do something yeah you know in
America we can't even see I mean the
government can't even see the reason why
we would want to do work on a space
program you know like they can't see the
value in it well it's a long-term thing
and yet profit-seeking companies are
absolutely essential for innovation and
you know driving the economy everything
else but they're also beholden to
shareholders in a way that makes them
focus on quarterly results right you
know you can't you know we have big
problems that require really long-term
and most and most companies aren't Apple
in the sense that you know Verizon is on
Apple Verizon is happy to be relatively
complacent with what they have you know
if they weren't the widespread FiOS
would be happening right now and it's
not you know Comcast and Time Warner
this like you know disgusting merger
that's probably going to happen where
it's gonna create this like insane
conglomerate you know it it's their
their their motivation for innovation
doesn't exist and it's like it sounds
like at a very basic level I go that's
some nerdy like what does that matter
like I need cable that's not important
but we don't matter when like you can't
get the things you need on the internet
because they have decided that it's more
profitable to charge you for them and so
it's like it's really a disturbing
situation we have in this country
supposed to do about it
a violent revolution I said this a
couple purch Cass ago the only answer
ultimately is a violent overthrow of a
corrupt government and I you know
actually like that's up joking around a
little bit but also somewhat like look
at other countries like what's happening
is violent overthrow of a corrupt
government and our government is like we
have a great way of like demonstrating
that we're not we like to act like we're
not corrupt and it seems like we're not
corrupt with like a tremendously corrupt
diseased government in America which is
poisoned by private interests and people
who want to hoard money and like it
damages the populace of this country in
ways that like we don't even we can't
even begin to understand and yet this
this wine yeah and yet Cheers
and yet like we're not there is an
Occupy Wall Street was the closest thing
we had to violent revolution it was it
was
a whiff of it was a baby's you know and
by the way as a new father I'm aware of
what babies can do not very much it was
like a babies version of like a real you
know revolutionary sort of movement and
I think that I'm not saying we need to
overthrow the government I don't know be
the word I'm not let me to say this
clearly do not overthrow the government
that would be a bad idea
but I do think we need a stronger
reaction to this stuff like you guys
like you know net neutrality sucks like
will black out our website for a day or
something like that like that can work
in small doses you can overthrow the
government every two and four years no
but yeah but but you're trading one
you're trading like one level for
another exactly I don't feel like I'm
overthrowing the government when I vote
every four years but I think I think it
requires a a fear and and knowledge and
understanding of what is going on at a
level that will make you do something
far more meaningful and that's like
that's not like that's a should vote for
Rand Paul no don't you think people
getting involved I think people getting
I think people getting legitimately
involved in what is going on in their
local governments and and trying to find
ways to affect real change by displacing
by removing people who are cancerous is
like a serious is a serious component of
it I'm really on a roll here my god
I'll probably get shot leaving the
building don't say by me oh my god see
see just behind me just just clips me
and that's it um any I just think you
know look we have uh I mean we have
wouldn't what I don't know what do you
do we're not gonna have a revolution in
America until it gets really bad but I
will say this we have a growing
disparity between the haves and
have-nots everybody knows that and at
some point that begins to like really
rot and when it rots like you know I
don't know you don't know I mean she
gets gets bad gets funky
I am so glad to be a Canadian citizen oh
you think you can run up to Canada
nuclear conflagration that wave of
nuclear of nuclear waste will just flow
right up to Canada alright are you
talking about judgement day is what I'm
talking about universal health care
you're basically
