and we are here in Austin Texas with Jim
Mazur from Native Instruments hi Jim
Trent and what have you got to show us
today yeah what I have to show you is
basically Traktor DJ which was only on
the iPad to begin with we now have
Traktor DJ for the iPhone excellent
excellent
how things changed scaling down to the
smaller screen well basically in terms
of the capabilities of the software
everything is pretty much one-to-one so
the iPhone version isn't in any way less
powerful than the iPad it's really just
about how we brought this interface down
to the smaller screen we actually
thought to really keep the the same size
and real estate that you have for
interacting with the wave display and
move it down to the iPhone yeah so
essentially you have two decks as you do
an iPad version let me just get a song
loaded here you can bring the browser
and by tapping the album art so here
I'll just go to my songs you get the
same kind of pain based structure that
we have an iPad version mm-hmm so here
you can see the wave display and you
have kind of this one deck focus which
lets you have all the same kind of cool
interactions that you have on the iPad
just scratching the sound freeze mode
stuff
bleeping and when you want to go to the
other deck you have also on the
left-hand side this kind of navigation
slider so as I pull this down
basically I slide between my decks so I
keep it in the center I have basically
both decks if I pull all the way down
now I'm on deck B so in this case
although the song is taking me
immediately to the recommendations so
it's just giving me a bunch of tracks
that will play well with what the song
that I have loaded in the same BPM range
and hearing yes yeah exactly so now I've
selected this song I can see this little
a indicator flashing saying that I have
something on my a deck so I load into B
okay it's there we can set like a loop
maybe let's just hand back see bolt
and it's just the same VPN detection
software that's in the larger version
and exactly the same the same exact
quality key detection as well so what
you can do is let's just slide up to
decade and when I tap these I bring in
my effects and filter controls or eq's
and filters so in this case I can XY
yeah
if folks are finding that the DCM is not
thinking where they wanted to think I'm
can people actually change cue points
here or any bit an external software is
that possible no it's it's super easy to
do in that map basically here I'm on the
intro so it's it sounds all good I mean
sometimes you have tracks with more like
quiet subtle intros where you can't
really tell if the one is there in this
case I'll just slide up in my secret
editor panel and then I can just grab
the local view and slide about and
basically I see that the transients are
all sticking in the same place so I have
a really high confidence and when I
bring this track in it's gonna be on B
so let's drop it on there
gotcha is this gonna be available for
and the smaller screened iOS devices or
is it strictly an iPhone 5 and larger
its iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 so yeah it
will cover the older screens as well I
guess my one question is why didn't you
do this sooner we didn't want to be the
first we wanted to be the first to do it
really right or as close as we think
native instruments aren't stands for
certain quality and our customers really
are professional DJs and they'll hold us
to basically those standards how have
you learned from the experience you guys
have already had with track DJ for iPad
to sort of work on this and bring the
features into this one screen I mean the
iPad version hasn't been out so long but
so I can't really say that we we learned
so much in terms of like what people
were saying other than just the response
of people really getting what we try to
bring out with the iPad version in terms
of directly working with the wave
display and using that it's the kind of
portal into your into your track do you
have any sort of plans for interaction
between different devices or is that
sort of on your outlook we've thought
about it I mean I think the whole audio
syncing like Layton sees we obviously
want to keep everything like as close to
real-time as possible that's that's one
challenge we don't we won't have
anything in the first version but I
think this whole notion of just having
your devices in your pocket and
especially amongst DJ's it's I can
definitely see that coming in the future
so attractive DJ for iPhone is in the
App Store today mm-hmm what are we
looking at as far as price yeah it's
gonna be $4.99 it's it's gonna be a
separate app just for the iPhone okay so
here you already have Traktor DJ for
iPad this is a separate Buy
mm-hm and it's probably well worth the
price yeah and it's a great I mean also
if you just want to try it out it's it's
much cheaper than the iPad version Jim
thanks very much for sharing this is
awesome it's that one of those days I've
been waiting for for actually quite a
long time awesome always a pleasure</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
