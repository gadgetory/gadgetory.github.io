and photo sharing with more than 700
million people using it every month and
they're putting up 2.5 million posts and
links and comments and photos every
month to you'd think that would be a
pretty popular app but there's no app
for that yet but Facebook is trying to
fix that that services groups and until
now it's been buried a few levels deep
inside Facebook's apps seriously this is
how you get to it you open the app then
you tap over here to more then you
scroll down to find your groups then you
tap on a group so this is a groups app
you've got a bunch of little Facebook
groups each with our own bubble you can
reorder them you can search for groups
and you can make new groups when you tap
into a group it looks and acts just like
the Facebook newsfeed but unlike the
newsfeed to the rules of the group make
it really easy to know who can see your
stuff it's either public closed or
secret closed groups can be searched and
found and you can see use in them but
you need an invite to actually see
what's inside them secret groups are
just plain secret whenever you make a
new post there's a big indicator telling
you who can see it just like with
Facebook you can put up photos and
comments tag your friends and scroll
through it just like the main newsfeed
there's practically nothing new here at
all it's all just stuff you've done
before in the app just better there are
a few gestures to help you get around
some subtle sound effects and in general
it's just faster than the main Facebook
app for example it's easier to see who's
in a group and mess around with
notification settings and permissions
and all the other stuff you might want
to change than a group Peck you can even
add an individual group directly to your
home screen it wouldn't be a standalone
app let a bunch of tabs and so here they
are there's a tab that collate all your
notifications a tab for discovering new
groups and a tab for settings Facebook
isn't getting rid of the groups in the
main app unlike what it did with
messenger that's probably a relief for
those 700 million users but for people
who use groups a ton the new app might
be better it gives you a chance to
better manage all your notifications so
you don't miss out on anything from your
most important groups but you can skip
past the other stuff Facebook was hoping
you're gonna use it with your family
your groups of friends and maybe even
with your significant other and if
they're right a few years from now that
700 million might be over a billion
that's a lot of pictures of breakfast
