the company announced two new consoles
first one kind of ready knew about in
the leaked PlayStation 4 slim as the
name suggests it's just a slimmer
version the current PlayStation 4 that's
actually coming out September 15th
really soon for $300 there's a hundred
lower than it used to be the big news
however PlayStation 4 Pro once it's
called codename neo then the PlayStation
4 is not actually a new consoles just a
slightly upgraded version of the current
floor in fact all the same games will be
compatible across both what you get with
the floor pro however is certain future
games will be 4k HD are compatible
actually the original will be HD are
compatible soon - with a firmware
upgrade with the four probe you get 4k
gaming certain games will be upgraded
the place to be I will have more
graphical power other things the
PlayStation 4 pro has it's a terabyte
hard drive and it will have a new
Netflix and new YouTube app really
promoting the pork a Content push and
again the kind of the reason to get a
four pro at this point is to just really
make the most of a 4k television set if
you don't have a 4k this is probably not
the thing you want to get but what
playstation is trying to do what Sony's
trying to do right now is kind of the
iPhone upgrade model it is better if you
have the rice TV and if you don't you're
not missing much yet however that being
said at 400 ollars it's not a bad way to
kind of enter in future-proof some of
the game you want to do going forward is
pass solves the chicken the egg problem
bigger surprise and that is the place
before Pro is coming out this year
November 10th in fact and again it's
taking the Pointer dollar price tear
that the original PlayStation 4 had if
you don't need that then you don't feel
like you're getting before case anytime
soon get this limb it's cheaper
