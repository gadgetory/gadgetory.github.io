he's a brilliant guy the principal
researcher at Microsoft he's making some
frankly bizarre stuff and I'm looking
forward to this conversation please
welcome Andy Wilson from Microsoft all
right thanks
no pressure no pressure you have to
one-up battleship oh you do that I'll
try actually kind of low pressure ah so
Andy these guys don't know you maybe
they know you a little bit we did a
video uh months ago like a year ago or
something yeah then I thought was really
came back yes I did yeah I came to visit
your home away from home your lab yeah
which you actually do a lot of fun you
do live there right yeah pretty much
tell me what you do where how did you
how did you start doing this and what do
you do at Microsoft and give me your
give me a little your backstory so I'm a
researcher at Microsoft Microsoft has a
big research group of about 850 PhD
level folks doing research on all sorts
of things I'm mostly interested in
natural user interaction and different
ways that we can exploit sensing
technologies and display technologies in
in completely novel ways and we make the
way that we relate with computers so a
lot of the things you saw there are
prototypes where we believe very firmly
and building things and playing with
them and to sort of finding our way
through all these new things just by
experimenting and trying as many things
as we can and your work is I mean from
what I saw and some of the stuff we're
going to show today your work is really
about I mean we're very used now to
these kind of we have a screen or we
have something in front of us we have
some in our hand and we interact with
that we're kind of like going into that
interface your stuff is like taking that
interface out into the world I mean a
lot of what you do is is it's like
projecting on to the world basically in
making the world the interface where
does that where does that instinct come
from I mean what is that what is the end
game for you with that so that's right
so so I like to call it beyond the
surface Sam so I worked on the first
version of surface and the one that used
a video camera is the large 30 inch
tabletop and so for me it's always been
about what can we do with sensing
technologies and interesting ways and
for me the work that we've done with
depth cameras for example you know lifts
all of the interaction we're getting off
of touchscreens out into the real world
and that's where we really live we don't
live in the the flat plane of a display
we live in the real world let's bring
the sensing and display into our real
world I mean
you headed up the surface project that
when it was a large table so I did the
very first prototype and a couple of us
a couple guys and I did the first
efforts around surface and building the
first product it was a lot of fun was it
painful to watch microsoft introduced a
tiny tablet called the surface to that
don't know it was very flattered that
they decided to reuse our name i thought
that was a great choice but now you
can't call the surface to surface that's
right there that's that there's that
ring that does that hurts doesn't it a
little bit you can share not is no
judgment here in this room okay so you
also incorporate a lot of connect sort
of like technology and into what you're
doing is connect the first I mean that's
you know there aren't many consumer
products that are actually utilizing the
physical around you not yet to be is
that the first step do you see that it's
just like that you know Oh point version
2.1 of this absolutely is it's the
opening opening move and a thinking a
great you know Renaissance and natural
user interfaces you know people have
been doing this research for a long time
I was a graduate student at MIT Media
Lab in the 90s and what we were doing a
lot of this hand tracking kinds of
things and interacting with with things
on screen that now you can go out and
buy it's really nice to be able to see
that move from the lab gosh just taken a
little while but now it's like it's now
that its commodity at least in for
certain kinds of applications let's
think about other applications where
that where this would actually be useful
can is this the kind of thing that you
would find in a in a conference room at
a workplace or get to be excited when I
hear that with would we find this in a
conference room probably yeah I'm
working is there anything more exciting
than something in the conference room I
mean I know that's up here that's like
you're in the papers I know you're in
bright orange on the conference room
tech but like can we go to read what
about for the home what about for the
kitchen friend yeah kitchen is a nice
one because you know you don't want to
get your hands all dirty on the on the
touch pad right so maybe you maybe you
put that on the on your table top in the
in your in your your kitchen counter and
you actually lay out the recipe and the
things that you need and we have a we've
had a few demos over the years on
Microsoft where you it would be really
fun for kids you set out the recipe and
the ingredients for the recipe and kids
get that and then yeah sure can I pitch
an idea to you go ahead of the kitchen
let's hear it so I'm imagining something
like
you know these tentacles hanging down
over your over your kitchen work surface
and then you use some kind of motion
tracking the tentacles are all full of
different spices oh and use the motion
tracking you put a chicken or something
underneath and then you just kind of
minority report the spice is all over it
excellent do they get something you
could work on or absolutely we actually
have complete make that happen I just
can do for me we actually have some
video stuff that you that you couldn't
bring with you yeah this thing is called
a Bhima Tron can you explain this is the
be mature on that's the Bema Tron and so
with that the Bema tryna is a pan tilt
motion platform kind of like what you
see at rock concerts with lights except
we replace the light with a projector
and a depth camera and so what we're
doing is projecting the car and the car
responds to the real world just as as if
it were a real model you know
radio-controlled car and so by using the
the pan tilt movement we can actually
get all the way through the room we can
project a graphic into this person's
hand and move that that graphic from one
hand to the other here's a shot another
shot of the of a ramp she has a terrible
driver yeah absolutely so so the idea
really is to bring the the interaction
out into your entire world so with one
camera one projector in this this motion
platform we can we can you know track
these people there's we can project
graphics on to this person and reacted
appropriately she can actually pull
graphics from the wall and send them
from one place to the next and like a
spice yeah sure for instance you do that
you can track that the get the Korean
yeah exactly paprika boom tentacle down
onto the chicken why not uh and then you
have another one but you have another
one that we have video of which is
called the hollow flector can you tell
me a little bit about this this is like
this freak this is insane so this is not
done on post right this is actually
video shot of the of a mirror and I'm
standing in front of the mirror and then
I'm interacting with this this graphics
and this little bit like the peppers
ghost illusion you might have seen it
and you know a Disney theme park it's a
little different but we can superimpose
graphics on to it and so it's really
augmented reality but in a very large
form factor and we're incorporating some
some concepts from the phone here's you
know maybe I'm doing a little
holographic phone calls is actually
connect record at you
that's you talking that's me holding
yourself this is my little Maj to the
princess land you know a little that's a
little weird yeah uh so-so but you
brought something today I did in the end
and we should take a look at it let's
let's check this out what is it called
what did you bring this is the wearable
multi-touch projector okay I'm gonna
come up with a better name for that is a
wearable multi-touch projector at least
check this let's check this out yeah
help
this is handsome this is nice now now
now uh what did you say this is called
again we call this the wearable
multi-touch projection we got to come up
but once she's caught the predator the I
mean it's kind of I don't know yeah a
little bit looks a little bit it looks a
little bit violin see this is kind of
like a connect here it is basically like
the kinect uses the same technology it's
a short-throw version of connect right
so it actually works in this sort of arm
reach volume just a very in front of me
and you think in the future everybody'll
have like a lenovo laptop hanging off of
there hanging off of their side is that
is this the future i feel like we build
prototypes right and i'm just starting
the projector there's also a laser
projectors it appears at a pico
projector projector okay great and so
this is our this is actually our second
prototype the first one we built
actually just connected to it so we have
a desktop that was hanging off every way
so it brings like a full name eat our
meals and you have like a little
assistant to carry next to your a second
one of course if we were to consider
product izing this i mean we would not
have this this is but this is a really
nice setup because we can actually you
know right like really sloppy code and
get that running on here and yeah and do
all the experiments we wanted so you met
your code is sloppy abscess fine nothing
wrong with that re so show us what this
thing ok what this thing does so when
tell me why it does right so this is the
idea is to bring some of the interaction
into the world so we can actually co-opt
surfaces in the world and I'm gonna lean
over here and start this and it'll take
a moment to start hopefully and just now
what version of windows is this this is
one of seven actually uh-huh so I'm
sorry I've been upgraded yet huh nyan
nyan interesting ok so we're using the
depth camera to roaring that completely
yeah exactly all right that's it so here
I am so I'm gonna touch this the wall
here you notice that I get a bit of a
menu okay it's a little bit like our
voices the new windows phone 8 I
dressing about so and you notice that as
I move back and forth hoops they're just
disappeared that's all right we can
start that again and as I move back and
forth that actually stays the same size
we're actually using the depth camera to
rectify or make it appear as if the
graphics are the same size are actually
the real goal would be to stabilize it
so it feel feels like there's actually
painted on the wall so what I'm going to
do is show you a couple things there's a
phone icon we can actually touch this
and there's this ubiquitous slide so
Oh ubiquitous that's it that is a patent
case right there Apple are you watching
because you can have to you're going
down you're done I even bother I would
just I just find to take whatever money
is in your bank account right now and
said yeah right so we have a dial pad
here so we can do the kind of expected
thing you notice there's this sort of
red red ball here and that's showing me
where it thinks my my finger is an
actual phone number well I gosh I hope
not keep going yes okay let's call
someone and I'm just dialing a random oh
he's gonna call the number because this
actually capable of dialing it is not
that way so that's that's just something
we've been playing around with but it
gives you an idea of the sensing
technology that we have so we can do a
few other things oh by the way it's
multi-touch right so in we know what if
my finger got in here what do it happens
this guy you might try a min if you come
and you know yeah that's it is working
yeah I thought you might erase this yeah
yeah absolutely this is horrible what
you've drawn it yeah I mean see if I can
do me see if I can do something yeah so
it works a little bit better if you come
in from the side or a flat oh there we
go so and that has to do with the way
the algorithm that we've run let's give
draw face but that's obliterated right
ah you notice that I'm actually so I'm
stopping each of the little demos when
you by putting my hand over the cameras
kind of a funny thing to do but it's a
way for us to reset the system I'm gonna
show you a couple more things okay great
so we have yours here's your map and
again as I move back and forth Apple
might want to also take out of it and so
it's multi touch as well and so I can
scroll around and there we go so that's
the map and not nothing surprising there
and then let me show you guys see the
Hoover Dam on that as well as he was
intact so there's a couple of other
things that we can do one is of the
notion of being able to invoke an
application just by drawing the space in
the world that you want to see that see
it and that's not be the space that you
want yeah it's what you're saying yeah
so can you tell me what that so tell me
what the practical what you envision a
practical application for this is what
is it what are the typical yeah exactly
something like that so Ashley its
currency converter that's great yeah so
that's it give me a price oh I'm walking
a night in the future when these are
just commonplace yeah we're give me a
scenario where this is becoming you know
I need this so a good one would be you
know where we just met and we're you
know maybe we met in the hallway and
we're you know I want to show you
something over here and i want to show
you it in the large I don't want to like
you know huddle around the tiny little
phone right and actually throw this up
on the wall and lamb ajan that's bigger
and brighter and all these things
projector technology is going to get
better of course then we can interact
with this as if it were a real you know
large multi touch display right right so
it to the guys like a guy just met this
nerd with this thing on it now it now
you wants to show me something exactly
that's right but of course everybody
will have that well imagine it's a tiny
thing maybe it's actually fits in the
end you know in a button on your shirt
you the entire the entire thing and a
button on your shirt yeah you think we
can get there I think I think so in a
matter of time yes and all of these
things that I'm showing you here are
really small when you sort of take them
in the women I mean the pico projector
is just a there's not even a lands on a
pico projector right oh we can you show
the audience turn around here I just
want you guys to see you're seeing the
back but do you see this whole setup
here I mean the idea that this could get
down to the size of a button seems
frankly like a pipe dream are you on any
dope right now but look at the size of
the first cell phones right and look at
what with her that's right now that's
layer originally like this tall they'd
have wheels on them I mean if you turn a
thing Oh thing with a wire that came out
you took a modern cell phone showed it
to somebody from you know 30 years ago
they'd be like what is this alien
technology you're showing me right it
does look it does look alien well this
certainly does Yeah right let me let me
show you one more thing okay and so we
set this and then I just want to give
you a little bit of an idea of the
processing that we're actually doing so
this is just a display that shows the
the fingertip tracking and you notice
there's it's multi-touch and then as I
reach in it goes from hover state to a
touch state and its we doing two at once
and then finally on the back out it one
more time and real quick I want to show
you the nature of the processing that
we're doing and this is this is
basically just showing you the depth
stream that we're getting from the
Kinect camera Wow right I can I get in
here you can get in there right and so
you get an idea of some of the
processing that we're doing do you want
to
yeah I don't know I don't know what this
Liz I'm exactly but that's all right
shows you in this out yeah that's right
now it's gone yeah who's gonna get too
far away it's too I was too funky for it
which is a problem a lot of people
feeling too funky and then and the
sheets and the other thing that we've
been studying is the idea that we can
actually project onto anything not not
just a whiteboard or a wall or something
like that and and then we can we can
actually track this you know this
notepad for me I won't actually use that
is why you tripping me out and so we can
actually do slide to a lot of ubiquitous
so i doing law you band then but and
then we can even do it on your back so
it was a turnaround on my back yeah yeah
so freaking kinda like where this is
headed potentially joining to take my
pants off oh you know I get this to work
okay right so yeah there we go so
alright coops a little bit lower i have
a little bit of back pain tonight yeah
right there it's perfect there was a key
press really hard on oh you'll slide
them off yeah right is it so literally
we can use any surface available in his
slide to unlock supposed to make you
sexually aroused is that saturday
alright that's very cool get stuck very
cool just turn around here let me just
uh Andy Wilson everyone Andy Wilson and
his
and
uh and we never we never did come up
with it we never did come up with a name
for this huh and I call it the sex
machine that cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
