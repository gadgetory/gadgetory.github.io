usually all about connecting people
through technology it's amazing and
inspiring but the enormous benefits of
the internet come with dangers as well
sixty-five percent of internet users
aged 18 to 29 that reported being abused
or harassed online and it's worse for
young women and minorities so this year
Intel recode and vox media herejust
parent company a partner on new
initiative called pack harassment which
aims to fight the effects of abuse and
harassment online the plan is to hold a
series of hackathons throughout the year
with a major progress report in May at
the code conference i sat down with kara
swisher the executive editor rico and
brian krzanich the CEO of Intel to talk
about hacking harassment and what they
hope to achieve the internet creates an
environment where people could do
whatever they want it really does and
sort of ugly size them come out in a way
they wouldn't in civil society and so
one of the things we have to do is try
to create one tools to help people who
are the victims of this and secondly
make these companies aware that this is
an important topic for everybody who's
using their their things from facebook
to Google to snapchat to anyone else so
what's the goal of the hackathon so
you'll be doing throughout the year you
know I think there's there's really two
goals in the hackathon first there are
potentially some genuine technical
solutions we can come up with there may
be things like identifying key words
phrases actual context their messages
and telling the person that may be
interpreted as harassment and and giving
them that feedback before they
that might slow things down the second
part of the hack the harassment is just
getting a word up at the end of the day
I think we can make a lot of technology
they can reduce the harassment levels
but it's gonna be when the peer pressure
when it just becomes unacceptable
societally that's when harassment will
really change it really sounds like what
you want is to for these companies to
commit to building tools for the users
to control those easy tools not tools
they have tools they're just hard to use
I they still I just the other day I had
an incident with someone on Twitter and
it was really difficult and I'm good at
this if I can't figure it out the
average teenager who's getting you know
pilloried on Facebook or Twitter or
wherever has no hope of being able to do
this except to sign off and that
shouldn't be the only choice you have is
to sign off so at the code conference in
may the goal is to present some findings
and some concrete steps forward what are
you hoping to announce that what what if
you could get everything you wanted what
would you be announcing and it goes like
this what I'd love for the maid code
event is to see that the partner list of
exploded so that there's tens if not
hundreds of partners that are really
joining forces and that we've done a
couple of these harassment the hot dog
restaurant events and and we have a
couple of solutions so we can start to
talk about and say these are some things
we recommend that sites like your own
and and like ours can start to implement
and help technically reduce the amount
of harassment as well look online
harassment is a real problem there's a
lot of work that needs to be done to
solve it obviously the Verge's part of
ox mania and I'm proud to be partners in
the hacker assmann initiative but there
are still a lot of questions need to be
answered a lot of solutions that need to
be developed and a lot of partners have
to sign up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
