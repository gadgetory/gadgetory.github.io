we're here at Google i/o and we are
checking out Google where 2.0 this was
just announced on stage it is the next
generation of Google's wearables
platform and the company says it's the
biggest update to the platform in since
its launched it has a bunch of new UI
features so you can see there's a new
controls using physical buttons this
particular watch has a button on the
side that launches the new app launcher
which you can see has kind of this new
carousel feature which is very cool very
slick push that back and go back to your
watch face and what's really neat here
are these complications that let you tap
into apps directly from any watch face
so this is a to-do list from todoist
that's been set up on this particular
one you can add tasks you can add your
water intake for other apps as well and
a bunch of different things that
developers will be able to plug into and
add more complications it's pretty
similar to what Apple is doing the Apple
watch but it's cool to see this in both
third-party watch faces and with
third-party apps another thing that is
new is the way you can reply to messages
so if we go to hangouts here you can
reply to messages using a new tracing
keyboard which is a little wild there's
a full keyboard on the there as well as
a new handwriting recognition thing so
you can write words on your on the
screen there with your finger and send
it away that's different from the emoji
recognition system that's been there
before so those are both new and you
can't back button to go back as well
overall on this particular watch this is
the LG watch urbane LTE which means that
it has a bunch of settings that you
might not find on a Wi-Fi only watch you
can use this watch without your phone
connected and there's a bunch of new
things for that but the UI is actually
pretty slick and pretty quick it's much
more responsive than I'm used to on the
we're watching I wear everyday the other
thing that's new here is there some new
Fitness features where it will
automatically detect new things like
strength training exercise so if you're
doing pull-ups or bicep curls or
deadlifts or something like that that
watch can now automatically identify
that in addition to the other activities
that it's already there google says that
Android wear 2.0 will be available later
this year but if you're a developer you
should be able to start downloading it
today and get it running on your watch's
already so there you go that's a quick
look at Android wear 2.0 for from Google
i/o I'm Dan Seifert thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
