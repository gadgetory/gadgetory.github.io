it live it do it live
I keep on writing and we'll do it live
 thing sucks
I'm John Borthwick and I am CEO of bata
works
we bought Digg because it is a it's a
wonderful iconic web 2.0 brand the site
was scheduled to be shut down at the
beginning of August so we realized that
we had to run very fast in order to
rebuild Digg we decided to write the
whole thing from scratch and we knew
that we had a great data set that could
identify what our popular stories in the
internet and we knew that we wanted to
have an editorial touch to curate that
we have three editors really with their
finger on the pulse of what's going on
right now we could have bought the site
and like you know plastered more ads on
it or done something kind of like just
completely commercial but yeah we truly
want to build something that people love
again and come back to we think that
mobile is key for everything in software
these days everybody's on the go you
always have this thing in your pocket
you can turn on paperboy and Digg which
will let you basically set different
locations like your home or office and
then whenever you leave those two
locations will automatically update with
the latest news
I'll get your reading list as well and
you can read that offline on the subway
or whatever in terms of sort of
developing the website and the iPhone
app simultaneously we had about six
weeks to do it but we used a lot of the
infrastructure and code that we've built
for news me and adapted it to this new
platform that we built news that me it
is still a social news aggregation
product where we look at social signals
on Twitter and Facebook
basically the conversation that your
friends are having and the internet as a
whole to figure out hey what's great
content that you should be reading it
seemed like a good fit for us to sort of
work on Digg with the experience we've
had with social web and real-time news
so yeah the news not me team is now the
digg.com team 92 percent people wouldn't
recommend the current Digg to their
friends so that can give us some license
to really go far and with the redesign
it was really you know looking at the
current version of Digg looking at
people's reactions to like the whole
Digg design like iterative process and
how people react to the things and what
they reacted positively to and what they
reacted negatively to and saying people
didn't really like the Digg bar at all
like we didn't like it and the public
didn't like it so why support it so in
some cases like it was really obvious
what we you know knew we weren't gonna
build in other cases it was a little
tougher like things like comments which
are important for community we felt like
we had to you know take a pass on for
now we had to make a decision that we
wouldn't adopt the existing
infrastructure and it was really a
decision about being able to turn dick
back into a startup I mean in the end I
think people have to be able to come to
to dig and find stuff that they can't
find it anywhere else you know that's
that's sort of what Digg was about in
the past and I think that's what that's
one thing that we have to continue to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
