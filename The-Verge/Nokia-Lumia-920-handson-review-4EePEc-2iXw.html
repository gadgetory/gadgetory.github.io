and this is the Nokia Lumia 920
launching this month on AT&amp;amp;T it's a new
flagship phone running Windows Phone 8
and it's sort of a second coming for
both Microsoft and Nokia the first thing
you notice when you pick up the phone is
it's a tank it's a really really big
phone it's really heavy it clocks in at
a hundred and eighty five grams which is
actually more than 50% heavier than the
iPhone 5 there's a couple of reasons for
it to be so big one is it has a wireless
inductive charging on the back and two
is that it has this a pure view camera
it's an 8 megapixel camera but what's
special about it is that the lens is
actually seated in some Springs that
keep it steady for longer shots and that
adds quite a bit of thickness to the
phone and actually if you shake the
phone you can even hear the lens
bouncing around inside there so let's
talk about the standout feature of the
phone the other PureView camera of
course you can launch it with the
shutter button and again the way it
works is the cameras mounted in Springs
so when you take a shot the shutter
stays open for just a little bit longer
and I found that hitting the shutter
button makes it so it you get a little
bit of shake but if you do tap to take a
picture you can get some really really
good shots it's incredible in low-light
and it also does very good job of
stabilizing for when you're shooting
video so you can see for example here we
took us and low-light shots last night
and it does a very good job in near
total darkness in fact it gives you
pictures that are brighter than what the
human eye can see when you're not in
ridiculously low light situations and
you're just taking pictures like you do
with the camera phone they come out
really really well I will say the colors
are a little bit muted but that's kind
of just nokia style but I mean
everything is really sharp everything is
really crisp and I'm really impressed
with this camera and you should be too
so the screen on the Nokia Lumia 920 is
a 4.5 inch screen at 1280 by 768
resolution and Nokia has a couple of
technologies that they talk about the
first is it's clear black which is a
polarizing layer that makes the blacks a
little bit darker it's not quite as dark
as it was on the 900 but of course that
was an AMOLED display whereas this is an
IPS LCD display I think it has really
great colors on it I'm really happy
with it the other thing is called a pure
motion HD Plus which is Nokia
guaranteeing that frame rates won't dip
below I think it's 60 frames per second
and it you won't see blurring when
you're scrolling suffering on the screen
and I mean it's there right there's very
very little blur at all as you move
stuff around or as you open up apps
everything is very very crisp and sharp
and to be honest it's really nice to
finally see Windows Phone on a
high-resolution display we've been
waiting for it for a long time it's a
much nicer experience so the other big
thing about the 920 is that it's based
on Windows Phone 8 the latest version of
Windows Phone the big thing about
Windows Phone is they spent a lot of
time re architecting it from the ground
up to share the same core as Windows 8
and what that means is you can have
faster processors bigger screens and
faster Hardware iterations in terms of
actually user experience it's very
similar to Windows Phone 7.5 now you get
these smaller live tiles
there's the Kids Corner but the
important thing for the 920 is there's a
whole bunch of custom Nokia apps so
you've got Nokia Maps which is a
iteration on Bing Maps that has a couple
nice usability tweaks like you can
scroll up from the map view to see local
places Nokia also has included their own
driving directions and transit
directions which is a essential thing
I'm smartphone if you ask me and then
there's also Nokia music which is a free
music streaming service which is pretty
cool but not really important anymore
for most people since Microsoft has
finally got Xbox music streaming set up
properly as nice as Windows Phone 8 is
it still has some of the same problems
that Windows Phone 7 does if you miss
notification and you don't have a live
tile for it it's basically gone and the
app selection it's not quite there it's
getting better but the real problem is a
lot of the apps don't feel as up-to-date
as they do on other platforms but you
know if you're choosing Windows Phone 8
you're basically choosing to make a
compromise and the 920 is also about
compromise you're compromising having a
small and light phone for a really
really good camera it's a big and bulky
phone primarily because of the
incredible camera here if you're willing
to make that compromise if you really
want that camera I think you'll find
that you'll come to have a real affinity
for the phone especially because it has
such really good industrial design but
if the camera is not a must-have for you
there are smaller and lighter options
Nokia's Lumia 920 is out in Europe this
weekend
18 DS version is only due sometime in
November we still don't have a firm
price or release date</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
