with a sequel to the reboot that's now
cannon to an earlier trilogy that may or
may not matter now he's giving me that
one more time please stay with i'm
russell brandom and this is 90 seconds
on the verge Days of Future past is the
seventh x-men film from Fox in 14 years
based loosely on the comic book
storyline of the same name the movie has
Wolverine traveled back in time to stop
the creation of the Sentinel robots that
by 2023 render mutants extinct in humans
of press in the comics whose kitty pryde
who traveled but whatever it's a direct
sequel to 2011's first class a reboot
set in the early 60s but seeing as time
travels involved it's also a chance to
bring back the pass to the first three
films that means to Professor X's and
two magnets just one Wolverine them Hugh
Jackman is ageless Days of Future past
also marks the return of director Bryan
Singer who held the first two excellent
films he then went on a directed
disappointing Superman reboot while
Brett Ratner stepped in for the equally
disappointing x men the last stand so
the original cast returns but what about
the story where does the original
trilogy fit frankly that isn't clear is
it still canon or does it live in some
alternate timeline like JJ Abrams Star
Trek movies in this case do yourself a
favor put her side logic regardless the
x-men series will live on Fox is already
planning two more films including a
sequel called apocalypse due out in 2016
expect many more to follow just remember
no matter what there's one linchpin one
constant face through it all excuse me
i'm erik lehnsherr to examine yourself
for more on x-men check out the verb
coming up a new daredevil Phil just
kidding I would be terrible</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
