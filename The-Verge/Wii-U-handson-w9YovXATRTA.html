we're here checking out the Nintendo Wii
U reference model this is not the final
product but it is indicative of the
experience you're going to have playing
with it so what you have here is a 6.2
inch single touch screens resistive
going around the sooner we have two
analog sliders you have d-pad your
general buttons Mike headphone jack what
you expect triggers over here the other
interesting aspect about this besides
the fact it's you know it's got the
accelerometer gyroscope the other
interesting thing you have here is a
front facing camera and this bar here
actually acts as a wii remote sensor
just like it does for the week so you
can use this to get you know use the wii
remote in tandem one of the things they
show it off at e3 was I'm actually
putting it down like this grabbing a wii
remote and kind of playing golf it would
detect your swing but right now we're
going to go take a look at for demos
these are the same demos they showed III
so we're looking at here is chase me
chase me is one of the wii u experiences
in 10 wants to show off to basically
showcase the new tablet controller what
you do here is it's basically a
glorified hide-and-seek so here's me so
i'm gonna have this top-down view right
here and I've got 15 seconds basically
get out of their line of sight now if
you look at the screen real quick you
can see everyone's got its kind of
first-person perspective of what's going
on everyone else is controlling with the
wii remote exactly remote you use
mminton newly I'm doing with tablet I'm
gonna be lookout in the tower he's
coming down the red middle of rental
alright so what will account now is
battle me in which are our little samus
aran's fight a giant spaceship which is
gonna be played this time by me seeing
as last time I got sadly defeated over
and over and over again we use in floor
I've actually got a move the whole
control actually quite a extreme bid I
mean my whole body probably gonna go a
little bit with this
as I am tilt to aim the joysticks here
just serve to move the spaceship it
actually doesn't control and uh viewing
ok God you got to get and lows helpful
oh look at a heart piece oh there you go
so one player is out now and that makes
two players out myself any other one so
what were the count now is panorama view
which Nintendo claims was at the e3
advantage unfortunately never got a
chance to see at that point so this is
brand new for us in a nutshell you can
see on the TV is just a car drive and we
think is a car driving along the streets
and from here you can actually get a
more interactive view where you can
actually just kind of rotate see
basically all sides of the street think
it is like a real-time google street
view and goes up and i can do it on the
interesting is no matter how far I go
down I can never ever see the driver in
question also if I actually did rotate
like this in a car I'd probably be dead
at this point so the last thing we're
going to look at is the HD experience
what we're seeing here is basically an
example of what do we use powers can be
capable of whereas the wii was decidedly
more of a standard definition console
this time around antenna wants to
emphasize it's capable of 1080p HD true
HD graphics so we're seeing here is a
very high quality legend zelda demo it's
actually basically everyone's dream and
when we first saw d3 everyone's question
was is it's going to be an actual game
nintendo won't say that but they will
let you watch the demo over and over
again we have a lot of controls around
we can use the stick to just the camera
angle ever so slightly but with a camera
but we can actually completely
dramatically change where the scene is
happening additionally with the with
light we can change the entire thing
from 90 today and we're all this is
happening in real time and you can see
especially the nighttime you can see how
the light is bouncing off everything
especially nabi kind of flying around
there the last thing to show around
where you can see is where the camera
were linked in with the bosses if we hit
this button here will actually take the
entire video feed and we'll move it here
it's actually a mirror what you see on
screen they moved the map on the screen
as well but they also showing both
videos at the same time you can see it's
the exact same picture being output no
change in the frame rate it's also very
smooth lighting is gorgeous and there
you have a list give link a break so
that's the wii u controller nutshell
again this is not the final product but
it does give a good idea what the
experience you're going to go for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
