what I have here is the samsung galaxy
s6 edge+ and it's a lot like last
version but just a little bit bigger
this is a 5.7 inch quad HD AMOLED
display so a little bit bigger than the
5.1 inch display we had on this it said
otherwise everything here hardware-wise
looks exactly the same we have a 16
megapixel camera on the back and a 5
megapixel camera on the front one of the
biggest difference is this time around
is with the edge screen this is
something that people had complaints
with the s6 edge and with the note edge
as well it's just how much utility can
you get out of having this screen that
curves around the sides of the device
and what Samsung has done this time is
not only can you access contacts from
the edge screen you can now also quick
launch apps and you can do this no
matter where you are in the phone so say
you're browsing in chrome you can swipe
it from the side and quick switch to
Instagram since we've got a bigger
device if it's uncomfortable to reach
all the way up to swipe now you can
actually move the position of the edge
screen quick launcher and access it from
top to bottom or anywhere in the middle
one of the other neat things in the
software is the ability to live
broadcast to YouTube this is going to be
available on the s6 edge+ as well as the
galaxy note 5 and all you have to do is
tap live broadcasts and you'll be able
to do private streams that are in by
only as well as public streams where you
can share a URL to Twitter Facebook or
wherever and viewers will be able to
just latch right on it can go up to
1080p at 60 frames a second and use both
the front and the back cameras however
all this thing doesn't feel that much
different in the hand than the s6 edge
even though the screen is a little bit
bigger Samsung's going to make this
available on august twenty-first and 32
gig and 64 gig variants for more check
out the verge calm
