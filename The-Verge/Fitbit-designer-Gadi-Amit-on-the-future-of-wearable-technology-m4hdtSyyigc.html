integral part of our lives today it's
not a battle of form and function it's a
symbiotic relationship well most of us
are quite familiar with the products
that we own the design process behind
them is still a bit of a mystery new
deal design scotty ama is one such
designer
he's the mind behind the look of the
Fitbit activity tracker and the Lytro
camera a National Design Award recipient
Amit has extensive experience with how
these very personal products are
conceptualized design and eventually end
up in our hands so for us interesting
topic about design most people look
about look design as something that is
exterior what we're dealing with the
interior with the core functionality
like how you wear it sizes of human body
you know like a ergonomics arrangement
of parts and only then we get to the
perfection of the exterior surface could
you maybe take us through the process of
how you got from conception of the
Fitbit and then to an actual product
that so it's actually an amazing story
so we started with the original Fitbit
and at that time we wanted to rethink
everything that related to was what was
then called pedometers and we wanted to
create something that is very friendly
to the human body we actually thought a
lot about women and how they carry
things and for instance the fact that
this was a clip was driven by that
because women have much smaller pockets
so we ended up with this innovative
design that actually had a unique
architecture with two nodes of
electronics one has a battery that one
to the rest and the latest generation is
dealing with wrist foreign objects you
could imagine five years from now each
one of us will probably have about ten
of these and two or three will be
customized to some physical medical
needs that we have two or three are
basically gun recreational and two or
three or maybe data-oriented identity
authentication and so on
now how much of the design is dictated
by the
Tronics it's a very interesting dialogue
there's obviously core functionality
that we're trying to get into the
product but sometimes the human
qualities are pushing back
for instance discussion about user
interface do you always need the biggest
screen on the planet sometimes you just
need to glance over and get a sense that
you're more or less okay
you walk 5,000 steps so let's talk about
light row
light row is the maybe another very
recent and popular design that you guys
did how much of this design was dictated
by the technology itself the design of
flight Row was driven by a constraint
and constraint was actually the optics
electro-optics so we decided to build on
these and created something that is more
of an extension of the lens so what you
see outside is very much what you have
inside its 2/3 a lens and about 1/3 the
battery in the circuitry it's it's it's
remarkable how much it doesn't look like
a camera yeah in the traditional sense
you know I mentioned earlier the
contrarian view we had alternatives that
were much more camera like the thing is
that we brought this idea which
basically is taken from a very simple
gesture which is the kaleidoscope very
human gesture and we had to prove a lot
and you see a lot of models here a funny
thing is that we still use these small
mock-ups and they are actually very very
informative in in decision-making
so this one is made of like just a block
of foam that's a block of foam with a
tape and a piece of cardboard about this
low-tech as you can yeah the next to it
we jump to like 3d weighted and old CAD
and all that both fit in lighter already
is born of smaller companies working
with large corporations can be difficult
I'm it notes that these smaller teams
have more of a passion for design it
gives the designers more freedom to
express themselves to their products you
know the thing that I really respect
both on Fitbit or light rail or
the new structure these are companies
that create product with a lot of
integrity when you feel the product it
feels like an Apple product doing things
right and doing things with full intent
to be perfect really really important
how do you think Kickstarter and these
crowdfunded kind of indie projects have
changed the look of design and products
for consumers so the one thing that they
do they democratize the entry level for
developers that allows people to bring
ideas directly to the market this is
structure by occipital and it's a
three-dimensional imager in this case
occipital is actually using it as more
for marketing and funding tool rather
than just funding basically opening up
for community but there are people who
basically start funding the company at
Kickstarter with honesty I'm a little
skeptic
there's a limit to what you can do with
this mode and the limits are both on the
level of integrity of the whole venture
you really need to deliver these are
really consumers who are waiting for the
product and so on but one thing to
change it changed a very simple human
problem somebody has a brilliant idea he
or she doesn't get money to fund it he
asks everyone to fund it and it works
that's wonderful
