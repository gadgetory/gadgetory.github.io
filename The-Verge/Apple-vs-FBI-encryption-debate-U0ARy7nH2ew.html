Bernardino terror suspects iPhone now
Apple is arguing that doing so would
make iPhones a lot less secure this is a
huge debate so we're out on the street
to see how people feel about it do you
have any idea I'm talking about no of
anything to do with unlocking the San
Bernardino terrorists iPhones I live in
a buckle apparently no I heard that app
that FBI won an apples to make a back
door so that they can access so that FBI
could access terrorists phones in order
to prevent attacks and stuff like that
okay so that's what I heard like that
was not the response we've been getting
all day but very accurate yeah do you
think Apple should unlock the phone at
the FBI's request I absolutely think
they should unlock the phone for the
safety of Americans absolutely what do
you think I absolutely agree I think if
it's gonna help kind of the FBI with
certain information that they need or
anything like that then yeah they should
be able to lock the one phone so I know
the iPhone this technology is good but
if they got a bit of help New York City
and so Apple is arguing they're arguing
that if they unlocked just the
terrorists phone that that would make it
so that everyone's phones are way less
secure so that other people would be
able to access say your phone's data
that's wrong no I got a phone and so on
I don't want no one listen I don't know
what listening I don't think I like it I
don't think I would want somebody being
able to tap into tap into my phone so as
you opened up the conversation they just
need to create I mean particular kind of
software or maybe a hardware inside the
Apple itself that helps either Apple or
despotic
particularly for FBI
and I just think that they have to be
smart enough people that it wouldn't
have to be a universal key obviously I'm
not in the tech world but I think there
has to be a way
but how Apple could break the security
of this specific phone is less important
than the precedent this decision sets
for the future of privacy on the iPhone
I think I have a bit of an unpopular
opinion okay in the sense that I don't
really have much to hide like yeah I
have pictures on my phone and stuff like
that but I rather save lives than
protect my privacy but I think nowadays
people have lots of private things in
their phone like phone is one a part of
our life like my home worlds my my
everything my personal things are inside
my phone what if somebody unlock it what
what it goes to anyone there will be no
privacy in my life right so I think all
of us he's not a good idea well I'm now
I found user and that that worries me
for sure because I have to think of how
much I actually have on my iPad not even
I'm not talking about like photos and
Facebook and things like that like my
banking information is all on my iPhone
so in that sense like that's scary yes
one thing that we do know is that public
debate is going to play a huge role in
the way that these laws are carried out
and being well informed is going to
prove to be extremely important in the
months ahead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
