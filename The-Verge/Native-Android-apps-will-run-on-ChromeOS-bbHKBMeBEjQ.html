Android closer together and that'll
eventually mean having Android apps
running right on a Chromebook while
still in the early stages google says
the native Android apps such as vine
Evernote and Flipboard will eventually
be able to run on Chromebooks the apps
can appear in a tall phone sized window
or they can be expanded to run as they
would on tablets it's been widely
expected that this would happen
eventually
especially after sundar pichai
previously the head of chrome alone took
control of Android 2 there's still no
word when the future will arrive and
Chrome OS still has some major hurdles
to face mainly these apps were designed
for touchscreens and most Chromebooks
don't have them yes Chrome has been
working with touchscreens since the
Chromebook pixel was released last
February but for the most part the
experience has been unnecessarily
tedious that looks like it's about to
change also Google announced that Chrome
OS will eventually be able to display
notifications from a parrot Android
phone and that a paired phone will be
able to unlock a Chromebook just by
coming near it
thanks to these updates the mobile and
PC divide is continuing to blur</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
