washington DC the capital of the united
states has voted to decriminalize
marijuana by a near unanimous vote the
council ruled that possession and
private consumption of the drug in small
amounts would be a civil offense
resulting in a $25 fine the bill goes
into effect this summer thus making
those family trips of the capital a
whole lot more fun however as DC is
going green nicotine is having a tough
time in la following cities like New
York and Chicago Los Angeles is banning
the use of e-cigarettes in some public
places the City Council voted
unanimously to band quote vaping in
restaurants bars parks and other areas
where cigarette smoking is prohibited
thankfully e-cigarettes will still be
allowed for quote theatrical purposes
mmm the theater lives Wow and finally
Swiss scientists have broken an informal
for decade-long ban on LSD research a
study was conducted in which cancer
patients receive the drug as well as
talk therapy to curb their anxiety about
death a year after the session ceased
those patients who had received a full
dose of LSD experience a twenty percent
improvement in their anxiety levels
while the group who received a lower
dose had an increase in their anxiety
symptoms well the study was small and
the results weren't statistically
significant the fact that the test took
place at all bodes well for psychedelic
drug research as the drug cause no
serious side effects that's it for
today's top stories coming up tomorrow
we check in on meth yep still illegal</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
