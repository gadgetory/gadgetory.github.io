talked about them on the show hable the
watch to watch the starter watch uh they
obviously blew past their funding goals
jam-packed to be clear they wanted to
sell a thousand these watches I sold
80-85 I owls they've hit over 10 million
million u.s. stars so to show that
they're all done they sold itself eight
days to go and they just saw vacation up
they're done they can't make anymore
maybe five thousand eighty five thousand
one hundred and sold before anything is
actually what do you why are we talking
their online to okay okay Eric Eric Eric
from pebble Eric pebble arik air travel
Eric PS can come on the line yeah this
is cool con an exclusive conversation
Eric you're on the line can you hear us
hi how are you now how many bottles of
champagne haven't had today I want to
get a gauge of how much you've been
drinking since discovering that you
level today i've been i've been eating
right next to my desk is a empty bag of
dried mangoes that's what i've been
shutting down is that it was a delicious
is that those get you high yeah right
about okay hey so let me ask you why did
you cut this off it seems like you could
have just kept going forever you already
passed 85,000 but yeah sizable number so
one of the big concerns for us was being
able to source enough components in
short term to complete the build on
schedule and so we really in the
interest of like delivering the absolute
best product to our kickstarter backers
we decided to cough um cut off the
rewards at the moment i'm assuming you
can still like donate a dollar or two
here now you just don't want to watch
are you still getting donations today
like decent amount yeah I think yeah
there were a couple hundred people that
have sort of done a dollar keep on track
but I mean we are committed to selling
more pebbles in the future so for
example as soon as Kickstarter closes
we're going to put up a little page that
lets people sort of get in mind to to
buy one of the first couples when they
are available after Kickstarter so what
so what's the okay so you've got
and million dollars now you don't do
have them you don't actually have the
money yet this thing has to close nope
nope and when we've the project closes
on the 18th okay and that's when
people's credit cards will be as
processed against that and so explain to
me I'm as we receive the transaction so
so explain to me how this works so you
have literally I i I'm not trying to be
you know rude I just want to understand
what happens you now have 10 million
dollars in credit card transactions that
will be what will happen on this date
Kickstarter will charge go from 0 to 10
million in your bank account somewhere
will suddenly have 10 million dollars in
it it's actually an Amazon Payments
account since Kickstarter's partnered
with Amazon to process all their credit
card but like but you will have access
to 10 million dollars when this thing
closes yes our company well hi Thank You
person are you I'm not gonna like I mean
how much of this is just your party but
you to finally close out your prime all
your prime items are you that right good
your witness I actually I actually I
think I should check to see if it's now
going to be like I can just spend a lot
of money on amazon or where they're
actually good you get the money yeah so
I have some I have some questions for
you about the watch I'm really curious
I'm a SmartWatch fanboy I have been and
this is I think the reason this is
caught on us because it has a lot of the
pieces that people have wanted in a
device so the first one is just can you
talk to us about how it actually works
with iOS because that seems to that
seems to be the thing that has made this
one really interesting right is yep so I
think there's there's a car there's some
things I can't really talk about too
much until we've gone through the final
stages of the process but you know II in
Britain briefly you know we've we've you
know we're following the mfi guideline
made for iphone guidelines and I think
one of the things that we've done
differently is we've used a couple
different Bluetooth profiles so in order
to get phone call notification on the
watch we're actually using the hfp
profile of bluetooth that's the headset
profile recent an extensive testing to
show that you can connect to an iphone
with pebble as well as a you know
another headset so on where you can get
caller ID information oh oh that's right
see wait let me just paint this picture
so you have a knife
you've got a bluetooth headset in your
ear and you've got a SmartWatch and
they're both can you get a call then you
answer it with your watch and then begin
talking is that is that correct eric is
that right to you you you get a call
you're notified on the watch you can
answer it on the watch in it and it
bounces it to the head but you can't
them you can't answer like there's no
speaker microphone no no I know that but
you but you take action on the call and
then it bounces the call to the headset
essentially right now we have the color
ID showing up on the watch so you can't
take action on it it's possible that we
made that in we can carry it right now
okay are you have you worked with Apple
on this at all I mean have you has there
been any you probably can't talk about
it even if you did but I just wonder if
there's been any conversation with
anybody there in terms of how example
that what I've just described is a plain
bluetooth spec thing we're also using
another thing that we've done that other
people haven't done is used avrcp the
audiovisual remote control profile to be
able to control music on either phone or
android so these are so these are the
profiles you're using they're not some
sort of custom spec these are no these
are like standard anybody could tap into
this it's just that correct nobody seems
to have done it or done it done it
correctly I've done it went but soda and
then there's a provision where you get
your app gets to run in the background
because it's connected to the watch
right correct so that's really
interesting how did you how did you kind
of negotiate that is that gonna kill
battery life so to negotiate that's
another that's something that came
around with iOS 5 so up until iOS 5 you
know with iris for there were some
provisions for doing background on
stream music like Spotify or if you did
location-aware apps like Foursquare
something like that yeah but there is no
exception or background exemption for
Hardware up until iOS 5 these are but
they run these discrete processes right
i mean they're kind of you know actually
back rounding the entire app your your
band is actually background of that
there's there's some crazy stuff that's
going on the OS but right yeah and so
and so this is so you're you'll be
tapping into that to keep a constant
connection yeah yeah and what is there
is there a battery life concern is there
I mean is what what kind of
what is that put on the phone side no
not in particular I mean we did we
haven't released you know precise uh
numbers but we don't we haven't seen
much is it the equivalent to say when
I'm in my car and you know my phone is
connected obviously via bluetooth mean
similar connection like in terms of
battery life concerns uh probably a
little bit less because with of a car
kit especially when you're making call
with making calls at the constant
Bluetooth connection right all right
ours is very intermittent and you're not
actually you'd use a lot utilizing the
watch for the call so right and then so
the other big piece of news you just had
was you upgrade to the phone the phone
I've by the way I keep calling it a
phone that's so part of fun you should
it's it's Ross as fun to watch you
should make a phone next um just just
can't collapse them all um no so you
just upgraded to bluetooth 4.0 which was
actually the very first when I first saw
the watch I was like well why isn't a
bluetooth 4.0 and then so you kind of
made my day there what do you expect to
me when I think it was a matter of like
you know so when we started up the
Kickstarter project we were estimating
that we were going to be able to
manufacture you know a thousand watches
if we raised a hundred thousand dollars
and so I mean we we obviously had a plat
plan the path for larger amounts of
manufacturing that's what we're pursuing
right now but at the end of the day you
know we were just you know really
hardcore focused on making watches so we
sort of we wanted to bite off what we
could chew and that's why we targeted to
11 + edr to serve with right because I
was available and so I have a question
um is it was the response bigger than
you expected I mean it seems like it was
way bigger than you expected I'd like to
know yeah was it and what yeah what are
you kind of dealing with like what do
you think the cause of it was like what
is it that you did or what is it about
your product that you think is I mean
what have you heard from people they
were like I've got it buy into this like
can you can you communicate that can you
tell me that yeah I mean we're still in
the process of figuring out because
that's going to be a pretty valuable
insight to figure out from what I've
here I mean just just talking about you
know parents and my relatives like this
is the first product that i've created
that really sort of
bit of my hands on Isis oh yeah that's
really cool that means that we're sort
of reaching beyond our comfort zone
which is the tech and the geek in the
gadget guys and you know crossing over
into our mainstream iphone users android
users and so so what what I've heard
from from you know basically my
relatives are some of the people that
have been talking to the most no they
like the idea of customizing their watch
being able to download a different watch
face and right on your watch and I think
that's pretty cool I mean how and how
come fast can you get with this I mean
this is an e-ink display right it's a
paper is it see paper sorry is it is it
yank or is it a paper is it as he has a
tray as a brand is the right is a brand
didn't get the brand name Jesse paper
and and what are you doing in terms of
levels of gray I mean how do you tell
can you go what's the rep you know I
guess there's no such it's just black
and white at the moment oh it is ok and
so and so uh third party faces is that a
thing that you may do yeah definitely
yeah so you might get like bell and ross
or somebody to do a costume like custom
that we're starting with just anyone who
wants to make one concern right writing
a watch face i was thinking you could do
like swatch could be a partner they kind
of funky yeah actually have you talked
to any any watch companies yeah he was
also like damn it we've been trying to
do this for 20 years you would think
that yeah we have what have it were
legit you know like already established
watch companies reached out and said I
don't why I'm saying legit a lot on this
show yeah um school like just Superman
for MC Hammer um have watch him he's
reached out to you guys have you gotten
people sniffing around outgoing hey we
want this technology uh not yet but I'm
sure once they do you know we'd be happy
to chat yeah would you consider
licensing this technology for other for
other devices other watches we haven't
really nailed down no that kind of
future stuff we're really at the moment
just focus on getting these out there
for so what what is what exactly is next
for easy yeah have you is the design
finished are you just wanting to buy the
parts I you try that you're by the more
you buy the poster brothers world but go
ahead and say sorry go ahead hey we're
placing large component orders get
anything getting everything lined up for
starting production now later this
summer so actually I've kind of two
questions ones like kind of minor
and one's bigger and I think the big one
is really interesting so you start out
saying we want to make a thousand
watches we want to prove the model we
want to show people that we can do this
if there's a way to make a better watch
and then you ended up with 10 million
dollars in 85,000 orders what changed
over the course I mean how did you react
to first the first explosion and then
how did you react to kind of okay now we
have to really do this yeah i mean when
you're when you're talking about a
thousand devices that's a that's a
boutique right order as a pretty concept
that's a right i mean that's a very
small run when you get up to what you're
at now you must have had to scale up i
mean the infrastructure to produce
85,000 versus a thousand has got to be
somewhat differently actually when we
started when we started working on
pebble tuples of our you know our second
watch we worked on impulse the
blackberry SmartWatch for a while we
actually so we had design right after
iOS 5 hit last summer we started buying
pebble working this new display that we
had sourced been lined up a manufacturer
we had lined up you know a whole team
for for making sort of a large-scale
product but we just didn't have the
capital to be able to support that you
know we have attempted to raise venture
capital from the VCS and just reward
people to get any any sort of traction
in the Capital Metro capital market so
we had this great plan and with this
great product we just had no cash to be
able to pull it off so we scaled back
our dreams we said ok you know maybe we
had this great sort of wash that we want
to design what's a subset of that what's
what could we launched on you know a
finite amount of money and that's what
we came up with with her you know with
civil so you see you scaled back there's
a difference started as a different
watch is what you're saying it didn't
snow sorry the watch the watch is the
same watch but we scaled our
manufacturing plant ok ok so it's it's
you weren't like we want to do this
crazy watch but we can do half the fee
so do you feel kind of indicated that
all the species turned you down and now
you've like gone to the buckle to be
honest I'm just really happy that I get
to make pebble right I would would have
hated I mean ice I wouldn't have given
up we would have figured out how to get
it you know out there somehow but it
probably would have ended up with just
me making more watches in our garage so
generation so the
18th is when you close right when this
when the kickstarter project closes what
is the very first thing that happens
after that i'm just curious you know
like literal to process literally you
get them you have the money right you've
obviously got the plans for the watch i
assume you know you've got your your
suppliers in place so what is the very
first thing you do you have the money
like how do you start the first dominic
actually happened about four weeks ago
so the day after we opened kickstarter
and you know the first engadget article
hit it sort of exploded and we made
engadget huh but we flip the switch real
rag which that day and gadget you say
it's fine interesting yeah so sure you
put them there i've heard of them I
think sound familiar and and so and so
then and so then the next thing is you
get the money and are you like writing a
check to a supplier is that is that the
next thing do you have to fly due to go
remote reading a lot of different checks
but no so so for example we we phoned up
our contract manufacturer you know the
day after Kickstarter started very like
well we're going to order a lot more
watches we studied that's been in the
works for four weeks the thing for sure
that's going to happen at the end of May
is I'm going to sign several very large
checks for long lead time components
interesting hello Eric did we I hey
sorry ah and and and these are all sold
yeah that's the nice thing he's not like
you're like hey we're going to make
85,000 watches and we don't know we're
going to do with them I mean these are
so so explain to me how that works is
this the watches are manufactured
overseas right yeah okay and then they
just being shipped directly to the
customers uh we're not out of isn't sure
how the logistics will work out but
we'll probably figure it what's the best
way to get them up to all over the world
and following the 85,000 that you've
that you've now sold right they're all
spoken for correct right so beyond that
do you haven't are you planning on
ramping to getting CI are you gonna go
to stores and yeah you distribute these
are gonna talk to this
you can try to put them in apple stores
or bestbuy or you know what's the plan
beyond the Kickstarter people um what
we're building it for production so like
the production setup that will have to
make the Kickstarter batch will be the
same factory the same setup that we
could use to make more watches if you
what's the rant between filling out the
Kickstarter orders and then selling it
to the public yeah having a lot of
people are serious call it is a major
thing at the holidays and we were only I
mean like we're shipping you know in
September and were just you know the
Kickstarter backers of the premier
people so Rankin's watch before anyone
else and if we're able to make more
watches before Christmas you know that's
cool but I'm not as worried about that
as much as just making sure that our
Kickstarter backers are as happy as
possible and it's too late now I can't
get one you're done are we get one for
agent didn't back it well I i did i i i
i i was gonna back it today so now salty
you're gonna hate my gosh Amos you're
gonna hate me Eric but I'm a big fan of
analog watches I actually don't really
like digital watches it oh there's an
analog face now I know that what I want
is a watch this is my dream watch maybe
you'll make it for me I want to watch
you remember you remember the motorola
hora phone that had the circular display
on the front yeah so what I want is a is
a watch that looks like a regular like a
classic watch but the display is a
circular digital display and it looks
like a regular watch until you swipe to
the side and then you get all kinds of
other features or whatever that's my
kind of dream that's the watch that I
think I'm going to be really fall in
love with though perhaps when I see they
have a watch in person and you're gonna
freak out why are you really on a lie
you got away right what color you don't
like a black jet black do you get one no
I I found this I found the story out by
going to the Kickstarter page and
realizing i cant donate i feel by the
way it's rare that you get to talk to
the Creator the back sir side Aaron but
before Derek on the show it's rare that
you get it's rare that you get to talk
to him and tell him that you didn't buy
the product in here first-hand his the
disappointment and some and I think a
little anger actually yeah
opportunity you know if you didn't get
it there's probably a few other people
out there that didn't get it as well
that's right no I mean maybe they'll be
some people for the next batch oh I
think they'll be people for the late I
think you owe for this I two questions
one one from the listeners which i think
is hilarious a second my next question
which is a little question is are you
are you at all worried about like Apple
kind of rejiggering the ipod nano now
that they've seen your success kind of
rejiggering the Nano because already
doing the watch stuff with it to make it
connect with the iphone is that concern
you all are you making our profitability
I that's not super frightened um I think
you know he still has my thousand right
out okay you've got ten million dollars
like you're good right yeah I might be
able to afford one with that haha okay
in the second question and this is from
the listeners are you kind of mad
samsung just released a product called
the S pebble because they did that's
truly just one of the colors like it's a
little mp3 player it's a SS square it's
a tiny little mp3 player that it's
thanks to the phone it's an accessory
for the phone a k-9 tell time it syncs
yesterday ya know it was when they
announced the galaxy s3 it sinks to the
thought that was just a color no no if
you think one of the s3 colors was
purple no it's an accessory for it and
it's like a little square that you used
to play we convince an mp3 file it
controls the music on the phone you know
it's an mp3 player thanks to the phone I
don't understand nobody understands
nobody understands it but it is in your
space now you better watch out yeah will
Google this right now you may have heard
of the small company samsung they're
challenging you on the day pebble well
there's Damon's pebble its pebble no
don't say it looks cool yeah don't give
anybody any you don't give them any
credit stands like Samsung's lawyers
listen to the verge cast now they do
their listen already about it but Eric
listen I'm sure you got you have a
champagne to drink over there and
watches to manufacture so we're gonna
let you go watches to make but um we
would love to have you come on the show
we do this you know on the Virgin we
almost had you guys come on the last one
and it didn't work out uh you don't have
to tell me now but you know hopefully we
can make that happen because we'd love
to talk to you and maybe see a prototype
yeah it'd be cool to show you show you
the the UI as it progresses
the summer and now we drink you know to
the developer kit wonderful that'd be
great hey if you want to come on we have
a show next week hey 17 just start
pimping it now yeah I mean you know
you're welcome want to fly in I want to
check it out anyhow but Eric thank you
so much and we will definitely be
talking to you soon and we're I think
we're all really excited about yes I
think what's cool about this is you know
we cover products all the time and it's
like they're all from big big companies
and I we just had Tony Fadell on the on
the last show and we were talking about
how hard it is to ya to create a
hardware startup and you guys have not
only done you're not only a hardware
startup but you're doing it in a way
that is totally unorthodox and
completely new and i think really
exciting because it's like yeah your
idea is has been validated by a public
by the pub you know the buying public
before you've ever you know put Robert a
road so by the way don't screw it up
because otherwise you know pressure but
just 85,000 people at Ted billion
dollars riding on it so I know that Erik
good luck we're really excited about we
can't wait to watch what you guys are
doing and um anytime you want to talk
where we're happy to do it portrait all
right thank you fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
