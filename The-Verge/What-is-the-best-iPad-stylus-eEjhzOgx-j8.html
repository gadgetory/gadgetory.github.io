today we're looking at the best styli
for your iPad for writing drawing
scribbling sketching or whatever you
need to do we'll be using paper new iPad
app to test out these styli which we
found reproduces marks pretty nicely and
is a good judge of character for these
styli first category we're going to
launch into is the most populous
category of style.i which is the rubber
tipped group the 24.95 value pen is by
far the most distinctive looking stylus
with a round tip and it looks like one
big chunk of aluminum feels really nice
in your hand it's weighted well and
there are no seams at all it is a
hexagonal prism which means it kind of
looks like the old Dixon Ticonderoga
pencil you used to use in school the tip
is really nice except for the fact that
it kind of drags across the screen as
you use it which is unlike some of the
other round tips styli i used but maybe
it's just because i haven't warned it in
that much the $29.99 bamboo by Wacom is
highlighted by 53 and it's promotional
videos for paper for a reason because
it's one of the best styler you can buy
for your iPad it's expensive but it's
exceptionally well rounded as a stylus
it has a removable pen clip it has a
removable tip it's a very nice length it
has a great weight from back to front
and overall it just works very well it
is a smaller diameter rubber tip and
some of the other rubber tips style I
tested and I actually like it better
because it allows you to be more precise
when you're writing or drawing next up
is the Amazon basic stylus which is
exactly as it sounds it's a basic stylus
that you can buy from Amazon it's the
cheapest on our list its eleven dollars
and there's really not much to it it is
a nice enough tip and it's black plastic
body with chrome accents and there's a
little annoying lanyard on the end of it
which we would just rather not have but
besides that it's pretty decent we would
actually expect this to be a little bit
cheaper from Amazon considering what it
is but it's nice to throw in your pocket
it's cheap you won't care if you lose it
and it works
well enough the 1999 stylus from Griffin
is really just like the Amazon basic
stylus but twice the price
there is a dingy little pen clip on here
that's removable but the build quality
of the stylus as a whole isn't very good
and considering it's 20 bucks there's no
reason to buy it the $15 kensington
virtuoso stylus pen combo is a great
deal it's a lot like the Amazon in terms
of performance and the tip but it's
longer it has a soft touch rubber
coating and when you pop off the cap it
actually exposes a pen so it's a really
nice deal for 15 dollars especially
considering the build quality is good
and there's a nice ball clip to attach
it to your pocket the Kensington is
perfect for a businessman with tablet
it's just the same length as the
ballpoint pen you're accustomed to using
the qlh 10 at 1295 is also a great deal
and at half the size it has a textured
grip that I like and the tip is the real
standout feature here because it's about
the same diameter as the bamboo except
it actually has a little nib inside of
it so that when you press it down on the
screen you can actually feel the stylus
making contact with the screen I've read
a few places that after a couple weeks
the tip can degrade down a little bit
but from my experience it worked very
well another key feature is the top that
comes off and the top is attached to a
little string that's attached to a
little plastic dongle that you can plug
into the headphone jack of your iPhone
or iPad next is a brief pitstop in the
lonely foam tip stylist category Pogo
sketch plus is a relic of the old days
where styli were ugly and metallic and
thin and uncomfortable to hold and the
Pogo sketch plus is no different the tip
is made of a conductive foam that you
could buy at the local RadioShack and
it's kind of glued to the tip here in
such a way that it's mushes down when
you use it and it just isn't very
responsive and isn't very comfortable to
use and it just doesn't evoke and
sense of quality it does have a pen
clips you can hold on to it but at $15
it's not a great deal doesn't stand out
in any way and it's the only stylus with
a foam tip which is not good in stark
contrast is the studio neat cosmonaut
which is a big dry erase marker typed
stylus that uses the same rubber tip as
the first category but this time the
rubber tip is embedded which means
there's nothing to poke or lose or smush
down and the cosmonaut has a great tip
because of that it doesn't compress as
much as any of the ones in the first
category cosmonaut is very overt about
its capabilities as a stylus it's not
trying to do too much it's not trying to
let you write in cursive on your screen
it's really just for sketching doing
some casual drawing writing diagramming
it's really great for kids adults the
elderly it's super easy to use it's kind
of like an extension of your finger and
it's kind of a no-brainer and it's
really durable so nothing's going to
happen to this thing it's twenty-five
dollars which isn't cheap isn't
expensive but it's really category unto
its own and finally we have the Adhan it
Jack Pro the jot Pro by Adonit is unlike
any other stylus on the market it really
doesn't look much like a stylus it looks
more like a tool an architect would use
it's really just this long piece of
aluminum with a soft touch rubber grip
that culminates in this pointy end and
the end touches this little plastic disc
that somehow conducts electricity
through the screen and because it's a
clear plastic disc you can actually see
more precisely than any other stylus
where you're writing so I think this is
the most precise stylus you can get but
the plastic discs are fragile they're
going to cost you eight dollars for a
pair of two of them to replace it and
it's you know it looks fragile but it
looks very sturdy one other cool thing
about the jot Pro is that it uses
magnets just like your smart cover to
attach to the side of your iPad and stay
there so your jot doesn't roll off the
table or if you just want to put your
iPad under your arm and walk around with
the jot Pro attached to it and it's cool
it's generally pretty reliable it
doesn't fall off and even if you have a
smart cover on it will generally stay
put one thing to note about the jot Pro
is that it's really not great for
sketching simply because when you're
sketching you're picking up your pen
you're putting it down very quickly and
because the jot Pro connects with your
screen a little piece of plastic there's
actually an audible tapping almost like
you're tapping your fingernail on the
screen every time you pick up and put
down the stylus to sum it up none of
these styli are perfect I wouldn't even
say any of them are stellar because the
fact is it's just not that pleasurable
of an experience to be writing on a
piece of glass no matter what instrument
you're using that's why this is designed
with your finger in mind because that's
really the only thing that feels natural
on the screen but if you want to do some
note-taking or drawing there are some
pretty great options
so our all-around winner is the Wacom
Bamboo with its understated modern look
and it really hits all the right points
no matter what you're doing but there
are some options that excel in other
categories so if you're doing mostly
writing which I'm not really sure why
you'd want to be doing a ton of writing
on your iPad but if you are jot Pro is
unbeatable because it is the most
precise and it will mark the screen
almost exactly where you think it's
going to
as far as diagramming or writing some
flashcards or notes the cosmonaut is
very easy to use it feels nice in your
hand and just about anybody can pick it
up and use it it's also just good for
browsing your iPad as far as quick
scribbling goes the SGP Kuehl h10 at
under $15 is just about perfect
you're not going to be doing any
extended drawing or scribbling or
note-taking on there but considering it
attaches to the headphone jack on your
iPhone or iPad you won't lose it it's
small tip is nice and the textured grip
means you won't drop it
