here at Aoife in Berlin and I've got
with me the huawei mate s Huawei's new
flagship smartphone now this is a 5.5
Android device like many Android devices
we've seen 5.5 inches seems to be the
preferred screen size for everything
from the Moto X play to the oneplus 2
but why waste big standout feature on
this one is forced touch and then you
won't recognize from Apple now force
touch basically means a
pressure-sensitive screen and you can do
things with that like you know press
harder to zoom into a picture or scroll
faster through music or video now why
always kind of unveiled this a bit of an
attention grabber you know they're not
putting it on all the main asses they're
only putting it on certain models and
I'm saying how many but it means they've
might have stolen a march on Apple now
Apple's got forced touch in the Apple
watch and in that book but a lot of
people think that it's also going to be
coming to the next iPhone if so then why
we might have beaten them to it
so apart from forced touch what else is
the main Escott well it's got very nice
design they've really put a lot of
effort into this now as we mentioned
before when discussing this company and
this smartphone it kind of is a little
bit similar to other devices we've seen
you know we have the shampoo dirt
chamfered edges that you might have seen
on sort of HTC One m9 as well as the
camera at the back now this whole area
looks very familiar to any HTC fans
although unlike HTC One m9 this 13
megapixel camera has optical image
stabilization as well as the 13
megapixel on the back there's also an 8
megapixel camera on the front there's
three gigabytes of RAM powering this and
instead of the usual Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor there's actually a carryin
optical now this might not be familiar
to many people buying smartphones in the
West but we've really liked the
performance on it animations have been
very smooth no stuttering no lagging so
you know we have no complaints and so
it's a very speedy little device there's
also a fingerprint sensor right here on
the back which is maybe one of the
fastest we've used I mean just a touch
and the screen lights up didn't light up
there did it and also got a fingerprint
sensor on the bat which might be one of
the fastest being used goes from just a
touch to lighting up pretty much
instantly so that's impressive as well
but for all the nice things about the
may s unfortunately people in the US and
the UK won't be getting their hands on
it now are we is only is calling this a
global smartphone but actually limited
availability it's going to be in 30
countries though Japan Germany China
Israel with a 32 gigabyte and a 64
gigabyte version they're going to be
priced at six hundred and forty nine
euros for the 32 gigabyte 699 for the 64
gigabyte</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
