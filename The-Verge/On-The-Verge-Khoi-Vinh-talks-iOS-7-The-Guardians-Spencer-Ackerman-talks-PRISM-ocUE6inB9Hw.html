older this is on the verge thank you
thank you sir welcome to on the verge
brought to you by samsung i'm your host
joshua topolsky and you are a human
being and that's okay I'm not going to
judge you we have a really big exciting
show today we have an interview with the
US national security editor of The
Guardian Spencer Ackerman we're going to
talk about prism with him khoi vinh is
going to be talking to us about iOS 7 he
is of course the former design director
of the New York Times oh he's got a lot
to say about design and apples design
challenges Nilay Patel who I know you
love did a wonderful piece on prism and
what it means for you and your loved
ones and our intrepid reporter Nathan
siker took to the streets of New York
City to ask people if they actually care
about their privacy and things like
prism also this week Kanye West said
that he was the new steve jobs which is
extremely important to know so obviously
a lot going on a lot to talk about let's
talk about this week's biggest tech
story the big story is of course if
you've been following technology apple's
WWDC worldwide developers conference
which they hold every year in San
Francisco it's a big deal for them they
had a bunch of announcements this year
including new MacBook Airs iTunes radio
a new OS 10 called Mavericks which is a
beach which sounds lovely I've never
been to a beach but I would very much
like to visit one at some point and they
also announced this new Mac Pro which
looks nothing like any other computer on
the market or that has ever existed
pretty much I think it kind of looks
like a bronc AF 20 coffee maker but
you're going to have to draw your own
conclusions on this of course the
biggest story from dub dub DC is iOS 7
the new version of Apple's wildly
popular mobile operating system and a
lot of people have been pretty critical
of it people like me I wrote an angry
editorial about the design of iOS 7
which i think is somewhat lacking and
there have been a lot of designers
who've come out of the woodwork to talk
about their issues with the new design
of the oh
s Jason Santa Maria for instance he
tweeted multitasking tabs control center
airdrop in general interactions are
looking fantastic in iOS 7 but wow the
ugly stick Tom Cote said iOS 7 will
probably be really awesome when they do
the visual design and khoi vinh who were
going to be speaking to very shortly
said if iOS 7 is revenge unforced all
four stalls revenge may be that it's
kind of not that great which is a
disgusting nasty sick burn all over the
good people of Apple my advice would be
to get some aloe and just rub it all
over your body because you've been
burned very badly anyhow but I will say
this the the event was very much a
typical apple Big Apple event though
some of the language they used and some
of their tone seemed to be a little more
humble and a little more reserved when
talking about their products take a look
at this we are incredibly incredibly
incredibly incredibly proud the results
are really incredible threat of
incredible incredible credible
incredible incredible just incredible
incredible incredible it's really
incredible incredible incredible
incredible credible credible and this is
incredible but but maybe not surprising
really powerful powerful power how our

just like that it's really just amazing
it's just fantastic it's pretty awesome

excited there revolutionary

it even sounds cool it's not even close
it's not even close a stunning stunning
stunning the amazing it's unbelievable
unbelievable unbelievable profound
pretty great great great great great so
great great great great great those
words being a great deal to us and I
hope they mean a lot to you it as well
and joining them how to discuss the look
and the feel of iOS 7 is famed designer
khoi vinh koi thanks for being here
thanks for having me so look you've been
fairly publicly outspoken about you seem
like you don't have it I'm gonna stuff
you don't want me to talk about it you
shouldn't have been speaking publicly
then no you but you've been publicly
outspoken about iOS 7 is it is it bad
it's a bad design that's by the way a
very loaded question yeah I think it's a
mixed bag I think on the whole there's a
lot of good stuff there there's a lot
more stuff that surprisingly for apple
doesn't work as well as it should even
in a first release what are the things
that you see and obviously we both seen
the keynote and some of the stuff that's
on the site it's it's in beta right now
as a dev beta so this is not in to some
degree it's not final but what is it
that you've seen that isn't that isn't
working the stuff that's the surprising
stuff I think they've just veered so far
into this area of trying to create a
minimalist interface that a lot of
really simple things like buttons or
menus have totally reinvented just look
like they'll be problematic once real
people get their hands on right people
who are used to a very different yes
interface non-technical people people
like right the proverbial moms out there
like what what do you attribute this to
I mean it's unusual for Apple I mean we
know they've done some they've had some
weird design missteps right that I mean
what part of this feels like a reaction
to the skeuomorphic debate the felt in
the wood and they made a lot of jokes
about that I mean do you feel like some
of the missteps are due to this being a
reaction
I think they really wanted to make a
break after what's it been now about six
or seven years of the iphone I think
they wanted to really push things
forward into a whole new direction and
create a new chapter for iOS so I think
most of the the motivation is is great I
think they've hit choppier waters than
they expected to trying to make you know
such a dramatic change looking at the
design I mean we know that Johnny I was
put in charge of of interface design is
there stuff here that's kind of mistakes
that a guy who's not a software designer
would make does it feel like some of
this is his newness to that world well I
mean I hesitate to say it's because he's
new to software design but to me it does
feel like there's a lot of those kinds
of mistakes that people are coming into
software design for the first time will
make I mean there's a there's an
overemphasis on the graphical quality
and probably not as much emphasis on the
behavioral quality of the interface
right what's your take on the icons I
like the simplicity I I wish they were
stronger overall they seem like a first
pass to me and I I'd like to see them
revised again okay so what do you seeing
that is working from from what they've
showed off and in iOS well it's a
beautiful interface it really has a lot
of great visual things to recommend it
but the transparency the the thinness of
of all the elements it just sort of
feels very lightweight and I think
that's something they really try to to
bring home is this idea that the
interface itself doesn't have to feel
heavy anymore it's like the devices are
getting lighter the interfaces are
getting lighter right so i think it's
it's done that job I I think I think
where they thought you know that they
might have been
ninety percent of the way there they
might be only be like seventy or eighty
percent of the way there in terms of
really making everything work right so
you said on the on the typography in the
interface in the case of both Apple and
Google their uses of helvetica neue are
so prominent that they're almost
indiscriminate and as a result both of
these efforts skirt that thin line
between aspiration and desperation yeah
can you can you elaborate a little bit
on what what your thinking is behind a
statement like so how about a kunai
which they're using very prominently and
I also mentioned Google has been using
that really prominent their iOS apps
that's a really beautiful typeface that
traditionally or historically has been
used in the fashion and beauty
industries and it's meant to connote
modernity sophistication and and
thinness frankly for actual food actuals
it is physically an extremely thin oh
that's right yeah and I don't think that
it's there's any accident that these
companies have chosen this typeface and
and really put the tightest typeface to
the fore they want people to think of
their devices as fashionable as as a
really desirable compliment to the way
you think about your own personal
presentation and I think that's terrific
but if you if you really look at the way
Helvetica noise is used in print design
magazines and publications it's used as
a you know what we say is a display
typeface meaning it's meant for bigger
bigger uses of type headlines and titles
and so forth and both Google and Apple
have used it not just for display but
for text labels and for you know
paragraphs and at smaller sizes where
where the letter forms start to run
together a little bit and become harder
to read than you would like yeah I mean
a lot of those apps are sorry not to
interrupt but a lot of the apps on that
that they show images of their own
they're it's all text I mean it really
is and it's all sort of the same font
weight right in varying sizes right it
does it does seem a little bit daunting
for the eye I mean you
no it feels like a little bit of
helvetica neue goes a long way and a lot
of it right it's like sort of it's one
of those more is more you know yeah you
know but it feels like that's a
fundamental part of the new iOS that
that typeface is going to be that
widespread yeah I think I think they can
still pull that off by using it at the
larger sizes in the display text
situations but but if the smaller size
is I don't think there's anything wrong
with using a heavier weight of helvetica
and I hope they consider that because
it's going to improve legibility
dramatically for people especially for
people who have you know like some
eyesight challenges right are you so
there's a story going around now that
there is some apples marketing
department some of the designers there
somehow had a hand in designing some of
this interface is that does that sound
like it makes it I mean you're a
designer you've worked in design for
years and years and years you've
obviously worked on some very big
projects is this the kind of thing where
you would go you would reach out to a
marketing department and say to me this
seems like a crazy concept especially
for a design-driven company like Apple
that you would go hey let's farm out
some of the icon work to the guys in
marketing does this sound like a
situation that could be that sounds real
to you realistic I don't think it's
outside the realm of possibility I mean
I have no first-hand knowledge you have
no idea what happened at Apple but I
think the idea that you want to you want
to bring in different voices into the
design process you want to bring in
folks who who are coming at design
problems from from a different
background from marketing from from
print from packaging design I think
we're going to see more and more of that
in software going forward I mean
software design until fairly recently
has been a pretty homogeneous kind of a
field where everybody like lives and
breathes software and they don't bring
tons of external influences into it so
the idea of bringing in marketing folks
is not inherently bad it's just how you
manage that process of mixing together
different ideas so what if you're an
apple right now they're like can I come
come and be fixed our design yeah what
are what are the where are the first
things that yours what are the first
things you're attacking
how are you attacking them it's a very
broad question yeah very curious yeah
well I wouldn't fundamentally change the
look of iOS 7 I think I think they have
good reasons for going in the direction
that they're going I would focus more on
the lower level interactions and making
sure buttons with like buttons making
sure there's consistent behavior with
toggles and switches and the way you
know action sheets reveal and and the
way you know sharing works all of those
things I think there could be a lot more
work to to make it more intuitive and
perhaps more consistent with what's come
before and I would fix some of the lower
level typography as well I would keep
the bigger picture Helvetica noise stuff
but make sure text labels and paragraphs
and smaller texts are a lot more legible
so what you do what fun would you go
with I would go with a different way to
have like in helvetica neue I would just
need like a regular or medium or in some
cases a bold yeah do you think you'll
have an opportunity to go to apple and
fix yeah probably not after that tweet
yeah right the tweet is maybe it was
aggressive you know maybe yeah do you
feel your reaction has been strong I had
a few people pipe in and say yes I agree
or no you're totally wrong I don't think
that the tweet was particularly you know
you know unique or controversial and
that you know I don't think tons of
people said wow I can't believe he said
that right now and and youth do you
think that and this is the i guess this
is kind of the ultimate question this is
abated whatever we saw as a beta do you
think that it'll change in any
fundamental way from a design standpoint
from from now until the fall when they
are presumably will release new devices
and put this on their old devices yeah I
mean it's hard to to speak about this up
in terms of numbers but it might change
ten fifteen percent twenty percent and
that might be enough fight I think I
think it will look more or less the same
when it comes out and i think that's
fine but
I do I would guess based on the level of
furor that we've heard that there will
make some changes this week Corey thanks
so much really suck at it it's a lot of
fun and stick around because next we
have a helpful explainer for your new
best friend prism and we'll be right
back you are being watched recorded
spied on it all sounds like the ravings
of a conspiracy theorist but those
theories gained a lot of steam this week
when the washington post in the guardian
published reports claiming that the US
government is collecting mountains of
data on every citizen they can look at
your emails your photos your private
facebook profile they can watch your
google searches in real time they
claimed last night a single tear rolled
down the cheek of a government employee
when you used your Xbox to order pizza
hut but as any of this really happening
it all started when Glenn Greenwald of
the Guardian broke the news the National
Security Agency had ordered verizon to
hand over records on all calls
originating in the United States now it
should be noted that this does not
include the content of the calls but
rather the associated metadata the imei
numbers of the cell phones the time and
duration of the calls the two phone
numbers involved but still that metadata
is powerful and telling that story is
quickly followed by the revelation of
another government program called prism
which collects much much more as
reported by both the Guardian and The
Washington Post prism collects data from
technology companies like Google
Microsoft Facebook and Apple the exact
scope of prism is still unclear as the
original report claiming the NSA had
quote direct access to the company's
server has been partially retracted and
the companies involved and the NSA have
denied the majority of the claims
Google's first denial was basically
titled what the there's always a chance
though that it's happening without the
company's knowing and according to the
Washington Post the NSA may have direct
access to the company's servers without
their knowledge or consent Google for
example contends that it delivers data
only after a specific court order does
so via cure ftp transfer or literally by
hand
the company along with Microsoft and
Facebook has asked for more openness and
transparency so as Congress although it
should be noted that President Obama has
claimed every congress person has been
briefed on the prison program and has
voted several times to keep it running
the White House has defended its
surveillance and others say this is
simply business as usual for the Bush
and Obama administrations but the
documents have made explicit what many
have feared that laws like the FISA
Amendments Act and the Patriot Act have
allowed the US government to run
roughshod over citizens privacy at this
point what we need is more transparency
from all sides The Guardian and posting
to show us the rest of the evidence they
have regarding the government spying and
the government itself needs to be clear
and honest about what kind of data it
collects the only problem is that none
of these parties will feel any pressure
to do anything unless the people
actually care how do you feel about the
government spying on you the NSA there's
no point of doing it to everyone it's
just going too far it's inviting my
privacy without even my consent so it's
just a bad about violation of my fourth
amendment see III tend to have a
different opinion if there's a way that
we can stop you know a terrorist attack
from happening I think maybe it's
something that should be used but
there's there needs to be some kind of
constraint towards it it's the same
thing as airport security do I want them
to Pat me down and put me through a
machine every time no do I want them to
make sure no one else has a bomb on them
yeah obviously you feel like now they're
getting uncomfortably close they have
put the potential to be but I definitely
think if it's anything on the internet
then that is fair game I mean you posted
it with the intention of people seeing
it so I think that that would be fair
are you okay with your searches being
sent uh no I mean I had nothing to hide
but what about it's like friday night
it's like two in the morning you're on
google
y'all know what what we're searching
it's you in the morning yeah I'm young
man I mean I don't care really yeah it's
not doesn't bother me but I feel like
it's my privacy why should you know what
I'm doing privately what if you had
access to government technology where
you could check in on like an ex of
yours someone says it's totally legal
they won't find out would you use that
information to check in on your ex I
mean I would some people down and figure
out with the location is their specific
location at the element what if it
wasn't legal but this this guy pulled
you aside he was like listen I work for
the government don't no one will find
out you can use this information would
you do it even though you knew is
against the law would you still check in
on these people um I'm gonna say yeah I
would still do because you know as I
said people should be safe for mamas
community every move we make they're
watching out the song
is more true now than ever all right
y'all give it up what my beginning we
are the people trust the government
trust the government
very very helpful and also frightening
stuff from Neil I and joining me now via
Skype is the Guardians US national
security a deter Spencer Ackerman
Spencer thank you first off for joining
us I know you're extremely busy right
now let's talk about prism and what we
know right now there's been some
confusion it seems like in particularly
in mainstream a lot of mainstream press
about the this story and and whether the
take on prism that we've heard so far
that there is some collusion between
these tech companies and the NSA is
accurate you do you feel that the the
story has been accurate thus far right I
mean this is there is some collusion
happening is that right so there's a
program that we know is called prism
that basically monitors the online
communications of a best vast amount of
people as long as the NSA has some kind
of suspicion we're not really sure what
the standards are but has to have it
like a 51-percent suspicion that the
people there monitoring our outside the
United States or are not United States
persons so that's what prison is and
there are something like nine companies
involved there are nine companies
involved Microsoft Google Facebook is
involved um the extent of their
involvement there now negotiating with
the Justice Department to disclose but
the NSA has been working with them they
want to add Dropbox to it so that
communications that they believe are
outside the united states are harvested
all under this program right and you say
you said 51% confidence that the person
they're targeting or people their target
are outside the US do you know how they
build that confidence i mean is this
just a whim of somebody at the NSA i
have no idea the NSA has not disclosed
that it's a fascinating question that
would be a really excellent subject for
a public so there's been a lot of talk
about this doing this direct access
debate versus a lockbox versus you know
the companies have basically denied that
there is a direct any kind of direct
relationship can you explain a little
bit about your understanding or
how this is working that these companies
seem to be not dancing around and
they're flat-out denials they say we
haven't heard about prism so how would
this work or how does it appear to be
working in a technical manner we're
waiting to hear the specifics about how
well this gets ironed out with the
companies the companies are right now
because you're worried about their
business asking the Justice Department
to disclose what they can about requests
for information they get from the
government there's a lines from from the
slide deck that we have that suggests
the companies can go in themselves so
we're really waiting to hear what the
Justice Department will let the company
say about their cooperation the slides
are seem very direct and what we've seen
at least so far about how they describe
the access to data does it does it seem
to you that there is that these
companies are could be more involved in
that there's a reason why they're not
able to speak on that um yeah for years
through the Patriot Act through an
expansion 2008 of the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act recipients
of these government requests for
information from telecommunications
companies from Internet service
providers and so on have been under very
serious restrictions about what they can
say publicly recipients of the
administrative subpoenas like National
Security Letters from the FBI under
Section 215 of the Patriot Act which is
distinct I want to clarify from a prison
that relies on something called section
702 of the 2008 FISA Amendments Act but
under 750 under sorry under 215 of the
Patriot Act recipients of these requests
for information cannot publicly disclose
to their clientele or to anyone else
that they've been turning over these
these records so it is very difficult
for these companies to talk about in
public what they've been turning over to
the government right so so and there has
been this I mean the government is
obviously very outspoken saying look
we're not doing anything that isn't
completely within our rights completely
within the law as established by in the
Patriot Act uh the the there seems to be
you know Harry Reid is saying look I
don't know why anybody is surprised
about this we've been doing this for
years Dianne Feinstein is is is
defending the use of
this this type of surveillance does it
does this seem like is there a turning
point here where we need to take a look
at the Patriot Act and what it allows
you know obviously there have always
been critics of the patriarchy since day
one is this a point where you feel like
there's need to be real scrutiny and
real oversight about what the Patriot
Act allows so a couple things first to
be really clear a prism is not about the
Patriot Act the collection of millions
of Americans phone records telephony
metadata as that as the term of art goes
basically you're your phone number the
duration of your calls possibly the
location so forth that is something that
the NSA is justifying under Section 215
the so-called business provision of the
Patriot Act that's something that
already you're starting to see senators
like Jeff Merkley and Tom Udall say
needs to really be reviewed on and on
the broader point um most senators who
you know aren't on the Intelligence
Committee most members of Congress
aren't on the House version of the
Intelligence Committee so most of
Congress is in the dark about how these
programs actually operate and what um
two senators Ron Wyden and and mark
Udall have been warning about for two
years now is that the administration
with the blessing of the FISA Court a
secret surveillance court has been
allowing a completely in private without
any public review very broad
interpretations of both the Patriot Act
and the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 that
they've argued allow for vastly more
surveillance than most legislators
thought that they were authorizing under
these public was and they've called for
the declassification of these laws of
these interpretations of these laws
because they feel that they can't
responsibly legislate surveillance
information they can't responsibly
legislate the surveillance rules of the
road for Americans to protect Americans
privacy if in private the administration
with the blessing of a secret court will
essentially rewrite those laws okay so

story I mean there's more to come right
