bit smarter a great place to start is
with your lighting smart lighting
systems can be really convenient and
really cool I have mine set up so my
life turn on just before sundown that
way I'm never left sitting in the dark
but there are a ton of systems out there
and some are going to be a huge headache
so here's what a good system does number
one it's easy to set up number two it's
easy to use day-to-day remember this has
to be more convenient than a light
switch and third it has to be really
flexible you have to have a lot of
options for how you can set up your home
there is no perfect smart lighting
system right now but the one that comes
closest to nailing all three of those
things is Philips hue Phil Chu is
emergency go shew name and smart lights
and for good reason it's just really
easy to set up and use basically just
plug everything in and you're good to go
it's app is a big part of that you can
control entire rooms or individual
lights without digging through menus
that includes just turning lights on and
off and even dimming them by dragging
around on a slider the app also lets you
set up triggers that your lights can
respond to what's happening so they can
turn on when you come home or off when
you're leaving and if you want to get
really nerdy about it you can even hook
up the lights to if this then that and
then have them respond to all kinds of
weird things you could have your lights
change color when it's about to rain we
can have them flash if you get a new
text message or Facebook like or an
Instagram heart or a slack message or an
email or you know don't get carried away
you also works with Siri and Alexa so
you can control your entire home's
lighting system with your voice just by
talking to your iPhone or your Amazon
echo for me the one downside to Philips
U is that you can't fit up to your light
switch so if you turn your light switch
off you suddenly can't control your
lights at all there is one solution
though Philips does sell these little
controllers that you can
on the wall they work pretty well and
they're convenient enough oh and I
should mention that like most smart
lighting systems she also offers a bunch
of different color options you can do
lights that are just plain all-white or
you can do want to do basically any
different color from white to purple to
red to green to whatever you should just
consider whether you really need a
purple light in your house the thing
that I like the most is something that's
a little bit in between the two of them
it's a white bulb that could be a little
bit warmer or a little bit colder so you
can still sort of dial in on your exact
preference there are a lot of other
smart lighting options out there and I'm
just going to quickly run through them
because some of them are kind of
interesting and others you should just
completely ignore lifx is a nice
color-changing bulb that's really great
if you just want one or two because it
doesn't require a hub just know that if
your Wi-Fi is a little patchy they might
be a problem
Sivaji you don't require a hub either
they're cheap temperature changing bulbs
but you can only control them inside the
home so there's sort of just something
to get if you're curious about what
smart lighting might be like Lutron's
can see the wireless is an interesting
option because you can turn your
existing lights and choose smart lights
but it's not quite as elegant because
you have to plug all these adapters into
outlets around your house and then
there's the headaches Ostrom Belkin and
GE all make big bulbs but they become
big headaches when you try to use them
with their own systems so just a warning
now say you want system that doesn't
just stop at your lights then there's
one other option for you consider that
is Samsung smartthings be warmed
smartthings is not just a lighting
system it is a full-fledged smart home
system that lets you hook up thermostat
motion sensors security cameras and all
kinds of different lights including the
Philips hue so it's going to be a lot
more complicated on the lighting front
smartthings is a bit more challenging
but it also gives you a lot more options
you have a ton of different bulbs to
choose between and there are a lot of
different sensors that you can hook up
to make your lights respond to different
things one thing that I really like is
that you can even replace your old light
switch with a connected one that way you
don't have to double up and have your
existing light switch and your smart one
right beside it if you do want to do a
little bit more than that and integrate
more smart home products throughout your
home over time smart things is maybe the
way to go for you but you can always add
that down the road
start with Phillips you to keep in mind
the smart home market is developing
rapidly and a lot is going to change
over the next few years but if you want
system that is already working well for
lighting Philip Q is absolutely the way
to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
