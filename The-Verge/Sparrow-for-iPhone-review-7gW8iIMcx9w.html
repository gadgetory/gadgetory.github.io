verge and we're taking a look at Sparrow
for iOS Sparrow takes some of the design
ideas from Facebook specifically the the
idea of using cards and moving back and
forth and takes it a little bit further
so you can swipe left once and you can
dig down into whatever account you're in
swipe left again and see all of your
accounts and if you're all the way up at
the top you can just tap the top left
and it pulls you all the way back to see
all of your different accounts but then
if you want to jump into a specific
account you can just hop in and pull up
all your specific labels in one place it
takes a little bit of time to get used
to but ultimately it's a it's a really
efficient and fast way to navigate your
inbox definitely faster than Apple's
mail the great thing here is that you've
got a unified inbox so you can have 1015
however many accounts you won it's got a
little bit of a higher information
density than male primarily because they
pull out the bottom navigation bar and
in this place is just a compose button
so from within any inbox you can just
tap the bottom right and it pulls up all
your contacts it is odd that spareth
throws up a screen that forces you do
pick your recipients before moving on to
the rest of your email so you can't
start writing and you can't start
working on the subject until you
actually pick who it is so anyway all I
know myself it's you know it's pretty
much like any other email app one of the
nice things is you can just tap the top
and swit switch the account that you
want to send from unfortunately there
isn't a rich text editing here like
you'll find in the actual mail app but a
little something it's not really a big
loss one of the really great things that
Sparrow does have is you can add
attachments after the fact so where as
with mail you have to jump into your
photos app in order to add the photo to
an email you can add it here even better
you can go in and add multiple photos to
any email spare gives you the option to
shrink those down at the end of being
very large one of the cool things that
Sparrow has in the general reading view
is you can tap the inbox title and it'll
move you between different sections so
you can tap it and you can move to all
of your unread and if you're in the
unified inbox this looks at all the
unread across all of your different
email accounts and then you can also tap
it again and pull in all of your starred
emails so Sparrow much like on the
desktop app supports most
map services you know you can use Gmail
you can use google apps you can use
iCloud there's AOL support and mobileme
and yahoo unfortunately there's not pop
support yet but we've heard is coming
you'll see that just like on the desktop
app there's facebook integration and so
what that does is it pulls in user
photos so you have a little bit better
of an idea of who is actually sending
you an email it's pretty hard to escape
a giant email thread in the modern
office and spares done a really good job
of dealing with that and so one of the
first things you can do is you can swipe
up and down between different threads so
that's pretty handy the other great
thing is you can tap the title and you
can see all of the responses in the
thread with the author and a quick
preview and then jump into any of them
really quickly it's a really subtle
really interesting UI that we're not
seeing anywhere else and it really makes
dealing with long email threads much
easier so one of the great things that
you can do you can just swipe right on
on any message and you can label it you
can start you can reply from directly
within here where you can archive or
delete so it's not like the mail app
where you're forced to either you know
trash it or archive it you're given both
options so if you want to label it you
can just tap the label button and then
add it very quickly and so it's no
longer a question of moving it between
different folders that sort of sync up
to gmail but it's not always perfect so
it's really really fast and it makes
moving through your inbox very easy
unfortunately there's no way an appt
browser yet so if you do find a link
within an email it's going to take you
back to mobile safari we have heard that
it's coming in later versions so it's
you know it's not too big of a problem
unlike on the desktop you're not able to
specify the email client that you want
to use and so it's pretty much
impossible to go fully sparrow and use
it all the time for absolutely
everything because if you're if you're
emailing from any other app it's going
to default to the mail app so the gold
standard for mobile email search is
still gmail on Android mail lags far
behind it's it's just not as fast and it
it tends not to pull up the actual
results or any results that are as good
the bulk editing abilities are pretty
nice as well so you can just tap the
edit button fortunately there's a mark
all is red you know which we're really
not seeing anywhere else what you can
also do is select multiple emails and
you can move all of them or
archive you know just select ones or
delete all of them or just select emails
we've been using the app for the past
month or so and we've come to see it is
the best mail app for iOS unfortunately
though when it launches very soon it is
going to be launching without push and
so if you're dependent on that it's a
bit of a deal breaker and you're still
going to have to use the primary mail
app until sparrow launches with push
notifications that aab simply shows the
promise of what a mail app on iOS could
be</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
