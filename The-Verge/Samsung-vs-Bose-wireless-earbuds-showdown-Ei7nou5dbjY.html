and if you haven't tried them yourself
you've at least seen a lot of people
walking around wearing them in fact you
might think they're the only completely
Wire free earbuds out there but over the
past couple years other companies have
been getting in the game - like Bose
which is obviously a leader in high-end
audio gear and Samsung which makes
really really nice phones which is why
you should buy their headphones you have
something hanging out of your ear
these are the Samsung gear icon X
wireless headphones it's the second
generation of icon X right because the
first generation had crummy battery life
as I was going to say these costs one
hundred and sixty dollars these are the
Bose sound sport free they cost two
hundred dollars so they're a little bit
more expensive but sometimes you have to
pay for good sound quality sure here's
the thing about buying headphones these
days it used to be that all you had to
think about when you were buying a new
pair of headphones was how good they
sounded it and how well they fit now
there are all kinds of options you have
to look at whether they're in here or
around the ear or whether they're a
wired or wireless or totally and
completely Wire free and whether they
work a voice assistance and what else am
I forgetting your budget alright and
price I still think that true audio
snobs are going to respect these more a
lot more
considering all I know about these I
think these are the better pair let's
talk about fit first now this is gonna
be a subjective thing but personally the
icon access fit my ears really well I'm
impressed with how comfortable they are
I mean this fit my ears really well too
it's just just kidding the problem I
have with these is that they're huge
and I've tried all the tips that come in
the box and I just I just can't get a
great fit and that's too bad I was able
to go running with these no problems the
right bud does fit my ear a little bit
better than the left but okay no two
ears are the same I mean I'm sure these
fit some people well and they're really
light despite their size yeah I'm gonna
call this a win for the icon X's but
let's talk about sound quality once you
can get these things to stay in your
ears music sounds nice and balanced it's
not too bassy it's not too tinny and
there's a nice depth to it
I mean I'd even go as far as saying that
Bose has set a new bar for what truly
wire-free audio should sound like the
sound on these is pretty good to me if
slightly over
and I guess if I'm being honest phone
calls can sound a little bit hollow but
one thing that I have with these that
you don't is the ability to really jam
them in my ears when I want more
isolated audio as well as an ambient
sound mode when I want to let in more
noise that's true the Bose do have more
of an open air design but I'd still say
that these are the clear winners on
sound another thing to consider with
truly wireless earbuds is how you
interact with them since you no longer
have a wire with a little remote on it
and I think that for both of these
headphones there are some downsides to
that I think the icon X's are slightly
easier to control not surprisingly
although there is a bit of a learning
curve because there are a bunch of
different ways that you can swipe and
tap through them to control your music
and phone calls and everything else she
hung up on me twice while she was
wearing those he was just trying to
adjust my left ear bud but I thought
they fit so well at least they're not
unnecessarily difficult to control it's
true the Bose sound sport free have
these tiny buttons at the top here that
require kind of a firm press to change
anything but hey at least I never
accidentally hung up on someone or
skipped a song track when I didn't mean
to I think we're even on this one and
then there's battery life with the Bose
sound sport free you should be able to
get up to 5 hours of playback time per
charge same with these except my
charging case is nicer because it's
smaller because mine are smaller ok well
I think my Bluetooth connection is
better these almost never drop out now
if you're still on the fence there are
other features to think about too like
the fact that these have four gigabytes
of on-board storage so you can play
music locally and not have to stream it
and these Auto track your runs for you
to which you can look at afterwards and
the Samsung health apps Oh apps
why do bluetooth headphones need so many
apps you have a Bose app yeah but with
yours it's like download the Samsung
gear manager app and then download the
Samsung health app is act you don't have
to download any apps and they'll pair
with your phone just like any bluetooth
headphones there are just more features
and controls in the apps if you want
them also these work with voice
assistance ok so do these that's not
really a stand out feature anymore look
if you want the best sound quality you
can get in a pair of wire free earbuds
and you can't go wrong with the bose
sound support
if you can afford them and if you if
they happen to fit your ears which they
don't fit mine and if you don't think
they look ridiculous that's a lot of
oops
I still think overall that the Samsung
gear icon acts are the better choice
they're smaller they're more comfortable
or less expensive they have good battery
life and they have pretty good sound
quality I win really intrigued by how
good this smells</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
