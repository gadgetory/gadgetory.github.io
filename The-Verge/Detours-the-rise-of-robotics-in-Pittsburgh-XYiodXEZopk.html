Smokey's City Steel City robot city
for over a century Pittsburgh thrived on
steel the steel mills churned out smog
so thick that it blotted out the Sun
streetlights remained on even during the
day this was seen as a sign of
prosperity
eventually outdated manufacturing and
depleting natural resources led to its
destruction forming in its aftermath a
new industry robotics
Pittsburgh has become a place of
monumental ambitions its mechanical arms
are reaching for the stars but some are
starting with the moon my life is robots
robots and robots I've had the privilege
and adventures of robotic cleanup of
nuclear accidents the creation and
mastery of robot carve driving land sea
air underground and now to space I
conceived for the concept of drilling
for the ice at the moon and had those
ideas rejected for years on the basis
that there was no evidence for the
existence of ice and now of course it's
a sure bet and the agenda is to
robotically reach the surface and to
drill that ice robotics in space have
not been linked forever except in
science fiction and great movies
it was a one-time venture by the Soviet
Union to put the Luna cog on the moon
but except for that there are no other
robots on the moon human capabilities in
space are intrinsically constrained by
the life-support and mass that's
required and the issues of long
radiation exposure so the missions that
are on the books are all robotic that's
a transformation of my lifetime I got
the idea for robots at work at a time
when robots work just fantasy and
science fiction and I had a vision for
robots to develop secure feed this world
and to explore worlds beyond I embraced
that there was no looking back my
interest in robotics in robots began
when I was a small child I was always
interested in in motion whether it's
away cars drive the animals motion and
as a child I was lucky enough to find
some small computer and hook it up to
motors from RadioShack I was able to
make these toy cars move around the way
I commanded because that's the ultimate
be able to command that motion
right now we're in my lab it's called
the bio robotics lab it has its name
because a lot of the work we do is
inspired by biology so my group has done
a fair bit of work in snake robots they
bear their name because you know you
look at them and they look like snakes
there's many many extra joints many many
extra degrees of freedom these degrees
of freedom allow the robot to thread
through tightly packed volumes and get
to locations that people and machinery
otherwise can't access so one
application is our urban
search-and-rescue here you have a
collapsed building rescue workers want
to locate up trapped survivors but it's
a very dangerous situation that
structure is very fragile
it's dangerous to the rescue worker also
it can be dangerous to the victim
because you don't to cause collateral
damage these robots have the potential
to serve as a tool to extend the sensory
reach of rescue workers so they can
locate victims more quickly
urban search-and-rescue inspection of
nuclear power plants archeology in all
these cases we're doing minimally
invasive surgery on structure so it
stands to reason if we shrink the robot
down to a small size we can do minimally
invasive surgery on a person we're
trying to deliver a tool to physicians
to perform capabilities that otherwise
were relegated to surgeons
just over 200 years ago the first steam
boat was built on these rivers it
squandered natural resources police it's
the rivers and required a crew of over
20 men this boat requires zero
platypus builds these small low-cost
robotic boats for applications such as
environmental monitoring fish farms
pollution monitoring
we were able to build these really
low-cost boats by leveraging existing
Android phone technology along with
custom electronics and package that into
a really low cost foam and plastic hull
that we could fabricate it's smaller
than a lot of people expect we get this
all the time where people come in they
look at our boats like wow that's way
smaller than I expected you know I was
expecting a boat so for one example we
can go into small streams and small
rivulets and things like that without
too much problem because we have such a
narrow and short base the other thing is
that these sensors are just tiny tiny
one-ounce things that are strapped on to
basically these really huge boats and
then dragged around right now and
there's a reason for that and so if I
actually going to these smaller sizes
you get hit kind of a sweet spot where
you can use much cheaper hardware to
actually push them around we've just got
to keep going down that path of making a
cheaper more robust more repeatable more
usable robot and then the killer apps
are there I hope
how come I help here may I assist you
need anything
your wish is my command we're currently
at the experimental stage the petri dish
trying to figure out what the best robot
is what should look like what
infrastructures will have should it be
running Ross will be running Linux no
one really knows what the robot of the
future is gonna look like
he may look like a Roomba it may look
like a hive arms robot who knows right
we're here at the personal robotics lab
it's a lab that I started this is a
robot herb
herb stands for home exploring robots
Butler everything is completely
self-contained he has lasers to map the
environment he has cameras to recognize
and register objects got his arms to
pick up objects and it took us about a
year to you know take that first step to
get her to actually recognize and
register an object it was actually a
coffee mug and pick it up and and doing
all of this completely autonomously like
we didn't tell him where the coffee mug
was we didn't tell him how to pick up
the coffee mug get models of physics
underneath that he was using to evaluate
how to grasp objects there's a
tremendous amount of autonomy and
tremendous amount of artificial
intelligence motion planning perception
that goes into executing you have very
very simple tasks
it's very rare that we can actually make
true impact in the world and actually
help people my grandmother is in India
and she's very old and we constantly
worry about her
and if we can build technology that can
help her perform the kinds of tasks that
she's used to performing in the home
that will be extremely rewarding
so what we're doing right now is
monitoring my level of attention I have
it set up so a threshold of value of 80
will cause the hand a grip right now I'm
shooting about 14 so let me concentrate
get that guy go
and that will stay gripped as long as my
concentration value is higher than 80
the thumb movement is done by a plane
function and the coordination of the two
will allow for a large degree of
dexterity
I mean CMU CMU is great don't get me
wrong it affords a very knowledgeable
base of people to talk to and
collaborate with certainly their
facilities are very very top-notch we've
noticed that like universities rarely
bring things to market they kind of get
caught up in the system we worked there
for like six months and became pretty
frustrated it's really cool technology
it's really helpful but it doesn't help
anyone if it actually doesn't come out
what we're working on is an assistive
technology specifically right now a
prosthetic arm and the technologies that
we use are EEG and EMG technology which
means that we create an artificial
nervous system essentially when you
concentrate on and bring your attention
level up it'll close the hand
prosthetics really are not they're
either not functional or not affordable
we want to find a balance between
functionality and costs so keeping
something that's affordable to people
but delivers far more functionality than
you know your average sort of hook I
mean the technology that we're
developing it is a broad range of
applications from just giving somebody
their life back by allowing them
functionality of a limb to like
surrogate robotics you know we look at
what what people have access to now kids
have access to now we're just blown away
what's it's amazing it at the Maker
Faire these kids would come off to us
and be like that's an Adreno mega and
like
and they'd be like he says it yeah but
and they ask us like really kind of
technical questions technical questions
that we don't hear from adults I mean
you have in Pittsburgh lots of really
good schools right so you have people
from all over the country all over the
world coming to this region to develop
their ideas and learn new things but
that doesn't end when classes end these
people go out they they interact with
the community and it fosters a
development process unlike any any
educational system could you you also
don't need to go to CMU to learn
robotics I mean you know I've I did it
for a couple hundred bucks and you know
library fees we do this stuff all the
time there are solutions out there all
you have to do is know what questions
that ask
