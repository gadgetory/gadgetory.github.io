today by joe belfiore for microsoft
controller to join us Joe well here at
CES in Las Vegas CS when it off how's
the shopping for you it's great so far
we're excited at Microsoft with a broad
range of stuff but for me windows phone
the nokia lumia 900 is exciting it's a
big day does it have that for you to
Lumia 900 what about the HD Titan to you
how do you feel about that's pretty
exciting too but you know for me
yesterday being part of the Nokia
announcement getting that device out
there spending time with those guys it's
definitely meaningful there a key
partner for us we're excited about the
Titan to generally lots of good stuff
happening here cool well we we had heard
that you guys would come out with some
OT windows phones you've done that with
HTC and with Nokia any other windows
phones that we can look forward to with
LTE well right now what we're talking
about so far and what the announcements
have been at CES have been the two new
phones though as I said the one from
Nokia and then the one from HTC so so
far no additional phones that we're
talking about so far well there's
another big mobile event specifically
mobile event mwc coming up and the Lumia
900 quite a few folks would have been
disappointed to see that it's a AT&amp;amp;T
exclusive so its Us exclusive can we
look forward to similar devices in
Europe um you know I that's a good
question for nokia i think what they
would say is that to the extent that
people are excited about that device you
know they're going to look at expanding
their lineup over time but right now the
Lumia 900 really was built for the
American market it's designed for LTE
for 80's bands they're entering into a
significant partnership with AT&amp;amp;T so
whatever happens in the future we'll
have to see but I hope it is true that
people are excited enough by that phone
but they wanted a bunch of other
countries and let no key gets that feat
oh yeah I mean I just today I got a
chance to play around with it and I do
like it very much myself I I got to
review the nokia n9 and the lumia 800
which was knock its first witness form
and the 900 is kind of very much like a
scaled-up 800 which
kind of a good thing it's pretty good
thing but you know you do have to note
the fact that it has wvga resolution 800
x 480 which is starting to lag the
competition can you tell us anything
about what Microsoft is planning on that
front yeah it's interesting um I think
if you look at how we built our team and
the program on windows phone we've
really tried to focus our engineering
efforts on a relatively narrow set of
hardware so that we can optimize it
greatly and if you look at the chipsets
for example we're on qualcomm chipsets
the snapdragon chipset if you look at
the screen resolution by focusing on a
narrower set of things initially we
think we can drive performance up
battery life up and help ISVs go get
their apps done so if you think about
Windows Phone and sort of its we're
barely out of our first year and we're
trying to bootstrap this new high
quality experience the approach that
we've chosen to take is to focus on a
narrower set of things you take the the
you pick the screen resolution as an
example now what I would say is for most
consumers walking into a store or even
forget walking to store carrying a phone
around as their phone for two years on
contract that that resolution looks very
good and the you take the any of these
phones really taking any phones with the
technology they have for applying great
contrast and making colors pop out the
screens look really nice now that's not
to say that you can't incrementally
improve how things look by increasing
resolution you can but it does come at
the cost of some battery life you have
to put a stronger processor in to drive
all those pixels and the trade-off that
we've made so far is in the combination
of battery smooth buttery animations and
performance cost to focus their over
time I think you can expect to see us
expand the breadth of the kinds of
things we're doing but right now we
think it makes it over time is a very
wide range they will be trying to get
with guys here at CES to contract the
overtime because when they say we
introduces something this year would
basically the beginning of January yeah
that doesn't really give us much of all
the good and bad news for you is we're
talking at CES about the things that
were announced now and they're coming
really soon we'll have other
announcements other things to talk about
for later in the year but
right now we're excited about the lineup
weekend well something that you selfish
and is cost where do you see Windows
Phone fitting in in terms of the
competition I think it's fair to say
that Android and iOS are the biggest
competitors and they both have very
specific strategies they're all
approaches to the market iOS must keep
it very narrow with one hero device and
Android wants to keep it it's versatile
and as diverse as possible so how does
windows phone stand out how do you you
know how do you tempt somebody away from
the iOS and Android ecosystem yeah I
think that there are a number of
different things that we're thinking
about in that regard one is in terms of
the value proposition that we want to
create for end-users we started on
Windows Phone looked at the iphone we
looked at Android was emerging at the
time and we said what are the
characteristics of this and what is it
good at delivering iphone at the time
was very focused on apps good touch
experience good at web browsing and we
felt like we could do a lot by focusing
on human connections deeply integrating
social networking bringing people to the
forefront and trying to do that with a
visual appearance that's unique and yet
differentiated no i'd say the plan but
it's just you know you're different and
unique and in my personal opinion the
things that you've done a very good but
you know when the person walks into a
store is the price point going to be
something yeah that you push well where
i was going is I think there's sort of
two dimensions here that are interesting
one is what's the design and feature set
and what I'd say for us is we have a
unique visual design and we offer a
feature set that focuses around people
it's good at apps and in fact it tries
to integrate applications into the
experience but it tries to really make
your human connections work well but
then there's a separate sort of track of
what's the program and you characterize
the iOS program it's apples you know
relatively narrow set of devices and
their their ecosystem that Android is
very broad one we're trying to use a
methodology that balances those things
we want to get the kind of predictable
quality that people generally expect on
iOS because it's controlled but with
more variation than you would get only
going with one
they're doing deeply integrated hardware
and software and so unlike Android I
would say we're with open source there's
the benefit of someone will take that
source and they'll engineer the craziest
device you can think of and it'll happen
really fast that's that's what open
source enables we will be slower for
those kinds of you know crazy or
speculative things to happen but are the
trade-off that we're aiming for is
higher quality and value in a way it's a
it's a little bit of a less edgy early
adopter approach it's more of a broad
mainstream approach where we focus on
predictability really high quality you
know ranging from how good are the phone
calls to the battery life to the stutter
enos of the user experience to being
able to count on all the apps running
and so that's how we we think about
those two things you know a unique
design and then a program that balances
aggressiveness and speed with
predictable quality okay that's a very
comprehensive answer is sorry I
appreciate but again hey I mean I I want
to sit with the price point for just one
more question which is to ask would you
look to match android devices I mean
what you just said is you're not looking
to fight a spec war with Android which
is fair enough right you look into the
differentiator on a different way but
would you look to match android devices
installs a price point so would you look
to undercut them um i think i think in
general matching on price point is the
right way to think about it we have a
cost structure and windows phone has a
cost structure that's different than
android you know android for a device
vendor to bring it to market typically
requires more engineering investment to
do work to fill it out we think we
require less engineering vestments so
we're less expensive in that way we
think we have a license that's different
than Android there's no license for
Android so the cost structure is really
are different now in terms of supported
hardware um because Android has the open
source model they can span very wide and
so OEMs do make decisions to drive
prices down that in our opinion
compromise the user experience in ways
that are particularly unfortunate
because they're not detectable by the
end user so I'll give you a good example
we have a lot of debate
our team about whether today we require
four point symmetric multi-touch which
means you can detect multiple fingers
there are a lot of Android phones that
ship with just two point symmetric
multi-touch you can shave some cost off
the phone by doing that the problem is
some games won't work right and as an
end user going into a store you have no
way of knowing really whether the phone
you're getting has the better controller
the less one so we are going to make
decisions that in the service of quality
probably keep us above androids lowest
price point but I think as a practical
matter the low price points that people
are looking for will get into those
price bands but Android will always be
able to go a little lower than we can
show you also mentioned the
standardization in terms of hardware but
recently st-ericsson announced that in
partnership with Nokia their worship or
Windows Phone device with st-ericsson
with an SD ericsson chipset inside and
how would that affect things would we do
you have any significant info well we we
haven't commented specifically on other
companies doing chipsets but if you take
that as a hypothetical example over time
it's certainly our intent to broaden the
ecosystem of hardware that's supported
by windows phone and if you go sort of
look at where we're at in our life cycle
as I said I think we're we're in the
phase now where we've got a pretty good
value proposition we're building out the
number of apps we're starting to
increase the breadth of phones getting a
wider range of chipsets will make sense
and it's something I expect will do but
we don't have any announcements about
show yet so let me just now that there's
actually switch over to discuss the
upcoming windows phone so we know
windows phone with no windows phone 7.5
but we've also heard by Windows Phone
tango and we've heard about Windows
Phone and Paolo can you tell us anything
about tank oh no no very well because we
re we've heard about tango region irit
to make Windows Phone compatible with
256 megabytes of RAM anything you can
tell us about that sorry no a roadmap
for tango to nothing to do I think tango
is a cool sounding word is a cool 71
Apollo it ends in
oh ok you killing me ok welcome to look
forward to with mwc ah you know it's too
early to say i think if you look
generally at what we're doing i can say
that the team certainly is busy doing a
whole lot of interesting work and i know
that i know that all of you watching
this and you guys would love to hear
more specifics but unfortunately i just
can't talk about those yet we're trying
to make sure that we focus on the
exciting announcements that we have
today solve the problems and and then
announce stuff when it's ready as oh and
just wrap up Wilco and Lee's mentioned
last year that Microsoft had a vision of
one ecosystem which includes windows 8
includes windows phone and Xbox and all
of those things how are you guys going
about making that happen yeah I actually
I'm I'm really excited about 2012 from
the perspective of windows 8 coming to
market and there's a lot of things that
already a line between the windows 8
plans we've announced in the Windows
Phone product that we have now if you
look at the general user experience of
Live Tiles there's obviously some good
alignment there if you look at the app
platform for windows 8 the app platform
for Windows 8 is a combination of ways
that developers can write apps and one
of those the methodology of writing in
silverlight or zamel and c-sharp is
highly similar between what Windows 8 is
is going to be doing and what exists
today on the phone so as a developer
will be really easy for you to use a
similar or the same tool set similar the
same language and API access so we think
that's going to help a lot in terms of
developers coming to Microsoft learning
the tools learning languages and then be
able to target both platforms ok so you
I mean it's kind of evident that you've
tried to have a consistent look to the
interface where to start UI and what
you're saying is that basically you
tryin give consistent tools to
developers yeah absolutely and I think
that you know certainly we will do new
revisions of the product which we're
just not talking about yet you can
expect to see other things what about
apps will have apps that are consistent
across all free device platforms I mean
if you mean in terms of
we'll developers go and try to take
advantage of the similarity and
platforms to write software that
interacts across both I'd say it's
highly likely they will although you
know right now it's early days certainly
for windows 8 in terms of getting
developers going and we haven't shown
that many apps or talk to that much in
specific about what developers will be
doing but I think I think it's right to
assume that developers will look at this
very similar platform in its user
experience and some similarity in the
way you go about writing the code and
take advantage of that fact certainly
from a Microsoft perspective as well I
think next fall we will talk about
windows 8 and windows phone as family
products and I think that'll also you
know create more of a momentum around
people doing work that crosses both okay
Joe thank you very much yeah sex good to
see any shit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
