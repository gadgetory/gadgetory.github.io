are the sony a7 and a7 are cameras at
seventeen hundred dollars and twenty
three hundred dollars respectively these
are sony's most expensive and advanced
interchangeable lens mirrorless cameras
yet the a7 and a7 are are significant
for one reason they are the first
interchangeable lens mirrorless cameras
with full-frame 35 millimeter sensors
they are the smallest lightest and most
portable full-frame cameras on the
market all other mirrorless cameras have
smaller sensors that are not as good in
low light or other difficult shooting
situations and they can't match the
image quality of a full-frame DSLR as
the adage goes the best camera is the
one that you have with you and it's a
lot easier to have a smaller camera with
you more often for many that means a
smartphone but smartphones don't offer
anywhere near the image quality of a
proper camera Sony's managed to make two
cameras that aren't a chore to lug
around and can hold their own in nearly
any photo situation both cameras clearly
come from Sony's NEX line of mirrorless
cameras only they are slightly bigger
and have a few more dials and switches
on them they are also similar in
appearance to the RX one fixed lens
camera physically there aren't really
any noticeable differences between the
a7 and the a7 our save for the tiny
badge on the upper right of the camera
both have 3-inch tiltable displays high
resolution electronic viewfinders that
look absolutely great sizable rubbery
grips and enough buttons and dials to
satisfy even the most demanding
photographer both cameras are also solid
and well made and feel worth their price
tags inside is where the two models
differ as the a7 has a 24 megapixel
sensor and the a7r has a 36 megapixels
chip the a7 also has a faster autofocus
and continuous shooting speed but other
than that the two cameras are almost
identical they also feature built-in
Wi-Fi and NFC for pairing to an Android
or iOS smartphone and can shoot 1080p
video at 24 or 60 frames per second
shooting with the two cameras is almost
the same as well neither camera is
particularly quiet which is
disappointing that the a7 ARS shutter is
significantly louder and just doesn't
sound nice likewise the a7 s autofocus
is faster in practice the neither camera
is particularly quick when it comes to
focusing and I notice that the cameras
tended to miss focus a bit more than
proper DSLRs also the a7 s 5 frames per
second continuous shooting is passable
but it's not going to impress any sports
photographers the a7 s can be shot in a
variety of full automatic modes but
they're really designed to let you the
photographer take control and make just
about focusing and exposure but the
output from these cameras is quite
remarkable both models capture an
immense amount of detail with a7r taking
the edge due to its higher megapixel
count both cameras also shoot incredibly
well in low light and at high ISOs with
a slight nod to the a7 like we saw with
the RX one the a7 and a7 are can hold
their own with any other full-frame
camera up to ISO 6400 and higher ISOs
are even usable in most situations there
are some ugly JPEG processing artifacts
a few pixel peep on the images but
they're not visible most of the time and
aren't an issue if you shoot RAW I'm
partial to the $1700 87 because there's
enough resolution for my needs and I can
put the money save towards other lenses
and accessories it can be purchased with
an optional 28 to 75 millimeter zoom
lens for an additional 300 dollars the
lens is not particularly bright and it's
pretty slow to focus in dim light but if
you're considering the camera at all you
should probably pick it up just for its
versatility both cameras shoot well with
the zoom lens but they really come alive
with a fast prime such as the 35
millimeter f28 or a 55 millimeter F one
point eight autofocus is much quicker
and the image quality from a prime lens
is almost always better than with a zoom
lens the a7 s aren't perfect and they do
succumb to the some of the trappings of
other mirrorless cameras namely poor
battery life I tapped it out after only
a few hundred shots slow autofocus and
limited lens selection but you can't
ignore the incredible image quality they
offer that has been previously reserved
for much larger and more expensive
cameras and can't really be touched by
any other compact mirrorless camera on
the market with the a7 s Sony's managed
to defy expectations when it comes to
the laws of physics and what you can
expect from a compact camera it's clear
that Sony thinks this is the future of
photography and there's a good chance
that in a few years the big bulky DSLRs
of today will be mere relics of the past
and limited to very specific specialties
it's a taste of tomorrow's photography
that you can get today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
