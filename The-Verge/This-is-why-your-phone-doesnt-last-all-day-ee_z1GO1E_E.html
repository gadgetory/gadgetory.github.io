of modern technology.
They can stream Netflix,
play incredible video games,
and connect us with people
around the world at anytime,
all in the palm of our hands.
So, how come the battery
life sucks so much?
You remember your old phone?
The one that just played
Snake and made calls?
Those things had batteries
a fraction of the size
our modern smartphones
but somehow they lasted a week.
So with all the leaps and bounds
we've made in modern technology,
why can't our current phones
just last until the end of the day?
(upbeat music)
To find out why our batteries are so bad,
I talked to Dr. Venkat Srinivasan,
an expert in battery technology.
- So I mean, part of this is obviously
as you know very very well,
the demands of the apps coming off
the mobile devices increased
dramatically, right?
I mean that was pre-touchscreens,
pre all of us on Twitter and Instagram
and taking pictures and getting on these
high resolution screens.
So, much of it is just the fact
that the draw has become
dramatically more.
- Okay. So, phones have gotten way better
and they need more power because of that.
An original Nokia 3310 had 100 MHz,
single core processor,
and a 4,000 pixel display.
The Galaxy S10 plus from
2019 on the other hand,
has a 2.4GHz,
eight-core processor that
pushes 4,377,600 pixels.
So, yeah. Things have come a long way.
For processor speed,
we even a rule for this
called Moore's Law,
which says that roughly every two years,
the number of transistors that we can fit
on a single microchip will double,
which means proportionately more powerful
computers and phones.
- [Venkat] We all talk about
Moore's Law for electronics.
Unfortunately battery
energy density don't scale
at the same rate as
Moore's Law is scaling.
Also, batteries have been evolving.
It's just at a different pace
in which things happen.
- So our batteries don't improve
as fast at the rate of
the rest of our phones.
They have been improving,
to a point.
We've been squeezing
out more and more power
from materials in the
technology that we have now,
but there are limits to how far we can go.
- A lot of what has been
happening for a long time
is being sort of shrinking all the devices
that are inside of the chip
to make things better
and better and better.
In a battery equal to that
would be removing you know,
unwanted stuff from the battery.
So that I add more and more and more
dense, energy dense materials
so that I can ultimately pack
in a lot more energy into the system.
Turns out, people have
been doing this game
for the last 20 years.
And if you do this game
for the last 20 years,
you start to reach a point
where it's very difficult to
squeeze out anymore stuff.
Pretty much, most of the battery today,
is being used for something.
- Our modern batteries basically use up
all the internal space they have for power
and the only way to get more
is by shrinking down those internal parts,
like the barriers between cells.
And when those get too thin,
that's where safety issues can happen.
And when things get pushed too far,
well, we get products
like the Galaxy Note 7.
Basically, in modern
lithium ion batteries,
energy transfers between the positive
and negative electrodes
through a liquid solution.
Now, that solution's flammable.
But, it's okay because there's
a separator between the electrodes.
In the Note 7, that
separator was too thin.
It sparked and then the
liquid caught on fire.
- What happened five years ago was that
it became clear that these
limits were getting hit
where we couldn't remove anymore things.
But we reached a stage
where new improvements
in energy density got
to come from changing
battery materials.
And new materials are always slower.
- So what does the future look like?
Well, right now the material we use
is called lithium cobalt.
A battery technology that we've been using
since the early 90's.
But researchers have already started work
on what comes next.
- Actually all the batteries
have a liquid electrolyte in them.
The next big thing and I think
this is going to be a huge thing
is solid state batteries.
Things that don't have liquids
but a solid that can conduct lithium
back and forth between them.
You can't predict a breakthrough
so you don't know when
that's going to happen.
But we think that's
where things are going.
And if that happens,
cellphones and laptops will start getting
more energy dense.
- There is one slight issue
that could come up though.
By the time better
batteries do come around,
our phones might be even more powerful
than they are right now.
Which might leave us
right back where we started,
with less than a day of battery life
and external batteries galore.
Progress always has a price.
Thanks so much for watching.
