I'm taking a look at the new LG g4 this
is LG's new flagship smartphone for the
year obviously her place is AEG three
that came before it it looks very
similar to the g3 in terms of design
it's got the same size screens 5.5
inches same kind of overall shape
there's an ever so slightly almost
imperceptible curve to the device now
whereas the g3 was flat but it's nothing
along the lines of the G flex or
anything like that so the screen itself
is a new what they're calling quantum
IPS panel it's a brighter better color
reproduction and more efficient than
prior screens used by LG and of course
LG says it's better than the competition
as well as the same q HD resolution so
it's 2560 by 1440 pixels it's really
bright great viewing angles in this
limited time that we've had it really
does look nice it's powered by a
Snapdragon 808 processor it's got three
gigabytes of RAM 32 gigabytes of
internal storage LG claims that it is
just as fast as the s6 and a whole
variety of situations such as opening
apps and opening your camera and things
like that one of the other big new
features in the g4 is the new camera
which features a new f1 point eight
aperture lens it's the brightest cell
phone lens that you can get at this
point it's 16 megapixels and resolution
it's got a new image sensor in there as
well the g4 still has the laser
autofocus system that we saw on the g3
but over here on the other side
underneath the flash is the new sensor
that provides more accurate white
balance and better color reproduction LG
says that this this is the camera that
will actually make you replace your
point-and-shoot camera or digital SLR
the other thing that LG is really
talking about here is the design of the
g4 this particular one uses a plastic
back with a kind of dimpled finish not
too unlike the g3 but LG is also
offering an leather back which uses a
vegetable tanned finish and stitches and
all kinds of stuff to give more of a
premium feel as opposed to the metal or
glass that every other phone
manufacturer is using the back itself is
still removable so you can customize the
different backs you can take the battery
out you can an SD card slot in so the g4
is actually has a lot of features that
Samsung has taken out of its most recent
phones LG has decided to keep them for
this year's model for software the g4 is
running android 5.1 lollipop it's still
lg's interface and skinning on top of it
but the company says that it has removed
a lot of duplicate apps most versions
will only have one browser which is
google chrome and it has a lot of other
google apps pre-installed just like most
Android phones today as well as
integration with Google Drive throughout
the calorie app and the music app and
other things
it still feels and looks a lot like LG's
software it really doesn't look too much
different than the G flex 2 or the g3 or
anything along that line LG says that
the g4 will be available in the US by
the end of May or early June can expect
to see it on all the usual carriers and
LG says they'll be priced about the same
as the g3</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
