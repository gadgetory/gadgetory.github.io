we're looking at the novos mix 2 11.6
inch windows tablet now there's two
versions of this is obviously the 11.6
inch version there's a 10.1 inch version
and essentially they do the same thing
so you got the tablet like you would any
normal tablet but it will literally
magnetically connect into a keyboard
care so not too dissimilar to Microsoft
Surface connectors on here you can see
they look quite similar they're
essentially it will slap straight in to
a laptop style mode you can see there's
no hinge here and then when you want to
actually close the the tablet and lid
like you would a normal laptop literally
just push down and it sort of slots into
place it like almost applied back onto
another magnet here and and the other
mode you can do which is this one here
it's like at what they call like a stand
mode and since you've got a speaker at
the front here with William will come
out and it doesn't have the traditional
sort of tablet mode like you can connect
it there and it feels like it's
connecting but and that's not like a
recommended mode and you can clearly see
that it's not designed to go that way
other than that there's some small sort
of differences between a 10.1 inch
version level 6 there's a couple of
years bees on this keyboard up here and
the other main differences are this
one's the core i5 for the 11.6
introversion and the 10.1 inch version
is the pay traffic so that was the
Lenovo mix too</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
