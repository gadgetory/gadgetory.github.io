the verge mobile show I am dieter bohn
i'm dan seifert and i am chris sigler
dan and Chris were expecting snappy
patter from me before I just dropped my
name so that they could get ready with
their cover repost proposed proposed I
usually I usually like to take a long
drink of whatever beverage I'm enjoying
while you're going through your opening
spiel and you really didn't give me
enough time to enjoy a beverage this
week little upset about it well normally
you have more time to Chris cuz there's
it goes it goes dieter Vlad myself you
where is flat what's led story we don't
know where that is Vlad he's busy he's
on the streets of London he's busy air
quotes he's not letting so harder
there's a werewolf in london maybe
American and Vlad has to fight it uh
yeah yeah so uh mr. mr. Ziegler do you
want to talk about the environment next
week actually there are some logistical
issues here that maybe our viewers and
listeners don't care about but I'm going
to share them anyway which is that we
don't actually have regular studio time
in New York booked for this program
which is fine because we don't need
studios because we don't but uh but next
week I will be in New York possibly for
a very long time I might die there yeah
um it's a risk it's a it's a genuine
risk well no I'm just saying like of old
age right like I may just be there well
I mean London's got werewolf sand and
New York has as Chris tickler yeah you
can't leave you just either right Lakers
like Hotel California so yes I will be
in New York next week uh with
I am a little shall we say skittish
about having been in Chicago with easy
access to delicious pizza for the past
11 years of my life so this is a Chris
if you really get homesick there's
always a unos dan we already went
through this the uno in New York and
elsewhere in the United States is a
licensee of the uno name if you want
real uno pizza there are precisely two
places to get it way way way way way way
there are few places to get uno
shouldn't there be just one ah shouldn't
it be called like it should be called do
oh no dieter I almost feel like you
actually know that the second one is
called doing because it is really yeah
and you're just setting me up but yes
there are two uh wouldn't it be derision
alunos there's uno and do a their local
would we dos Chicago pizza might not be
new york pizza but it's not mexican
pizza manish pizza I what I needs one
right well no yeah we know me it's one
dude do a means to in Italian oh okay
see I'm when i see you know I think one
in Spanish yeah so oh well who know is
one in the right for confusing that
fantastic chain restaurant with
fantastic Chicago pizza when I want to
eat stuff that doesn't taste good like
me or feeds welcome to the Virgin Mobile
show ad nauseam if flag comes later aqua
carrots and avocados yeah an avocado
we've actually had requests for more
avocado banter really more avocado
banter I hope this is enough avocado
burger eating avocados is like last ones
that aren't paint stained with blood
like there's a lot of there's a lot of
bad avocados out there that come from
poor working conditions so I do actually
think there's an opportunity a genuine
opportunity for a fresh foods podcast
not necessarily hosted by the verge but
in the the podcast world in general I
think there's probably a good
opportunity for that but anyway the
getting back to the original discussion
here yes as of next week I will be in
New York which kind of changes
potentially how we are going to record
and present yeah the show to you and
yours answers yet there's an easy answer
for that you just need to go to a place
where you can record and obviously the
best solution is for you to get in the
car that you own and drive there uh I
know why you're you're trolling me say I
no longer own a car which I also feel
very weird about yeah a lot of weirdness
in my life this week don't worry name is
car ownership sucks yeah it's kind of
like home ownership just a big false lie
you guys are killing me any mob speaking
of dying flappy bird yes flappy bird
like has been around and then it had its
glorious moment since we last podcasting
and then it died unless you happen to
have a phone or what I'm outie made by
the expensive phone that they're selling
that has flat for where are you using
android phone you just Google for the
APK I do not endorse yeah what dan has
suggested or you have a windows phone in
which case you're using the clone that
is identical to be real game the kerf
that's in the Windows Phone store yeah
uh so I flappy bird was discussed on the
ridge cast I don't really don't have a
ton more to add other than it's
remarkable and I kind of can't wait
until the next thing to seem like flappy
bird happens and also if you had any
doubt in your mind whatsoever that there
is a very strong correlation to draw
between apps and pop music hits you need
to let that go because one hit wonders
are here flappy bird is the nasty I
don't want to go with bye bye bye it's
what's a good ones I wonder we can go
fine I actually they're never going to
give you
up of apps no I I actually argued
exactly not the perfect rickroll I think
I think your point is flawed because the
developer has like four apps in the top
10 most popular games on united's so
who's in who's a good for hit wonder
that we can talk about um but the other
ones only became hits because they
discovered their back catalog right I
don't think so I think he's had success
in the app store before not to this
extent no obviously flappy bird is like
you know Metallica wrote for great
albums and then had the black album
where that took off at everyone
Metallica's name but you know that's the
first example I could they go as far as
i can tell the phrase for hit wonder
doesn't appear on the internet anywhere
Wow um what was the point ears wonder
podcast formerly known as a virgin
mobile show we are we clear today how do
we not have fun here we go here we go
third eye blind is a four-hit wonder
thank you they do the semi charmed kind
of life song yeah and the the jumpers
own yeah there's any charm kind of life
is about doing math but you didn't know
that says cool fact bro anyways I don't
want to talk about bad games I want to
talk about Three's cuz threes is like
the best game member and yes actually
really good game and I hate dieter and
Chris because they're really good at it
and I'm not very good I'm not got it I
don't know what you're talking about
deters score is like three times mine
well that's like 10 times mine so yeah
no matter fun oh my god forehead
wonderful he's and gentleman has some
time to talk about threes so here's my
experience with threes I've gone through
yeah I think whenever you you have a new
strategy game and I'm going to disclaim
this by saying that I'm terrible at
games in general and specifically like
uh you know games involving like logic
and strategy like chess anything that is
in the same vein as chess I fail at and
36 flappy bird like
you know no flappy bird is is is not
it's like a action / platformer right
exactly really simple I don't know how
you play that's exactly our chess how
Chris totally avoided deters troll by
not by took I didn't I I I can only be
trolled so much in one show anyway I i
I've gone through phases with threes
where I keep changing strategy it's like
first as like well you know the best
strategy is to just make sure that
you're matching color you know you keep
tabs on the next tile and you make sure
that you're matching colors as much as
possible note that was my second
strategy my first strategy was just to
push everything into one corner my
second strategy was to match colors as
much as possible and now my strategy is
just yellow I basically just like do
whatever and that seeing actually seems
to work best that's how we've got all my
high scores so if you're not familiar
threes is a game on the iphone where you
slide numbers around on a board and when
they match they double they so you start
with three than 6 12 etc etc and our own
andrew webster wrote about it and we've
all become quickly obsessed with it and
the the high score amongst the verge
staff has been passed around a little
bit j crash snack has had it for a while
i believe i have it right now but yeah
it's a it's a good game and it's well
worth the two or three bucks so yeah I
think it's a buck 99 or something but
yeah the UM the thing with threes is
like there's a lot of games like this on
the App Store there's a lot of games of
great gameplay there's a lot of games
that are addictive and fun to play but
like it's these little things in threes
that just make it like a real joy to
play even if you're not having the best
game you've ever played the cards become
little characters that say things as you
play the same thing Lee I gotta turn the
music back on I've been with the music
is awesome turn the audio on because the
music is awesome they say things like
hello and like bored if you like don't
make a move for a while and it's just
like these fun little nuances of the
game that just make it a fun experience
yeah it's good it definitely reminds me
like there's this entire class of games
that concentrate as much on design as
they do on gameplay hundreds comes to
mind yeah letterpress
and you know what's what's interesting
about both of those games is that they
were flash flashes in the pan right like
they they were super hot for like two or
three months and they disappeared and I
suspect 3s will be the same way because
if I play more than three or four games
in a row I start to be like this stupid
and then I want to throw my phone and
eventually I'm gonna get to the point
where I feel that as soon as I open the
game but right now it's super fun did
you ever play a hundred thousand or is
it a million I figure what it's called i
can't i can't read how many zeros are
out here it's a really great game like
that i'm not really match symbols and as
you match symbols this dude running
across the top kills monster it's great
just trust me well whatever you do don't
play dieter again don't play against
eager and again ever evil he will ruin
that game for you very quickly yeah
don't add him to game center unless you
want to be really depressed yeah
although I don't know if I'm easy to add
on game center because I I've switched
my apple ID to a different email address
so that it be harder to have my identity
stolen after mat Honan had his identity
stolen via a vector that included a
apple not that it you know it really
saves me but I think just searching for
an email address might not get you to me
on game center no not a lot of people
are pals with me on games they're also
the process of opening game center
waiting for it to actually load hoping
it doesn't crash is so painful doesn't
really matter also speaking of awesome
things this nexus 5 it the red orange is
it is i still haven't seen in person is
it as awesome in person as it seems it
is it is fu red or orange but in a good
way right in a great way it is a it is
just like shockingly shockingly
beautiful yeah I don't understand why
they didn't that this from the get-go
and I'm very mad at myself for buying
the black one because now I can't buy
this one ah with it then that gives rice
it important question
which is is is back the same texture as
the black one of the white one black and
the sides also equally as important well
really because I had heard the opposite
um okay well hmm I don't know no it's
totally it's it's totally soft like it's
not quite as like soft touchy as the
black one which is really owes a nebosh
to the palm pre in terms of its soft
touch feel actually technically there's
ladies and gentlemen is your weekly
webos reference well if you want to
really get into soft touch polycarbonate
on phones the phone that that really
started at all in my opinion is the treo
750 it did the best job of like proper
soft touch diener just leave Assad cast
right now of course it did the best job
in your opinion look we established
before the show started that I began
podcasting in 2006 and it was the the
trio central trio cast and so yeah
that's like if I'm podcasting I'm
talking about trios that's just what my
life is but we can move on otherwise but
but like honestly like this thing is
really am awesome and you should you
should buy 10 of them hey you guys use
pebbles right early some of you do I
don't currently because I am waiting on
my shipment okay I wanted in front of me
and the battery's dead so here's my
question and Vlad used one to right
that's right what out let's there okay
so do you guys have this thing and it's
been doing this ever since version 1
point 0 where every once in while the
iphone is like a pebble wants to
communicate with pebble technology
corporation blah blah blah and then like
you have to unlock your phone and then
it automatically opens the pebble app
and then everything is normal again do
you guys have that I've had where the so
on the iphone it's got two connections
it's got a bleep standard Bluetooth
connection than a Bluetooth le
connection which supports the
notifications and sometimes the
Bluetooth le connection drops and it
will ask to reenable that yeah I think
that's what's happening it's super
annoying because of like it forces you
to open the pebble app like there's no
way around it you can't even like just
hit pair and then move on with your life
you hit pair and then the app opens it's
insane anyway I'm gonna have to talk
sounds like the absolute worst Chris it
isn't you guys what's right for both of
you that applies with respect to the
iphone you talking about yeah yeah yeahs
android it's just straight up bluetooth
at least the the versions that i'm using
and like I've used pebble way more than
to it than I have an iPhone because you
can be with at least with the supporting
apps not I don't know what to point out
but you'd be way more discriminate about
what doesn't doesn't get pushed out to
the pebble and you can change it when
you feel like it what 2 point 0 is way
better non-iphone way he bet my promise
I I don't want email showing up on my
phone screen I'm uncomfortable with that
for whatever reason but I'm totally
comfortable having it show up on my
watch so there's about education that I
would like to have my watch that I can't
on an iPhone because I don't want them
on my phone screen actually and I don't
know if this is a bug or if it's
intentional or what and I've been
meaning to Google around on this and
figure out what's going on but for some
reason that's exactly how mine behaves I
don't have gmail set to show on my lock
screen but it still shows up on my watch
mmm well it depends I think if you do it
if you set it up inside the app it used
to be then it would work because it was
a direct thing I don't know it's been a
while yeah through Notification Center
that it follows those roles and um
speaking of notification centers oh nice
8.1 leaks Technology Center do you
remember back in the day when when Trent
produced the podcast and if there was a
really good segue he'd inject the sound
of a segway scooter do you remember that
I do remember that it wasn't a segway
scooter it was the Jetson yeah I was
gonna say the segways don't make noise
no it Lisa Jetsons no no there no
there's at least one occasion where he
actually used like a segway scooter I'm
sure of it try it if your list in
Trenton isn't listening I know why it's
okay
I'm gonna email try to ask him about
this either deters right I think it's
the jetsons amp yeah well I the
important thing is that I successfully
derailed eaters pretty good transition
so Windows Phone 8.1 seems to be kind of
awesome like support for soft buttons a
proper notification center which is
called Action Center which seems to
actually like perform or do the way
you'd want it to slightly improved
camera interface they've changed the way
that multitasking works so that apps
don't fully quit out they can they can
still reside in the background but then
you can quit them manually by swiping
them instead of hitting a tiny stupid
little X you know just a slew of stuff
that there's improvements all over the
place sec I haven't seen a pip update
for a phone this big in a while I mean I
guess seven to 7.5 was um you know of
this caliber but this this seems like a
really nice update for windows phone and
I'm excited to see phones running it
yeah i was talking to tom about this
earlier today and he and I both agreed
that like this is a lot more than we
expected microsoft to roll out for happy
point one and it really feels like it
should be called windows 9 but i mean i
guess they're keeping 8.5 I mean
whatever but I guess they're keeping it
in line with Windows 8.1 which you know
lots of signs at this point to Windows
RT and this kind of merging together all
right finally so so that kind of makes
sense that they're calling 8.1 but uh
you don't know when what Windows RT is
by the way like I have no idea like what
it is who uses it what they use it on
it's not a clue there are currently like
in two devices that run ever I know the
surface 2 and that nokia tablet nobody
else makes RT devices anymore so it's
essentially Microsoft's own operating
system for its own devices yeah but
anyways uh you know it like dieter said
it looks great for windows phone 8.1
made uh it's bringing a lot of things
that we've been asking for for a long
time which maybe should have been there
a long time ago but you know they're
finally coming and it seemed i think the
word is that we're going to see this
around april which isn't too far away
Wow
that isn't far away at all um you know
what's kind of what's going to cause
complete havoc and I'm just gonna throw
out a completely hypothetical situation
here all right I'm imagine if microsoft
says oh well you know uh the lumia 1020
is going to get a point one uh and like
one or two other phones he isn't yeah
the 920 isn't like all these other
phones aren't going to get it like it's
gonna be windows phone 8 verses 7.8 all
over again that was a huge fiasco yeah
it was about timing i I'm sure that
Microsoft eventually rolled out 7.82
some phones but where are they waiting
for it for like a really long time
nobody cared what it finally arrived
right so i am going to say I trust
Microsoft not to do that that if your
phone ran windows phone 8 that you're
gonna be able to run 8.1 I wasn't that
the whole purpose of moving from seven
to eight yes it would but they don't
like it modern a kernel modern
infrastructure in the whole shooting
match yeah I guess but it's like I'm
sure Tom's yelling into a screen right
now like that's my goal in every pot
because I know that Tom watches us so I
just want to make sure that Tom gets
upset at what we're talking about at
least once per show yeah I tom I because
Windows Phone even have Instagram yet
right which the wait for that right and
vine well though they got fine is really
important yeah I must really dumb okay
so cam Aaron Cameron Cameron Cameron cam
Aaron wants to know does it matter how
good windows phone gets can they dig out
of the hole that they're in so we kind
of talked about this last week where I
was like we need to stop thinking of
them as being in a hole they're
definitely in a hole in some markets but
in other markets they could actually do
okay and they just need to focus on
those i would give Windows Phone another
try if they could make nice with Google
like I would give it like more than like
a you know I'd give it the old college
try I'm just said Tom just tweeted that
he's upset you think that's that's a
very you don't know what that's about us
though he's just generally upset i would
baby weight yes sir is there is there
a footy match going on because he's
always upset about sex oh I love it when
people talk Hoodie match what yeah he
does treat about podia Lannister it's
always around like four in the afternoon
my time and then like Tom starts
complaining about some some soccer game
so here's what you need to know about
tom he's a huge asian so you're not sure
if tom is it's Tom Warner resident
Microsoft expert who is he's an enormous
Manchester United fan you should tweet
at him like things about man you you
should send him man you like in products
and souvenirs huge fan anyway yeah I'm
sorry guys sorry it's late it's making
the day I I overslept which is the
reason I have a red nose and I'm late
for the podcast so I'm already in a
position to defend Europe at the moment
this entire assault I'm the good name of
Tom Warren and our entire continent I
just don't know what to do about it just
ah yeah I'm just gonna shrug and say on
top just let it completely start by just
a dentist's point about Microsoft as a
chance to make scoop of Google I mean
that if it's just way too big for me I
guess far as I'm concerned from what
I've seen since the beginning the real
problem like google has with Microsoft
is google doesn't want a competition
what do you say google is afraid of
Microsoft getting in oh who has some
other disagreement that's kind of taken
out on Microsoft in this way the fact is
reason there isn't a good YouTube app
from with this phone there isn't a good
gmail app etc is because Google doesn't
want playbook and I don't think it's we
wanted to do so ever since the beginning
because I mean to me I just see it is
google being defensive on a mobile front
what do you think i mean it's its
defensive but at the same point it's
like like google so far ahead that it
doesn't need to be defensive in this way
I mean I think like maybe maybe this has
to do something with how much you know
oft as you know gone after Google in
certain areas for search dominance and
claimed that Google has a monopoly and
all these things and you know actually
gotten somewhere with especially
European authorities and things like
that so I don't know maybe this is
Google's way of taking out I don't know
but yeah it's not the google support it
does make it very difficult at least for
myself i know a lot of us a lot of
people that rely on google services
which seems to be growing every day
google gmail subscriptions are growing
not shrinking so that's a big thing that
makes it difficult to move over to
windows well absolutely but but i would
also say it's a little bit different
from the search situation where bings
existence actually helps Google because
it keeps Google out of antitrust
situations at least even more severe
ones that already exist because at least
is some sort of sort of I book that's
you know somebody you can say hey Bing
exists those guys can take a bit of the
end trust heat of Google doesn't read
the case with their mobile strategy but
I agree with you I think that Google is
way far ahead and can afford to be a bit
more relaxed about it but then we can
also say that about Apple in the iphone
and Steve Jobs used to spend Ernie
schools talking trash about Android and
now Tim Cook is just taking up the baton
is doing the same thing like every
chance he gets he talks trash about
Android you know crappy tablet
experience um whatever it is formally
disease companies up one was he got
somebody asked about the google selling
off motorola and he had an acerbic thing
he said that google isn't committed
enough yeah i think it's it's really
hard to do hardware and software
services and link all those things
together that's what makes apple so
special it's really hard so I'm not
surprised that they're not going to do
that I mean in all honesty that's that's
just kind of like a slightly meaner way
of what we've been saying that Google
just didn't have the patience to ride
that out yeah well it's not I mean
that's not the only factor but I think
that it's one of the factor there's is
that Google didn't want to wait for it
was a pretty well toned
I gotta say he gets he gets credit from
that for that from me same interview he
also was pretty evasive about what the
new categories were and he's like you
know there's going to be two categories
and no reasonable person would say that
this isn't a new category which is a
weird way to couch it but whatever
categories being new products that apple
is expected to rice that new front not
another iphone not another ipad not
another mac not um maybe i don't know
like i would say not another apple TV
but maybe it is something in that zone
doc to say anyway we should actually get
back on the the Windows Phone horse
because Nokia's got news coming up we're
expecting that it's gonna unveil the
Normandy ironically not windows phone
news they've also got this mystery
Windows Phone that we saw the YouTube
video for which there's been speculation
that it's the verizon icon I think yeah
this has been talked about for a long
time a rumored or something at least
yes'm uh go ahead dear I'm sorry not so
i don't know normandy and nokia phone
running android so i think Tom's not to
not to bring the talk back on to Tom but
he summed this up really well the other
day in a tweet he's like if you don't
care about nokia Asha phones you're not
gonna care about nokia normandy phone
even if it runs android right yeah so
that's that's pretty much what it is and
i think like you know we've talked about
this before about how it's a great way
for Microsoft to bring its services to
the lower lower markets where Asha is
that where they currently don't run
extra phones don't run bang they don't
run out look they don't run a whole host
or onedrive now whole host of services
that android phones can run so it's it's
a good way for that and the other side
is that you know no key has had these
kind of subversive factions that have
managed to push products to market
before so it's I'm not hugely surprised
at this
is going to market um a lot of people
have said its egg on the face of
Microsoft maybe it is I don't know I
totally is I if they can push their
services though that's like all that
matters right man if it's an android
phone I mean like it's it's not a win
for Google because it's an android phone
that wont run Google Play so it's like
Google doesn't care uh-uh and if it's
able for Microsoft to be able to push
ping and outlook and all these other
services to a whole new audience in a
whole new market then that's a win for
Microsoft and bear in mind that from the
consumers perspective they will never
hear the word android like you don't
hear with from amazon and you're not
going and it looks like a windows phone
like the interface that we've seen the
leaks interface that we've seen look
like Windows Phone interfaces right
which will clash jarringly with the
android apps yeah whatever well I mean
that's the thing though right because
they are not going to have google play
I'm nokia presumably will be curating
app availability very closely um so with
that might end up being a non-issue to
some extent yeah I mean to mine so
something like the Amazon App Store on
there just make it essentially a
paradise of great apps yeah amazon
appstore and Yandex those those
eruptions on the yola phone does your
phone have Amazon action I know has unix
anything hasn't pretty loaded but it's
one of the recommendations that they
make well regarding Yandex and not just
not just Russian but also Chinese app
stores it's probably safe to say
considering the market segment that
Normandy is going after that there will
be an opportunity for them to load a lot
of asian and russian app stores on these
phones right yeah so that one fly in in
the US but you're not going to see the
normandy on any US carrier i'm assuming
i think so we don't we don't see any
asha phones here so right exactly
so okay we saw a couple Samsung leaks we
saw there's some some icons and well
they had that they were teasing these
new icons that look very decent but I
think you made the point that they look
flat a flat was wow that's pretty good
actually no I'm like that but notice
you're here's the thing when it's the
last time I mean we still make fun of
samsung for TouchWiz but seriously when
it's the last time anyone at Samsung has
said the word touch woods oh you've been
a long time and they are they always
jump on me whenever I mentioned touch
ways or tweet TouchWiz that like we
don't call it TouchWiz anymore yeah okay
fine whatever I'll call it i'll call it
life companion self wear whatever you
want Susan listen they stop talking
about TouchWiz and they started putting
s in front of everything yeah and now
there's another girl instead of putting
s in front of everything they're putting
five after everything yeah everything to
the power of five so life speed
curiosity everything to the power of on
it so having a cup well I'm sorry blood
go ahead then go ahead well I was just
gonna say there's been a couple of
reports and samsung's new software is
going to be toned down that they've had
these agreements with Google and those
part of the reason that Google sold
Motorola was that it made these
agreements with Sam something that
Samsung is going to back off of all of
its s software or a lot of it at least
and promote the native google apps and
we seen we've heard those reports
samsung itself released these icon sets
today uh but other than that you know we
have no idea what the s5 looks like
there haven't been any hardware leaks we
saw there's been some very kind of
sketchy leaks saying the specs of it
that it might have this processor and a
1080p screen or whatever but we still
have no idea what the design looks like
which is pretty remarkable I think we
mentioned this last week or whatever
that's pretty remarkable we haven't seen
any leaks of it with it supposedly but
it's not it's not remarkable the Samsung
has done a tremendous job of keeping its
phone secret for the past like 20 18
months it's remarkable it's still
remarkable in the whole scheme or the
whole world of consumer electronics were
literally everything leaks I mean yes
it's samsung has done this before where
it's kept everything quiet up until the
release it's still remarkable that it's
doing dan can I live vicariously through
right now and would you do me the favor
of eating a cookie dough oreo which I
still can't find in Chicago I will
actually need to leave my seat to go get
them I love this I want one so bad but i
can't find they're not good man they
taste like day-old coffee not good i
don't recommend uh while we're on the
topic I'll give my quick review of the
new special edition Oreos the
marshmallow crispy ones which have a
golden cookie are edible they're not bad
I would not buy them again the cookie
dough I once which have a chocolate
cookie are not very good and I
definitely would not buy them again that
really sucks i had high hopes for the
cookie dough on yeah me too it sounds
like a great idea I mean they should
what happen if you put a cookie dough
Oreo in the oven and like baked it
perfect right you get like a solid
cookie in between two like overdone way
through no I mean maybe maybe cookie
dough Oreos would be awesome like broke
it up and crumbled into vanilla ice
cream but on their own not very good and
what they should have done is just taken
like raw Oreo batter and put it in
between two cooked oriya wafers I don't
know if anyone wants to really know what
rod Oreo batter looks like that's true
I'm trying to decide if i woke up or if
i'm still go for a nice are you talking
about anything right oh god I'm just
gonna drag this ride back to icons I
don't give a damn if I was gonna go to
your deviate although the oreo and see
is the iconic cookie so I think that's
an appropriate segue yeah enough quick
quick quick mention the icons somebody
in front enough in our facebook comments
mentioned this and he was spot on they
very much remind me as well of symbian
the latest versions of symbian buy
nokia's things like Symbian Belle and
they're very clean so
all the gradients have been taken out it
so dual color so and so circular so
Symbian Belle had this kind of squared
circle rounded square shape this is a
these are circular but they they keep
that same sort of flat design and just
two colors what a would say chance of
you to say that they're pulling this
stuff from Simeon when the obvious
obvious thing is that they're pulling
flat this flat ideas not of the icon iOS
7 yeah by 07 does a lot of gradients
there's no gradients here Samsung's
icons is specifically the thing that
stood out to me is that they've
eliminated the gradients at least in the
ones we see now the having some leeks
with show gradients which are much
closer to iOS 7 but in general I have
the strong feeling that well they've got
gradients in the icons on iphone anyway
I have a strong feeling that the design
of the software on the the next Galaxy
phone from samsung is like just now
getting pinned down from radically
different visions I think that they had
that weird stuff on the tablet there's
rumors at Google you know making them
tamp stuff down we've seen various
conflicting leaks we've seen these icons
that don't seem to match up super well I
I am betting that like what we're gonna
get is going to be kind of a hot mess of
a bunch of stuff that got like finished
last minute but actually does matter you
wouldn't give that was sensing anyway
imagine imagine Samsung just like
releases the s5 it's got killer
cutting-edge hardware and that it's just
like running stock Android 44 and then
it just like drop some I can walk to it
that'd be pretty awesome instead of
websites money for a google edition just
saying it would pretty awesome so did
you see this rumor over at the
information that they're creating an API
where it will track stuff that you type
and then i create a service called
context so that other apps can see that
you're completely obsessed with oreos
and so when you open up amazon it will
know that you search for oreos all the
time and it will suggest REO stuff to
you
that's like that's really speaking as
someone who loves to be targeted by ads
that even terrifies me yeah okay so hang
on so you live your life in a browser on
your desktop and you know Google knows
what you're searching for it's got a
text box that you're typing stuff into
all the time in your browser or on
google's homepage and that gets used to
target stuff to you all the time so if
is is a difference that you don't trust
Samsung to be a good steward of that
information I don't trust the apps that
Sam's that could potentially be
requesting that is yeah but hang on
google shares the that like target
information with the sketchiest of
sketchy websites I'm sure when you're
doing stuff on your browser like the
only difference between what Google does
and what Samsung is doing is that this
is on your phone and it's Samsung and
they're like targeting more than just
what you type into a browser well I
think we don't know I think there's a
lot of unknowns here like like you said
they're targeting more than what you
type into your browser so is it reading
all the text messages that i send is it
reading all the private email
communications that i said because it's
is it capturing literally everything i
type into the keyboard and you know a
lot of people have take issue with like
third-party keyboard apps that you can
install on android because the the
biggest permission that they have on
them is that this can read everything
you type and you know what are they
doing with that data so that's the kind
of lesser evils it's not just a party
keyboards i was just going to say that
is no different to what google's
keyboard available to play store once
permission for yeah but we don't believe
that Google is using that information
for ad targeting do we well it is a
matter what the information is being
useful the point is using keyboard
because that goes well yeah but what I'm
saying is it doesn't matter for you to
be you know upset a word about it for
you to know whether it's for ads or for
some other purpose it the risk is there
that's my point so you saw the google
keyboard and first mission you give is
this can record all the information that
you type in
doesn't matter what application what
you're doing start typing wicker record
of this data so that's sufficient for
you to have a security work to ask you a
question I think speaking candidly yes
you we don't trust Samsung as much as we
trust Google I mean Google operates of
the United States even you know people
in Europe we're more familiar with the
u.s. previous regime and you know the
ethics that Google is subjected to
whether it appears to them or not and
Samsung frankly is okay I'm not gonna
say it because I like to be alive and
everything but yeah it is this big
octopus like company with all of these
subsections and samsung Display company
which is a separate company but it's
also subsidiary and there's always stuff
going on and it's just unfamiliar so
it's kind of a scary proposition I think
that the challenge for sams like will be
if it does indeed plan to do this is to
show the value that is going to provide
to me the user with all this data that
it's country google has 10 like so well
i mean google has whether you know it's
it's actually providing value to me or
it's convinced me that this is valuable
you know i find things in my google now
cards all the time for stuff that i
search for that you know is kind of
interesting so you know if Samsung's
able to prove that to me that letting it
capture all of this about all of this
content or all of this some information
is going to be valuable to me and it can
do all these cool things and grey that's
going to be the hard sell Google's
already proven that it's been doing it
for years it's you know improving the
searches it's improving things with
flight recommendations and airline
status and all this other stuff that it
already does so listen but I think the
way to summarize this is first of all
these TouchWiz icon so whatever Sam so
it was cool to software well those are
the okay guys let's do this let's let's
right now here now decide are we gonna
just keep calling a touch waves in the
same way we've decided that with we're
calling it metro and I don't care what
Microsoft that Microsoft Fitch elated I
mean it's going to like pin TouchWiz on
samsung forever
because it was terrible once or do we
want to come up with like the other
option and I think the one that Samsung
prefers is Samsung user experience no no
go ahead like denuded words that have no
I'm sayin reference and passion like
meaning samsung calls it i mean i think
we should go a lot of such ways we
should call it life experience or Life
Companion move on overwhelming support
though I wanted Samson said a word
samsung Simon look we can go to send
them softly lately samsung weeks is here
to freaking burn it seems like software
sinner face sinner face is pretty good
sooo trophies alright so glad finish
your thought about this interface okay
and I'll focus on the sim part of this
interface but yeah I think yeah is
versatile you know you can read it a
whole bunch of ways I think first of all
I'll take your comments okay i'm going
to try finish the centers here ok coming
from comment somebody said whatever
alternative you give me to the currents
in the old TouchWiz icons is an
improvement so we don't need to be too
picky about these and after we still
just talking about an icon set it's just
teaser there's two weeks into over 24
when Sam so very much seems likely to
announce this galaxy s5 like Danny
saying we don't know much of anything
about the hardware we started to build
an idea about the software what I would
say is even if Samsung like teacher is
saying is working to scale things back
customizations try me cleaner and more
basic as these look suggests it is
really going to build into a hot mess
because right now one of the icons that
is being shown is a style icon which
again is simplified but its graphical
representation is the same thing as the
stock Gallery icon in android so the
very least is going to happen there is
that people going to be compute
it's gonna look like Gallery icon yep
but it's called style we don't know what
the hell is going to be but if that's
your photo gallery then we got a problem
John ledger asks in the the hangouts Q&amp;amp;A
I don't think it's a real job under
again but hi do we realize that if it is
called the samsung user experience the
best abbreviation for that is su as
beautiful that it actually be su ex soup
anyway look I I am I am willing to
reserve judgment on this thing until we
see it right like Samsung has a very
checkered past when it comes to this
stuff both and throwing way too many
features in lots of weird little corners
and just having like ugly design and I
would love to see them turn that around
I think it would I Connor actually the
seconds are actually a step in the right
direction and give me a little bit of
help oh I think we can consider that
there it will have been made progress if
they just took it out the option where
you can choose Comic Sans as your font
that is progress yes please please allow
me to do that hey and you know what else
the Sony Xperia z1 compact from Saudi
has a white balance adjustment that is
the first phone of seeing white balance
adjustment I would like more companies
to kick click that out and just just
have those extra tweaks available
because particular with Samsung enters
AMOLED displays sometimes they over
saturate we discussed the whole blue
tinting with displays etc so that would
actually be kind of a nice bit of new
functionality for me rum ok we gotta
talk about HTC so they just signed a
huge patent agreement with Nokia they
stopped suing each other which is great
but they also had a quarter where they
broke even ray but they're gonna lose
money again soon boo and then cheaper
phones that's gonna solve everything for
them which knew it would
we move it is they're gonna have they
they have to provide phones across I
mean they can't be can I got the number
gene whatever I mean I'm telling me it
depends on the market that they're going
for if they're going for the market in
China there cher Wang in her comments
made a very good point that the phones
in our stores cost five hundred dollars
or more and most of the phones sold in
China are 152 like $225 so if they're
not like selling phones in that space uh
and they want to be uh in that market
then then yeah they're gonna have to
release cheaper phones yeah maybe they
don't have to they don't have to spam
the US with those cheaper phones but
well is the idea that those cheaper
phones are like gonna become a profit
Center for them and like save the
company I mean no no no I think there's
a lot of other things that need to
happen as well but well no but hands
like I do you feel like HTC is just kind
of out of ideas at this point and it's
really making me sad because it's a
glorious company with a glorious recent
history and well no that's not true
they've got one idea is it was realistic
about wearables and it's not going to be
just another wearable right yes they're
talking about but that's my point what
I've seen over the past and four or five
years is every time a mobile company has
got a desperate its design decided to
retrench to emerging markets so nokia
would you still go with symbian was like
we still got all of this market share
we're going to work in the emerging
markets even love just kept talking and
talking about that until you've got the
company pulls out and the whole device
you know division shut down and oh by
Microsoft now BlackBerry has been doing
the same thing i were really big in
indonesia it's like no emerging markets
and a high volume of low profit margin
devices like these says i'm not going to
say so that is really a common idea that
HTC trying to retread wearables are
common idea that HD is trying to jump on
and you know good luck to them out
to see HTC you know capture that market
but again it's nothing new now and
finally the really disappointing thing
for me is Peter chair with a quarterly
results that would just announced that
yesterday in fact let's say we're going
to communicate better with the consumer
it's like that's a marketing was your
solution this time last year and now
you're just rehashing the exact same
solution that you haven't done anything
about over the past four months I mean
what I mean they're they're in a really
tough spot they can't fight samsung on
marketing dollars they're not integrated
stack developing a ton of their own
software they've got you know they got
blink video so I they there is a steep
steep hill that HTC has to climb in
order to be successful and I don't know
I don't know how they climate I don't
know like what like what possible
innovation unless it's wearable is the
bee's knees if they actually had a
wearable that fit on the knees of bees
that could be interesting yeah I mean
something around Scott croyle is a is a
pretty talented industrial designer and
I have a pretty strong feeling that
whatever we see out of them and the
wearables department is going to be
unique yeah I don't think that they're
out to replicate the galaxy gear and if
they are then god help them but you know
one thing really the only thing that in
terms of their high-end smartphone game
about the only thing that I can identify
at least in the US that hurt them last
year was the extremely delayed available
the of the one on verizon but other
otherwise there really wasn't anything
that I felt like they totally stumbled
on well I mean I don't know if it was
just a funny image of what they didn't
really have great marketing or a whole
lot of marketing yeah but I don't think
they could have done any I mean just
considering their marketing budget i'm
not sure that they could have up their
game their much all they could have gone
be list instead of paying for Robert
Downey jr. that's really you know they
could have had carrot top the thing that
I noticed different uh in 2013 vs2012 is
is even though
uh HTC didn't really sell it anyone exes
there are quite a few AT&amp;amp;T commercials
for the 1x and I don't recall seeing the
same for the one yeah something all
right so what HTC inevitably fails
Schumann wants to know who's going to
buy him actually I'm not gonna say they
know you feel but if they were to fail
and decide on something I baloney lenovo
already got their company right they
they shopped around they got rejected by
Canada for my blackberry like a scorer
we'll just go with motorola's that like
yeah but lenovo already had a a
smartphone business so I'm do you know
when I continue collecting smart phone
companies that's just like there's
something boltron just like my beloved
attorney to a giant awesome company you
get the motor then you'll have the moto
1 x yeah just saying throwing out ideas
I mean think about it can you imagine a
1x with HTC's industrial design
sensibilities that would be a truly epic
product here's my oh my here's Mike 1x
advice that it exists no one comes
motorola 1x are you ready yeah you ready
I am sorry I Moto X naught when I I
always do that I always called the moto
one ex I mean the Moto X here's gonna
here's who's gonna buy HTC are you ready
you guys standing by yeah think about it
it was Isis yeah that's right think
about both in Seattle I mean it would
make sense yeah make perfect sense yeah
that mean there are but then amazon puts
his calls in the table and essentially
announces to the world we are building a
smartphone if they don't know which body
she see because they already built the
Smurfs oh well i mean they could wait
until so the rumor in late 2013 was that
HGC was partnering with amazon for its
smartphones which i think there are two
or three that that are in the pipeline
or at least there amazon is playing
around with so amazon could wait until
the first generation
kindle phones come out and then by HTC
to thought I mean it is super convenient
it is serendipitous that HTC has a large
facility in in the Seattle area and of
course amazon has head headquartered
there so that would be there would be
some synergy there that would work out
very well yeah by chance I wanted to it
could buy t-mobile well n HTC and then
it could have a smart phone company and
a mobile network to run the smart phones
on and never leave Seattle ever ever is
t-mobile being run out of Seattle as
well yeah yeah t-mobile's at least until
print buys them oh but that's not gonna
happen is it but just briefly I just
want to say and it just builds and do
just points about what was it you say
say the help link video I mean that that
to me is the point with HTC you you have
you have a company and you have a budget
of energy and time the UKISS man on
developing your proposition to people so
if you spend your time on blinkfeed if
you spend your time or things like HTC
watch and things like HTC Sense and five
point 0 + 5.5 and I don't know what it's
going to be next version 6 photo and
those things are not compelling to
people they are bringing new consumers
in and getting people to buy you know to
make repeat purchases of HD devices well
this is where you end up I mean Tim Cook
is right you can do the hardware but you
can't just do that well you have to do
the software as well and this is where
HTC has consistently been fighting me
would keep saying this industrial design
is HTC strength it keeps naming it keeps
doing it well well and write it like
okay so here's a great example Zoe's
right the HTC the the one has got that
little thing where you can take a
picture and then it's like a moving
image and then you can upload it to
their service but it won't stay there
forever because why would you want that
to happen and then you share them in
there like flash and like it whatever
the little movies are look like if you
don't have the chops to run a cloud sir
this and like distribute your brand new
media format and don't run a cloud
service that takes a Zoe and converts it
into a gif or a jiff if that's how you
prefer it's pronounced how cool would it
be to have a phone that has the jif
camera that like it takes a picture and
five minutes later you've got an
animation of the best am so that you can
embed anywhere right I fear something
you kind of job that they didn't know
disappoint with the latest version of
Zoe I do think that you have a built-in
jiff creator well I'm not Zoe I think
it's in the photo gallery app that's
fine but you're absolutely right data
it's is the most convoluted jiff maker
in the world so your pitch to people
isn't you have a juice maker now in your
gallery and you can get it on your HD
phone you can stick it on Instagram and
everybody would love you for it because
you you look pretty cool no they're like
we do Zoe photos and yeah people need to
understand what Zoe is they need to
decode it and it's just so convoluted
and messy that ultimately puts people
off an editing body using it and and
then the end the other thing they're
sharing service you're absolutely right
is so over branded as well as not being
more functional than all the other ones
its own branded so HTC Zoe I'm sharing a
Zoe with the world like they assume it's
kind of like set from my iphone in order
for anybody to want to have all this
signature that identifies your device
they need to feel proud of the device in
the first place and agency just is in
that position anymore it's Apple does
the case you know you need to give
people reason to want to push your brand
and they're not doing that right I mean
if I told somebody that I was standing
in with Zoe they'd be like no thanks and
I ready to have kids yet right like or
all I know thanks I've already watched
the West Wing uh-huh where I'm not a big
fan of new girl there you go I actually
haven't watched new girl at all that's a
good shot I'm actually I'm a fan of it
become I was just I was mad at her
because like Ben Gibbard really I mean
come on but then she left it right she
like yeah she left him yeah she's like I
kind of want to be a movie star so see
ya
so I know what you'd be waiting so the
star of the grill uh zooey deschanel was
dating ever married actually start their
season the names ooey pronounce away
death cab for cutie and death cab for
cutie had like three great songs or like
oh man these guys gonna rock and then
they got super emo and then psycho
they're just as more conventional over
again and then I gave up on them but
like that they she managed to be cool
enough long enough to land her and so I
was always just bitter about that that's
all she I better and she is now so there
you go I have literally nothing to
contribute to this kind of I mean the
challenges HTC faces to you know get
back into business when you have even
just the name is yeah exactly like
they's if you see married Ben Gibbard
right and they just that was a mistake
who should they have married um oh I
don't know Robert Downey jr. but that
came too late it is but like in his coke
fazer in his clean face either
definitely the cook face he'll either
way you know I have to say thanks by buy
low sell high goodnick open early just
to extend this whole thing this whole
stupid terrible metaphor of ours Robert
Downey jr. as a for as a you know a
promoter of HTC's trying to me is kind
of yeah as a fisherman for HTC it
strikes me is kind of like Jennifer
Aniston in her desperation phase where
she's trying to prove that she can you
know have a hot boyfriend she's like
just find me somebody you know to I
don't think they're you know Robert
Downey jr. is one of the most well-known
movie stars in Hollywood right now he
the the Iron Man franchise remade his
career uh and you know the fact that
he's so well associated with iron man
and like high technology and things like
that kind of makes sense that he's at
work is she eating bushes energetic fun
um I'm just saying that agency is
desperate and it's just show it look the
highest-paid movie star of 2013 was
in the rock Johnson rock and what are
you know drill yeah it's true and and so
you see she should have hooked up with
the rock really yeah man I mean he's
definitely the guy who works at at the
most you can tell they all right but why
didn't he I believe me like 66 million
dollars last year yeah his packs are
larger than Vin Diesel and that to every
every fast and furious movie that the
rock is in like he can make it bigger
yeah his arms bigger and it's like chest
gets bigger and he just like because
more towering and menacing and they need
like smiles and he's like oh I'm a nice
guy but I could crush your face it's
really tails done all right just wait
ski this guy scarlett johansson spunk
mrs. johansson johansson are you Swedish
now Johan yeah maybe she is a case of
deal with her sound like a Swedish name
I mean it's certainly no dick I never
hurt anyone's getting me on Hanson
before I have currently well my
publicist is to me you know the biggest
failure of this year so far all right I
have the most marketable actress in
Hollywood and you associate her with
freaking SodaStream well okay you
associate her with the israel-palestine
conflict which is the most intractable
conflict that nobody should be
commenting on if they don't want to have
you know the head yo dove by one side or
the other and you stick your actress
into that I mean she could've the
commercial whole market in anything the
commercial also sucks like she's like I
don't know what they're trying to prove
but but she's like I'm gonna make this
go viral and then she like just stands
there for a minute and then that's the
end of the cover it's terrible hey man
we're talking about it so musta gone
viral yeah stream that was the plan all
along do we want to talk about how a
sprint thought that they could go roll
into the FCC you'd be like hey guys
how's it going the answer is like nope
not virgin nope you're not buying about
by and t-mobile it's like I could have
told
this look I mean all sprint had to do
was bring me in as a consultant like a
month and a half ago gave me a hundred
thousand dollars and I could have been
like nope isn't gonna work no matter
what out of the border like walked out
of it yeah what do you guys want to do
is nope nope okay but they could have
saved so much time and effort and money
if they had just brought me in in
December to tell them this yeah like did
anyone think this this was remotely a
sprint chairman masayoshi son and CEO
dan hesse accorded the wall street
journal they were shocked by the
opposition within the FCC well then they
should both lose their jobs because
anyone with half a brain could have told
them that this wasn't going to happen
yeah and why is that Chris because the
market is the market dynamic is
completely different now than it was in
2011 when the FCC shut down 18 tease
acquisition of t-mobile and it has
become much more competitive now so if
they shut down that acquisition in 2011
what would possibly lead them to believe
that a more competitive market 2014
would see regulators approve a sprint
purchase of t-mobile just didn't make
any sense well their their idea is that
they would be a better competitor to the
other big to that right now it's the big
two duking it out on top and then sprint
t-mobile kind of on a lower tier and
that if they were to combine then they
would like get up to that upper tier and
then there would be a true three-way
competition instead of a two-way
competition with Sprint t-mobile well I
would you be the chairman that's I'll be
the first to admit the den dan has it
dan has he is a sad panda I get it but
John ledger has created this arsenal of
quotes that would work against him in
any merger scenario right like he has
done nothing but try to convince people
that they are the most hyper competitive
uh like you know fu 18teen verizon
carrier on the market there there is
nothing depressing about their message
there's nothing depressing about the
prospects they're growing they're adding
subs like it just you then he's working
against the whole deal not to mention
the fact that even if
for an tmobile did merge they'd still be
something like 25 to 30 million
customers smaller than AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon
so they they wouldn't like be top tier
competitive they occupy this like weird
third place that can't quite reach yeah
it's terrible i dinnae already so to
curse this point is at some point in
legend right so that's that that's that
is that and that also is the entire
