and we are here in Seattle Washington
talking to Amazon about its latest
Kindle Fires the Fire HDX there's a
7-inch and 8.9 inch version they've got
spec BOMs brand-new screens an update to
the fire OS it's now on 3.0 there's also
a cheaper fire a 7-inch model that
starts at $139 which is kind of a
groundbreaking price point for a tablet
of any quality if you've seen Amazons
fire tablets before these won't look
completely unfamiliar to you they do
have some new design language they're a
bit more angular around the back and the
power button and the volume buttons have
moved on the HDX models the back is that
nice soft touch material that Amazon
likes to use Amazon says that the new
8.9 inch device is lighter than the
previous version it's thirteen point two
ounces thirty four percent lighter than
the previous generation it feels a
little bit lighter in your hand it's not
a massive noticeable difference when you
first pick it up the displays are pretty
amazing on both devices the seven-inch
screen is a 1920 by 1200 display and it
looks absolutely beautiful has a PPI of
323 while the 8.9 inch display is a
massive 2560 by 1600 339 ppi screen and
it is really impressive when you see it
up close both devices use the new
quad-core Snapdragon 800 CPU clocked at
2.2 gigahertz which is apparently three
times faster than the previous
generation and the devices have two gigs
of RAM doubling the RAM from the last
version fire OS 3.0 has some noticeable
changes cosmetically it's very similar
though it has been cleaned up in a lot
of areas it now has multi tasking built
in and it also supports a grid view for
apps and content the grid view is
essentially the same thing as the app
drawer on most Android devices the mail
app have been greatly updated it now
includes label support for Gmail and
threaded conversations which is a big
improvement over previous versions of
the mail app there is a new feature that
allows you to put stickers on top of
images or create mean-like images with
text above and below Amazon is updating
its
a future for video when you're watching
TV now you can see what music is playing
in the background of a scene and jump to
that particular spot in an episode or
you can jump into the Amazon store to
buy an mp3 they've also updated x-ray
for music it now includes an option to
read lyrics and even jump to a
particular spot in a song based on the
lyrics the to high-end versions have a
very interesting new software feature
called Mayday which lets an Amazon tech
support rep remote into your tablet and
give you real time on screen device
support and they can actually take
control of the device completely okay so
drag down there all right okay yep okay
can you can you do it for me I don't my
fingers are busy right now can you just
select that for me overall the picture
here looks pretty good for Amazon the
hardware and software updates are
welcome improvements to the fireline the
previous tablets were good these new
ones seemed considerably better to my
eyes some of the features such as Mayday
are truly innovative and I think a lot
of people are gonna find tremendous
utility in it however it does raise some
concerns given the recent focus that's
been put on our personal privacy on the
internet and on our devices though
Amazon seems to feel pretty confident
they've got a secure and sensible piece
of software yeah now are you gonna be
able to see this password
okay yep
okay so I got my new password in and it
is set okay great
all three new Kindles are available for
pre-order on Amazon right now and we
will of course have a bunch more info in
the near future on the verge comm until
then I suggest refreshing your browser
