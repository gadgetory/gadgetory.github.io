a lot of work done with it but most
people think of work they think of
typing and that means a keyboard a real
one most keyboards for the iPad works
basically the same way you charge them
every month or so you pair them over
Bluetooth and you attach them to an iPad
somehow there are a lot of different
kinds of iPad keyboards some of them
make look like a laptop some will come
with built-in cases and some that fold
up like crazy accordions but you want to
keyboard that strikes a hard balance it
should be good to type on it should hold
your iPad at the right angle it should
work on your lab and it shouldn't cost
too much that's a lot to expect but
there is one keyboard that managed to do
it all it might surprise you who makes
it it surprised me Microsoft yes
Microsoft makes the best Bluetooth
keyboard for Apple's iPad air 2 it's
called the universal mobile keyboard
it's not a case it's just a keyboard
with a neat little detachable cover that
folds open to reveal the keys inside
that cover also acts as a stand it keeps
a keyboard stable on your lap or on a
table and it has a little slot for
holding your iPad that slot is actually
one of the reasons we like it so much it
can hold a caseless iPad air at two
different angles and it can accommodate
most reasonably sized iPad cases so if
you didn't already have a case you don't
need to ditch it to use Microsoft's
keyboard the most important thing about
a Bluetooth keyboard is that it feels
nice to type on and Microsoft's
universal mobile keyboard does it's not
quite a full-size keyboard
nothing in this category is but the keys
are big and separated and they have
enough resistance and travel to feel
good to type up Microsoft separates a
few iPad functions like music controls
at home into dedicated buttons so you
don't have to fiddle with a function key
to figure out how to use them there's
also a dedicated number row which is a
big deal to me the other thing that we
like is that it's basically future-proof
you can use this keyboard with any iPad
iPhone Android device or Windows machine
with a quick flick of this tiny switch
but the truth is our favorite thing is
the price it retails for well under 100
bucks that means you can spend the rest
of your money on a case you actually
want instead of whatever happens to work
with your keyboard but if price is no
object and you haven't picked out a case
yet a runner-up pick is the creme de la
creme of iPad keyboard cases it's the
Belkin code
ultimate Pro keyboard case for the iPad
air 2 this thing has it all a big easy
to type on keyboard a nice case to hold
the iPad even if you want to leave the
keyboard behind and the case is
compatible with Apple Smart Covers it
has magnets to control everything from
turning it on to positioning your tablet
you want angles the code has them two
for portrait and two for landscape
it has function buttons for damn near
everything you could wish for and the
keys are backlit really the only problem
here is that it costs nearly twice as
much as Microsoft's keyboard okay so
what else is out there a ton actually
there are more styles of iPad keyboard
cases than you could believe one popular
style is to have a keyboard that acts
like a kind of cover that the iPad slots
into Logitech's ultra-thin magnetic clip
on keyboard cover is the best of these
but it doesn't work if you want to use a
case then there's the folio style which
has a case that unfolds to reveal the
keyboard but the problem with these
folio designs that you're stuck
awkwardly flipping the keyboard around
if you just want to do tablet things
like reading or playing a game and
honestly a lot of them are really kind
of junky there's also a few keyboards
that have really weird ideas for what
you want to do turn your iPad into a
laptop nope it's a tablet crazy origami
folding keyboards too fiddly and they
feel terrible to type on standalone
keyboards without a stand no thanks you
want to be able to use your iPad and
keyboard on your lap look you want a
keyboard because you want to get work
done with your iPad and you can't get
work done if you're fiddling with a bad
keyboard case Microsoft's universal
mobile keyboard doesn't make you fit it
just helps you type faster and costs
less in the competition and that's the
point of a keyboard to give type</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
