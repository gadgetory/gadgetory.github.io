verge and Nicola from ract were here at
the Metropolitan Museum art check of the
new fashion techniques that are
presented by Apple we're gonna be
checking out all the beautiful dresses
here how they were made and how they
blend man and machine in their design
everything in the exhibit details what
part was on my machine and what part was
done by hand these striking is see
Miyake pieces were all made with machine
pleating and then - sort of like double
and press-on you what kind of production
goes into this they have the flat
garments across the way which is just
such a cool visual mechanism of being
able to say something flat and the way
that it comes to life from patterning
and from texture imprinted by machines
on to the physical form these are my
favorite dresses I think they came from
1990 from the world from look good and
he continued this onto his like next
dress in 1993 8 yeah it is my favorite
my favorite dress of all please please
but the reason why this dress in
particularly is my favorite it's called
the Flying Saucer dress and it's it's so
sci-fi to see like this rising like
strain of color going up from the bottom
it's brilliant oh this is terrifying it
looks like a rib cage that developed
over time for what humans or some animal
they've become but this so this is 3d
printed which is really interesting in
took apparently the file took two months
to make and it took a full week to print
it out this was done in 2011 so pretty
really yeah I can't really think of
anyone else who is 3d printing clothes
at that point I mean if you want to
close but I mean it's crazy with how far
are things going to go with 3d printing
you can see like the level of detail in
it just like not only the bones which is
already so macabre but just like the
little bits of what looked like white
see you it's made of white white
polyamide and it just kind of flows
around the skeleton itself and you can
see how one might wear it but also like
it would kind of hurt if you were
wearing this there's an amazing amount
of flexibility
happening here like there's so much
curvature there's so much difference
between thick and thin in the same
pieces it definitely looks like
extremely delicate to of me okay so this
guy is cast fiberglass this is the
Justin feature to me yeah this is the
dress in the future even though it was
made five years ago okay so this dress
comes with the digital handset because
each one of these little doodads can be
controlled to fly off and swarm around
the dress and the way that you get in
and out of it is through motorized
hinges this is crazy I mean if you look
you see little so it allows me crystals
that look like I guess butterflies or as
fly as I guess pollen obviously look
when you app that wasn't gonna have like
if there was gonna be no like Apple
watch display because that's not how the
sponsorship works but that's kind of
thing but there is it a sigelei like
Apple feel to the actual design which is
cathedrals are like entirely whitewash
very much like objects are on display in
the center with very little interruption
and it's really different from what
these exhibits usually look like but it
definitely has a very church-like feel
to it if you look up you see these kind
of geodesic dome going on with gold
simple and white but also the entire
enclosure which is a building within a
building feels very much like a church
and they custom built this structure
inside of here and that all the walls
are kind of like this sheer material so
you can see what's essentially the
boning of this building which also kind
of plays back to that like seeing the
production process like even within the
way the show is designed it's just
really cool the exhibit opens to the
public this week as someone who's
interested in fashion it's obviously a
lot to look at it's really beautiful and
there's a lot to learn and some who
loves tech it's really interesting to
see how things are produced and all the
design that goes into it you can come
check out the visit app and that
and through August 14th so normally we
do this bit inside but they asked us to
stop filming but anyway if you want to
