it's really good I mean look it's got
this huge tall screen it's got a couple
of cameras on the back so you know what
I'm gonna give it an award
congratulations LG you get a
participation award now I know this
seems really mean but I don't need it to
be me and let me explain why now the LG
G six is the first of the major 2017
flagship phones and to make it LG did
the right thing by making a huge big
tall screen on it it is 18 by 9 aspect
ratio so it's twice as tall as it is
wide and that offers a bunch of
interesting software opportunities which
we can get into but the basics of this
screen are just really good it's bright
it has Dolby HDR if you care about that
sort of thing but more importantly to me
is the bezels are really really small
and the screen is flat which means
you're not going to get rogue touches
from like you might get on a galaxy s7
or an S 8 or perhaps are on the side
bottom line LG just did a really good
job making a really big beautiful screen
a centerpiece of this phone so let's
talk about the rest of the hardware this
phone and what you need to know is it's
all about glass it's a glass back it's a
glass front it's actually three
different kinds of Gorilla Glass on it
and it looks fine I did get a tiny
hairline crack on the back but I don't
think that will happen for most people
I'm just really hard on phone hardware I
guess the power button is here on the
back it's a little bit small it's the
same thing as a fingerprint sensor and I
kind of don't like it it's a little bit
fiddly I never know if I'm turning the
phone on or off it just takes a while to
get used to because LG phones act a
little bit differently than other phones
but for me the bottom line is this is
just really simple handsome Hardware
nothing crazy about it I think it looks
good I think it's really unassuming and
nice and also honestly it's a little bit
unassuming on the inside too
the processor is a Snapdragon 820 one
which yes isn't the latest and greatest
processor but it's plenty fast I've
never had any real problems with it I
think you'll be happy with it it's got
four gigs of RAM sure and it's only got
32 gigs of storage in the US but it is
expandable via microSD card
the other thing to know is that the
battery inside this is 3,300 milliamps
which should be enough it's not crazy
but nobody wants crazy stuff now because
that might make the phone explode but I
have found that I'm having a hard time
getting through a full day with this
thing now I do use phones a lot so it
might be that you will be fine but I'm
finding that in the afternoon I do need
to check and see how I'm doing the good
news is that it supports Qualcomm quick
charge over USB see and in the u.s. it
has wireless charging so you can top up
when you need to so if there's one place
where you'd expect LG to bring the
gimmicks it would be in the camera and
yep there are two cameras here but LG
actually held itself back a little bit
here's what you need to know they're
both 13 megapixel sensors so you don't
get a huge quality difference when you
switch between them one is normal and
one is 125 degree wide angle I don't
love the wide angle look I don't like
the distortion that you get sometimes
but if it's your thing it might be fine
my favorite feature is actually not the
cameras it's this tall screen they've
got an app that lets you take Instagram
photos and preview them right away or
build these neat little layouts but what
you should really care about is the
quality and the quality is pretty good
but not mind-blowing it works okay in
low light it's got up to image
stabilization but I haven't had one of
those pictures that's like oh my god I
can't believe I took this picture with
phone moments and if this thing is going
to compete with the Google pixel the
Galaxy s8 in the iPhone 7 it really
needs a standout feature and the cameras
are not that standout feature and
speaking of things that don't stand up I
really don't like LG's software it's
called LG UX 6.0 and it is more
toned-down than what we used to get from
LG but it still just feels kind of junky
LG does this thing where they want to
put everything on the homescreen without
an app drawer it does this ugly
stretching thing when you you know
scroll over to the edge of the
homescreen it actually hides a bunch of
settings which normally I would like but
they're a bunch of settings that you
need like putting the little
notification button down here by the
main Rose you can't swipe down on the
the power button or turning on knock-on
so that you can activate the home screen
just by tapping the screen but stuff
that you need in order to make an LG
phone work and it's buried in general
I'm just not impressed and it just feels
like LG is still skinning phones for
skinning sake and I wish they'd stop oh
and one more thing this phone you're
probably gonna buy it from carriers and
depending on which carrier you buy it
from you're going to get the standard
payload of crap where okay so after all
that let's talk about that joke I made
at the top the participation of work
it's really mean but listen there are
only a few top-tier companies that
deserve your attention right now when it
comes to flagship phones Samsung Apple
Google and now LG just getting on that
short list is a really big
accomplishment and LG should feel proud
but the thing is with phones like the s8
about to come out and the Google pixel
already there LG needs something that
makes it really stand out from the pack
and I just don't see that here this is a
pretty good phone but for 700 bucks or
so you deserve something better than
pretty good like why do I have Farm hero
saga do you want panda pop I don't want
a panda pop why do pandas need to pop in
the first place
pandas shouldn't pop that's like scary
and gross they should just like be
pandas and eucalyptus they shouldn't
explode on your phone also juice jam
really pick one it's either juice and
you drink it or it's Jam you put it on
toast
you don't want both juice jam</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
