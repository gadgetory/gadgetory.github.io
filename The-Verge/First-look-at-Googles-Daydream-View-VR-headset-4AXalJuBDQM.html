Francisco and we are checking out
daydream view so daydream is Google's
new vr platform that's going to
encompass a bunch of different phones
and headsets and daydream view is the
first one of those headsets it's
supposed to feel like a piece of
clothing and it's designed to fit any
daydream phone except that right now
there are only two daydream ready phones
the pixel and the pixel XL which were
also announced today so we're going to
go take a look at what it actually feels
like to use it so daydream view is foam
and fabric and it's kind of squishy over
on this side you have your face mask
which you can actually take out in hand
wash and then right in the middle
there's this plastic shell which is sort
of where the VR magic happens in order
to use it you pull off this little loop
and open it up and you can see that
you've got your controller held in here
by elastic you pull it out hold it and
then this is where you put the phone so
you set your phone in and you'll notice
there are two little plastic nubs here
and these actually will tell your phone
okay where is the center of the screen
so instead of having to get it in at
just the right angle you just put your
phone in snap it shut and it'll know
exactly how to align the image so for
different widths of phone you can also
pull these hinges out a little bit that
means you can either use a bigger
daydream phone or you can use a case
without having to take it off before you
put your phone in VR when you're done
this just slides right back in and you
can fold it back up so in order to put
it on it's a lot like other VR headsets
you stretch this
put it right here and then you tighten
these straps a little bit so Google says
they're going to be 50 degree maps by
the end of the year with hundreds more
coming and that includes some things
that Google is making itself like a
viera version of youtube or street view
it includes some things we've already
heard about like HBO and Netflix apps
New York Times journalism apps as well
as some games and a neat little tie-in
for the film fantastic beasts and where
to find them where you become a wizard
and use the controller like a war so
daydream you is going to be launching an
early November although we don't know
the exact day and pre-orders are opening
October 20th that's a little bit longer
than you'll be waiting for the pixel
phones but it's still closer than it
could be you'll start seeing other
daydream headsets and phones coming
later this year in early 2017 so if you
