we're here with Barney a product manager
at Panasonic to demonstrate the new
limits g5 so we're here with the getty
gallery with the new g5 camera this is
the latest in our lineup of DSLR cameras
it's a 16 megapixel and a third sensor
what you'll notice about this camera
first of all this is unique design and
share so different to previous cameras
in our range from new handgrip recessed
and gives the customer much easier grip
more ergonomic feel and balance to the
camera the new feature for this camera
is a function lever when the power zoom
lens is connected this can actually
control the zoom of the lens from the
camera body it also acts as a FN button
a function button so you can actually
assign a murder to this particular dial
and you can access it through clicking
playback their images or quick access to
the quick menu other improve features of
this camera we have a high resolution
LCD screen $920,000 and a brand new
feature this helping us with this camera
is the use or combination of the
electronic viewfinder and the LCD at the
same time we call that touch pad so you
can actually chase a moving subject
through the viewfinder and touch the
autofocus on the LCD point don't see the
screen at any time something a lot of
people are finding really useful in
early previews we also have improved
image performance from this camera using
our new 16 megapixel sensor so we can
actually shoot at ISO of 12,800 and this
camera is really quick so we've got six
frames a second 16 megapixel or 20
frames a second 4 megapixel
also the movie functionality is
massively improved we have dedicated
movie one on the top of the camera and
we can now capture 50 p 50 frames per
second progressive in the ABC HD format
we can also capture 25 frames a second
in the mp4 format so the Luminess g5
also boasts one of the world's fastest
levels of also focus simply half
pressing the shutter and you can hear
the double beep last the camera focusing
around about point zero and nine seconds
the only is it fast but in tests
independent it laps it also performs to
be one of the most accurate levels of
autofocus as well as the quickest</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
