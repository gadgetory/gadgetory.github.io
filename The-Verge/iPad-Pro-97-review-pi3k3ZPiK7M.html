seven inch screen it looks a lot well
like the iPad air 2 but the difference
is this iPad has enough computing power
to replace a lot of cheap laptops and
Apple says it could actually do that
then again Apple said that before about
this giant iPad and I don't think that
making it smaller is going to make that
case any better so remind me what is
this thing for again let's start with
maybe the most important thing to know
about this iPad it starts at five
hundred and ninety nine dollars for the
32 gig model the next step up a more
reasonable hundred twenty eight gigs
cost seven hundred and fifty dollars
this is not a cheap iPad you'd better
know what you're going to use it for if
you're going to buy it it has a nine
point seven inch screen that's actually
better than any other tablet screen I've
seen before part of that is it has this
new anti reflective coating but the big
deal is this clever new technology
called true tone they're hidden sensors
in the face of the iPad that detect the
color temperature in the room and then
it automatically adjusts the color
temperature of the screen to match it
the idea Apple says is that it's
supposed to act more like a physical
piece of paper it reflects the color in
the room so if you're in a yellow room
the screen is going to get a little bit
more yellow now that sounds kind of dumb
why would I want my screen to get more
yellow but I've turned it on and just
ignored it and it actually is pretty
great when you turn it off all the
sudden your screen looks really really
blue and it's actually kind of ugly so
my suggestion if you get this is turn
the thing on and unless you're doing
color correction it's just going to look
better and you're gonna be way happier
it's really neat but what really makes
this iPad a pro is a constellation of a
bunch of features it supports this $99
Apple pencil if you want to draw you can
also get this $150 smart keyboard if you
want to type and it has four very loud
speakers one on each side and a new 12
megapixel camera but what really makes
this thing a pro is that has a powerful
new processor the a9x the same one
that's in the big iPad pro and keeps
things moving along and a really
fast clip I never really thought my old
iPad air 2 was all that slow but you can
really see the difference on the pro
especially when you're doing
split-screen with a couple of apps it's
faster but it's not so much faster that
I suddenly feel like my old iPad air 2
is a piece of junk there's all that
worth a couple hundred dollars more than
the iPad air to come honestly not so
sure you can split screen on the iPad
air 2 and you can get a decent of
Bluetooth keyboard and if you ever
encounter lag on the air 2 you can spend
that time imagining what all that extra
cash is doing in your 401k and the other
thing is this pro has the same 2 gigs of
ram as that iPad air 2 as opposed the
larger pros 4 gigs and that makes a
difference especially when you have a
lot of Safari tabs open or you jump into
an epsilon ok maybe a reason to get this
iPad pro is the pencil which is pretty
neat but I found that most of the things
that supported our illustration apps and
drawing apps and you know professional
photography apps there's not a whole you
can do with productivity and for me it
just doesn't seem worth it to carry it
around and keep it charged now I'm of
two minds about the smart Keyboard the
first thing I'll say is once you've got
it set up it's actually one of the best
typing experiences I've ever had on a
keyboard of this size the keys are just
really well separated and they're great
to type on I seriously got used to it in
just a few minutes but it only works at
this one angle and there aren't any
function keys across the top for playing
music or doing other stuff you have to
learn a whole bunch of arcane shortcuts
in order to figure everything out and so
at 150 bucks you're probably gonna be
able to find a better option now the
camera is easily the best I've ever seen
on the town it's 12 megapixels which is
the same as the iPhone success but
honestly I find it kind of baffling it
causes this camera bump on the back and
the good news is that it doesn't wobble
on the table but I just can't see that
it's worth it for iPad photographers and
yes that's a thing sure I think it's
worth it but otherwise it's a document
scanning and I don't know do you really
need 12 megapixels for that these
speakers though damn but they are loud
if you watch a ton of movies let
headphones on your iPad you're really
going to like them it's almost enough to
make you think you won't need a
Bluetooth speaker except that the bass
on them isn't very good I'll tell you
the truth I would like to believe that
this iPad even more so than this huge
one is the one that you can carry around
with you all day and make your main
computer and the battery life is
actually good enough to make that happen
it's also fast enough for switching apps
and going to split-screen to Apple says
that this is it's a vision for the
future of computing and there's a lot to
like about that vision this iPad pro
can't do everything that you'd expect a
future computer to do partially it's
that Safari on the iPad pro just isn't
as good as a desktop class browser and
yes you can do two apps at once but you
know what sometimes you want three and
there are times when you want to be able
to plug in a USB stick or some other
peripheral and you know what honestly
sometimes you just want a regular old
file system and windows and a desktop
the iPad can't really do those things it
does other things it's the things that
make it an iPad some productivity and
movies and ebooks and some light web
browsing it's really good at that stuff
those are the things that Steve Jobs
said the iPad was good at when he
introduced the very first one and the
question is arisen lately is there womb
he said I was a third category of
devatta computer in the middle and not a
phone something that's between a laptop
and a smartphone the iPad is its own
thing and this is without a doubt and
even though it's pretty expensive a
stupefyingly good iPad but it's still an
iPad gotta see such ridiculous device
it's just so
crazy you're crazy jerk are you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
