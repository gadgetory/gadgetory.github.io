this is the new razor blade razor has
always been known for making gaming mice
and gaming keyboards and crazy Windows
gaming tablets like the edge but this
time it's built an even crazier gaming
laptop the goal is simple this is the
Alienware 14 a gaming laptop that's 1.6
inches thick and this is a MacBook Air
Razer wants to bridge the gap between
the two and then add some more on top of
it using practically the same components
as the Alienware in a thin aluminum
frame the 14 inch razor blade is
attempting to completely merge gaming
laptop and Ultrabook into one awesome
machine the craziest part is that razor
might have pulled it off then laptops
are always filled with compromises but
they're surprisingly few here for
instance the fully customizable keyboard
is a little bit shallow but typing is
still quick and accurate the touchpad is
really smooth though it has some trouble
with responsiveness and it's not quite
the silkiest we've seen the laptops
frame is solid and durable and its hinge
has just the right amount of weight and
tension so that it stays in place but
doesn't jostle the laptop when you lift
the lid the speaker's aren't going to
win any awards but they do provide
pleasingly wide audio for games the
biggest thing missing is ports there's
no SD slot and no Ethernet jack among a
bunch of other omissions but really if
there's anything to harp on it's the
blade 1600 by 900 screen which isn't
quite as sharp as we'd like and has
fairly poor viewing angles too but the
combination of low resolution and high
performance in the blade does mean the
most demanding games run perfectly
Borderlands 2 and Max Payne 3 runs
smoothly at 60 frames per second even at
very high settings and even battlefield
3 is playable on ultra in a pinch and
yes it can play crysis 3 the aluminum
frame helps a little bit to dissipate
the heat from the processors but it also
directs that heat straight to your hands
and lap the worst-hit is on the back
edge of the laptop which probably won't
be in direct contact with your body but
should still be avoided at all costs
then there's the price to consider at
$799 the 14 inch blade cost more than
many beefier gaming laptops and $300
more than a similarly configured
Alienware 14 which comes with a much
better screen anyway and sensibly
there's no space for a full harddrive
you'll have to shell out 2 grand for the
version with a 256 gigabyte solid state
drive if you want to install more than a
handful of games that's way out of the
reach of most ultrabook buyers this is
still very much a gamers laptop but it's
a gamers laptop that's never really
existed before if you're looking for a
stylish windows computer that can fit in
a messenger bag get
hours of battery-life and still play all
the games you can think of there's
really no other choice out there razor
has been trying to meld thin and
powerful for years but this time it's
finally built a blade that's worthy of
the name</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
