CES with razors new project Linda
prototype every year at CES razor always
brings a new and interesting prototype
to kind of show off some ideas for the
future of computing this year's this
project Linda which is a laptop dock for
the razor phone basically take a razor
phone you put it in the center laptop
over here you hit this docking button a
USBC connector extends into the phone
and it brings it up on the laptop as a
full laptop experience CF apps which are
running in full desktop or tablet mode
here's the verge you can still their
hardware keys to access things like
Google assistant and hardware keys to
access core Android functions like the
back button in the app switcher you can
also pop up games or productivity
software like Lightroom which runs in
this tablet mode but this is obviously
much more than usable work environment
to get things done than necessarily
trying to do it on a phone razor is
eventually hoping to be able to develop
this to the point where you can actually
run different content on the two screens
so you can have for example Lightroom
open and have a palette picker on here
you can plug in a mouse on the side but
the idea is really to extend the
capabilities of what your phone can do
into more of a laptop setting instead of
just marrying the phone the project of
the prototype actually also charges it
while it's plugged in the idea being
that when you're using it on the laptop
when you take it out your phone will
have more charge than when you started
the project when the prototype also has
roughly 200 gigabytes of extra space so
you can store more stuff for twice you
have a USB C port and a headphone jack
on one side a full-sized USB type 8 port
in the other size you can plug in any
basically any peripheral as supported by
an Android phone so flash drives mice
keyboards etc and there's a headphone
jack which is always nice
there's no speakers on the device
because it takes advantage of the
front-facing speakers and the razor
phone itself which is a clever
repurposing and instead of using the
camera though there's a webcam and mic
built into the top so that people aren't
looking up your nose while you're having
a Skype conversation if some clear
whether or not razor will actually be
bringing this to market razor has done a
lot of prototypes at CES some of them
make it to market some of them don't
some of them end up informing other
products that do make it to market so
it's still development and there's no
idea of knowing whether or not we'll
actually see it make the final cut but
for now it's really interesting
prototype to extend your phone
especially as phones become more
powerful to the inside is a soft touch
coatings that doesn't damage the phone
and you can kind of see how it works
really really cool then really fun to
play with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
