things are transcending all these
cultures you know it doesn't matter
where you live if some people start
enjoy something a certain type of music
or a culture I think people will catch
on I think that's exactly what's
happening right now I can't keep all the
kpop going new like every day and
there's like one to like 20 members just
so this will be variety
now a lot of the new bands that are
forming are formed with Chinese members
members from Thailand fluent English
speakers so like this isn't my accent
they are keeping the international
audience in line so they're trying to
reach out to the international even have
entire songs being sung in English now
so that's like a huge change for us
my name is Simon and Martina you make
videos about life in Korea and slowly we
started getting a following but we had
no idea why the first time we we left
just to get some like vlogging footage
of what it's like to be at kcon and we
were totally like swarmed by people and
we were just completely shocked I'm like
is there k-pop man behind me
our plan today was to make a video of
this whole thing but we can't actually
get anywhere without being surrounded so
we have security that escorts us only to
miss necessary places but it's really
really shocking in America right now
well of course with YouTube it's just so
easily accessible now whereas in the
past before YouTube and you know
internet really kind of booth into this
phenomenon it was kind of hard you have
to go to the traditional Korean video
stores to rent these music shows and
dramas my name is JD relic and I'm a
songwriter and producer I started out on
YouTube I was making English covers of
kpop songs through that I met the people
I'm working with now they asked me to
come right for their company so that was
it I mean I didn't have any prior
songwriting experience before that so I
just kind of dove into it about two and
a half years ago YouTube is absolutely
crucial to the role of cake hop
spreading
I think sigh that did Gangnam style very
clever
the Americans took oppa Gangnam style
pretty well it's very different gum
themself from the rest of kpop because
there's a lot of you know irony and
humor in that video we don't see that in
other kinds of kpop but we still see a
vast amount of success happening on an
underground level when it comes to Kayla
scary if I was an artist in Korea I'll
be nervous because the pace of the
popularity of music is quick your
discover when you audition for like a
record label when you're like 12 years
old and then when the label thinks
they're ready they'll start bringing
them out into bigger bands videos and
kind of like debuting them in the
background and stuff as an extra as an
extra and then the fans kind of get to
know them and then the fan group starts
forming even before the band releases
its first single so by the time the beta
releases its first single it has a fan
group it usually has a fan color it'll
have fan chants everything fan colors
seriously
they pick colors they're running out of
colors fan involvement is really popular
among k-pop fans in Asia you know
karaoke is so huge and one thing that
I've noticed is that if you have a song
that's really singable then it's more
likely to be a hit because people can go
to you know the karaoke lounge and sing
your song I think was a gay thousand
people here you know they just want to
be able to get up close and personal
with you know these artists the fans are
so extremely passionate
there's no moderate fan in the crowd
here screaming their guts out kpop has
definitely evolved a lot more over the
past four years when we first came kpop
was very just Korean Korean people
singing Korean songs it's obvious that
it's becoming more and more global all
the time you'll see groups coming out
with English versions of their songs and
promoting it here I could see it
from now being pretty big and seeing
this right now cake on there's so many
different ethnicities out here and races
which that I think is most shocking to
me
