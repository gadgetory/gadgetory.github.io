among all the big news that Google had
the show-off today was a new tablet app
for google plus the social network has
never had a tablet app and now there's a
full-fledged one so and it comes with a
full redesign of the social network as
well so let's just take a quick look
here when you first come in you'll
notice that they've made a total
horizontal design and everything kind of
falls into place as you go across here
framers drops a little bit but it's very
picture heavy experiment experience and
everything's dynamically resize that's
what Google says according to what it
thinks you'll be interested in in a
10-inch tablet form factor this is a
asus transformer it can do two rows here
but on a 7-inch tablet or a phone its
much as just one row here so it's not as
interesting but it is a full tablet
experience which is good to see you can
come across here and this is the same
sort of hollow experience that we've
seen a live android apps you drop down
here and get some options but if you
click here you'll get what's very
similar to the google plus website and
you have all these options but the big
news here is events which is a new
situation sort of like facebook where
you can invite people to events and
parties and these pages aren't as
complete as you'll see on the computer
will show you guys that in a little bit
but this is it'll show pictures as
people take them and comments and you
can invite people the last thing that's
sort of noteworthy here is local which I
actually just kick you out to google
maps which is now enhanced with Zagat
ratings and you can find places to go
nearby but it's not really google plus
feature it's really just google maps you
have to kick yourself back out to google
plus if we go into a photo comments two
photos actually you pull them up just
like this and you can scroll through
them which is actually a pretty great
design that we haven't seen at all and
you can come in here and +1 a comment or
reply google did make a point of saying
that the tablet interface is all new but
they updated the phone
app today and it's basically the same as
the new tablet app if we scroll down
here you can see it Scrolls basically
the same as before on the tablet app and
if we go wide screen you can see it's
essentially identical we have the same
holo interface here where I can drop
down here to get some options and over
here is a full list with notifications
other than the updated tablet app
Google's of course added events to
Google+ on the web and we come in here
and it will show everything you've been
invited to and it will give you option
to make your own event and if we go in
here we can see Google's added this new
with a calling Sinha graphs over here
you could see this sort of some rustling
in the wind and it's not terribly
original but it gives it like a little
personal touch and these are all things
that you can set up when you're first
making it a bit this is supposed to be
like you know my friend really wants me
to go to the party and you open up this
letter you see where it is and you can
invite more people what is also being
touted here is a new party functionality
that makes it so that Google+ as part of
the party not just how you all meet up
so if we go back to this other one that
I started we can see pictures that
people were taking during the party
these are all taken by me but if you had
multiple people at the party who all
checked in to the party all their
pictures would come in here live during
the party and you could click up here to
play live slideshow and this will just
filter through during the party so if
you had a TV monitor setup for example
different perspectives of the
proceedings as they go down could show
on show up here other than events they
have at a local tab which will give you
the news a good ratings that Google
isn't working on that's already been
implemented on mobile and it's guy
recommendations for restaurants that you
can go to Google Plus for android phones
and Android tablets running guy scream
sandwich or greater is available now as
an update in google play and that's the
new google plus
