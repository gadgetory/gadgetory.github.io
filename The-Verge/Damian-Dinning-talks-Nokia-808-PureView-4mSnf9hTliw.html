here with Damian Xining head of imaging
and Lafayette
although you do have a more specific job
title and I would like to let you think
it's one of those classic no fear job
titles on lead program manager for
imaging experience and smart devices
head of imaging otherwise I mean oh you
the mice is a smart devices right I mean
that's right you can ask even evil if
you think see when your feature called
the smartphone - awesome right all our
products awesome right and the reason
we're here today and the reason of
meeting you is because of a truly
awesome device it really do ecology in
just introduced which is the 808
PureView tell us about this phone so
this is a development that many of us
have been involved in for about five
years
started with a desire for us to do
something radically different in the
early days people were fixated with
megapixels and in the early days that
was right to be fixated and improve
increase the number of megapixels that's
how image quality improved dramatically
but once you got a 5 or 6 megapixels the
improvements weren't really coming
through image quality yes your
improvements in processing technology in
optics made further improvements to
image but they weren't really coming
from the increasing the number of
megapixels at that time we also wanted
to do optical zoom
but it was real challenge to get optical
zoom in to a device that fits in your
pocket with the performance that we
wanted to be of service
yes you thought about having optical
zoom on smartphones yes in fact we had a
number of concepts obviously we have the
N 93 and 93 I around like 2006 2007 we
introduced those products but we really
wanted to around that time the
expectation level for imaging was also
increasing and we thought if we're going
to exceed that expectation then we've
needed to do something radically
different we couldn't do that with
conventional optical zoom designs in the
space with the performance that we
wanted to be able to realize we were
considering there's a mechanical optical
zoom and also I guess software solution
yes if I worked on a number of those
projects which were looking at different
technologies you wouldn't happen to have
any concepts in your pocket so knowing
my pocket know the mess of Nokia so we
stuck with a few of you da to wake you
but well what have you done in terms of
zoom that one because you have done
something so this is where we utilize
the very high resolution 41 megapixel
sensor with his revolutionary concise
optics which have 10 times higher
precision in them in the manufacturing
process
and the tolerances accenture than any
SLR lenses that was the level of
precision that we had to go to to be
able to make the optics work with such a
high position high resolution sensor in
addition to that we also have to make a
breakthrough in processing technology as
well when in between video for example
we're handling over 1 billion pixels per
second when you're recording video and
that's over 16 times more data
throughput than most other camera
smartphones in the marketplace today and
that enabled us to get this to utilize
this algorithms that we've developed
capitalize on all that information in
detail from the sensor and coming
through the high-resolution optics
combining the information from multiple
pixels to create fewer but higher
quality pixels which fit with the modern
way of handling and capturing images
that we have to do the technique of
sharing but even if you wanted to print
poster prints the five megapixel images
that we capture have far more detail
quality than any other camera smartphone
that you could possibly imagine
I saw a sample of some of those pictures
and they were terrific back I was
looking for fine grain noise yes I mean
there's samples you picked them yourself
right sure but they were really
impressive images so I like fully with
you but this is this old sampling
algorithm
is something very interesting because
like you say it's probably one megapixel
sensor in total that's right just so
don't believe that I mean maybe I can
show you something yeah so this is the
actual sentence we're losing this is the
middle one is is a regular smartphone
sensor and this is the sense that we're
using in the 808 q of you okay no one on
the sublet this is a smaller 5 megapixel
module Wow
so what is the actual square footage of
this very optical format is one over one
point two inches right and I've actually
seen the whole camera module you showed
us the camera module yesterday and it is
about a centimeter cube so it's a
centimeter in height width and depth
so it's a big old thing it is using this
camera we could we put up the phone
itself as well I'm sorry so the sensor
is right here behind those carl zeiss
optics like you're saying what's right
and you do have a dedicated camera
shutter key which is something that's
kind of coming well we have to some
people some people put like the hardware
key it's a two-stage we keep a lot of
emphasis in the mechanical designer
that's what feels really great but
there's also a touch shutter key which
works similarly to a hardware capture
key so you can you can press it hold
your button hold your finger on the
button that will lock focus and then you
can you can take take the pictures you
would with a regular regular hardware
key
there's some professional I took it
shouldn't be brandy I know pointed it
out it's no key a branding algorithm at
work I mean I have to tell you I I won't
be alone it being slightly disappointed
this Iranians think in but just purely
down to the camera section
it's impressive stuff like capture just
now was so fluid and your gallery
application is good and again like
jumping between images this is nice and
quick this is really nice and the image
is just kind of amazing I mean these by
the photo what five minutes illusions
yeah absolutely but if you were
photographing a an area where you had
like a black and a white line you'd
expect pixels where you transition to be
black and then white typically we're
cameras you sort of go black and then
this sort of gray or sort of merge into
one another whereas the pixels here so
pure that you get that perfect black and
then white transition it's really
staggering detail and this is ten speed
video by default 1080p 30 frames per
second by default you get full field of
view which is I haven't seen on any
other camera smartphone and you get four
times lossless zoom plus we also have
our Nokia which recording technology
which allows you to record even as high
as 140 decibels which means that you can
go to a concert and you can capture CD
like audio without any Distortion
whatsoever and also I wanted I wanted to
ask you the thing that Joe Harlow
actually teased was that this isn't
going to be the only thing that's going
to
there will be other devices can you tell
us about those
so you're not gonna tell us the means
and the posture I can't move in no I
can't reveal off product roadmap plans
but I can't say we're actively working
on bringing this technology into you'll
see this technology in other ways in our
portfolio at some point in the future
that's what I cannot see all we see the
same sensor I can't reveal any specific
details but I do feel like the sensor is
a really huge part literally sure of the
whole pyramids acknowledging let me put
it this way to you we wouldn't have
spent five years developing this for a
single one offering and and that's
another question you said you said it
spent five years developing it how does
the innate fit into this because this
the Nokia 808 is the most direct and
obvious successor to the NA sure and you
can kind of tell because both have
big camera compartments which really
made them stand out this camera phones
performers so how does the innate fit
into your five-year development cycle
for disability what I'm saying is it
wasn't like a halfway house when you
were still developing and always here
right okay this is a technology which
which we wanted to be able to do we knew
it would take quite some time for all of
the pieces of the puzzle to come in to
place yeah but we couldn't tell exactly
when that was going to happen the NH
Development was a completely separate
track they weren't coupled in any way so
that was something we wanted to do as
well so this is just the way that it
panned out okay so they're essentially
two different developing tracks like
you're saying yeah but they were after
the same goal which was you know to get
the best camera
so normally how we would be developing
products is that we would have specific
targets in mind which vary according to
to the type of product and what's
important to that product the insights
that we happen in the market place in
terms of what would be important to that
product and that means that products are
typically
whereas for a large amount of the
development time at five years it wasn't
it was a technology development and once
it became clear enough to us that we
were going to be able to bring it to the
marketplace at a specific moment in time
at that point it then became something
which moved into our sort of product
ization process and that's how we're now
able to have this conversation and this
device 808 PureView when will it become
reality we won't be able to get one we
expect to hit the market in q2 and then
other products and devices I mean I
assume you guys have kind of abandoned
the idea of mechanical optical zooms
like a pocket camera but anything else
you can tell us about what you're
working on a new camera department all I
can say is that we're super excited
about our plans for imaging we're
looking at a number of different areas
that allow us to differentiate in the
marketplace I can't reveal obviously the
details around those at the moment but
we'll be exploring a number of different
directions in the area of imaging
utilizing the POV technology
way so you'll see our sensor and
processing and optical capabilities used
in different ways in different parts of
our portfolio well when you do decide
what you're going to do when you do
decide that you want to announce it and
that's worse be sure to come in and talk
to that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
