with the Nokia n9 this is the first and
unfortunately only meego harmattan
device for the consumer market
it measures 12.1 millimeters in
thickness which isn't competitive with
the latest smartphones just in terms of
measurements but in terms of looking
field the n9 is actually one of the best
phones of handle yet it really has great
feel in the hand it also comes with an
854 by 480 AMOLED display it comes with
a clear black branding that Nokia
applies to displays it has awesome
viewing angles terrific color
reproduction there is a slight issue
with whites and light Gray's when you
look at them from the side they tend to
have a bluish hue but generally it's a
great display the Hamilton UI is unique
in a couple of ways firstly it unlocks
with a double tap or you wake the lock
screen with a double tap then you have
this swiping gesture which you can see
here
if you swipe only halfway up you get
this four icon launch pad which is
available when you are inside an
application or from the lock screen you
have three home screens this one here is
the events now this is the application
screen there is a drop down menu and the
third screen is the open application
screen which is essentially your visual
multitasking overview but you can access
your apps and switch between them very
quickly performance is generally very
snappy very quick but loading in some
applications can be occasionally slow as
you could just see there with the music
player at the pre-loaded games included
will go of 2011 Angry Birds with some
NFC additions made there so that you can
play with your friends and as you can
see need for speed shift all of them
work brilliantly they play brilliantly
frame rates more than playable camera
performance is very quick in terms of
quality there are some issues it isn't
perfect but in terms of taking both
Stills and video the n9 is one of the
faster phones out there it isn't quite
on par with the iPhone 4s but then not a
phone really is performance go browsing
through the pictures again is very quick
very snappy pinch-to-zoom is buttery
smooth now issues whatsoever the same is
also true of using it in the browser or
in the preloaded Maps application one
cool thing about the swiping this is the
way you dismiss applications you swipe
them away from one at the edges of the
screen you could see there was that the
video was still playing while you were
swiping the application away on the
applications menu you can move all the
icons around and on the open
applications menu you can kill
applications individually or there's a
button saying closed off so it all works
very well you can have a four icon for
call view or nine card view the browser
when you first get into it brings up
your latest and your most visited
websites you could just see there the
on-screen keyboard is also terrific it
really works very well this haptic
feedback which actually works and helps
user experience browser performance is
again for a quick there is no flash
support but again pinch-to-zoom
scrolling for
there's an elastic animation there when
you reach the end of scrolling or
finished assuming there's the unlocking
motion you can swipe you look screen
away in any direction you just start
from one edge of the screen and then
swipe all the way to the other coming
back to the AMOLED display it is
obviously and typically for AMOLED
displays very uniformly lit one thing
that bears mentioning is that it comes
with plants our matrix sub pixel
arrangement which has been an issue with
previous phones but looking at it here
and close-up you just can't tell there
are basically no issues relates to
depends our matrix I wouldn't be worried
about it again
terrific viewing angles one thing also
to note is that the Nokia n9 comes with
a micro sim it's one of very few forms
that use it Apple's iPhone is an obvious
example so there we go there's the Nokia
n9</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
