saw that we went on air presumably you
heard my introduction but maybe you
didn't we'll see it's it's a good times
I'm dieter bohn I'm glad Sabbath i'm dan
seifert and i'm chris sigler and don't
you guys noticed but something happened
yesterday the entire world changed again
forever again I'm excited about watch
dogs to dieter it's not just year uh
yesterday was an insane crazy horrible
ridiculous day we had Microsoft keynote
we of course had WWDC and then we had a
sony keynote later in the evening and i
believe we also like something else
happened and i just lost it it was it
was a crazy crazy day um we are all
being electronically monitored now which
yes ah we are being electronically
monitored well Jenna team core where of
it now he's been going on for beautiful
right while right good point well if you
believe the government you know we mean
Dan and Chris should be fine it's flat
who should be worried because he's a
foreign national right and if you need
the government this is all perfectly
legal to a foreign national a dangerous
that can bid it has to be said actually
really i really hope that there is a
secret court order explicitly requiring
that the NSA be allowed to monitor the
virgin mobile show like not just one
we're on air but like the off air part
like they can they can tap into that i
hope that there is an actual documents
they they can they can monitor us
positioning our cameras and microphones
yeah and complaining about hangouts yeah
we're duly fascinating lives oh but
actually to what to what diesel was
saying how often does it happen that we
have simultaneous Apple and Microsoft
events not nice yeah yeah the fact that
they were overlapping is really messed
up for priotiy I mean so this is like a
trend that we've been going on to with
these companies they've been moving
their events closer and closer
and closer together like a few years ago
there'd be a couple months apart then a
couple weeks apart and then in the past
year or so it seems like back to back to
back every company would have events we
tweak tweak and now they're like on the
same day and overlapping and before you
know it you know we're going to have
events all at the exact same time all at
once every company in the industry will
just have a one-hour press conference on
a designated day simultaneously this
fall the fall events are all going to
happen on the same day at one p.m.
eastern goog is going to announce
Android 4.3 and apple announced the new
iPhones and Microsoft will announce
Windows Phone 8 and Rob well there is
actually a big industry secret behind
this which is that in spite of our
efforts happening in internet forums and
web publications to try and stir up
conflict between these companies the
truth is that all these people actually
love one another Google employees Apple
employees Microsoft people they live one
out in the Hangout physically in the
real world and they go on holidays
together so obviously you know you get
the event done and then you go on
holiday so they have to synchronize
events that's that's pretty smart that's
uh I like that take I mean agent secret
is that people actually get along it's
not yet that is actually I mean I think
there's a lot of truth to that but uh
you know I I I don't think I mean yes
yesterday sucked from a news coverage
perspective the fact that you know we
had at the xbox one event overlapping
with the beginning of WWDC both of which
are obviously huge events but there's
there's some separation in the fact that
one is very very heavily videogame
oriented the other one is Apple if it
had been WWDC and say the first day
keynote of google i/o overlapping or you
know the Windows Phone 9 intro
overlapping that would be much more of a
doomsday scenario it still was was tough
don't get me wrong and I'm sure was
tough for for readers to who are trying
to like keep up on two major pieces of
news and two major live blog
simultaneously but it could have been
worse yeah
so fortunately we have some very
excellent everything you need to know
posts for each event and I mean let's
just I mean come on let's just talk
about apple and nothing but apple for
the rest of our lives because everything
changed again again drew everything
changes for the better or for the worse
is the fact that a lot of these to keep
saying this talk about apple and then
doesn't want to talk about for because
it's like I just don't want to start
okay so yeah iOS 7 uh there's just
there's so much to talk about we've put
up a bunch of a post on it last bit of
thoughts Josh to put up thoughts we've
got man just just I don't even order to
start let's start with it just the
high-level it like it looks different
it's the flat design but that sort of
flatness I don't know it doesn't seem to
come through for me well because I'm
looking at the icons and I just can't
get over it they're just so ugly like
some are and some ons I think right
which one is ok tell me because I'm
looking at the home screen right now and
I good compass notes phones okay videos
we seriously just gonna bring down every
single icon well the cognate one is cool
now then right actually tix yeah but
actually my cook is it well it showed
gmt where is she showing pretty
something anyway um a lengthening look
screen actually and but then the big
issue for everyone seems to be that it's
inconsistent and we have to remember
that this is to just to be the Beta Beta
Beta Gamma whatever is still you know
the pre-release software and it's
intended only for developers so we
shouldn't be judging it as something
that just been released or brand new
device that's the first thing to say so
inconsistent is inconsistencies kind of
to be expected but I like the cleaner
lock screen I don't like the fact that
the slide to unlock bit kind of invites
you to slide up words whereas you want
to be sliding
uh to the right and there's only a very
subtle animation you know the little
elimination of the slide to unlock which
we write on the left to the right and I
just way too subtle most people just
aren't going to pick up a hint well it
does give you some sort of thing when
you try and slide up that no no you
should go a different direction like end
it and write it is possible to juice you
can slide across from anywhere on the
screen now you only what it follow that
step path what is that text anymore what
is that arrow supposed to indicate as a
control center is that letter indicates
control center and then there's an arrow
at the top of the lock screen to
indicate Notification Center yeah so I
could see I mean I think there are a lot
of subtleties I mean we have to keep in
mind a couple things one this is a
really fundamental redesign that by all
appearances was turned around in the few
months and Scott Forstall left yeah to
this is Johnny eyes first shot at south
where to sign he is a noob when it comes
to sell for design and three like Vlad
was pointing out we have a few months
before release and I think a lot of
these things are probably gonna get
ironed out I suspect that by the time we
see a commercial release of iOS 7 there
going to be a lot of nuances subtle
nuances that have changed from the first
beta that would be my guess yeah I mean
they're they're subtle nuances and
there's like really guys you didn't hear
anybody complain about these things and
I'm like like do we know what
notification toasts look like are they
gonna go they did talk about them I
don't think they showed him know and
judging from talked about this in our
post WWDC show with Ross yesterday I'm
concerned that notification center which
was one of my biggest complaints not
from iOS 6 from from what we've seen of
it it doesn't look like it's changed
enough to me it's it looks like it's
basically the same notification center
which is completely useless in its
current form right well I mean they they
added tabs right so there's a today view
there's an all of you and then I think
there's a unread or something view I
mean miss that's because yeah I mean the
today which is kind of weird because
every notification you haven't yet see
in a second kid missed no no this well
Mary good and I've seen like rather than
minute fix dismissing notifications they
just gave you another tab where like you
just go to look that's right that's
right i mean everybody complains about
the fact that is a timely 2x that you
need to be specific to try and nail down
and then once you do that there's a
second secondary challenge where you
have to tap it again to clear clear the
stuff away well what blows my mind is
that throughout the interface apples
added all these swiping gestures they've
you know you swipe up for control center
you still swipe down from the
notification center there's a new back
gesture that you swipe back which is
very reminiscent of other platforms
which i'm sure we'll talk about but in
Notification Center they didn't like the
most logical thing to do with these
notifications is swipe across them just
like Nike do a nandroid to clear them
out and they didn't seem to enable that
or write an absolute event X appleby
much invented a whole idea of swiping
away to delete things I remember that
from using its mail client yeah years
ago so although classically Apple's
model has been two steps right swipe and
then press the button right so right you
don't do it accidentally but if it's a
notification you know you can pretty
safely swipe it away you know your data
is not disappearing you're not deleting
an email you're not bleeding a message
it's just deleting the notification so
right that would make so much more sense
in that scenario than the stupid little
X that everyone seems to hate yeah I'm
relatively happy with control center I
mean I will say that like that the idea
that they separated out controls from
multitasking so instead of having this
stuff scurried away to the left of the
multitasking area they just need a whole
separate panel for it you know it's it's
fine like it it looks super tacked on to
me it's a little bit weird like what
they chose and like there's like square
buttons at the bottom and big circle
buttons at the top like they stuck
everything in there that I would want
although i will see if airdrop is
actually useful or not the concept of
control center is great and i think that
the fact that they separated out both
from notification center and from the
multitasking screen kind of sets them
apart from other platforms in a
meaningful way but what would struck me
on stage
was that control center I mean the whole
platform looks like weirdly uh what's
worth a million for like under designed
or like unfinished basically but Control
Center takes the cake like it literally
looks like a wireframe like giant it's
opened like Adobe Illustrator and drew
some lines is like this is the basic
idea for what I want and then they just
that's what they ran with and it's not
alone in that respect Chris if you look
at safari for iOS it has some really I
mean absolutely abstract icons going on
if you look at the bookmarks icon and
tabs icon they're just kind of squarish
shapes with lines going through them
like they're almost impossible to
interpret I you have to basically tap
them see what happens and then remember
okay this is my bookmarks it's this is
the issue that I had really is the fact
that although the skeuomorphic look has
always looked outdated or at least you
know for the past couple years has
looked outdated and I'm fashionable and
all of that stuff the new ultra-modern
look does look really slick and sharp
but isn't this intuitive for people and
you know you're gonna hand this to
somebody who isn't all that proficient
in using smartphones and they're gonna
start scratching the head whereas the
older icons might've look Celia the
might have looked more childish but
they're just things that people will be
able to see and recognize and I think
that's a loss in just basic usability
but but I should to bring back to the
control center let's give up a credit
because I've gotten quite a bit of heat
for not giving up or credit so i think i
should do that in order to preserve my
life over the next few days and let's
give a credit photo control center
because those are quick settings
integrals that we've been asking for for
I know do they really deserve credit
though I mean people have literally been
asking for that since the first version
of iphone OS it's been a jailbreak tweak
for years and it's like the most logical
thing because people want to constantly
toggle their bluetooth and Wi-Fi and
airplane mode and all this other stuff I
know I constantly do it when I'm using
iphone and I have to dive into the
settings app or have to use the old
style multitasking
ios6 to jump to the Settings app and it
like why did it take so long to put such
a logical useful feature into the
platform ok so what do what are the
toggles to the bottom it's it's like
flashlights calculator camera and lock
o'clock yeah yeah like you set your
alarm that makes absolutely no sense and
it doesn't look like these are
customizable either so you can't put
your favorite apps there right so but so
like these shortcuts at the bottom or
what are just surreal to me like it's
like when you hang when you put in a
custom widget on Android and like oh you
know what I want the camera I'm going to
stick that in there but and flashlight
like I guess there's no place else to
put it and that's another one of those
things that get stuck on the android
widgets in the notification center or on
a homescreen widget like you know you
want to build such a time a lot but like
or set your alarms but it's just like
they just like took a stab at the things
that people want to access frequently
and just the room down there and
calculator really I mean maybe those are
the things people access frequently all
the things people have the least
patients when they want to access them
or the least tolerance for delay Ryan
maybe that was apples premise yeah Alice
made a really interesting point
yesterday which is that the calculator
which is one of many many apps that was
redesigned in OS 7 was originally
designed to look like a really famous
braun calculator from right via late
seventies early eighties I believe
there's a reissue now if you want to buy
it but you know it I don't know if it's
actually a dieter Rams design but it's
it's a you know it's very classic like
Bauhaus style design and that what's
interesting is that that calculator and
other products in bronze line at that
time and even today we're designed
around the principle of you know as
little design as possible and now
they've gone away from that made it even
simpler I mean it's literally just the
buns are just like monochrome squares
now right I think in seven and it's so
it's like they've it looks like Windows
Phone styler yeah so it yet yes it does
so they've gone away from
from a calculate from mimicking a
calculator that was designed
specifically to espouse the principles
that they're obviously trying to achieve
with iOS 7 which is ironic what do you
guys think of the incredible ubiquitous
use of transparency and semi
transparency and the Gaussian blur to on
a bunch of the overlays everything has
got like well okay first of all there's
a parallax effect on the home screen so
the wallpaper moves there's a there's a
transparency on the keyboard so you can
kind of see some stuff behind the
keyboard it's a little blurred out it's
on control center it's on notification
center there seem to be some other
random things that have been like
transparency on them if you put a gun to
my head and said you know we're going to
give you linen or we're going to give
you transparency uh I guess I would take
transparency but as a lot of people have
been pointing out there's been a lot of
developers who downloaded the the beta
and have been using it and things like
that ah this transparency can cause a
lot of issues with usability because the
out what the problem is and if you look
at the screenshots of control center
everything is monochromatic on that
transparency layer so if you open it up
in front of say something with a dark
background all of a sudden all of your
controls become very difficult to see or
almost invisible which is like totally
counterintuitive um if if there were
some maybe some color added to it or
some depth of some sort added to the top
layer um that that gave you some
definition to those buttons especially
in control center that might help
mitigate the issue but I mean it's not
like completely transparent you know
right i don't think i've seen any
literal translations but the problem is
all translations it's translucent but
it's uh it's dependent on the background
of the app that you swipe it up so like
if you are on the home screen and you're
using that stock wallpaper that seems to
be with a lot of like greens and blues
and things like that you have this you
swipe it up and you've got this
transparent layer that's got a lot of
greens and blues in it but if you are on
say like Safari or you're in the new
calendar app which is like red and white
you're you swipe off that layer and it's
like
mostly white with you know the text on
top of it if the exact opposite happens
if you're on a black an app that has
mostly dark backgrounds or a black
background God the eyes are so ugly you
guys it's not ideal and just a pie along
with you with you then there was another
issue which I which I've forgotten just
think about the threats of people again
where do we meet for criticize an apple
too much for which already should point
out I don't hate Apple no google nor
Microsoft I'm just kind of a dick to
everybody so so it's kind of equal
opportunity hating yeah um now that
there was another point which is the
weather wrap the weather app got
massively redesigned also the calendar
I've got redesigned a whole bunch of the
basic applications or redesigned whether
we're pleased it's all yours but i just
want to point out with the weather app
that um the font is Helvetica knew it i
think is the one that's being young is
universally no it doesn't have a shadow
on OA oh right that's that's part of the
problem like in control centers like
none of these buttons have shadows so
none of them have depth so you know it's
just a line of text and if there is
something conflicting behind it you lose
would it feel the flat design would
suffer Macbeth well this isn't really
flat design though that's saying I'm
completed there's lack of depth I they
do get credit for thinking through what
the layers are in a way that wasn't
there before when you multitask there
was there the old way was it like gave
you this little bar underneath and so
you had the sex there's a thing hiding
beneath it and then I believe like
notifications that are like felt like I
was coming out on front it was it was a
little bit weird and now it's like
there's very clear layers there's your
wallpaper behind everything there's
icons and then a nap and then on top of
that can be either control center or
notification center and it's just like
those are the four layers and your stuff
like when you multitask you know where
you're going in that like hierarchy when
you pull down Notification Center you
know where that is on that hierarchy
II and like that design it's not like a
it's not necessarily a functional change
because it's just you know you're still
pulling swiping something down to hit a
widget you're still swiping something up
to hit a button whatever but it does
give you a better sense of like here's
where i'm at right now and i would i
would say that nobody else since webos
has done that i hate to be the guy I cuz
I'm that guy who talks about webos but
like you look at Windows Phone I feel
lost in windows phone all the time I
really do and I don't know why but like
the back button behaviors a little bit
weird just like everything everything on
windows phone is so flat and so similar
looking you never really feel like
you're like I'm in this thing now and I
know that this thing exists in relation
to those other things and same with
Android although Android you know it's a
little bit simpler but you've got you
know the multi-tasking menu that pops up
and it's fine but but this has got us
like a hierarchy and a system to its UI
elements that does make a lot of sense
well I think that's driven in part by
the fact that iOS devices still have
just one physical button right like
right in and just introducing the
concept of a back button to a platform
automatically throws you into all these
weird philosophical discussions about UX
that you don't have to have an iOS
because that button doesn't exist so
okay I metrowest multitasking now is a
proper you know the way the windows
phone does it the way that sense 5 did
it it's just you know you hear your
screenshots and you can swipe between
them and her aides what's funny is how
much crap we gave HTC for doing this two
cents for I mean HTC decided to like
turn them and make them 3d and all this
other extraneous nonsense ah but it's
essentially the same system you know you
get a look it looks the most to me it
looks the most like Windows felt the way
Windows Phone does it yeah yeah i mean i
guess like what just mishaps in that
multitasking overview is just trade up
web was like they're all blowing that
from what will s yeah yeah great and you
know i think part about webos which is
that you could have multiple windows /
app and you could stack them together in
cards right yeah but i think you know
there's been a lot of discussion about
how much Apple has taken inspiration
from other platforms we had a big design
piece on that that went up earlier today
and how it's really using elements from
virtually all four of the major
platforms we've been talking about
between Android Windows Phone webos and
blackberry 10 but for me at least it
feels like this is the most inspired by
webos just because the multitasking
webos was the first to use these
translucent layers that I can remember
webos had all of these great uh out of
focus boca backgrounds and things like
that all over the place which is very
prevalent in Iowa 7 and you know became
prevalent in Android later on but it
just feels like Apple was tapping into
jon rubinstein and webos ideas Matthias
I Matthias yeah yeah can we can we talk
for a minute can we can we please talk
for a minute about this the signal meter
oh yes yeah actually can I can I finish
up like this is actually an actual like
new function that we need to talk about
with multitasking just so we can wrap
multitasking um because like they were
very few like here's a new thing that
you can do I was Casey was telling me
about this I pointed at him he's right
over there that there was there was very
little like here's a brand new thing
that you can do with iOS you couldn't do
before like we had it was you know Siri
can do talk to talk to you in different
voices and airdrop and you know whatever
but multitasking they added a new thing
where they will let apps update in the
background which is like s final huge
yeah but there's some weird language
around like we know which apps you use
most often and we know when you use them
and so that's when they get to update in
the background so my guess is that like
apps will be able to request to get
background updates and then iOS will let
them like on the hour whatever the
timing is when they're going to do all
their batch data stuff and I'm guessing
but I don't know I'm guessing if they're
smart what they're doing is if you don't
if you don't open an app
for like two days or something iOS is
like you know this app wants background
updates but this user totally doesn't so
you're cut off until you get opened
again well I know that on something good
on stage they said that push
notifications could trigger the
background updating so if you get a push
notification say say you know this is
enabled for the gmail app and you get a
push notation for email that will
trigger the app to go into the
background and hopefully update your
inbox so that when you open it the email
is there just like it is with the native
mail app which is one of the biggest
complaints with any third party email
app on iOS is that you get a
notification and then you open it and
then you have to refresh it and you have
to wait to see your message actually
show all right you can't send email as
your default email app of course no and
you still can't in seven yeah there's no
they didn't they didn't announce any
sort of third-party becoming defaults
with it's a third-party keyboard or
third-party email app or third-party
browser or whatever well nevermind
default there's no indication that you
can even install a third-party keyboard
in seven yet right I mean that they're
they're probably my guess they do this
every year is you know when they
announced say the new iPad Mini or the
iphone 5s or six or whatever it's called
there will probably be one or two quote
unquote surprises and I seven I was
trying to figure out what it was last
year and I couldn't remember i know that
in i was five the surprise was Siri
because Siri was dependent on the iphone
4s is hardware so that had to launch and
then Syrian launched with it when the
hardware launch which was after iOS 5
was initially unveiled at WWDC and I
couldn't offer life of me last night
think of what it was in iOS 6 so unless
you guys are enlightened I know it was
something i don't i don't know if it was
passbook maybe I can't remember I know
wasn't passbook there what what hardware
requirements were in like what what what
other than LTE the iphone 5 doesn't
really have any hardware advantage over
the oven fluorescence yeah I can't think
of what it would what it was I don't
know if the top of my head mmm yeah what
is bigger display but that's all right I
mean the big was played but I guess that
could be it because you know iOS 6 I
just support the right larger describe
intriguing thing about I
seven is actually that series seems to
have switched over to Bing for research
results yes well Siri is you've always
it's always used whatever your default
was right so if you set Bing to your
default search engine in Safari Siri
would have used that but now in iOS 7
apparently you can't change that and
it's only set a bit mmm I don't think
that the former it defaults to Bing but
yeah yeah well i don't i don't know i
mean maybe but you know apparently it
pulls in search results in a much more
formatted way than it did before it used
to be that it would just kick you out to
Safari when you do like a web search and
now they're they're formatted within
Syria itself so yeah so Chris wants to
talk about the the dots that are used
for sharing and I just want to say
before we get into this I'm very angry
because one in order to look at the dots
I'm now looking again at the icons on
the home screen and they're so ugly some
thanks for that Chris you're welcome ok
so the dots whatever actually no I think
it was somebody at cult of mac dug up
one of the old prototypes from the
patent trial the samsung patent trial
that we saw like really early prototypes
of the iphone and one of them was like a
wooden block with a piece of paper
pasted onto it and it had basically
candy color icons and these five dots
for signal strength really this is what
Johnny I've wanted from the beginning
and like I'm serious it's totally
hilarious like it's you know it opened
whatever but like Chris go talk about
the dots I mean I'm not want you to say
about five dots I I have a lot to say
about these dogs um so this is I mean
this is a perfect example of Johnny I've
meddling like this is something it isn't
a design element like the bars are like
international I like to add Aaron from
the Virgin has just said that the signal
meter is the greatest thing to happen to
signal meters since signal leaders were
invented it will aaron i am going to
auggie errands corn as soon as chris is
finished the a lot but please
allow me to finish okay absolutely that
these like they are an international
standard everybody's gonna let you
finish thanks Kanye but Apple just
vented the best signal bar ever well I
mean and look that's great if every time
you want to know your signal strength
you want to count the number of dots
that it's showing but don't like you're
not counting balls no you're not because
each bar is a different size it's
communicating more information to you
just by virtue of its existence with
this your only indication of signal
strength is the number of dots that's
the first thing the second thing is that
like I said this is not a design element
it's like a fundamental like a globally
understood thing that it wasn't in jony
ive's place to redesign it was like when
Nokia came out with that ridiculous 3650
with it with the circular digit keypad
and everyone's like no give this isn't
cool remember that and and then never
again did nokia attempt that that keypad
layout because people were like this is
stupid you just come out with a regular
numeric in fact they they rereleased
that same phone with a regular keep at
it was such a failure and and so i think
what's going to happen I could be
completely wrong but I would not be
surprised if by the time I os7 came to
market they were like oh wait are bad
this is stupid and then they just went
back to the same old signal in no
Charles Chris no jobs not listen all the
little design tweaks and things that
have kind of changed for changes sake
because let's face it the loss of
Shadows under the font is just a choice
it's a design choice a good one well
then and I would argue that sometimes it
isn't like honestly you can't really
read the temperatures in the weather rap
because they're so thin and white and
just don't contrast enough with a blue
sky but aside from that the signal or
the cellular strength signal bar thingy
that is being the same way since the
ancient days where
you could actually you know the LCDs
were so basic that you actually had you
know the little shadow of the signal bar
on the LCD itself like it's 15 years old
20 years I don't know it's as old as
we've had displays on mobile phones and
it's always been these bars as
collecting upwards the thing is crazy
you're saying with apples you look you
have to count the dots we don't really
have to counter those because of dots
are consistent as well right they go
from left to right i believe it's not
like you get the first filled in before
filled in and you have to like scramble
your eyes to figure out how many does
the rotor screen it's consistent and I
think it's just as glanceable I think
it's a cute little change and it's one
of those um any of those faces a
skinning effort like say its context I
because you're my cousin how much how
much how much space is taken up by yes
that's my the hangout but wait wait it
takes up more horizontal space right you
know what that leaves less space for
carrier branding yeah my carrier burning
still there okay so like if you're a
Verizon or god forbid of motor phone
customer 55 dots across and you're
connected to Wi-Fi and you've got
Vodafone like it's gonna run right into
the clock but you know like me and you
shoot you should have a carrier whose
name is a number because i only have the
number 3 i'm gonna my phone it's really
stylish although i was in Taipei last
week and the carrier name I think it was
a Taiwan mobile but I forget but it was
massive I knew was Owen well there's
enters Far East are Far East tone I
don't know if that's the carrier you
want anyway is it Taiwanese carrier it
was a tiny carrier named far east towne
Far East tone at T 0 NE okay so I two
things uh first of all I would just like
to drive home the point that this is the
stupidest thing that Apple has ever done
um I'm and you say whatever I you know
the Safari icon
reminds me of those stupid clocks that
have like the dye forget what they're
called but they are the dots and yet
like do math to figure out the time
that's what it reminds me of yeah it's
like I would like to point out that
Island isn't a winery clock that's none
of this it's not this this come on but
it's like a for all of this but yeah but
dealer to dance point like if they're
going to do this why not come up with a
creative new way to indicate the time in
the status bar to instead of numbers you
know why not have like symbols like a I
will take your point that like there are
standard design elements that aren't
that bad that they have just like
they've like willfully said no we're not
going to use that the the share dialogue
that they I think they actually helped
pioneer a little arrow coming out um
signal strength um there's something
else that's like why didn't you just use
what everybody else is using there's no
hamburger button right they just you
know go whatever name named after our
own ellis hamburger exactly yep yeah
we've we've been trying to like google
doesn't call it a hamburger button by
the way they call it a hotdog button
which is just typical okay i need to i
need to have that explained to me
actually what was that the three
different lines with three line oh yes
yes every button so apple doesn't
doesn't use that to not in the native
apps I mean third party apps yeah yeah I
was going to make a serious point in a
brief one Apple in the industry design
Apple is pressing circular shapes we and
the WWDC keynote kicked off with this
video which has now become infamous
because I complained about it and then
people to shut up so I'll shut up about
it but here's the point it was a design
video and if each of these circles and
they were really elegantly transforming
into other geometric shapes you saw
squares you saw things animations it's
all very pretty and and it kind of spoke
to the really abstract shapes that I
mentioned in so far you know with the
squares and straight lines so straight
lines are kind of like the secondary bit
in circles are the big foreground bit
which i think is why we're seeing that
new signal strength indicator
does anyone mention how ugly these icons
are god they're so ugly all right but I
like so it's ugly on say that let me
just wipe out the point and say I'll be
brief about it but the thing is the
icons coming to what you're saying
they're not circular there's two
squirrels but a closer to circular
because the radius on the corners is
actually uh not as sharp as on as soon
as they change the radius and queens
yeah so machines razandrich so but like
the rod wreck was designed to be the
same the same radius or the same you
know whatever curve has he ever buddy
iphone flores so I I right night someone
tweeted this yes and I I can't remember
who so I can't give him credit I'm sorry
but they put the they took the
screenshot from from Apple's website and
I put the old Iowa 6 icon next to the
Iowa 7 and they measured it and they
figured that the six icon had a ten
radius 10 pixel radius and then this
seven icon had 12 pixel radius and you
can see it's also a softer corner on the
on the iOS 7 icons that's crazy man
that's not it but just just to finish
this lab where you try to map the
projector but yeah i'm looking on I'm
working I'm not giving up hey there's
our install what I don't know when I
talk in google+ hangouts there is a
signal meter of how loud my voice is
right above the video looking right out
of here I'm gonna point the camera it is
good so i can see live dots hey uh huh
wow that's pretty amazing maybe that's
why though maybe even know how to tell
no signal strength maybe it's like how
loud you're speaking you think that's it
Chris no I'm I'm not participating but
Mr is he just enjoys wrap up very
briefly I've always emphasizing circles
but the very fact that those circles
aren't universally visible and you know
thing things that you can sense
throughout the UI throughout the
operating system tells us that everybody
is incomplete as a style of saying and
it's inconsistent now the best example
for doing this kind of thing for me is
me go
Harwinton from nokia which emphasized
again kind of the skwerkel shape so it
was really rounded corners on a circle
and that was everywhere the app icons
were that shape all the little toggles
that you could slide left to right with
that shape the clock was really fancy
when you when you set your alarm but
again that shape was just everywhere you
looked everywhere throughout the
interface it was there any really helped
to make the whole thing feel cohesive
and that's what I was missing at the
moment it's introducing circles here and
there is that as devastating alien
control center Sam icons flat as they
are have circles around them the other
ones have squares circles around the
page and it just you know those little
subtle things people might not sit down
and knock them down on the bullet point
list but they contribute to whether it
always feels cohesive or not and it
doesn't feel that way yet so a year ago
exactly a year ago I wrote an article
saying it's always 73 degrees and sunny
was 72 73 degrees basically it's like
Apple needs to change up their design so
like they've done what I asked them to
mostly but there's the thing that I
don't get once we get over my complaints
about the pastel fluorescent whatever
you want to describe them colors in on
the icons are just the worst I can't
stop talking about it is they they they
didn't try and do anything crazy with
the homescreen basic they they still
actually great I bratz babyz directly
address your headline by just removing
the temperature poked away but yeah
that's exactly right they like say it's
that's no longer Sonny because they
added a cloud and they took the
temperature off like they can put the
live clock like accurate clock on there
but they still can't give us like just
you know and I come with whether the you
know there's so they totally no love for
the closest thing you get is you can
pull a notification center from the home
screen now which is cool we still gotta
go looking for it you get it today view
which you will populate with your
calendar and some other the weather and
some other stuff
but you know there's things that I need
to look at relatively often and it would
just be nice if I could find a way to do
that in this in the system and not go
you know jumping in and out of apps or
still in and out of appt jumping here
yeah and they also apparently went over
to Yahoo's campus beat up whoever
designed their their weather app threw
him in a burlap sack and made them write
this iOS and here's what's going to
happen in response to what you just said
you're gonna get 10 people tweeting at
you that there's a yahoo logo on the app
to which you will need to respond as
I've had to repeatedly over the course
less 24 hours the yahoo logo has been on
the weather app since iOS one it has
nothing to do that just means they're
getting the data from yahoo so like
putting the actual Yahoo weather app
inside iOS so what is very interesting
to me is that you know we mentioned
earlier how much inspiration has been
taken from other platforms but
additionally in all the other news
yesterday Apple at its wwc every year
gives out awards to whoever he thinks
designs like the best apps and the three
apps that were got these awards were
Yahoo weather letterpress and the new
Evernote which has a stackable card view
and every single one of those apps you
can see in iOS 7 you've got yahoo
weather is iOS 7 weather letterpress the
design elements in letterpress are all
over the place in iOS 7 you see them in
the dialer you see them in the calendar
you see them everywhere and then the
evernote with its a stackable card view
you see right in the iowa 7 safari
browser so it's really kind of funny to
me how you know it a polite oaken nod to
these other developers while just like
whole or you know a ham-handed lee uh
stealing their their ideas and shoving
them into the OS and i don't know if
that's because of the you mentioned the
seemingly fast turnaround time from when
scott forstall was given the boot and
you know iOS 7 was came out if that's
why they drew so much inspiration or
whatever but I just can't not see that
i don't know i don't like they didn't
like I don't have a problem taking
inspiration you know stealing right it's
it's what they do with it and how they
you know how they execute on it and
there's some hits and like a bunch of
mrs. that I wasn't expecting like
actually I came up with a marginally
clever puns pronouncement on this and I
think I think I need to get it out Chris
when he was complaining about the signal
strength it was essentially saying the
old saying just because you can doesn't
mean you should but recently well at
least well as you can I os7 I was
thinking just because you should doesn't
mean that you can ha and that's and
that's really the point weedeater deters
request last year they need to redesign
the interface yes they did need to do
that but at this point in time again
let's reiterate this is not supposed to
be out and it's not spoke and it isn't
out for consumers it isn't our new
devices it is given point in time it
isn't ready it isn't good enough but you
know months and months of development
time can it can turn at least at least
in my estimation can turn into more when
when we talk about Apple then what we're
talking about its competitors yeah
particularly since okay OS X 10.9 got
announced WWDC as well but the room of
the rumors have been that resources have
been dedicated to getting iOS finished
and done on time and on time is actually
you know let's say September time which
is when we anticipate in the next iPhone
to come out so Apple is fully invested
in getting this write-up scratchin and
let's also they'll be too critical this
isn't another case of maps this is
nowhere near as bad as that hmm I agree
with you I don't think well we don't
know yet we don't know until it's it's
you know the final versions out and it's
in users hands maps was a mess through
all the betas but you can't really say
that the final product
going to be mess until it actually was a
mess um so yeah we're not there yet and
like you said Vlad a lot of this could
be adjusted and fixed in the next three
to four months or whatever that I guess
three months that will be seeing betas
but I mean am I going to get used to
looking at these horrible icons and it's
gonna be like oh yeah that's what they
look like and like you know I thought it
was ugly at first but it turns out like
Johnny I was just way more
forward-thinking than I am and you know
he sees where my tastes are going and
and he's going to help me get there is
that what's going to happen and when I
when I looked these icons today I'm
never going to stop talking about these
icons when I looked at him today the
most frustrating thing would not be able
to stop talking about the icons is that
I don't have the proper language to
describe my feelings about them because
I'm not Josh Topolsky and so I just keep
trying over and over again anyway what I
looked at them today I was like you know
maybe they're not as bad as I thought
yesterday and I can't decide if that's
because they're growing on me or if it's
because like my tastes have gotten worse
having had looked at them for a day I
would actually really like to see iOS 7
against a variety of wallpapers because
i think the wallpaper is coloring my
opinion of the OS oh you didn't want him
to took from android exact loading
bubbles yeah exact which which was I
believe pulled from what was I was it
didn't have a floating bubble oh no they
didnt that there was their hacks for
active wallpapers I believe but I don't
know you mean it actually being active
no I just meant that the look of it um
yeah and you know the the OS actually
apparently changes depending on the
wallpaper that you put so if you put a
wallpaper that's got more red color and
that the OS elements will change no it
changes it's sort of like a like the
dock and the the status bar they're not
translucent like control center
Notification Center but they do change
their tone based on the colors that are
directly adjacent to them and so like if
you like your like if you think have
your wallpaper as a picture of the beach
then your doc will be a brown
they'll have a good doc basically
uh so are the active wallpapers are our
developers going to be able to make
active wallpapers or no don't know I
just all I know is I saw a wallpaper
move yeah there's I believe there's two
included with the beta 1 but it's not
clear if developers will be able to tap
into those ER hmm oak so say I joined a
hysterical that Android has had live
wallpaper since android 2.1 they viewed
on the Nexus 10 and now they just show
up in iOS there's some really good ones
for android too there's some really good
third-party pounds yeah tell me tell me
which one because I um I have a parallax
one that Apes the don't know if you
could see it but it's you see my globe
moving you probably can't see it on
camera but it does the parallax effect
that uh iOS 7 does ok hold on I will get
you the name of my there's a papercraft
one that is just like paper land pro
that's the one enters yep just makes me
want to die like no it's too much work
yeah that's the 1i you wallpaper that
gives me like the weather that looks
well no so the latest version of paper
land pro connect it can actually be set
up to be responsive to the weather so
depending on your local weather like
different things will happen in the
world yeah and then I'm gonna spend like
half an hour every day like do I want
the tree slider set to this level or do
I want it down here like I always just
use the presets and turn weather on and
off yeah there's some good presets um
but I went to I would like to see I
would love to see paper land pro come to
iOS 7 but we don't know if developers
gonna be able make their own right I was
going to suggest that were running out
of things to talk about with iOS but uh
they just won't find a thing oh there's
at least one leveling I got one more
alright well mine is gonna be quick it's
just to say that Tim Cook spent way too
much time during that keynote bitching
and moaning by Android honestly think it
annoys me and it also reminds me of the
advertising techniques of smoking
companies
so when well bear with me but when it
kind of became apparent that smoking is
really horrible and nightmarish for you
what tobacco companies did they tried to
be clever and they stopped advertising
smoking as something that's actually
good for health which they used to do
you know clear your throat with a bit of
smoke they started advertising against
one another so they started talking
about how their filter is better than
the other guys filter and instead of
saying smoke out cigarettes you won't
get a sore throat like the other guys
and and it's always the case that I
think if you have a really solid awesome
product you should be selling it on its
own merits whereas Tim Cook's been I
mean the other thing is Tim Cook
everybody just went through stats and
graphs you didn't really do any of the
demos so most of his time was actually
coming on stage is saying we're the best
look at these charts and android or
android is kind of sucks and and I mean
Lynch to compare alders and rank lead an
Android they did it what there's no you
didn't but in the beginning but I kitty
was talking about things like and you
know a whole third of Android users are
using an OS released in 2010 so he's not
wrong about that outraged about it
there's 90 like I mean it was upset
ninety-four percent are on iOS 6
ninety-four percent of iphone users like
that's bonkers that's insane the rebels
language harbin history has had a great
update cycle like that like if I'm Apple
yeah i brag about that all the time yeah
but brag about your own don't spend time
to advanced it means nothing with some
context you could say like ninety-four
percent of phone users are on iOS 6 but
if you don't mention that oh that's you
know a notable feat because no other
platform can do that uni and then that's
the context that you provide their
bloody larger point is that maybe I'm
gonna put words of there's a sense there
was a sense of defensiveness the
idealized big thing was when when when
chillers like can't innovate my ass it's
like well who was saying you couldn't
innovate exactly I'm like who you
quoting man yeah that sounds like
paranoia more than anything else well
but so but like everybody has been
doing what we've been doing and saying
like the iOS feels a little tire they
got to do something so there there was a
level of not like here's the amazing
thing that we've done that you weren't
expecting there was a level of we know
everyone's been asking for this stuff so
here's the amazing thing that we did
because we knew you're all asking for it
right and that's that there's a
different tone and tenor to that right
and the same is actually true with I
mean that quote was specifically
reference to the mac pro but at the same
sentiment held there to like that the
mac pro had grown really tired and
people were clamoring for a completely
redesigned model and they got it I have
absolutely zero need for a mac pro but I
won't let believe that you know I am so
freaking excited for the new macbook
airs it is other than like going back to
the old magsafe because the new ones
sucked because they're there they stick
flat out literally everything I wanted
them to do on the macbook airs they did
like no right not her ray no Retina
awesome longer battery life awesome I'm
done like why twice and SSDs faster like
it's great I am super happy with the new
MacBook Airs I'm going to get one and
i'm going to prance around like a little
girl with it it's going to be looks look
if they're not going to okay first of
all you need to stop inviting sprockets
comparison I mean come on you're asking
for it but uh if they're not going to do
a retina macbook air which is fine
whatever like I would have preferred a
retina but that's fine no they know look
is the reason why you don't want a
retina is because you're right about the
effect on battery life right and speed
okay well you can get it you can get a
three point three gigahertz I seven a
gig of ram and and has well on this so
speed should be concerned and as well as
part of a positive effect on battery
life so but anyway the reason if they're
not going to retina then the very least
they can do is offer a matte option and
they did not do that yeah that would
have been fantastic yeah um now I'll
think about this laptop but I'm going to
get an ID
directed okay I radio I radio so raw so
whatever yeah well mming right well it's
it's not a Spotify competitor it's not
an RDO competitor it's a pimp and during
about it it's a Pandora killer I mean
assuming that everything that you can
listen to or you can buy in iTunes you
can listen to on I radio I mean that's
huge they showed an example of led
zeppelin playing during the keynote
there's no streaming service that has
led zeppelin's catalog um so that's kind
of a nice little coup I guess for Apple
but it's just it's plugged in its
built-in it's just like I message in
that you know it's seamless for users to
just start using it yeah yeah I guess I
mean if I'm are do or I'm spot if I'm
definitely breathing a sigh of relief I
mean unfortunately they're I mean I'm
sure that there are users of those
services that will just kind of be like
confused into thinking of this as a
streamlined way of getting to the same
thing which of course not but yeah
you're right like it if i'm pandora i'm
completely like pooping myself because
you know pandora is already in there in
the hurt locker we've written about them
a lot that they have this you know they
can't find a CEO they still have a CEO
right but if i'm not mistaken and yeah
now they are neither this CEO left no
it'sit's panda right now Kendra wait do
you only know contribute to the
discussion because I'm not that much of
a streaming radio guy other than having
you Spotify in the past the anything I
will contribute is that right we should
still give a radio a chance to
completely suck no I'm really sir
because the thing I recall is that when
Google Drive got announced we all felt
like Oh Dropbox really should have sold
to Google when they had the chance Ted
do you know Google Drive is coming is
going to bring more features more
integration a broader ecosystem it's
going to plug into things like Gmail and
just completely obviate Dropbox
false ever since then is that we realize
that Dropbox actually is a really good
interface and works really well and
reliably in Google Drive has its own
issues so I mean I radio seems like it's
going to be completely oh you know
obliterating Pandora but let's give it a
chance to see how it actually works in
practice well if if can you guys hear me
yep yes okay sorry the stinky bars my
dots aren't working Chris the if Apple
isn't able to put pandora to sleep with
this then something has gone horribly
wrong because Pandora's catalogue is
like under a million songs Apple has how
many millions and millions of songs
available in the iTunes library
Pandora's big thing is that like they
don't have millions and millions of
songs but they don't need them because
they have the songs that you actually
want to listen I disagree when I I don't
use pandora much anymore because I paid
for an RTO subscription but when I did
use pandora before RT 0 and Spotify were
available in the US and things like that
I used to hear the same songs all the
time now it's rosie props yeah but like
there-there strengthens our algorithm so
basically panda or just needs to get
sold get bought yeah but it's like then
but yeah there's strength is they're out
there algorithm in the same way that
like grace notes strength was it was its
database right like I mean the product
like at the end user facing product like
no longer should exist like it's been
out loaded by an object by more like
modern streaming solutions by the way I
want to point out that both Chris and I
were right both Pandora and Rdio are
looking for CEOs so in other words
everyone is screwed yeah if you very
much did it didn't look at have some
unlucky music have some trash talk to
say about I radio oh yeah the saddest
trash talk ever like I didn't even like
I forgot the nokia music existed and
like some dude and nokia this is like an
actual press release right like that has
a quote from some nokia guys saying oh
looks like apples finally playing catch
up with us yeah
that's obviously what's going on yeah
funky music was such a brutal competitor
uh I think airdrop looks cool well I'm
curious to see what kind of files little
share but you seem like I'm curious to
see if i'll ever use it that did you
notice they took a swipe at samsung when
they were talking about airdrop because
they were like don't have to walk around
touching phones with each other well i
mean i think that's a swipe at NFC in
general right cuz you can do the the
file sharing with Windows Phone and yes
friday yes but Samsung has definitely
been pushing that the hardest like if
they've you know they've had at least
three or four commercial television
commercials showing people touching
phones to transfer data yes true but
samsung also has like a very similar
feature to airdrop right where you can
just broadcast something to a net of
people in your Wi-Fi network isn't that
one of the billions of features that
come on the Galaxy series yeah that's
Wi-Fi direct they have a they have a
thing that uses Wi-Fi direct and it's
like a photo-taking party mode yeah and
you know it's the most ridiculous thing
because like I don't know how many
parties you got to where people are out
and drinking and they all stay within
the same Wi-Fi network and there's no
problems there or they're all using
galaxy s3's or old gray galaxy s force
so sorry we're getting we're getting
angry tweets people are mad at us okay
that's okay I'm a bit late yeah we've
been given him reason to wait undergo
well what is uh oh I see so our own Matt
macari one of our one of our legal
eagles I never get an opportunity use
that term what about legal eagles guys
is is asking why iTunes radio isn't a
real RT or Spotify competitor and I
think that I mean it's it's this is a
really good question it raises a really
interesting point because people don't
have that clear of an idea what the
differences are between like an online
radio and online streaming service I'd
like there's those even the right terms
so like the difference is like Spotify
Rdio like you got all of the music all
you can eat you can pick whatever you
want and listen to it right now and you
pay 5 10 bucks a month for that
Radio subscription is like you could buy
music and you can listen to stations but
you can't say I want to go listen to
this song right now give it to me right
yet see on demand yeah yeah it's a
distinctly different type of service
right so I think I add to answer Matt's
question directly from what all of the
reports from our own reports and other
sources as well before iTunes radio was
announced was that Apple was very
adamant in how much it was willing to
pay royalties on the songs and I believe
that the record companies are reportedly
all wanted more money than Apple was
willing to pay I think Apple wasn't
willing to pay as much as even pandora
pays per song and so maybe they just
weren't able to come to an agreement on
those terms in order to allow on-demand
streaming like you have with our do and
Spotify because I didn't want to pay but
the royalty per song as far as like is
it a competitor I mean it it's not a
direct competitors doesn't have the same
functionality but the question that it
that it raises is are people going to be
like ma'am I'm not going to start paying
for I'm happy enough with what's on deck
here I'm happy enough with this and why
I could go yeah it could totally totally
eat up customers from Spotify nor do I
could speak to my wife uh does not
understand why I pay for our do when she
has pandora for free like she is
perfectly fine and perfectly content
with pandora even with the induction ads
in the limited song selection she's like
I don't care I don't have to pay for
yeah and yeah I mean that I think
there's a total like there's a huge
contingent of the population that just
isn't into music enough to really care
to be able to listen to their own
selection of music they just want they
want some background music they want to
be able to press play and stuff just
starts coming on and that you know this
is perfect for that contingent in the
population and it but if you are a music
enthusiast you can be looking for
something more and that's where services
like our dear Spotify come into play
it's also interesting that iTunes radio
seems to be funneling you into just
purchasing songs on iTunes because you
listened to it and then there's a button
right there to buy it if you want it
actually oh yeah yeah it almost feels
like Apple gave up like
want to like go through the same level
of how that are do and Spotify and mog
have gone through to secure these
hundreds of maybe even thousands of
individual deals for for streaming all
these songs so there they just like went
halfway and they're like okay well we'll
just you know what we'll do a pandora
style service and then funnel people
right into put Tobias it should be noted
that uh I don't believe Spotify Rdio and
definitely not Pandora none of them
actually make money so that's no fair no
I just brought up a great point on
Twitter and response to Maddie's the
other thing that we have to keep in mind
why help gonna raise thats model go
ahead then do it ma'am well yeah I
wanted to show off the fact that I'm
elated to at least from formula but the
licensing regimes are different so if
you're running an online radio service
you don't need to sit down and negotiate
deals with people there's basically a
preset rate at which if you're running a
radio service you get access to the
music and you don't need to go and talk
to the artist because they signed up
basically the royalty rate is already
set for you it seems like it's more
complex than that because Apple has been
going to the labels and signing
licensing deals of some description but
but yeah if you're operating a pedorra
like service the negotiating of the
licensing isn't a problem for you
because there's that particular regime
in place so imagine the point that
imagine if they they did offer something
like Spotify Rdio just unlimited music
you could pick your songs itunes is the
number one seller music right now and if
this thing was popular like people would
just it would cannibalize their own
sales right and if I'm Apple I maybe you
think that's a fine trade-off if I can
charge enough for the service but if I'm
the music company and I see the store
that sells the most of my music coming
to me and saying hey we will really want
to launch this service that will totally
like kill all your sales how about it
you want to set up a deal there you know
if I'm up a music company I say yeah
that's not going to happen goodbye right
um I think that I am done talking about
iOS there must be more we could talk
about the tabs in chrome but we don't
really need to not chrome sorry ha
Safari well so there was that they stole
from chrome that's exactly yeah there's
just one kind of like overarching theme
that I want to address now I talked
about this briefly on the WWDC show
yesterday but like I feel like every
platform now has had its what I'm this
is my term feel free to use it I'm open
sourcing it but the term that I've come
up for this with for this phenomenon is
Apple's had its Metro moment like you
know we saw in the true transition from
windows mobile 6 57 we saw it in the
transition from gingerbread honeycomb
and and now we're seeing it with with
iOS and I imagine that if webos had
actually lived long enough just to still
be shipping phones today it would
probably be less I don't want to use the
term cartoony but would have personal
than it did it would it would have less
gloss than it did when it died so it's
just the direction the design is going
but it kind of makes you wonder what's
next like at some point do we go back to
the glossy look like you know is
everything that is old new again at some
point what happens well I can speak to
that from the very obscure field of
soccer t-shirt okay I manager isn't here
this and what happens there is there is
actually pretty much an ebb and flow in
terms of design so you get one year or
two years three years where retro shirts
of back end so everything is simplified
everything is basic everything tries to
look like the 1950s and people couldn't
afford to buy more sophisticated shirts
to play soccer in football in and then
the designers kind of started getting
back to their guru to start over
designing things start putting mesh
panels on the side etc etc and it
becomes really over designed and busy
and I always thought oh you know what
we're gonna go retro and simplify and
you know go back to real spirit power
and I just keep cycling that in and out
in and out
kind of lucky or you used to be because
the nfo is moving to the same sort of
system but you're kind of lucky with her
consistency or sports uniforms were you
you don't follow college football
apparently yeah any like I'd say past
tense what did it what do you mean well
they used to be consistent not now
they're not a kind of horrible angry and
polish Bosco Jesus man I can't even
watch that with the parachute shorts and
anyway we leave diverged pretty far from
uh from mobile you guys that's a John
McCain's favorite new feature auto
updates for App Store apps that's right
okay yeah he I mean he actually he
brought that up on the the Senate
Florida teen i right at some point in
questioning and good questioning Tim
Cook that was he had he had the CEO of
the most powerful technology company on
the planet and he's like what am i
upside i'll update do you think it's
like you think you have to cook such an
email immediately after that and being
like we need to add this feature will
click and just just do it hey you know
what it wouldn't surprise me it's
entirely possible just like i'm
developing a conspiracy theory that sony
hadn't decided on pricing for the ps4
until after the xbox about yesterday but
yeah okay that'll be hilarious thing we
need to start lobbying congress for
features that we want in iOS we need too
many senators John McCain and can move
to move estate no actually that's not
worth it we need to get soldiers don't
burn get mad inners no Franken the
seventh letter he'll be an outside right
here we go yeah if used to in politics
where you get a bunch of senators
complain about notifications in iOS I
think we get something done yeah I I
would agree with that how optimistic on
that front as well I didn't talk about
how bad the folders are can we talk
about that how they're not bad come on
though they look hideous I love the fact
that they're unlimited so now I can
consolidate my ford weather app folders
into one hey boys need some weather apps
they're so ugly the weather the folders
are so ugly in iOS 7 they're like ah
damn why don't you just move to Florida
man then you're at the right now Florida
is not
good I would say more like San Diego San
Diego is a place where you don't have to
worry about the weather right yeah so
okay Real Talk guys uh duh now that we
know about iOS 7 does it influence at
all you're interested in getting a
google edition device later this month I
need both yeah I mean any boat now
because the thing is I already own an
iphone 5 i'll get iOS 7 on that so right
oh you're but you're not lining up for a
5s is that what I'm hearing no not
unless like when they do announce the
successor it does some really
mind-blowing hardware stuff yeah I mean
I my personal thing is that I ki be I
keep feeling harassed by the difference
in quality of apps between iOS and
Android it's is such a recurrent thing
to say about it you know I always have
to just more reliable and better i get i
can tell you guys actually go ahead man
well I can totally agree with you Vlad
and and that's the thing that is like I
get frustrated when I'm on iOS
exclusively because none of my apps
update in the background and then I get
frustrated when I'm on Android because
none of the apps are the quality of iOS
so I'm actually really intrigued by the
new background multitasking features in
iOS 7 and if they really do solve this
problem of apps not updating in the
background because it drives me nuts to
use Sparrow or gmail or whatever email i
will use and it doesn't update in the
background yeah and Twitter to like the
control panel plus background proper
multitasking like that's those are like
to my you know four or five big
complaints about iOS and their big ones
and like just changing those things is
going to change a lot of the like the
effective feel of what it's like to use
the phone and it like might overall just
feel way better than I expect as a
holistic experience so I'm super pumped
for it to get out but yeah no I mean I
mean I'm
I'm gonna not own the latest android
phone no I'm gonna own the latest
Android phone i'm going to buy a stock
gs4 it's going to happen well i would i
would much prefer j s4 active oh god you
get a just for active with like a four
point four inch display that would be
sweet no you have you have to have a
galaxy zoom now that's what you get you
get the galaxy yeah no Flannigan's
galaxy mega by omega yeah you know what
if i if i get a galaxy mega if somebody
even sends it to me for review i'm using
as a chopping board that is just
happening the soom the zoom is the rumor
for the June twentieth event is that
right yes take a point shoot camera and
duct tape it to the back again work and
those are the leaves which is
essentially what the galaxy camera is
right now it's actually worse is
actually worse than a galaxy camera
because a galaxy camera when you look at
it from the back it's all screen I won't
look at it from the front is basically a
camera so it's like galaxy camera that
is one of the Samsung names which I've
had the fewest complaints about it's
like yes galaxy okay that's you enter a
brand camera it's a camera good what
we're on the same page it's your Android
camera but now this thing is essentially
yeah we're gonna build a galaxy s4 on
the front which is why the call in the
product galaxy s4 zoom room and product
yeah and then we're gonna splice it to a
crappy point shoot camera and we're
going to make it as thick as a crappy
point shoot camera make the front with
you know the physical buttons and
everything else just like phone so we're
going to encourage you to use this
freakish thing including in your piece
so I think that see here's the thing i'm
excited by this like the the idea of a
galaxy s4 zoom because if you can just
like crammed on a camera to the back of
a galaxy s4 and you have a new product
that the other ones took the whole world
of possibilities like you can have like
the galaxy s4 twitch galaxy s4 attached
to a cappuccino machine porto save
toaster yeah well s4 toast as for drive
like it's some attached like a scooter
there's a lot of possibilities they a
lot of product categories they could
jump into here with what the dream for
Android was that it's you know could be
put on a billion different things and it
turns out you don't actually have to
customize Android for the thing you put
it on you just need to tape an s4 to it
I mean really I think what would serve
all of us the best is if they'd they'd
just attach a galaxy s4 to the back of
an iphone and then you have to choose
platforms yeah there you go yeah um nope
oh speaking of choosing California why
don't why doesn't somebody make a case
that is holds an iphone on the back and
an s4 on the front you know ozz don't
think you all it get-get will I am on
because I bet he would do it well I am
with definitely me down with that this
is worse than the idea of conflicts in
today of using one web browser on this
so that is one web browser for work and
one fun oh that's right well ya know I
do that I I have two browsers open all
the time I can't do it i think i think
safari still does open in a new window
above opening a new tab on the right
click menu something like that it's like
these the small little browser things
that just annoying pest me so that's why
71 browser and we should all stick with
one device and these companies should
just get there something something
together and make a cohesive OS well if
you're an AT&amp;amp;T customer you're gonna be
sticking with one device a little bit
longer now really you're gonna try and
fit in all the other topics we have no i
just want to plan okay he generally my
skin because you know agt announced on
Sunday no less the day before WWDC that
it to like verizon was going to be
dropping its 20-month upgrade cycle and
extending it to 24 months so now you
have to wait a full two years before you
can upgrade your phone and get a full
discount on it and which is fine it's
kind of expected to happen because
verizon did it and anything verizon does
ATT has to do as well because it's
monkey see monkey do but just the fact
that they have the gall to announce it
on a sunday afternoon the day before
WWDC and everything that's happening at
e3 just knowing that this news was going
to get there
and steamrolled by a billion things
happening the next day it's just like so
typically ATT that it drives me nuts I
mean this is such an AT&amp;amp;T move that I
actually like it wasn't even news to me
I was just like oh I thought that was
already the case you know we need to do
actually no I'm not gonna I'm not going
to give this idea way but I have an idea
and I'm gonna do it it's gonna be
amazing so you already gave away your
best idea of the podcast which was the
yes or Pogo attached to this for to a
pogo stick fun for kids everywhere I
like it yeah now you can browse reddit
while your pogo sticking actually you
guys probably discussed this though wait
wait wait wait wait galaxy s4 galaxy s4
take two galaxies horse it put him
together so like when one dies you can
just flip it around yes exactly
brilliant brilliant you should win a
freaking nobel peace prize for that idea
I should win a galaxy s4 Nobel yeah
dieter can you just take your mic and
just drop it yeah actually you know it's
permanently attached to my desk oh you
know what we we just got a tweet about
something that we do need to talk about
which is FaceTime audio which is
actually a big deal yeah you want to
know who hasn't replied to my request
for a statement asking if they're going
to do anything weird with FaceTime audio
gee I wonder I wonder who could that be
I'm just saying I say you gotta ask how
you're gonna lau it right you're not
gonna block out on any of your plans or
you know data networks or anything and I
have gotten an answer usually I get
something right away but not this time
it's interesting isn't it hmm maybe
it'll be announced on like a Sunday
afternoon the day before you know we're
expecting the iphone 5s peanuts so
FaceTime audio is one of those things
where it's like yeah that should have
been there and I'm happy for it and I
don't know if it changes things because
facetime still feels I'm wondering a
facetime and imessage are going to feel
better integrated to each other than
they do now when is it is race time
going to be opened up like
promised oh so many years ago won't
happen but I do we know the details on
the FaceTime audio is it limited to
Wi-Fi do they say that or does it I
thought what I already gave any details
now but not really regular what do you
want tuna not limited to Wi-Fi so right
I I definitely like the idea of like
being seated at my computer and you know
say I need to talk to dieter for like
five seconds uh like you know just being
able to like FaceTime audio him like me
on my computer him on his phone like
yeah it's a beautiful thing and it's
easier than the sky and it's ironically
what Google kind of broke with hangouts
because you used to do that very easily
with google voice on your computer yeah
I don't know why like hangouts not
having a an audio option is annoying
like you can't allegedly coming right
yeah it's well yeah and you can do it
now on the phone but you gotta like dig
through a menu to get to it so actually
I have a confession to make here and
when we start to talk about
communication services like actual
communication services would actually
human beings on the other end I start to
get bored and sleepy because I don't do
all that much of it with these phones
and the plan i was going to raise which
again you probably discussed on last
week's podcast was the galaxy s4 Z is
completely uninteresting to me but this
nokia windows phone with a 41-megapixel
sensor and all that 808 PureView
goodness that is a phone i'm actually
excited and extremely interested in it
looks huge from the leap from the leaked
pictures it looks thinner than the 80 80
really enjoyed a dude a connection of
the leaked screenshots for the next
version of Windows Phone right it looks
like no real Notification Center like
intriguing yeah oh yeah let's hope yeah
but we've I mean we've heard time and
time again from various sources that
we're not going to see a new cut of
Windows Phone I mean we'll see these
so-called GDR releases which are the
interim builds but we're not going to
see a real new version of Windows Phone
2013 so whatever we're seeing in these
screenshots just push out your mind for
another 6 plus
what yep it's not coming this year ready
yeah all right thanks for nothing a
video that was a chicago-style rain on
your parade boom look at that what does
it even mean I don't know what
chicago-style rain rain means you're
just making I don't know man mean
whatever kind of sucks in chicago right
your face kind of sucks look Vlad what
what what I wanted to say is that well
two things 1i think this phone looks
really wide which is it runs totally
counter to your philosophy of how of how
a phone should feel an and and two I do
think there's a possibility as phone
will launch this year it's just not not
gonna have a new version of Windows
Phone do you mean thick rather than wide
no i mean like it looks I don't know
like it from the pictures it looks like
wide like it definitely looks bigger
than like a 928 like likewise so it's
hard to use one handed yeah that's a
fair point but my thinking was it was
kind of to be expected a nokia will take
the 808 technology the 808 PureView
technology and kind of shrink it down to
some degree given that it's at a year
since then and that seems to be what
this device is shaping up to look like
and I think if you're gonna get a really
high quality sensor really high quality
lens optical stabilization all those
other fancy and actually useful not just
give me keep it useful tricks than okay
asserted into the 808 I mean uh
basically it's a trade-off but it's one
that I could see a lot of people making
because gaseous for zoom to me is just
an unholy alliance of two annoying pesky
yes your product think that galaxies
your system is gonna be your phone then
get out of my face go away but like
right this is all gonna do wrong because
I was like I would actually make it make
it be like a phone it doesn't look at
that much thicker yeah if I if I really
really wanted that camera and I was I
knew I'd be carrying it with me
everywhere then yeah it's like it's
actually really intriguing I think it's
cool
that's point yeah that's what and trust
me I've used the 808 PureView with
gassiness as a combo it's really
annoying to carry two phones around so
if you have an 808 PureView with a
usable operating system and come on
Microsoft let's have this notification
center before the end of the year please
and then is great you know yes he's got
a big bump and okay if it's really wide
I'll just have to learn to stretch my
hand out a bit more or have a big person
hire a big person to just carry the
phone around for me you know whatever
you know it's it's a trail if you make
but ultimately it's a smaller trade-off
then you have to carry around a
smartphone and a camera you can you know
rely on and enjoy and I've been
disappointed with cameras I mean I
really think the pause well the current
generation of latest hardware the galaxy
s4 in FM five and not the best cameras
that either companies produced mm-hmm
not so see more apple and they're not
really stepping forward awaiting I
survived is definitely the best camera
that's been on an iphone oh yeah I'm
sorry I thought your dog wasn't here the
other but yeah like maybe not like
relative to the other times like the
iphone 4 cam yeah so far ahead of
another thing that's what I'm try to say
yeah anyway uh we've been doing at this
hour a half i'm calling it a show
because ok see you later man yeah you
got to take this and buy you guys I mean
the listeners and the Watchers also the
guys that were on the podcast you should
follow them on twitter vlad vlad savov
