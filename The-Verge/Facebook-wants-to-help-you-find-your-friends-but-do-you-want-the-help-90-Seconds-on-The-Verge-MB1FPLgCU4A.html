Facebook wants to help you track down
those jerks I'm Ross Miller and this is
90 seconds on the verge Facebook today
has begun rolling out a new opt-in
feature for iOS and Android called
nearby friends which as the name
suggests is all about seeing which of
your friends are close by this kind of
social discovery is far from a new idea
in fact several years ago it was
something of a trend with apps like
highlight sonar and glance II they
didn't catch on one reason was
technology more specifically battery
life
that's a simpler thing to fix and one
that Facebook believes will not be an
issue this time the bigger issue however
was social people don't wanna share
their exact locations because well it's
creepy that's why nearby friends is
instead focusing on approximate
locations like neighborhoods the users
can then choose to share the precise
location with a specific friend after a
few clicks nearby friend is a bit of a
change in strategy for Facebook which
has lately been breaking its services
apart into standalone apps like paper
for news and messenger for chat Facebook
clearly thinks that this is a defining
feature but it's also conflicted about
how exactly to integrated and that
confusion echoes Facebook's larger
problem it isn't just the nearby part
that's concern is also Facebook's very
broad definition of friends facebook
also seems to know this and has designed
nearby friends with curated lists in
mind ok so let's say you do activate
nearby friends you curate a list you get
all your buddies to do the same a day
today do you really want an app actively
tracking your location every 15 minutes
