this is kind of an abandoned it's not
abandoned it's a very empty building in
Brooklyn yeah the building is actually
an old tire factory area needs a lot of
power bandwidth it's a good spot for us
can you just set a very high level
describe what area is it's the first
company that's figured out a way of
creating an alternative for consumers
outside of the cable bundle the cable
package for live television you've got
really small antennas how have you
managed to make those antennas provide
reliable service and switch them from
user user reliably that's um having to
be huge basically first and foremost but
typical ATSC antenna is designed to look
at all parts of the spectrum at the same
time since ours is a switch system
meaning that consumer says I'm
interested in watching ABC all of the
channels are essentially six megahertz
wide so the area antennas are soft
antennas in the sense their
characteristics change depending on what
channel you're looking at you said they
were how many incentives are there on
each of those little boards you're
showing us so each board carries 160
antennas okay and then how many boards
how many people can you support from
here that room that you saw is capable
of serving several hundred thousand
seven hundred seven hundred thousand
consistent average
it's come to area whether or not you
guys wanted it or liked it
the idea of area is this life is
literally an upstart company that's
taking on the cable giants exists
they've been in court you've been
fighting the fight do you think of
yourselves as renegades in that way
areas so not I mean we spend so much
time money resources in trying to figure
out how to comply with the law right so
that that's not renegade that's like the
most compliant child in the room who is
going through contortions to figure out
how to comply there's all kinds of cable
channels you can't get over the
over-the-air right so if eventually your
customers start demanding
MTV or AMC or HBO the way that you would
provide them is by doing license deals
not building thousands of titles you
know I'm not sure of what is going to
happen I would rather focus on making
the customer base that understands the
value proposition which is you know for
ten percent of the price you get fifty
percent of the value out of the large
bundle and then you have a myriad of
other options whether you rent movies
from itunes whether you have Netflix for
a lot of library shows a lot of cable
shows end up on Netflix I would rather
serve those people than to go recreate
the cable bundle because I just
personally as a consumer I've never find
appropriate balance of value and price
in that and I don't think that's the
future I think the future is a smaller
number of what I call skinny live and
deep libraries people like on-demand
they like to be ability to say I'm
interested in four of these episodes I'm
gonna watch him back-to-back and you
know I got six hours to kill and that's
what I'm gonna do
what's the next step prayer I mean
what's interesting to me is that it
really does seem like if you're going if
your goal isn't to recreate the
traditional cable model on the trishul
bundle and company where you are
recreating is your the company people
will buy live video from what's the next
step along that path for you I don't
know yet I think it's too early
here's the one thing that I more and
more a sort of concluded if you can put
the consumer in the forefront and say
I'm willing to forego everything else
for this particular customer or these
sets of customers you're gonna win
you're absolutely going to win no
irrespective of what they call you or
don't call it you're gonna win the
system is set up that nobody cares about
these customers it's purely about
creating more and more profits for the
companies and I think that's just it may
be right for them but it creates an
opportunities for guys like me to come
in and say if I pick that guy and I just
support them and I just support them to
the nth degree I'll win he'll make sure
I went but so I want a net like if you
prove this model works and you prove
that there's consumer demand of this
product and you prove that the legal
precedent for this product need to be
allowed is there what happens when
Comcast builds a datacenter with
thousands of tiny little antennas and
says hey Xfinity customers you know
watch it on your smartphone how do you
compete with that I mean this is exactly
what happened to Tina the the biggest
issue you know that the sacred cow in
the mix of all of this thing of the
bundle the question is when is the that
go away and individuals have the ability
to pick and choose the question I have
is when you're in that world the best
technology the best experience is going
to win and I think I've got a shot at
that I like my chances</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
