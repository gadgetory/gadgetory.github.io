pierce that's the wii u and this is 90
seconds on the verge Apple's new iPads
are now available with LTE AT&amp;amp;T Sprint
and Verizon have all confirmed they'll
be carrying both the ipad mini and the
fourth-generation retina iPad you can
also buy from apple directly though it's
still quoting a two-week shipping delay
the ipad mini with LTE starts at four
hundred and fifty nine dollars that's
130 dollars more than the Wi-Fi only
version take it from me though it's
worth it and now for another chapter in
space but scientists have discovered
what might be the farthest known
galaxies in the universe galaxies ma cs0
you know what let's call it Susan galaxy
Susan is estimated to be about thirteen
point three billion light-years away
since our universe is said to be just
13.7 billion years old that faint red
light may offer a glimpse of life the
universe and everything back when we
were just a baby 420 million years old
finally Sonia is celebrating 70 million
PlayStation 3 console sold that more or
less exactly matches the figure set by
the xbox 360 which microsoft said past
the 70 million mark last quarter it's
quite an achievement for Sony especially
since the ps3 had a less than stellar
launch Sony's milestone comes just two
days before nintendo's new Wii U console
hits the market and of course Sony and
Microsoft are rumored to have consoles
coming next year so things might change
quickly that's it for today's top
stories tune in tomorrow but to be
honest we won't be here I'll be here Roz
