4s as a green car but it actually is in
more than one way Green ez'n goes really
fast like zero to 60 and 3.8 seconds top
speed 188 miles per hour in a 420
horsepower engine that's brand-new for
the 2017 model year but in order to have
that you have to opt for the PDK sport
chrono package which makes this a real
beast on the road but it also makes it
much more fuel-efficient Porsche has
improved fuel efficiency on this car and
the best place to drive it of course is
the track the targa 4s is actually a
convertible that you can have a little
bit of fun with the top goes up and down
in 20 seconds at a speed of 31 miles per
hour you'll have to wait to spring to
get this car comes out in April and the
starting price is 120 two thousand
dollars if you've got that around I
envision that you'll have some fun at
the track this spring so you might
notice the new wheel package on this car
the spider RS wheels but it also has an
entirely new front fascia of course we
recognize the iconic shape of the
Porsche the first 911 came to market in
1963 but what matters about Portia is
really in the details and this is where
we see the height of German engineering
working really hard to improve I like
the nuance proportions here but the most
important is that you can go really fast
and I think that this is a car that you
can put the top up and joy in the road
in four different driving modes but then
you can go to the track and that's when
you can really see what this baby can do</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
