we're here at Lenovo tech world we're
checking out the the new Moto Z moto
mods so basically these are these
attachments that you can slip right on
the back of the phone and what we have
here in particular actually is a moto
mod Developer Kit this is a reference
moto mod meaning we can design things
that go right in here and they do
various different things so the first
one we have here is actually just a
display that can go on the back of your
phone it can mirror whatever's on the
front of the phone on the actual phone
display this whole unit just goes on to
the back of the phone using magnets see
that red light means it clipped in now
we go on the front that animation means
it's all it's all working correctly we
just open up this thing here click on
display via mod and just put something
on the back of the phone like this thing
right here turn it over and now it's
mirroring right here on this display
right here on the circle now there's not
a lot of applications for this right now
it's just kind of a proof-of-concept to
show what you can do with this
development kit this moto mod kind of
reference design but there's tons of
applications you can imagine you know
putting any kind of any kind of image on
the back here or having some of that you
can maybe even interact with using a
touchscreen or a flip up screen
something like that really the the
opportunities here pretty endless and
that's kind of what Motorola has been
going for is this this idea of
customizing your phone and letting
developers kind of customize it for you
give you new things to try out more than
just you know aesthetic backplates
things like that so this next one we
have here is a simple LED light moto Bob
so right now this is just a prototype
mod this isn't something you can go
online and buy unlike these other mods
here that are like a battery pack or a
backplate those those you will be able
to buy with the Moto Z so right now this
is just kind of a cool proof of concept
but down the line motorola hopes that
these things will be easily available
developers will make them make them
available on the moto maker website and
you'll be able to purchase them for
yourself for more videos like this check
