what we're looking at here is the pair
of zeke 2 point 0 which is released last
year actually something we reviewed on
this is my next this however is their
new thing Perseus the parrot Zeke sport
there's actually less than a third the
weight what you're looking at here is a
prototype but it should look like this
when it comes out later this year now
what you have of course because it Zeke
sport is all the features of z2 minus
NFC musique sport has a lot of sensors
that are kind of tracking your run what
we're looking at is a mock-up app of
what you'll see later this year things
that you'll see that tracks is vertical
oscillation how much you're running a
kind of up and down ground contact time
that includes or if you're stressing
your left foot your right foot more
obviously your heart rate is going to be
here and of course the big thing for
when you're running is actually how much
noise calculation actually works so
right now if we move it I'll lay up I
won't build hear anything wearing these
but if I move it to street mode it
actually works in reverse and I'll
actually be able to hear all the cars
passing by me as I'm running through the
street and it's actually very
comfortable you tell me how it looks
I'll let you decide on that one again
the parent Zeke sport is coming out
later this year the price they haven't
really told us yet but if you want to
see more CES stuff and all the future
technology and health and wearables and
audio and all that technol check out the
verge youtube channel subscribe and
you'll get to see all of it as soon as
we put it up which is blazingly fast
that's the future folks</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
