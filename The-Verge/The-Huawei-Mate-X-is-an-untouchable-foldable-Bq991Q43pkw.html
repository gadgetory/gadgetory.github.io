we're here at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona,
and we've just taken a
look at Huawei's Mate X.
Its first foldable phone,
a competitor to Samsung's Galaxy Fold,
and it's one of the most exciting devices
we're gonna see this show.
I do say see, because none of
us got a chance to touch it,
so let's have a look at it,
and I'll tell you what
we know about it so far.
So the big difference between the Mate X
and the Galaxy Fold is pretty obvious,
the Galaxy Fold folds inwards,
the screen is on the inside,
whereas with the Mate X
it wraps around the outside of the device.
When you have the screen on the inside,
you have to be aware about it freezing,
so you do have to have a radius
on the inside of the hinge.
Now when the screen is on the outside,
that radius is already
integrated into it so the actual
device can pretty much fold flat,
and that's what the Mate X does.
But in terms of holding it in your hand,
when the person was demoing it,
it just looks much more natural,
it looks also a more
robust and durable device.
Huawei's demo person,
he held it pretty much
within reach of myself
so I could see it up close,
he handled it super casually,
it wasn't like one of those
super fragile prototypes
where you're tenderly
opening and closing it.
It almost feels like an
expanded smart phone.
You really stretched out a smartphone,
and then you decided, you
know what, we'll just fold it.
So to me that says we're
talking about a device
that is really much
closer to a retail product
than pretty much any other
foldable device we've seen.
Hopefully, at some point during the MWC
somebody will let me touch it,
so I can speak about how it feels,
and whether it's as light as it looks.
And that's the other thing with
the Mate X, it's super thin.
It's got a 5.4 millimeters of thickness
across most of the device,
and then it has little bump
which I consider pretty much a grip,
which makes it 11 millimeters.
And that grip also
integrates with the cameras,
it has a USB C charging port,
which also brings to mind,
there's no headphone jack.
As far as I've seen, no headphone jack.
It matches the Galaxy
Fold, what can we do,
the future has no headphone
jacks in it apparently.
Anyway, that's not the important thing,
the important thing is
how the thing functions.
You have an eight inch display
when the tablet is fully open,
and when you close it
up, you have a 6.6 inch.
Pretty much a regular
smartphone on the main display,
and then you have a 6.4 inch
really tall display on the back,
because that's sitting
right next to the grip
with the camera stuff.
Then you have the rear one
which helps you with taking
selfies with the main camera,
if you wanna take a photo of somebody
and you want them to see
you taking their photo,
you can do that.
You have screen mirroring.
And then again you have
the eight inch tablet,
which is almost a square.
It's an eight by 7.1 aspect ratio.
I don't know why Huawei
couldn't just make it
a little bit wider and
give us a perfect square,
that would have been just
the magical Instagram device.
So Huawei's keeping
quite a few of the specs
under wraps for now,
but I'll tell you what we do know.
Firstly the processor is the Kirin 980,
and there's also a 5G modem in there,
the Balong 5000, I love that name.
Both of them are built on
seven nanometer process,
so it's about as advanced
as Huawei can give you,
both of them are from Huawei itself.
There's also 4500
milliamp-hour battery in there.
Huawei's also upgraded
its charging to 55 watts,
which is kind of intense
for a pocketable device.
That means 85% charge in 30 minutes.
Again, with such a large
battery it's super impressive.
No wireless charging that I know of,
but y'know by that point
we're really talking wishlist items.
In terms of practicalities
there's a fingerprint sensor integrated
into the power button on the side.
So this is our first, very
fleeting, very complete look,
at a Huawei Mate X.
What I will say is that,
having handled the Royal Flexpai at CES,
having seen as much as you can see
of the Samsung Galaxy
Fold earlier this week,
and now having come close
to the Huawei Mate X,
I think this is by far
the most complete concept.
It's not even a concept anymore,
it really seems like a retail product,
something that's ready to go on shelves,
and be put into people's hands, y'know.
Huawei is going to have to
figure out the software.
It's doing some side-by-side
multitasking with apps.
It needs to figure out
how to make the screens turn on and off
when you want to use just
the smartphone section,
just the tablet section etc.
So there's still so
many questions with it,
but I do feel like,
this is the closest we've come
to producing a foldable device
that is really just ready to go on sale,
and for people to use, and
to actually enjoy using.
I do adverts.
For more news, gadgets, smartphones,
5G, cameras, etc. coming out
of Mobile World Congress,
stay tune to theverge.com
and youtube.com/theverge.
Can't promise you that all of it
will be as exciting as the Mate X,
but we'll try and get
our hands on this thing
and bring it to you.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
