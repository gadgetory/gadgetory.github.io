we're at CES 2014 checking out the new
Ekso bionics exoskeleton tell us your
name Paul Thacker Paul great to meet you
what do you have here for us today well
I have basically a wearable robot it's
Ekso bionics wearable exosuit so I'm a
paraplegic I have no use of my legs at
all so I normally on a normal day I'm
cruising around in a wheelchair but on
days like today I'm lucky enough to
strap this baby on and I get to cruise
around how did you wind up with this
with this suit what tell us a little bit
about you know how that came to be well
I'm a professional snowmobiler by trade
and about just a little over three years
ago I had a training accident that left
me without the use of my legs so you
know I was fortunate enough shortly
thereafter to get hooked up with XO
bionics and here we are today and what
does this allow you to do aside from the
obvious of standing walking around what
does it mean for you to be standing up
and have the mobility that you lost well
I mean it's it's something that it's
hard to put into words obviously you
don't really realise the things that you
know you take for granted until they're
taken away and the fact that we're
having this conversation I to eye and
face to face that's you know that was
taken away so you know I mean there's
there's a list as long as you know this
arm as this building of things that you
know I get to do on a regular basis
standing and you know it's just an
incredible piece of technology and I
heard that you're actually still
snowboarding and you're good excuse me
it's not a snowmobiling and you're yeah
and you're gonna be going to the X Games
in two weeks is that right yeah the 23rd
for the 26th I'll be competing actually
the last day of winter X this year in
Aspen so you know X Games and ESPN are
are cool enough to have an adaptive snow
cross for us guys that have you know
banged ourselves up so it's an amazing
opportunity to get to compete again
obviously I did that before I got hurt
and it's cool to be able to do it after
and they don't let this into the
competition unfortunately yet do they
you know I've been trying to get EXO to
build me a suit that I can ride my
snowmobile with that we're not quite
there yet you know maybe in the near
future but no not this
did you ever think when you've got hurt
I mean that's obviously you know a
really serious incident life-changing
incident did you ever think that you
would be able to find a piece of
technology that would allow enable you
to do what you're doing here today you
know i mean i i'm i'm a optimist always
have been so i never have lost hope that
i'm gonna be able to walk again i have
to be careful what I wish for obviously
anyone in my position when you first get
hurt your first instinct is to you know
wish and pray for being able to walk
again
well that's happened now so now I have
to kind of change what I wish for and
now I want to be able to walk again
under my own power and you know
hopefully this type of technology will
help me get to that point great thank
you so much it's been great to talk to
you and best of luck in the X Games
we'll be rooting for you
take care
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
