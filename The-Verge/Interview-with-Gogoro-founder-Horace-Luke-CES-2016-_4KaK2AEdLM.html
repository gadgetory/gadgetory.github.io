here at CES 2016 I'm flat Sabbath and
i'm joined by Horus loose from Kogoro
you're the chief co-founder the CEO the
everything of the company and so you
have a bit of news to share with us here
at CES well as you know go-girl is both
a product and a vision you know gogoro
is a high performance electric scooter
that along with the go-girl
energy network allows our customers to
swap and go in the city anytime they you
know they want and of course with the
climate change and the pollution issues
that we're facing today and also with
traffic congestion we're seeing in
cities you know evie especially
two-wheel electric vehicle it's gonna
play an instrumental role in to making
our lives better for the tomorrow but
there comes a challenge in how people
would be able to actually you know adopt
a electric vehicle for example the city
that actually gogoro is in in taipei
about 80% of people in taipei don't have
access to parking and when they do have
access to parking it is not a private
parking but off public parking that
makes charging a vehicle an absolute you
know I would say a non-starter and in
2015 we've made a lot of progress
launching our first pilot city of course
in in in August back in you know back in
Taipei and up to today we have made some
significant I would say adoption we've
now shipped over 4,000 vehicles we have
about 145 go stations around Taipei and
we just recorded 3.5 million
all-electric kilometer that of course
you know reduce pollution by 95% and the
really big news that we announced to CES
this year is what we call the go-girl
open initiative and open stands for
owner proposed energy network think of
it as crowdsource plus a little bit of
Airbnb plus a little bit of you know
kind of kind of homegrown the network
both from a community of people that
really celebrate and understand and
wants to be part of this change at the
same time you know really help us
understand exactly you know we can guess
which city but guessing is guessing but
if you see a lot of hands with your
hands raised man
cities that we gotta go to next because
we just simply demand they're the new go
charge of the ear now switch is a more
compact version of the go station which
is your main charging charging and
battery exchange stations do you think
that will help you get into smaller
cities like you said not so much mega
cities but you know small and more
targeted locations I think the main
thing behind the go charger is to really
accelerate our rate of deployment if you
look at you know 140 stations that we
now have in Taipei you know it's a
really densely deployed solution every
1.3 kilometer or about slightly over
half a mile we have a station but that
did take time it took about four months
five months we can deploy at an amazing
rate of one station per day but imagine
that I can deploy in a city within a day
or two with a hundred stations that
allows people to basically go and not
have to worry we're gonna have to charge
just stop by a cafe have a cup of coffee
pop off your battery go to the you know
go on your way for the rest of the day
that's the vision we see and that will
help us deploy into all sorts of cities
absolutely and so far you've rolled out
your pilot city was Taipei home city
you've had quite a bit of success there
it's been very well received
you also have that really impressive
gogoro experience store which looks to
be very much modeled on the Apple Store
its simplicity and just give things you
know it's basic and all about the device
as possible Amsterdam is your next
destination yes when is that going to
happen we're gonna actually deploy the
retail store and also deploy the energy
network first half of this year
so within the next six months and what
cities are going to follow Amsterdam do
you have some sort of an idea when of
course next year we have an idea you can
share with us I think it's you know into
time will will will law announce the
right you know that city what I can
share with you is that the vehicle is
now European certified so any any cities
in Europe in the neighboring countries
is really an accessible
target for us well in any case you've
had a lot of success already I want to
thank you on behalf of the verge for
validating us and giving you the best of
CES 2015 award we looking forward to
everything that you guys do in the year
and in the new year and the one to come
so see you again probably before CS 2017
right absolutely more gogoro news before
their absolutely and I think you know if
I can leave everybody with one thought
you know we are facing a huge crisis the
you know the biggest crisis the earth
has ever seen you know with climate
change with pollution with you know
population there's moving from villages
into cities and and and expanding you
know I would say demand on energy like
never seen before we need to find a
solution and what's amazing is that
go-girl has a solution is here and now
and ready you know if you look at the
impact we've made to Taipei it's
significant the amount of kilometers
that was accumulated over the last three
months equal to about one hundred ninety
seven tons less of co2 footprint you
know the Hat in itself you think about
it it took a mountain impact we can make
if we all go electric on transportation
I can only imagine what that what life
would be like and how you know how how
good of a quality life we can have
especially in these emerging cities
across the world if you've been to
Beijing if you've been to Shanghai if
you've been to Taipei if you've been to
South it is you know Southeast Asia have
you been to London you know those are
cities are they're extremely polluted
today yeah so London of course you know
as is the worst of unfortunately is one
of the worst in the in the you at the
moment Horace please fix it yes we will
absolutely want to do that and we think
you know that's that's back you you know
you asked me earlier about breakfast you
know why you know why a quarter you know
quarter of an egg can get me a half an
egg get me through this it's the idea of
changing the world for the better
it's the idea of applying all the
creativity we have ever done on
smartphone on connectivity on software
and applying that to a sector that
desperately needs it energy in
transportation something real-world
problems service yeah serving the world
thank you very much free time Horace
thank you that's it from the ver CES
lounge I think I've got out right this
time for now stay tuned for more and
