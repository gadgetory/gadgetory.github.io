back to the edge of the galaxy and
Beyond in halo nightfall a live-action
digital series produced by none other
than legendary sci-fi director Ridley
Scott the series will star the newly
minted Spartan soldier agent Jameson
Locke Locke is a big deal while details
surrounding his character are thin we do
know he'll be playable in Halo 5 making
him a major new human face for the
series going north on G he's played by
actor Mike Colter who you may have seen
in men in black 3 and The Good Wife and
I got to sit down with him to talk about
the role so Mike pleasure to have you
here
just gonna get right to it you're
basically the new face of Halo Master
Chief we've never seen his face the
arbiter who played him but he was an
alien what's it like to be the first
human face that players are actually
engaging with and what's the
expectations party man what appeal to me
about the project was that they're
approaching it from a cinematic
standpoint of having a film and then
following the film character into the
game world and I felt like for me as an
actor that was what was appealing you
know you get to create a character who
has you know the nuances of all the the
richness of a human quality that you've
been put into the game and so hopefully
the fans and the gamers will connect to
that and then they will I guess just
have a better gaming experience because
of it well starting with the show first
I mean you're working with really Scott
executive producer what's it like
working with him as he hands on or you
know it's funny because this his
production company is called Scott free
and I think it I think it really does
does relate to how he approaches it I
mean it has got free I mean he is you
know he does keep his finger on the
pulse he's very involved as far as the
the creative aspect of it you know when
you're on a pre-production you can tell
I mean it's called equality there's a
lot of nuances to the film I think
people gonna appreciate it I think
you'll see a little Blade Runner feel to
it you see a little alien feel to it it
predator I mean it has a little bit of
all of those things kind of combined
visually when I first saw some of the
daily rushes I looked at and I thought
wow this reminds me like children of men
which cinematically III really thought
that was kind of cool so it looks you
know looks you guys as far as the game
is concerned I mean you said motion
capture and like your faces actually in
the game yeah you were in the whole suit
the full ball suit yeah yeah and there
are no cameras a lot on set when that's
going on because I don't want anybody to
see me run around the suit it is quite
comfortable though it's kind of like
going to bed but you're not yeah it's
kind of like that it's it's meticulous
and as tedious process we did the
scanning for my facial imagery we did
that for about three hours I mean I'll
say about 30-40 cameras you know
position just so so that I'm missing
anything you said then you make every
facial expression known to man
what's the wildest expression that you
had to make like in that process I think
it was something like oh well there's an
expression I couldn't do like it the
flare your nostrils I can't let my
nostrils and slate flare my nostrils
mine I'm so glad I can't do because I'm
like I don't want you to have that as a
possibility and then the one where you
open your mouth as wide as you can yeah
that I'm not gonna do that now yeah you
open your mouth as wide as you can for
some reason so then they'll use that and
there'll be certain scenes obviously in
certain levels of the game and where my
character will be interacting with
another character you know as an actor
but I have to first do the technical
aspect so I'm yeah I'm pretty a pretty
company psyched about that having my
face in a video game like that and
having my own action figure that's
that's also something that's appealing
you know everyone should have their own
action figure everyone should have their
own action figure yeah have you seen the
action figure yet I mean I'm seeing
other people's action figures and I'm
assuming that they're gonna do a pretty
good job because I I mean they tend to
look a little better than the person
actually so you know me having a bald
head I'm sure it's gonna be nice and
smooth yes shiny shiny bald head that'll
be fun but I haven't seen it yet I mean
I have to ask what is like the heart and
soul of like this character like what
makes him tick well you know he's a
pragmatist he's very logical but he
basically it's it's the mission the
mission is what is what drives him I
mean he does have doubts about things
and and and especially in battle
especially when your life is at stake in
which a lot of that it's gonna you know
you're gonna see that because we're on a
planet that basically the stakes are
raised we have a time element we have to
get off the planet a matter of hours
otherwise we'll all die from the heat
the halo ring gets past them excessive
three four hundred degrees and we're
talking about death immediately so
honestly locker the kind of guy that
would give his life for the mission and
for his his colleagues he would he would
die for them and he would die for the
mission and that's something you just
don't see very often nowadays that's
something that I like about him because
that's not me you
butt-ass the defense I mean I would not
die for the mission so I like I like
acting and doing things that are
completely out of the box for me
yeah so like you took this role and like
you know strong black character like
what is the diversity equation like in
this series it was weird about it you
know I pride myself in approaching all
the work the same you know I'm kind of
colorblind in a sense even in America
2014 Google in color blind how can you
be it's pretty hard still but I just I
just look at the work is always being
you know it's just the material and if
I'm able to play and they if they're
able to see me in the character then
then what they'll happen to have as a
black guy who has a bald head who seeks
for three and all these things will just
be you know just a happenstance or just
you know just randomness but when I read
it I felt like I've come across
character and I felt like it could go
any color but you know there's something
innate about it there's something
there's an equality about it there's
something you can't put your finger on
whatever it was they saw that with me
but um and so hopefully you know
hopefully people when they look at it
the first thing they won't notice is
that he's a black guy because it's just
four hundred ahead of time so I mean I
don't think anybody's gonna be thinking
about that four hundred years I think we
probably you know I hope we pass that
point or maybe I'm the only black man
left but hopefully hopefully not well
you said that you're not the biggest
gamer I'm gonna hold you to that so how
much halo have you actually played very
little very little I mean honestly I I
just I just picked up a joystick at the
Xbox Microsoft headquarters so they have
a huge screen in there and they showed
me a lot of the stuff as it was raw
footage as they were building the game
and so I got to experience it on a
really intense level you know 3d with
huge speakers and stuff and and I can
see why they do what they do because you
sit there all day long and you're in
this room and you're surrounded by you
know these all this technology and
you're basically creating you know a
game and I just look forward to seeing
the finished product and I hope
everybody is pleased with it um it'll be
out in November and it's available on
Xbox one and to anyone who buys the
Master Chief collection so look forward
to it thanks for coming up man Thank You
Man Thanks
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
