at computex taipei 2013 I will gain
Easter's new mainstream laptop the acer
aspire s3 which is just announced
yesterday it's a windows 8 laptop with a
touchscreen and of course and we saw
yesterday visit first time I've seen it
on it's running a new Intel Haswell
processor we all know the actual
specification but we're told that it's
going to be available in a4a three four
and five or more i7 later this year in
q3 the display is 1080p IPS that's what
we're told but it's actually not a very
good display it doesn't look good it's
washed out and the viewing angles are
not great at all otherwise that it has
an attractive design it uses a gorilla
glass back much like the nicer at seven
it's going to be available in a few
colors red and yellow and possibly some
more has a chiclet keyboard that's
pretty comfortable with backlit and
overall design is pretty good it's got a
hard drive in here so it's a little bit
thicker it's point 7 inches thick and it
weighs over three and a half pounds but
as a 13-inch 13.3 inch machine with
discrete graphics might be a pretty good
option when it comes out later this year
now we're looking at the acer aspire s7
which is an update to one of our
favorite ultrabooks from last year the
body is basically the same it's got a
touch screen and a gorilla glass back
display backlit excuse me
it has a they've addressed some of the
issues that we've had with the previous
version they've increased the battery
life it's now got a 6280 milliamp hour
battery which is a pretty significant
increase and it's the big update is as
running intel's new Haswell processors
to be available with 4 i5 and core i7
chips and that's going to give increased
battery life and increased performance
for this uses integrated graphics the
process that's on here right now is a
core i7 4500 you ultra low voltage with
1.8 giga hertz overclocks to 2.4
performance seems perfectly fine so far
we haven't tested regular rigorously we
all have too much information on
availability but we're told that it will
be about the same price as the previous
generation which is available at e3 1299
and should be out in q3 one of the most
interesting updates that they've done is
they're offering a super high resolution
2560 x 1440 panel they don't have one
available here but we're told it should
be out maybe in q4 it's possible when it
becomes the United States where maybe
like a five-hundred-dollar price premium
the display here is high quality viewing
angles look good it's well saturated
yeah that's the acer aspire s7
