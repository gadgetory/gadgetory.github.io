google hangout of small empires this
episode was about vimeo and we are
wonderfully joined by some of the vimeo
team here and obviously as well as
stephen Kirk and Alexis you guys know
very well by this point so we have
Andrew and Andrea from the vimeo team
and you guys can introduce yourselves
and obviously talk about vimeo and what
you guys do for the company uh yeah sure
so I'm Andrew Pyle I'm the CTO of your
video um and I'm Andrea Allen I'm the
director of video production at Vanina
so why don't you talk about vanilla oh
sure yeah so Vimeo is a big-ish video
sharing website um we've been doing this
for about 10 years it's changed quite a
bit over that time and i think you know
at the time of this video on the small
Empire Sigma shot um you know we're a
little over a hundred sixty people we're
here in New York is 2014 um and we're
just about to go into the holidays yeah
so everybody's taking a big big side
relief oh well it's not a yeah yeah
today o people are pretty psyched today
because it's like our holiday party
tonight and we just we showed the video
from the whole company and people are
pretty into it so yeah there's a lot of
like the mio nationalism going around
the office ready we're ready to get
turnt and Vimeo knows how to get turnt
for sure ok wait speaking of vimeo
nationalism do you got what is the story
behind the pizza flag and agents Oh
piece of my best chris christie i can
who's one of our copywriters and there's
i think there's a well i think everyone
at Vimeo a pizza fan and for a while
there or not we don't want you getting
your not allowed and out but there's
this big joke every time you know we
would go off a pizza or people dealing w
want pizza and it just got to be this
like running joke in the office that
pizza is the best thing ever and we
started doing things like drinking there
was a pizza beer I think that
passed around at one point seven mark
thing that was a mark thing there's just
a pizza culture is a alive and well here
at Vimeo and we decided but I think
Chris decided we needed to have a pledge
to the pizza flag and he wrote it up and
it's beautiful yeah we should give mark
a shout out yeah yeah mark 4 platoon a
look mark mark but don't put that in
your mouth we've got this guy works here
yes I minima team and he brings in
special guests this could be people who
work at Vimeo or just people on who are
from Vimeo community and he finds the
craziest stuff online buys it and then
they eat it together and they films it
and it's it's and thanks like a billion
puts it up onto the airships you find in
the back of like the Chinese bakery yeah
you know cartoon rabbits on them and
you're like what is this then you eat it
it's like I don't know some fruit that
you've never heard of like yeah yeah
yeah like pizza flavored beer once yeah
octopus chips there's I mean it was
broken mechanic wait one of them is
called eating meat in a bag from the
garbage haha are you serious I oh yeah
where is this I'm gonna I'm gonna link
it to you guys uh right there it's the
still thumbnail is just him pulling a
piece of meat out of a bag it looks like
came from the garbage yeah Martin he's
getting this looks accurate Oh mark
that's our designer Justin on the right
and then design so yeah light is a shot
me office oh I'm scared I would not want
to take me out of the garbage from here
generally decide this episode's product
meeting it back to my garbage Wow yeah
accurate cool haha okay before we get
too sidetracked by that I a pretty good
example of what we noticed when we were
there and just about like the company
culture that you guys have it to me out
it seems like it's very vibrant and
people are very happy there yeah it's
something that I I sort of take I mean
it's weird to take that seriously to use
those words to take something that but I
really do um working with people that
are so talented so good at their jobs
can be very intimidating um but what's
great is that everybody the thing that
you know everybody has in common whether
it's a developer an engineer on the back
end or someone who's a designer or
someone who works in marketing or PR um
we all are like really into having fun
and although that sounds like yeah okay
everybody likes to have fun namion takes
it to a level that I've never worked at
a company where we've been like at the
level of fun it's almost like this
requirement like we outdo each other up
we tried to like see how much fun let me
just give one example we do every year
we go to UM we caught the summer retreat
and we go somewhere outside of the city
um it'd be best if it was in
international waters we're working on
that but we go outside of the city and
we take over basically like a campsite
but is usually you know for like like a
summer camp the summer camp and we take
it over for a whole weekend and we just
kind of like rage and go nuts and it's
one of my it will continually be a new
favorite memory every year there's
nothing quite as therapeutic as like
going into the woods with a hundred
fifty your co-workers and just like
having it out for a weekend in the woods
getting paranoid it's the best way you
really get to know people that you know
not everybody works with everyone else
but all those barriers are down when you
know you're out in nature having a thing
going on a canoe ride um thrown around
the camp me now there's just like yeah
anything yeah and if you know work is a
place you spend like most of your life
for better for worse so it's like you
really need to like the people you see
on that time with and um you know I
think vimeo it's a lot of people who
were cured like relatively young but
they've also worked here for a long time
so they're like pretty close friends
through actually like a big chunk of
their life which is kind of kind of kind
of bird I think about but so yeah is
most of your team based in New York or
do you have
international offices as well yeah
almost everyone's in New York right now
except for I think there's like two or
three people in London oh wow I'm a
couple in LA and a couple now I'm sorry
um so it's like you know had people
around the world like who work remotely
a lot of that is while we wait for their
visa stuff to clear yeah and Andrew
you've been at with vimeo since like day
zero right well i think yeah i've been
here since um lado 5 which was basically
like you know vimeo launched in like
earlier that year but it wasn't like
what it is today back then it was a
basically a personal side of our
founders and it was only his videos so i
actually came to work at college humor
way back in the day and kind of grew up
with the company and as finger it became
more and more of a primary thing I'd
moved on to doing doing that yeah and I
joined up in well i joined the man
started posting my own videos in 2006
and then came to work at Vimeo in 2008
so i've also been here a little bit not
as long as pile obviously but i mean
here the longest yes he's grandma please
grab I'll uh what is vimeo the name is
that just a name that someone came up
with Jake um yeah after came up with
that Jake Lodwick it has two meanings
one is video with me in it and the other
is it's an anagram of movie oh the me
part of that is um pretty integral
actually because you know I'm vimeo
you're only allowed to upload videos
that you create or had a you know big
hand in creating um and you know I think
that really lends itself to back at the
beginning you know you could watch a
video and when you left a comment you
knew that you were speaking directly to
that creator and I think this is
mentioned by Alexis in the am in the
video but that is actually part of the
reason that like I think the community
grew in the way that it did rather than
how it does on other sites like YouTube
where it can be a little like caustic
because you don't if you're just kind of
thrown that like that common app
it doesn't matter what you say when
you're talking directly to the person
that made that thing you're going to be
a little bit more careful and like you
know nice ya know it's kind of an a
leaper sunol like people you know it
grew out of this place where people put
their own uh I won't say exactly private
but like personal videos um and that's
really what the me was about um
ironically there's youtube which you
know launched wait pretty much in the
same month but but we didn't really know
about each other um so it's funny that
like a few big video drinks i said like
need you yes it's what it is interesting
though because YouTube is generally like
if you look at youtube globally it's
more about like audience building and
like getting numbers and like going
viral like that's what YouTube is at its
core but then video is about like here's
something I made or here's something
that I saw or hears me that I feel if
they are like fundamentally different
and it's just this weird coincidence
maybe or like just the power of language
that force that to happen yeah I mean I
think it's it like it's everything like
you kind of can't look at one particular
aspect of it and be like oh it was this
rule or that was this you know piece of
content that really defined Vimeo or
YouTube for people um yeah it's it's
everything it's the aesthetic it's the
content on there as a whole it's the way
people talk to each other it's yeah your
rate things I think a lot of it too is I
mean being an early user of the site I
just remember seeing videos that like
Andrew and Jake and Zack and all these
people we were working there were making
and that sort of taught me what this
what it was like to be on this site what
my like when I'm on this site I should
act like this is how it's expected and
this is what's like what's appropriate
and I think that was really helpful to
and building that community so but Mike
Pyle said it was like can't point to one
thing it's a lot of things yeah yeah
it's funny because I I've been updating
my profile in the last couple days and
like I haven't been some of the notes on
the website that that are there like in
the profile sightings and stuff and
there's all these like little hidden
jokes that
kind of notice really like browsing
deeply and it's it's so refreshing to
find things like that throughout the
site you know like the way that things
are worded or like different prompts
like it's very clear that there is a
sense of humor there and that's value
and I think that is so huge and being
able to differentiate you know the
feeling of both sides it's it's it's so
well done oh thank you yeah we kinda
have a saying that it's important to
take you know people's work seriously
and you should take your work seriously
but you should never take yourself too
seriously I think that comes through in
the site to you should talk about the
hard thing you know if you go into the
the vimeo search field than you type in
the word fart you'll have a pleasant
surprise everybody's doing it right now
it's weird right now that work girl up
and down um now it's true i mean i think
over the years we've been like pretty
consistent in church is not working this
guy told our search is not working yeah
it's a technical difficulties cool cuz
you're an all-team awesome yeah yeah um
I get in a minute I guess yeah no I
think we've been really consistent over
the years with our kind of like voice
and are you know personality um you know
we want to put the thing out in the
world that makes us happy and that we
want to use and I think that's why it's
like so closely aligned with what were
life personally so um you know and
getting like 160 people's personality
into a website is like a weird thing to
think about but you know a lot of people
that work here now came from the
community or came to vimeo because that
they got that yo you identical ones out
there yeah so kind of like see this site
and you're like I like this yeah it's a
little bit of like a virtuous cycle of
you know you put something out there
that people enjoy using and they'll
eventually come work with you yeah so as
someone who is a casual you know video
browser I spent a lot of time on YouTube
and my idea of vimeo and
my friends feel the same way is that
video is just a website that has really
great quality videos uh what do you guys
think Vimeo is a sort of stands for
because rightly you like YouTube is the
biggest thing ever but vimeo exists and
it's really strong and you guys
mentioned this a little bit in the video
or Alexis did but um yeah talk about
what separates you know what makes video
different than YouTube oh I'll take 17
than you and then you follow up I'll add
the color commentary I think that the
thing that separates it I truly is i
mean yes Vimeo is known for the highest
quality videos on the internet and
between it be because of staff picks
that's what you're immediately going to
see um I wouldn't necessarily call my
videos the highest quality videos on
vimeo um but i do feel like Vimeo is the
place for me because the main difference
that when I look at videos on YouTube
versus Vimeo videos on vimeo is that the
people who are uploading to vimeo care
about their videos in a different way
than they care like the people that
upload to youtube I think um I think
we're talking about a YouTube looking
like being this place to get all these
views it doesn't necessarily matter how
good the video is as long as you get
views for as on vimeo you care about
your video and you're not looking
necessarily to get like this massive
viral hit it's a place that you go to
upload something that you actually care
about and i think that to me that is
that the heart of my kind of what
separates it and i'm sure if i will have
a different thing to say but yeah well i
mean i think ya know that that's totally
right like we usually say that it's like
if you you know give a shit at all about
how your video looks and about what
people are gonna say about it and you
know what other videos are gonna move
you around it it's better off being on
vimeo because just those are the things
were better at um you know if you care
about getting some kind of huge level of
exposure or making you know money off
through advertising then that's what you
choose for and you know that's that's
kind of a weird delineation but it
really stems from I think what is the
more fundamental difference which is
we've always built a product to really
care
people who make videos and YouTube as a
product has really kind of beer down
this path of you know being a viewing
destination and being this kind of just
massive repository of a video which is a
very like Google thing and um so you
know look our incentives are they were
line differently you know vimeo makes
money off of subscriptions and from
creators who sell their work or who
bought their tools then pay us for it
and you know uh yes you know the entire
business is incentivized around watching
a lot more content and watching ads with
that content so it's like it really i
think fundamentally is like two sides
the same coin I think we built our
future set around people who make video
and therefore 10 but care a lot more
about how it looks um probably why you
see that content reflected on there yeah
Alexis are you gonna do a Vimeo account
are you gonna start making short films
uh you know I actually have a Vimeo
account from mmm way back when we see if
it's still there it's gonna be really
embarrassing that's the best part how
far you've come yeah it's beautiful it
means like the only place in the
internet that I use on any regular basis
where it's like the other account
holders and like some of the videos that
are in my legs hey like the timestamp is
like eight years ago nine years ago it's
like whoa the whole world's gonna be
like that soon like everything you
posted it's just like I mean I know it's
out there but uh a lot of these like
companies and networks haven't been
around long enough that you actually go
back there like shit that was a decade I
was like um yeah how'd you Alexis huh I
found you mahjongg um is it official
years ago six years startup guy red pig
the band rocks of the San Francisco pier
39 yeah this was not a mess is not a
terribly well produced video product is
this you playing music yeah yeah I had a
band for a little bit there's cold bread
big earnest in your in your profile
that's yeah that's before he got broken
great um Wow oh you're only following
one person Wow looks not a good
poorhouse episode 1 like and one
following well Adam to the credits of
epi yes yeah we gonna add it to the
credit drive some traffic yeah no really
gonna do all that because he's rolling
in so i have an eyelid question
unfollower for you guys i think um like
I said before just casual you know video
watcher but the one glaring difference
between Vimeo and YouTube is that you
guys don't really push the account like
at all it's like kind of even hard to
find that has that been like a
fundamental principle from the beginning
that it wasn't about the views it was
about the quality of the video because
obviously that's like a you know a
pretty big design choice that you made
yeah I mean I think there's a couple of
aspects of that like back um like when
you to was this is like 2007-2008 it was
like YouTube's one of their most popular
pages was just like most popular videos
ever and it was like the same basically
dozen videos for like several years
because it's just a giant feedback loop
and so when we were you know building
vimeo and building out the features uh
we didn't want to have this kind of like
top ten or like most view type of ideas
kind of floating around out there those
me just viewed it as this kind of like
that's how you get into this like we
were death spiral of like you know a
certain community kind of bombs on the
video it takes it over we wanted the
kind of you know experience that people
had when they first came to vimeo to be
based around you know our curation
things like that so for us kind of as
like a you know product team we didn't
really think you mattered that much i
mean we've always understood that it
obviously matters the people that make
the video me personally I don't think
like an ever-increasing number that
eventually is just getting rounded off
is all that exciting I know that that's
not a super popular opinion amongst
video creators but yeah it has
kind of remained a little bit more
downplayed you know like back in the day
it was like the total like coin of the
realm was like the number of plays you
have on YouTube and people talk about
that now but now when you see YouTube
advertising they talk about subscribers
yeah but I do think the kind of value of
a play it's kind of like a page view you
know it's like I think the whole economy
around video online is like evolved and
beyond that um just another way vimeos
ahead of the curve yeah I mean we also
push the harder it's much easier to see
like how many likes you know you're that
video has received in how many and how
many comments people have left on it and
again like that to me um I remember this
can't remember who said it was like
Vimeo we never considered it like the
vimeo community shouldn't you shouldn't
approach it like a sea of eyeballs that
you need to trick into watching a video
of yours that you should be making
something that you're like like you're
proud of and you hope that people will
also like be into I am you shouldn't be
trying to trick people and watching your
video by putting some crazy I don't know
thumbnail on it or like right yes a lie
cuz it's got a huge number of views you
should totally watch this it's not based
on that right yeah i mean i don't think
i can like talk expose me about some of
these numbers but like it's funny
because you know Forever Living has been
compared to youtube and like over the
years the I don't know like how big we
are compared to youtube I know how big
we are I get numbers about you too but
even comparing the numbers like the way
we count metrics and things like that
it's hard to compare apples and apples
on that but we've always been like a
percentage of YouTube right whether
that's players or traffic or uploaders
reviewers or whatever it is and I don't
really know what the percentages that
run the numbers like over the years but
it's always been like any percentage of
YouTube is a meaningful thing to me you
know and like I think it's a meaningful
thing for any website like we're top I
don't know 50 website or something like
that it's pretty big and um you know
five years ago it was like oh youtube
has you know X number of hundreds of
millions if you did videos play per
month and I'm like all right well we do
this many million and then now it's like
and but in the preso is always like well
Vimeo is a tiny part of what you
and now it's like Oh YouTube does like
several billion a month and we do like
however many we do and why okay well
we're still doing a huge amount of
traffic crazy explosive yeah um and like
work you know a thousand times bigger
than we were a couple years ago which is
still kind of comparatively this small
thing um it's weird how like you get
bigger and bigger and bigger but you're
always smaller right biggest person in
the room so it's like it's kind of me
they've kind of run cover for us in that
way where it's like we don't ever have
to you know like run away from the idea
of like we're to mass market or were too
popular or to anything like I think
we've really done a good job walking
that line um so yeah and I think that
you guys had the advantage of you have
you know most of your team is in one
location whereas I think like as soon as
YouTube got bought like right they
became part of this huge behemoth that
is then all of a sudden scattered across
all different places and become much
more corporate so you guys are really
being able to retain a lot of that
culture and that style that wouldn't be
possible otherwise that's true and I
also have to say like um throughout you
know Andrew what was your title when you
when you came on vimeo and oliver
developer and now he's tto I mean and
that's awesome like a lot of times I
don't know I mean I vimeos the best
thing but like tech the first technology
company that I worked at yeah but you
may be hired on to do community work and
then being able to create the video
in-house video production department for
you know a site that is worshipped for
its video is like beyond what I would
have expected of any job and that's
another thing that makes me I think and
again I don't know about google and how
they like hire promote or anything or at
YouTube at all but I can't say that the
way that the media treats its employees
with like respect and um and like trust
who continue to run with what we already
know is a good model is like super
awesome yeah yeah a good place to work
at I think you know yeah culture is
important I don't think you can keep the
like um and we're talking about like the
voice of the meal like him kind of like
personality it's like that's like the
first thing you lose because um well it
just is ah you can't you can't recreate
that you cannot manufacture in scale
yeah and like there's no Casey my guess
like otha yeah authenticity i think is
the word people would probably used to
describe that that kind of vibe um but
um yeah I don't know I don't feel bad
for YouTube like when they joined Google
I mean you see the things that they do
if I'm a technology basis and like the
resources you to like google has its
disposal it's just it's freaking
outrageous yeah I mean it's awesome and
it's scary and yeah Oh Andrew have a
quick question for you what's left as
CTO what's kind of the biggest like fire
that you have to put out on a regular
basis with like in regards to technology
that goes into a video platform and
stuff the King's brother we're stuck I
break the web same on a buddy me um the
biggest fire to put on a daily basis you
know it's it's less technology stuff
like every day you know I think as we
become like um more of a streamlined
business and we like get smarter at
things like doing stuff that we hadn't
done before like marketing you know it
becomes like the people that have been
around for a while ended up kind of
making more strategic decisions than
like the day-to-day fire stuff you know
I mean the worst like technical related
thing that happened to us this year it
was we got like dee da super bad in
January we were down for like most of
the morning yeah Mebane North Korea yay
oh is that was that North Korea uh it
was not North Korea although they'll be
watching email me we would definitely
host the interview oh my god um no we
actually i guess i'll tell the story
never told story Funyun is a good story
to tell the story I'll tell a story so
um we're getting d dust and we got an
email ordering that's here they have the
disasters watching I hope you thought I
hope yes listen to us cuz you should be
scared oh yeah forgot
site was down big mess trying to keep it
up we have like a failover site we flip
over that but like you know takes him a
couple minutes to retarget that video so
it's not a good situation it's all hands
on deck a bunch of people are doing
various things to try to get stuff
working what hour of the day this is
like the morning this is like 10 a.m.
yeah i'm running around screaming yeah
um yeah a lot of people with their like
offices lock with like 10 people in it
like all staring at a screen really
closely like a lot of a lot of that that
morning but um so is now so even people
like the designers you know the
engineers are working on like technical
solutions like okay we're gonna route
all of our traffic through ec2 or we're
gonna like get this d das mitigator
online and you know we were calling up
people like going heels websites calling
up the 800 number and being like hey you
do like DDoS mitigation melon yeah or
like great were a top 50 website and
work down and we need to like point all
of our traffic at you right now that was
a crazy morning for like that but the
funniest and the best thing that
happened in that day was we got an email
from this guy that claimed to be the one
DDoSing us and he wanted a hundred
dollars you're like a hundred dollars um
oh we don't negotiate with terrorists
like but we were like what should we do
like what should we say this guy first
we made him prove it so he like we're
like prove it to you so we like stop
that he does and he said he was gonna do
a more like funk shit that's actually
him um and he was like I want you to pay
me a hundred dollars and we're like um
alright how would we pay you and he's
like used like this website and you go
as website it's like you know some
scammy like debit card fake things like
you plug in your information and it goes
through like Germany and then the Cayman
Islands he gets enough um so we're like
okay we're going to like run this by
illegal apartment like find out if we
can pay you this way and basically
trying to string this guy alone and kind
of keep them on the line and we you know
we're saying all this stuff over the
course but they like you know we need
your we need your w-2 to pay you to be
like what is not gonna happen boy so we
did was we set up a fake painting
website
it was called like secure payment dot us
or something we your your team created
one yeah the diners who the site was
down to the desires that don't you do so
they take website um so and it looks
like it was like a bootstrap thing with
like a big like clipart dollar bill it
was like the safest way to pay online
yeah so we're like all right go to this
web like what about this and we can't
pay this German thing so what if you go
to this website so we sent him this link
so he got his IP know and not only that
it had we had a pop-up that said you
know click here to verify it works in
your country and which was just the
html5 geolocation API got the guys like
street address got got Wow and then what
um but it wasn't in use in North Africa
we couldn't get to him so he wasn't
around the corner like we were hoping we
could just come knock on the door ya see
nope let's ask you a few questions he
did ask you guys for a hundred dollars
yeah well presumably the hundred bucks
was just like a phishing scams yeah make
it yeah it's a hundred bucks to be like
cuz once you're on that list of like
places that want to go she ate or
whatever it's like yeah and if you go
back to I think it was a general where's
it was it it was earlier in the year but
there are like a string of d-don't you
guys remember like a string of sites
there we go it's Dropbox altar right and
like a couple places published the email
and it was the same email we got except
he was asking for like different amounts
of money like like fifty dollars or like
$75 very sure another yeah anyway
marketing team that got asked Yeah Yeah
right we learned a lot that day um yeah
including even when you catch the guy
you can't do anything about it yeah
amazing but that yeah the fake site was
just like even though like that was like
a fixed article didn't fan and it was
like really bad everybody's kind of
bummed it was still like this really
kind of fun trying to a fun day oh man
look at this site we just made that's
yeah that's awesome so what is the next
five years for vimeo look like oh man
um well we're going to keep drawing I
think very on demand is like super
promising I think you know the user
expectation you guys talked about this a
lot and video like the is your
expectation of like being able to pay
for things online is definitely changing
over time people's capability to produce
things to put online that are actually
worth watching is increasing so you know
we're hoping to be like right in the
middle of that combination of things
that are happening if like giving the
tool set and being like that people want
to put their stuff to sell directly to
consumer um you know from like a pure
technology basis like obviously a higher
resolution video is on the input side
and the output side is going to get
bigger and bigger and bigger and I think
what's happening what happened basically
a year and a half or what we saw
basically to basically that the year ago
was people's expectation of how video
and where video can be played like
completely flat so you know the idea
that you shouldn't shoot something on
your phone and watch on your TV almost
immediately is like a totally nuts idea
like three or four years ago today it is
completely standard issue like um so you
know like set-top boxes desktop phone
this idea that you don't have flash
installed oh you're gonna have a TV that
has the right codec or some shit like
that it's like none of those days are
over like compatibility for playing back
video is like from a consumer
perspective assault problem so there's
like no going back from that expectation
that whatever your where we are paying
for something wherever you're shooting
something you're gonna be able to watch
it and experience it anywhere and I
think what we're going to start seeing
soon and this is happening with like
cloud providers like drama stuff is like
the kind of idea of like capturing
creation I feel like that's going to
becoming more of a kind of flat process
so you know you shoot video over here
and you watch it someplace else well now
it's going to shift more into the realm
particularly in the pros but assuming
everywhere like you should hear you edit
here you can also edit here you can you
know collaborate with somebody over here
the kind of cloud aspect of actual video
creation has a really comfy fruition so
that's another area
I think we're like prime to kind of be
involved in and I'm super excited about
that yeah wait so are you guys gonna
make a cloud-based editing and
publishing solution is that what you're
talking about well can do gonna be for
my desktop in two years okay then the
interesting thing about cameo is that
particularly the one point oh and
there's still a lot of this in two point
O although we've optimized it um that's
actually a cloud-based editing solution
so it's like you capture on your phone
but all the editing and all the effects
and all that stuff that's all being
pushed up and rendered on the cloud and
pulled back to your phone okay you sit
is why there is a delay and some of this
stuff and so we've optimized a lot of
that out by doing more of these things
locally but that engine that powers that
whole kind of process is like modular so
we've actually taken a lot of what was
going on in the cloud and move that into
the phone and we have this ability now
to kind of move this this video creation
anywhere we want so I think it's a very
natural extension to kind of bring that
to other places I mean the obvious one
is Android and like tablets and stuff
like that but um yes definitely not a
realm reason to bring it to the web and
connect all these things so it becomes a
more of a contiguous process yeah man
boobies already taking steps in that
direction that would be awesome to like
provide that sort of same tool set for I
mean for our pros especially I mean how
many times do you get like a screener or
a private you know a link from a Vimeo
you know link that is like here take a
look at this rough cut its gotta be
private and it's gotta look awesome so
I'm going to send it via Vimeo um
imagine being able to like collaborate
with multiple people across no across
country across the world on that same
file uploading other files and having
that collaboration there um directly on
the place that you will end up yes watch
was like perfect so does a world exists
where vimeo does things like house of
cards where you know people are rushing
to go to vimeo to watch a new show well
i mean it's kind of already happening
with high maintenance i mean i think
that we were lucky in that you know high
maintence had like a pretty fervent
audience already so you know and we
promoted in a bunch so the excitement
around the original content um
I mean it's improving on netflix and
stuff but already starting to understand
like what that how you go about doing
something like that so um I hope you see
a lot more of it yeah and i think the
the key element that will differentiate
like what netflix is doing like what
vimeo is capable of is actually like
money so video has this you know the
most talented people right and the fact
that we would be able to facilitate them
making more of that awesome content and
then selling it to their audience who
are also vimeo users and beyond um i
think that's what's going to be the most
important thing is like finding people
like like the high maintenance folks
we're already making awesome stuff and
being like we want to do we want you to
do more of that and we want to give you
money to do wear that and i think that
there's a just there's so many people
making awesome awesome stuff on demand
we just need to like continue to find
them fund them and promote them and I
mean that's the thing is if we're making
things tools the website decisions based
on is this going to be good for our
community for our users then we're doing
the right thing because that ultimately
feeds back into what makes the website
great and what makes you know working
here great and what makes everybody who
comes to the site think that this is
awesome and what to do the same thing
exactly awesome I think we should wrap
up we've gone yeah we had a solid
conversation this was great thank you

people watching go to youtube.com slash
