its big announcements for the year ahead
but they're always a handful of
surprises this year there are five big
things that we're expecting to see the
first is Apple's streaming music service
an overhaul of beats it's supposed to be
a direct competitor to Spotify offering
unlimited music for ten dollars a month
there's no free tier the app can arrive
on Android and it may even have
celebrity DJ's like Drake and Pharrell
who you know I'd listen to their
playlists the second thing we're
expecting is the next version of iOS
unlike the past few years it's not
supposed to be packed with features
instead Apple's supposed to have cleared
up a lot of the bugs and performance
issues that have popped up recently the
OS might also start to run better on
older devices there are two big features
that could also make it in public
transit directions and a google now
competitor it might display relevant
information based on what's coming up in
your calendar or what you actually do on
your phone the third thing we're
expecting is the next version of OS 10
it'll probably have a similar focus on
stability and performance improvements
with only a few small features it could
have an iOS like control center and it
may even get a new system font San
Francisco which might show up on iOS as
well but overall it's probably going to
be a quieter year the fourth thing we're
expecting is a bit of Apple watch news
it might not be much but apple's
supposed to show off how developers will
start making native watch apps that
should make watch apps a lot faster
although they won't arrive into the fall
the fifth thing we may see is a new
Apple TV this is actually really
exciting Apple could finally introduce
new Apple TV with Siri and an app store
which could allow it to do so much more
Apple is also supposed to be working on
a streaming TV service but that's
probably not going to arrive just yet so
those are the five big things that we're
expecting from Apple on Monday of course
there are still a lot of specifics that
we don't know between the streaming
music service and the Apple TV update it
should be a pretty interesting event</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
