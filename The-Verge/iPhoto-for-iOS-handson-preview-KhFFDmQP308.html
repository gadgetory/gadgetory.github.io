version we're here looking at Apple's
new iphoto app just released it's a much
more powerful photo editing app than
anything that's been on the iPad or
iPhone before and it's it actually has a
lot of the stuff that we're used to from
the desktop version so you can see
photos from your camera roll and you get
all your photos over here plus the one
that you're editing actually in the shot
and you get a surprising number of
features you can and it's all
multi-touch based so you can rotate
photos you can change some of the colors
and the white balances and all that
stuff it's actually really full-featured
it's kind of hard to do like small
changes to things and it ends up being
pretty drastic but you can actually edit
almost everything they're used that
you're used to and again it's it's a
fairly broad stroke thing you can select
different parts of an image that you
want to edit and just by dragging around
you can actually change the effect with
brushes or you can actually have it do
it automatically and there's a bunch of
filters that do pretty interesting
things with your photos some are more
kind of intense than others but you can
always go back really easily which is
nice you can just remove any effect that
you want and go straight back to how you
were so the editing itself is really
smartly done to work with your fingers
and then there's also a lot of sharing
that you can do with the photo so once
you get it the way you want it you can
share it to Facebook or Twitter or
iTunes or what have you and you can also
make a journal which is pretty cool so
if I add these 8 photos to the general
it makes basically a digital scrapbook
and you can add all kinds of different
stuff to your scrapbook you can add you
can add maps and you can add sticky
notes and all kind of stuff and then you
can share it and actually let people see
it in the way that you set it up so if
you have a trip or something like that
that you want to add information to and
you know share all about what you were
doing it's it's a pretty cool way to do
it and anyone with a web browser can use
it as long as they have your link it's a
pretty great app it works really well
we're using an iPad to hear it's pretty
fast and should be even faster on the
new iPad you can sort your photos and it
basically becomes a way to do everything
you need to do with your photos on the
iPad itself it's also available for the
iPhone the interface doesn't work quite
as easily but because the screen is so
small but it certainly
as all the same features and actually
works pretty well so that's the new
iphoto for iOS it's available right now
in the app store for 499 and you'll need
an iphone 4 or an ipad 2 or later to use
it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
