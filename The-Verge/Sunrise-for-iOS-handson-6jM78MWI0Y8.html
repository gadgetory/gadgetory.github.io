checking out sunrise for iPhone future
thinking new calendar app that's built
on Google Calendar but pulls in data
from other places like Facebook and
Eventbrite when you first open sunrise
you see all the events from all your
different google calendars so what's
different here well the first thing is
that sunrise pulls data from other
calendars you have where you've already
responded to events like on Facebook so
if you look here I have two events side
by side to demonstrate I have Mindy's
24th birthday shindig and I have
Minnie's birthday party so here's what I
was already using for my calendar it's
Mindy's birthday party at lolita bar
there's really nothing there to look at
if you tap on this comes straight from
Facebook you can see I'm going I already
RSVP'd here's the exact hours here the
event details I could write on the event
wall see who's attending and even see a
map of where I'm going it's really just
a whole new way to look at events on
your calendar that comes from elsewhere
and what's really nice is that if she
changes the time it's gonna change right
here in my phone another nice thing
about sunrise is the way it handles
meetings with people that you've both
attended to and it'll actually populate
a little image of them which is just a
nice personal touch when you're looking
at events and here's an event I have
with Pierre that he invited me to and
you can actually send him a message
straight from inside the event which is
something you just can't really do in a
calendar app unless you have attendees
attached and you know look at the
location of the event and if anything
changes it's going to be updated in your
calendar immediately if you want to
scroll through your events there's this
kind of intuitive nice way to scroll
through all your events you can go a
couple months back and a year and a half
into the future there's no search just
yet but I've been told it's on the way
one of the cool things about sunrise is
that if you're not sure exactly where
something is if it's already in that
Facebook event or you entered it in you
just swipe on the event tap little
Direction symbol and you're straight
into Google Maps getting directions how
to get there and like I said before if
she changes the location of the event
it's gonna change location in your
directions one other unique feature of
sunrises birthdays which it pulls from
Facebook and if you tap on birthdays it
actually pulls in people's timeline
photos straight from Facebook and right
here you can either post on their
timeline or send them a text message
which is really convenient so you don't
forget your friends
birthdays and of course since sunrise is
a calendar client after all you can
create events so if you tap the plus
sign up here you can enter in a title
use a really nice dialog they've come up
with for choosing your start and end
times for events you can make them
recurring you can also invite people
straight from here choose your calendar
set some alerts it's basically
everything you can do on the iOS
calendar one cool feature though is that
you can actually enter in a location and
sunrise will pull from places on Google
Maps near you so if you do city bakery
it'll pop right in there and it'll
actually change the time zone based on
where that place is if you want to make
an event someplace else just like in
fantastical or in Google Calendar on the
web you can quick add by holding down on
the plus sign and this actually uses the
same algorithms as Google on the web to
let's say you do dinner in Paris on
Saturday at 8:00 p.m.
hit add that's gonna pop straight into
your calendar with no more effort and
lastly since sunrise is plugged into
both Google and Facebook it actually
combines all your event invites in one
spot at the top of the app and you can
respond to things check out event
details right on the walls straight from
here so if I'm not going to this and I
hit decline it saves my RSVP and now
it's going to be taking effect on
Facebook and it's gonna be gone from my
list if you had the Sun Rise the
Settings menu right here you can change
settings for your accounts like let's
say which accounts you want show up
which you don't and you can also add new
accounts
there's also preferences for whether you
want your weather and Fahrenheit or
Celsius Google Maps or Apple maps and
what your default calendar is sunrise is
way of handling events is very clearly
the future calendar apps plugging in
everything you've RSVP'd to on various
services and giving you the context you
need and since it's built on the ability
to feed in api's from other services you
could really quickly add support for
something like TripIt and have live
updating events for flights just like in
google now you'll be able to very easily
follow a TV show or football team have
the schedule plug straight into your
phone without having to do anything
sunrise is a really refreshing take on
calendar as a consumption experience
cloud calendar for the age of cloud apps
