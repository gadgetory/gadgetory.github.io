people if they knew what net neutrality
was and I'm sure you can imagine the
results were highly entertaining so take
a look at this we write back I think
about net neutrality everyday because
I'm a huge nerd and Tim who is my hero
but I'm here in the Flatiron District in
New York to ask these people what they
think about it if they even know what it
is and most importantly if they think
anything should be done about it
what is that neutrality what net
neutrality I have no idea I have no idea
I have no idea I don't know
so I've seen various YouTube tutorials
or you know explanations of net
neutrality and all of them make sense
once I finished watching them but when
you asked me what it is it's fairly
complicated to explain so I ask you
question who owns the Internet I want to
say people on the internet the people
the data is owned by the people that
have the data on their servers and the
connections to the data is owned by the
ISPs the providers no problem really is
was this basically impossible to explain
I mean what can you say do you want to
pay more for YouTube so do you think
like Verizon should be sales you can go
to every set in the internet except for
YouTube if you know I don't think but
you want you see that fast by dollars no
absolutely not I
it wouldn't be cool but it's business
this is awful nobody knows what net
neutrality is when they do find out they
didn't want to talk about it because
it's really political but in a spirit of
this election year I'm gonna get
desperate
I'm calling Barack Obama and I'm calling
Mitt Romney let's see what they have to
say hi where does the president stand on
a net neutrality yeah do you know what
net neutrality is so who should have
more regulatory power over the Internet
the government or Verizon president even
though verizon sells you a product they
should be the ones who determine how
that product works that makes sense
because if anything ever goes wrong you
know who to go to
hi there I'm really interested in voting
for Mitt Romney but I've been I'm just
wondering what his position on you can't
just keep on putting me into robot town
like this you have to press zero when
you call Romney headquarters it tells
you to wait and then it takes you to the
top of the phone so this has been the
worst day of my life nobody knows what
net neutrality is nobody cares about it
nobody even really wants to talk about
it with me not even the president permit
I thought it would be on my side
so I'm gonna go I'm gonna take a break
maybe have a drink maybe throw myself in
front of a bus good night Internet it
was nice knowing you
a an upsetting story one we hope will
find an end someday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
