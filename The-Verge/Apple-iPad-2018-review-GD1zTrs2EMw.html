you want to spend less than I don't know
call it 500 bucks well the obvious
option is to get this the 6th generation
iPad that Apple just announced but what
else could you do
I guess there's Windows tablets but at
that price point they suck Android
tablets they're basically dead they
don't exist anymore there's only one
Chrome OS tablet and who knows what it's
any good I don't think it will be that
good and Amazon tablets are basically
only good for watching Amazon Prime and
reading Kindle books so this iPad which
starts at $329 isn't just the obvious
option it's basically the only option so
thank God it's so good
so here's the deal with a new iPad Apple
announced it at an education event so
you might think it's an education on the
iPad but it's basically just the new
iPad and everything about this iPad is
almost exactly the same as last year's
iPad it has the same very good screen
but it isn't laminated which means
there's a tiny little air gap from the
glass to the screen unless you're really
a pixel pennant it's not going to bother
you it has the same touch ID software
it's got you know cameras it does not
have the smart connector for attaching a
keyboard it's basically the same iPad
that you know and love okay so what's
actually new well only two things one is
that has a new processor the a-10 so
it's slightly faster and two it supports
this the $99 Apple pencil and honestly
that's it I said last year that if you
need a new iPad you should get a new
iPad and you should get this iPad
because it's an iPad and that same
advice basically holds if your iPad is
old and busted and slow or whatever go
ahead and get this new iPad and if it's
not don't stick with what you got so
this year the real question isn't is
this iPad any good because of course
it's good it's an iPad no the real
question is should you spend twice as
much to get this thing the iPad pro well
let's look at the differences between
these two iPads and see if it's worth it
so the first thing you'll notice is that
the iPad pro has a bigger screen it's
10.5 inches versus 9.7 but the iPad pro
also has a nicer screen it has a higher
refresh rate Apple calls it pro motion
and you can really see it when you
scroll really fast but I don't know
you're not going to notice it most of
the time I don't think the iPad pro
hustle has a wider color gamut and it
also has this thing called true tone
where it adjusts the color temperature
of the screen to the room sure that's
great I don't know how important it is
to most people other iPad pro
differences it has four speakers instead
of just two so you can hear it in stereo
no matter how you're holding it it has a
smart connector so that you can attach a
smart keyboard to it the iPad pro also
has better cameras and it also has a
faster touch ID sensor
but to me the biggest difference is that
the iPad pro has four gigs of RAM and
the iPad regular old
iPad iPad has two gigs of RAM and you
wouldn't think that matters but it does
because if you have two apps open in
split-screen and you bring a third and
slide over on the iPad Pro you can still
use the apps in the background but on
the regular iPad if you bring up a third
app the apps in the background freeze
and you have to dismiss this top app
before you can go back to what you were
doing if I'm honest I think the only way
to justify the extra price of the iPad
pro is if you really know for sure
you're gonna use it for full on computer
things if you're gonna be editing movies
and editing photos and using it as your
main computer and you fully understand
all the weird ways that iOS handles
files and other like main computer stuff
that you want to do if you just want to
do tablet stuff if you want to watch
Netflix and read books and browse the
web and play games then the regular ol
iPad iPad is gonna be way better for the
vast majority of people yeah if you
can't tell I really love this iPad the
battery life is great it's fast it does
everything I want an iPad to do but if
I'm being honest I really do think that
Apple basically did the bare minimum
here they updated the processor and they
added pencil support there's a lot of
stuff on the iPad pro I wish they had
found a way to put here for example more
speakers you could listen in stereo in
landscape mode if they put speakers on
this side but most importantly I wish
that they had added a smart connector on
the bottom so you could attach a
keyboard to it without having to fuss
around with bluetooth keyboards how much
would it have cost to add some of that
stuff to this iPad I don't know maybe a
little maybe a lot but I guess if your
Apple you're looking around the tablet
market and you're thinking man I might
as well keep this thing as cheap as
possible so that as many people as
possible own iPads and really that's the
lesson with this iPad nothing else in
the tablet space even comes close to
this thing nothing is as fast nothing
has as many apps or apps or anywhere
near as good really the only competition
for this ipad is a more expensive ipad
so why not keep the price low
other things that annoy me about this
iPad yeah of course there's dozens of
things that annoy me about this iPad
I've mentioned a bunch of them in this
video but would I recommend another
tablet one that cost less than 500 bucks
up against this iPad absolutely not
there's nothing else out there just get
this iPad do I wish that there was more
competition sure I do but until that
happens I'm just glad that Apple made
this iPad as good as they did everybody
thanks for watching you're welcome for
me not saying it's an iPad it's an iPad
it's an iPad 50 million times but you
know what it's an iPad if you want to
