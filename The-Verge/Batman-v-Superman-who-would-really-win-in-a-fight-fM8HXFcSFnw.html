name and poster for Batman V Superman
dawn of Justice the film stars Ben
Affleck as an extremely muscular and
very sad Batman and Henry Cavill who
will be reprising his role as the
beautiful Superman and the film doesn't
come out until next summer 2016 is the
next it is two years from now great
really Jesus that seems like a long and
time to wait for this fight but I think
I can give you a fairly definitive idea
of who would win right now let's start
with the suit Superman wears a regular
superhero costume with no special
features because he's Superman and he is
impervious to damage Batman on the other
hand has a fairly elaborate suit
especially elaborate in the Christopher
Nolan films and the Joel Schumacher
atrocities however in the comics it's
not nearly as elaborate mostly just
consisting of blue or grey spandex and a
fancy utility belt and boots and this
gloves are the things on the side
whatever they call those a notable
exception to the costume is the Adam
West version from the 1960s Batman which
doesn't look particularly useful in any
way but does seem comfortable like a
pair of cozy pajamas you slip into
before knocking out the Joker so even
though Superman suit is simple and I do
love simple things in life
Batman ultimately wins this one if you
can forget about the Joel Schumacher
suits particularly the nipples
something about an anatomically correct
rubber suit that puts fire in a girl's
lips
okay so what about the disguises the
disguises well there's really no contest
there Superman when he wants to not be
recognized as an invincible superhero he
takes off his suit puts on a regular
suit and then wears glasses Batman on
the other hand lives a life of opulence
and I think hot sex as Bruce Wayne the
billionaire playboy I'll be honest with
you
Superman's disguise is awful and the
fact that people in Metropolis don't
notice that Clark Kent is Superman
suggests that they're all high and drunk
so I think Batman takes this one though
I will say if you're a skilled qin
expert he's gonna be in trouble you've
got to ask yourself who in this battle
it has a more sympathetic origin story
Batman of course had his parents
brutally slain in front of him of course
we know one thing is for sure a young
Bruce Wayne is kneeling in front of his
dead parents gripping his mother's
pearls and crying
Superman basically had a regular
childhood and he was raised by regular
parents whereas Batman lived with his
Butler Alfred and also had a horrible
accident where he fell into a bat cave
although Superman did have his entire
planet blown up and everybody he knew or
could have known his dad parts of them
floating in space presumably also
there's that stupid hologram of his
father that just appears everywhere you
know what I feel like this one's a tie
abilities I mean this is not even worth
talking about
Superman is is Superman he can he can do
anything he wants pretty much Batman you
just has some gadgets
on the other hand if he did have that
gun that shoots kryptonite bullets it
could be very effective against super
bad but just because you put bat in
front of a regular device doesn't make
it any more capable of beating Superman
in a fight because Superman is again a
Superman with alien powers and
tremendous strain so I think I'm gonna
give this one to Superman let's talk
about success rate Superman seems to
fight the same villain a lot Lex Luthor
although in the last film Man of Steel
he did fight General Zod who's kind of
an awesome badass target that aircraft I
like to see you Zod versus Batman I'd
pay to see that anyhow I feel like
Superman wins a lot you know cuz he's a
Superman and everything Batman on the
other hand does not have a great track
record yes he puts a lot of people in
Arkham Asylum but they always seem to
break out of Arkham Asylum I'm gonna
give this one a Superman and I'm gonna
say Batman maybe start putting people in
jail let's talk about love life for a
second that might not seem like it
matters but on the battlefield when
you're thinking about what you have to
go home to it might give you that extra
juice fight juice Superman is obviously
hot and heavy with Lois Lane I don't
know how they have sex I'd like to get
some end data on that I assume he just
does it real gently and I think that's
great she seems like a pretty great gal
she's a journalist she can't tell that
Clark Kent is Superman so she might be
incredibly stupid but she seems like a
nice lady back me on the other hand kind
of gets into with a lot of different
ladies dude might have a STD actually
when you think about how many people
he's sleeping with there's Catwoman
attalia Ghul Vicki Vale Rachel Dawes
most recently from the Christopher Nolan
films that doesn't end well it's fairly
obvious that Batman gets around more
than Superman but there is something to
be said for monogamy on the other hand
Catwoman is pretty hot so I'm gonna give
this what about it
Oh sidekicks sidekicks Suman doesn't
have a sidekick cuz he's a Superman with
alien abilities and incredible strength
Batman has Robin who usually either dies
or leaves this is why Superman works
alone I gotta give this one a Superman
so let's tally up the count oh look at
that it's a dead tie between Batman and
Superman I don't understand why they're
even fighting why would they be fighting
you think that the either one of them
would be like this guy's cool like he
seems to hate bad people and like so I'm
gonna we're gonna just like hang out or
whatever get a beer or something
sometime what would they be what are
they fighting over who loves justice
more that's is the battle about which
one of them is more into justice I think
it might be it feels to me like maybe
this film doesn't end with Batman or
Superman winning maybe it ends with them
realizing that in order to truly do
something good they have to work
together to fight the real evil a very
curly haired Lex Luthor played by Jesse
Eisenberg although he probably will
shave his head so forget I said</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
