online video platform it's bigger than
pretty much everything everything except
television now traditional broadcast and
cable television are increasingly less
popular with young millennial viewers
but TV is still the biggest game in town
today those two worlds are coming
together with the launch of the new
YouTube TV service for $35 a month
subscribers get access to all four of
the big broadcast networks plus
30-something cable channels for the
traditional television industry this is
a chance to grab those elusive
Millennials who are too busy staring at
their smartphones and notice there's a
TV set on and for YouTube this is a
chance to get people who have always
watched for free and turned them into
paying subscribers now when you open up
the mobile app the first thing you see
is a selection of live broadcasting if
one of those shows has been selected as
your favorite it'll automatically be
saved to your cloud DVR you have an
unlimited amount of storage free on
Google and you can keep anything there
for up to nine months now if something's
been favorited and it's going to my DVR
I can scrub through live programming so
if I show up in the middle of an episode
I can just scroll back to the beginning
now everything you save in your DVR is
stored in this section of the app called
your library it's smart enough to know
that if I search for a movie say no
country for old men I'm going to want
that no matter what channel it's playing
on so it'll search around and the first
time that broadcast comes up it will
save it to my DVR now there are black
outs here for things like regional
sports or news but once a game is saved
to my DVR I can watch it no matter what
location I'm in the other big feature
not surprisingly is search now this is a
place where YouTube has a lot of
experience you can do search by genre by
show or even by keyword if I searched
for time travel the app is smart enough
to show me movies and TV series that
have this theme involved say I search
for Tom Cruise it's going to come up
with shows he's been in recently films
and of course related episodes but it's
also going to show me highlights from
the web YouTube stuff I wouldn't
ordinarily see on television YouTube is
far from the first service to come to
market offering a combined streaming
video with traditional television but a
lot of other players have stumbled
during big events have you ever tried to
stream the Super Bowl what YouTube does
have is global infrastructure and a lot
of experience with big live events so it
seems well poised
finally solve this painful YouTube is
built a massive global audience
primarily by offering entertainment for
free a lot of that stuff has even come
from traditional television now it's
trying to marry those two worlds
together and it's betting it will be
enough to get young viewers to finally
pull out their credit cards
YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube YouTube
for you to you to YouTube YouTube
YouTube YouTube perfect awesome alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
