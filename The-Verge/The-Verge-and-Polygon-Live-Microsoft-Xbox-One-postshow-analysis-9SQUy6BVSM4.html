welcome to the Future yeah you were in
the past what this is the future we're
not we're no longer on the same timeline
I'm actually having schisms yeah old
time we'll jump Diane Torrance
slaughterhouse-five star exactly my
grandma died again this guy that's not
cool but maybe you'll go back and see
her be born again would be beautiful in
that mean is my symmetry I'm Josh
Topolsky and this is Justin McElroy of
course who else would it be it's not
like I mean this could be Ross Miller
but it's not this time
your schism your time water your rocks
we see when we cross streams anyhow so
we're back after following the
incredible breathtaking emotional
emotional definitely Xbox one event TV
heavy what do you think may not me I am
ready to watch TV again I stopped
watching TV for a long time but now I'm
ready no you did find what you're
looking for I can finally find some
shows you're good with no it was a very
it was a very interesting confident
first off we didn't get into games for
about 30 minutes yeah game it was very
light very relatively why I mean very
known quantities Call of Duty FIFA that
was so that was interesting with the
features they show the connectivity and
stuff like that is is definitely much
more of a mass-market play I think then
Sony was was showing up during their
should we should we talk about like so
they started the event with make sure
the hardware before anything they show
the hardware and the controller they
kind of like got into it and then they
very quickly went into TV and Kinect
functionality and there was a big
emphasis on gesture controls voice
controls and I feel like the thing that
people hear that you and I seem most
excited about at the at first and other
people in the room was the whatever the
pinch to get that something was like so
the Kinect is always watching you oh and
always listening is that is the Xbox off
connected and carrots gonna keep watch
the so but in
the Xbox's is you can it's always on
mm-hmm like you wake it up by speaking
to it
but it's never fully asleep remember
fully out oh it's always so it's
listening to you all the time at home
perfect and watching you perfect 2013
dude yeah why'd you strike your limit
Jay man fully nude yeah he's gonna be
like that's a great outfit hey listen
I'd like to recommend this new fitness
game we got you you just said for me to
order your pizza are you sure you want
me to I'm not so sure I don't know the
ones still over there look I mean but
they didn't really address that better
that is no case it will be like sort of
a way so let's start with the TV stuff
yeah the illegal interest what do you
think um it just seems so strange to me
because first off the the first TV
integration they showed off was actually
the ability to switch to live TV right
which is interesting from a perspective
of like connectivity I'm it's cool that
onto switch input I guess that's kind of
neat right one controller yeah that's
cool they have a guide a guide yet built
into it but who is
I just didn't know people were watching
live TV I mean I know that I know that
people are obviously still watching live
TV I shouldn't say that but in terms of
like a forward-looking trend that we
want to get out in front of I mean they
used gesture and voice commands to
switch to prices right Wow it was like
that when they first demo it how amazing
it was you could switch in a live G it
was like the most dated right program
that you could possibly come up with and
and you know it's not their fault I mean
it was live TV mm-hmm but that's I think
you know it was interesting that they
had such an emphasis on that I mean
first off it's HDMI pass-through so
there so it's not like there's somehow
becoming your cable box like you still
need your cable box like that to get the
content onto there I think that their
their whole deal though is like we just
want to be you don't want we don't only
have any other boxes right if you can
help it in your living room besides this
thing and it even kind of has like the
design of the hardware's kind of looks
like it was like a VCR I'm trying to get
excited about but that was the main
sticking point that I noticed early on
was we had it and the controller looks
great I
looks very much like you would you would
expect like an Xbox yeah and the the I
the the the brand-new Kinect looks it's
a lot sleeker a lot more you know
compact it seems it's hard to tell scale
yeah but the box itself who look I mean
maybe this is the baby this just sort of
reaffirms Sony's decision to not even
show a box
yeah like does the Box matter I mean the
truth is it doesn't matter when the Xbox
is ugly the old xbox the first the first
the three sick no the recall Xbox one
original Xbox crime is that was ugly the
Xbox 360 i think is pretty ugly you like
it no I mean I like the black a lot more
than I like the white inhales okay yeah
but but yeah the newer one you mean this
yeah
was it called yeah yes yes and then and
then so this is like actually kind of
nicer but it also it looks like an HTP
see in the very looks like something you
might buy a new egg if you're building
like a home theater it looks like a box
that anybody would be comfortable
putting into a home theater senator it
doesn't say Kitty it doesn't say you're
right right but but you know anyhow
that's that's beside the point
inside x86 eight core GPUs memory it has
memory Oh storage definitely USB 3.0 oh
yeah I know that rated blu-ray drive
they caved on that yeah they gave in
Microsoft was like look if we're gonna
be the center of your home entertainment
situation like we're gonna have to give
you the blu-ray drive up or else you're
gonna buy so many probably in a tough
meeting you're gonna get yeah they're
like luxury we the HD DVD thing didn't
go great for us I'm just gonna try
putting it in what does this live is in
there baby
but yeah I don't know I'm a little
underwhelmed
now I crazy for feeling that way you're
a games guy your video game is
definitely not a there was I would not
say there was a big idea in terms of of
gaming I mean if you're if you care
about gaming primarily I mean it
apparently will look better the the
integration of some of those other
services into games but they the the
even that wasn't really shown for gaming
it was shown as a backup to your TV
experience what I think that people want
more than a supplemented gaming
experience and that's that's pretty odd
and they really emphasize the voice
control and the ability to switch
between things and even have that little
split screen sort of experience where
you can check some stuff out or make a
Skype call I don't know to me it's just
like are people just like man I wish I
could be making Skype calls while I'm
watching and move it it was weird about
it as it is in a in a press release it
says something like you know watch it
play a game play like your favorite
action game while watching a movie at
the same time and it's like future areas
that I'm missing that people are having
where they're doing that thing because
to me that's like I want to watch a
movie or play a game and like those
don't need to be happening I get pretty
on the attention span especially but
when I'm by myself I wouldn't mind
having another diversion on the side of
the TV and the guys I'm serious
yeah yeah yeah right while you're
watching TV well I'm watching TV I want
to be doing something else let me play
real bad play a whole scene here have a
Skype call while you watch a movie yeah
that doesn't sound that well maybe TV
sure maybe not a minute but a TV show my
dad wants to call and ask me how the
episode of justified I'm like that guy
are you watching justified I am I
watched the first few episodes I don't
know I'm not didn't catch it take more
time let's just talk about justified yes
what do you guys think of Jeff hey just
what is your take on it
I mean Olaf and by the way to see other
I've said this for a long time he should
have if he doesn't have a fan club
called olefins yeah to make that happen
but so a lot of TV stuff which was great
I mean the it seemed like the voice
control worked really well the guide
seemed really great like the
discoverability
of content and like recommendations and
all that stuff seem really switching
between all these different applications
yeah very fast and then they got into
gaming I mean there's not a lot to say
except like they're they've got a hugely
improve what it looks like hugely
improved entertainment / TV watching
experience yeah and then which looks
great yes like a great way to experience
TV and then they got into gaming I gotta
say I I did not at the at the ps4 event
I felt like I said there were glimmers
of actual gameplay and I was like this
is really impressive like this feels
what was it was Killzone is that the
game that they showed off that somebody
actually played on stage yeah that seems
Cystic elite Killzone is killed in an
actual name of the game franchise I just
make that I have a memory condition
where I actually instantly forget
Killzone Killzone related well I mean
how they showed off gameplay at the
PlayStation event I was like you know
guys say this does look vast and really
detailed I didn't feel like I saw any of
that today it's a Microsoft event and no
e3 they're gonna have all the games you
know that's a Call of Duty if that was
like the most graphically impressive
stuff that they showed well it's also
hard because the only things we saw saw
that they were cinematics I mean even if
they were being presented in the
gameplay engine right you weren't seeing
what it you know you weren't able to
they're using jump cuts or using music
yeah they're you don't get a sense of
what it would be like to actually play
the game here's a footage from this is
act this looked really good this is
quantum break which apparently is part
television series part game yeah it's
like unclear like if this if this is
rendered if this pre-rendered or
rendered in real time if it's in real
time it's pretty amazing yeah pretty
awesome you guys seem to think this was
not unattainable for real time but we
don't really see there's a little bit of
we don't know if this is game play here
or not this is like a cinematic this is
by really that's actually human that's a
human this is not an actual human remedy
who made Alan Wake which actually
integrated a lot of FMV into the game
itself so an integrated approach for
these guys is it makes a lot of snow and
I have to say Alan Wake I played like
crazy yeah and I thought it was very
all done the way they blended those two
things I mean I have no doubt these guys
have the capability of making a great
game it's just like getting trying to
get a sense of what the games will be
like what they'll look like what the
exactly will feel of it how it'll be
different from what we've already seen
is tough and I think we talked about
this a little bit it's also tough
because we are all we've all seen PC
games on really great rigs and this is
basically what we're looking at well
it's part of the problem with waiting so
long in between two generations is that
pcs have had such a long time to sort of
advance beyond this that I don't think
you're you're gonna be wowed by a lot of
what you saw and and you and I were
talking whether that's during the stream
the jump is just not gonna be like it
was when we went from sd to HD or even
you know 16-bit up to PlayStation 4 that
was a huge I mean that was a big jump
we're not gonna go into coming from
16-bit to PlayStation that was mine rice
was a huge deal
and I don't think you're gonna see it's
always gonna feel more incremental from
this point on because you're also
running up against the cost to actually
make all these right assets may God draw
the polygons that seem like I mean it
seems like you know there was a period I
mean a long period where off the shelf
wasn't an option
there was no like off-the-shelf testbed
for this stuff you couldn't just come up
with hey we're gonna put these
components together and we're gonna have
an amazingly powerful gaming computer
right I mean people had to actually
custom build I mean they had to custom
build the components to make a great
video game system right you know is it
gonna take I mean I wonder is there
gonna be some quantum leap when somebody
actually says look we created something
that nobody else has and we're building
for this game system you know dude will
that happen again are we always going to
be on the track where it's just like the
iterative process of PC hardware well
there has to be some sort of as long as
we're in sort of a to console fight
there's always going to be some parody
like it's gonna be hard to have anybody
make any sort of Titanic jump right
without the other person because it
doesn't make sense to develop games that
I can only be played on one if you're
not an exclusive deal speaking of
exclusive deal that was one piece of
gaming information that I was actually
pretty excited about is that they said
they were gonna have in the first year
of the system which
is is actually before holiday of 2014's
holiday and the next holiday 15
exclusive games 8 of which are new this
is a little disheartening they say new
franchises which boy charming whimsical
way to talk about video game a the new
McDonald's for you right
I'm transmedia is going to me yeah it's
like it's like why not just announce the
four sequels now tell me about the novel
it is that is I mean that is exciting I
mean the franchise part but not the
franchise part but but the idea that
there's gonna be some original and we're
gonna see it some of that at e3 of
course they want to keep something in
the tank for their I just it seems to be
that when you're looking at something
like this and this kind of like tone
setting event and you they actually
started out which I thought was smart
with with a sort of tone video with lots
of celebrities and people who worked on
games my man Jay Allard was up in there
and if they're setting a tone with this
kind of event and the first half is TV
you know and then there's ten minutes of
games and then they're back talking
about TV again like that to me as a
gamer primarily it's kind of a worrying
tone I mean I know that it's just that
but if that's the turn there's I mean I
think it's obvious that they have to
Microsoft has to own this space right
you know clearly Google wants to be
there they've tried with Google TV they
then you want to be in the living room
Apple is obviously like supposedly gonna
try to get there Microsoft hasn't been
you know they've not had a great couple
of years in terms of like stamping out
space in new markets or in markets where
they used to dominate right they're not
doing great with phones I mean they're
in third place now apparently but still
not like doing what Android and iPhone
are doing tablets I don't think the
surface is that much of an impact PC
sales are on the decline and a lot of
people aren't crazy about Windows 8 you
know solid OS but they're not it's not
like Microsoft is just clearly
dominating everywhere you know search
they're not dominating like they're not
necessarily like as robust on the
internet as they want to be like but the
Xbox has been just a completely separate
product for them
so right duh well you know maybe not
dominance but just a superior excellent
product that many many people millions
and millions of people love and want to
use and have a tremendous affection for
so I feel like you know this is a place
where they not only have to keep that
moving right they bring all those people
along with them but they have to say
like we're also this is a place where we
can and will succeed because we know how
to do it in the living room becoming
like this entertainment hub so today's
announcement felt very much like it was
you know it was almost like hey you know
we can do games like we've got great
franchises we have great hardware like
that's a foregone conclusion but we
really want to say we beat people to
this solution for TV which i think is
like weird because TV seems like I don't
know I we're doing a live TV I don't
watch that much live TV I kind of hate
flipping through channels and most of my
watching is like I heard something's
good or I know something's good and I
want to go find it and watch it or I've
DVR'd something I'm gonna watch it so
you know this doesn't necessarily add a
lot to the I mean to the live TV
experience like I'm not gonna watch more
TV now because of it right and and I
think that you're right in that I not a
lot of time spent on gaming but as you
say they I mean if you're if you like
video games you're going and you're in a
financial position where you can afford
it you you will buy one of these like
they don't really have to sell that
market I mean they've proven concretely
I think that they are the channel for
that now are they are they showing me a
strategy that says how they're going to
continue to and this I think is one of
the things that was missing outside of
specific games are they showing a
strategy that says this is how we're
going to continue to stay relevant in a
gaming industry that is moving right so
fast right I mean they show stuff like
this illumiroom demo which to me is you
guys are talking about on the pre-show
to me is like really like if you showed
consumers that experience and you told
them that you could make it happen and
it would be easy
I feel like consumers would be like whoa
this is a completely different gaming
experience right I've known before this
is a weird immersive gaming experience
they didn't really show we know the
Kinect they said it's more here
footage right here we know the Kinect is
going to be higher resolution more
sensitive you know I don't feel like
Kinect certainly not far penetrated I
mean I think it has a great penetration
in terms of consumer adoption but it's
not like it's a brand new home you know
new world graphically speaking I don't
think we saw anything that was
necessarily better than what
Sony's showing off so the question is
you know how do you do that is it is it
those franchises just like we have the
best content I feel like that was part
of the message yeah
another part of the the the message that
was noticeably absent was any mention of
the the Xbox 360 yeah
and how that that fits into the overall
Xbox world wired had a report that the
new Xbox has no we actually have do we
have a report on it you have a report
well yeah I talked to Marc Whitten and
one of the questions right I lost him
and he was very clear that at this point
there's no backwards compatibility for
the 360 and this I know they're actually
gonna be selling the 360 they're gonna
continue to sell the 360 alongside this
new X the Xbox was called one why ya
know what's that the year doughnut and
so I think that's I was a little
surprised I guess a guy who's invested a
lot of money in xbox 360 games and as a
guy who wants to reduce the amount of
consoles that I have in my living room
it's a little disheartening they don't
have some option here obviously it's
different Hardware right by some
streaming option or some kind of like
we're gonna be back filling these title
eating some way anything at all yeah or
like here we'll give you credit for some
new games like throughout me a bone I
thought that was actually really
surprised I mean I know that the
expectation was it's not me backwards
compatible but I just feel like there
should be some little like give me a
little bit of a breadcrumb towards some
like me not trashing the entire life I
said it before it's really it's bad for
preservation it's bad for keeping gaming
relevant it makes it seem so so much
like a commodity the you know I usually
stops the box of Peas
yeah and I play them like I go back to
old games
and I do that and it just seems like I
don't know it's maybe the minor thing
maybe it's for nerds only maybe we're
gonna be the only guys in the world who
are pissed off about it but if you're
gonna have me spend it they didn't have
the price we should say no price no
release date yeah they said this year
this year so they mean I mean like
November Black Friday it'll be in stores
yeah if not they blew it if on the same
doubt if this is it in stores for Black
Friday
Microsoft blew the console words never
like I mean Bay Inn in some ways would
be very nice November it'll be
definitely in November but no price
probably gonna be like what five hundred
baht no $4.99 so you know I spent a
bunch of unny on my games now spent five
hundred dollars on this yes the
experiences would be great it just would
be nice if like I'd have to retire my
entire library and I understand there's
an argument to be made for well people
won't buy as many new games if they can
play all the old games on this system
right that I mean that's a very sort of
weird to me that's a veneration to watch
I mean that's a reason to buy it's like
I get all the new stuff plus my old
stuff why would I keep why would I
continue to have the other one sitting
around I'm gonna buy this new console
and move slide into the next generation
I actually have a lot less patience for
the downloadable games not being
backwards compatible I mean to be able
to download my I feel like I bought
those and I feel like I own the right
and they're not even like a disc that I
can like what about the Xbox like what
about the the arcade stuff I mean all of
it apparently yeah that's in see that
seems crazy that's pretty especially
since they were like sort of harping on
you know all of their you know all of
their you know this operating systems
they kept talking about three operating
systems yeah that was odd there's three
os's there's a Windows kernel and then
there's the Xbox oh some variants and
then there's the thing that switches
between them and that sounds like kind
of to me it sounded like the
that we're explaining the technology in
the system the way my physician wife
explains medical things to me like you
basically have to it's like a train
that's in your body it's take on a sick
way no it seems like an oversimplified I
mean it's abstracted so far that it
doesn't really mean if you're running
though so it's Linux
mac and windows on this like you know
they're all running things
yeah like are you yeah anyhow but so I
don't I don't really know I don't really
know what that means completely no we
have we have somebody that we're gonna
bring in who's for who we bringing in as
a guest here are you hearing something
Oh Brian % it oh I I know something from
a polygon no look at this hey there is
Brian can you hear us
no again yes you can there's a massive
delay so this is gonna be awesome
yes Brian what was it like in the room
it was it was actually a surprisingly
small room it had about eight rows not a
lot of people in there and a lot of
Microsoft people I think in the back
because there was a lot of eruptions of
applause that odd and like odd moments
in the presentation perhaps even
pre-planned moments in the presentation
possibly possibly they had people
applauding for specific things I
couldn't tell what they were applauding
for but yeah it was it was an
interesting sort of setting where it was
not a lot of people there but enough for
us to kind of get an idea of what was
going on and then just sort of this
backdrop of what had to be I think
employees who were sort of filling in
the silence with applause now game
journalists are incapable of not
beginning to critique something like
literally the moment it ends I have you
talked to anybody else was in the room
is there a sense of the tone of the of
their reaction to the to the
announcement so far yeah you know
actually the people I've talked to have
all been pretty positive I think a lot
of people I ran into some of the Penny
Arcade guys I was talking to them they
really liked it there one critique was
why they went with usb3 and not some
other sort of input so that was I think
a joke critique but I think in general
people were I wouldn't say confused but
they're basically they want more
information this is a very a
presentation that painted with very
broad strokes so we got a sense of some
of the stuff going on but there's still
a lot of questions we all have about a
lot of the particulars I so we were
talking about the game
kind of what we saw of gaming did you
you know was there a moment did you see
something that felt like real gameplay
to you where you got a taste of what
this thing was capable of from a
graphics perspective because it was kind
of hard I mean watching the stream of
assertive hard to distinguish what was
pre-rendered or what was a cinematic
versus like any gameplay they really
didn't show any gameplay was there a
moment where there was a kind of like oh
wow or a gasp and people really got a
sense of what this thing could do there
are no gasps at all but I think that
that wasn't because people were not
impressed with what was going on I think
again they were sort of just sitting
there absorbing I mean there was it was
one hour and they didn't just present a
new console but they it presented like
something that obviously touches on a
lot of things outside of gaming in terms
of gameplay what we saw a lot of it did
look to me like pre-rendered stuff for
is up I think there was a moment where
they cut to real gameplay because it
looked real I mean it looked like it's
something that was happening in a game
the EA Sports stuff to me looked a lot
like CGI
I think ghosts though gave us their best
look at what some gameplay is gonna look
like and that was pretty impressive but
honestly for me at least as a gamer I'm
at the point where I'm not gonna buy a
console based on how pretty the graphics
are I'm gonna buy a console based on the
experience and what else they're
bringing to the table beyond just you
know what the game looks like so so
what's your take on this versus the what
you saw the ps4 is this was this more
compelling than what Sony showed off
yeah I mean I think they told us a lot
more about the console than the
PlayStation 4 than Sony did during the
PlayStation 4 presentation I feel like
the Sony sort of went into that and I
kind of think their philosophy is hey
entertainment hey TV hey movies we can
all get along let's see how we can all
work together we're gonna we're gonna
sort of figure out a way where we can
share the audience Microsoft went in and
said no we're gonna be the experience
and if you want to do anything with our
users you have to go through us and
whether or not you like that I approach
it's certainly a very direct approach
and it's one that can add something to
the experience so their idea is I think
you know let's take TV and add a little
bit of gaming experience to TV and let's
take movies and you
and everything else and essentially it's
a game a fight but give it an element of
gaming
so essentially gaming becomes one more
channel one more press button on your
remote you know you go from watching
King the game of thrones to watching you
know Mad Men to playing Call of Duty
ghosts and it's as easy as just pushing
a button I think that's what they want
to do Brian let me asked you something
first off I wanted to tell you that I
took the notepad from your desk and I
borrowed your pen and I didn't ask so
for that I'm sorry I want to apologize
for that up front sorry about that
that's it I used a whole page scribbling
up what are you getting ready to go into
e3 here in just a couple short weeks
what do you feel like you still need to
hear from from Microsoft about Xbox what
are the big lingering questions for you
these two one answer well I mean the
obvious one is the price and the release
date but I think also today it sounds
like looking at the schedule we're gonna
get a lot more detail on some of the
broad strokes that they already sort of
laid out for us so we're gonna find out
a lot more about how Xbox Live's gonna
work we're gonna find out about
backwards compatibility something that
they didn't talk about I would assume
because it wasn't brought up that it
won't be in the game in the Xbox one
that they won't have a backwards
compatibility if they're probably today
gonna be talking a little bit more about
oh do they did they confirm that it
snapped in there yes nothing affirmed
yeah it wasn't in the announced we had I
talked to mark Whitney so duh see he
confirmed it and yeah sorry that's not
surprising I mean it's disappointing but
I think ultimately it's something
they'll only hurt them for a small
segment of people for a short period of
time they're going into e3 what I really
want to see is I want to see all these
bells and whistles they've been talking
about and all these great games no one's
even combined I don't want to see a
fancier looking Call of Duty I want to
see a game that I could not play on my
xbox 360 not just one that looks
different than my Xbox 360 but something
that's so compelling that would make me
want to buy a completely new console so
make you feel like it's a new game so I
question actually going for both of you
sorry and this delay is insane
but and I wanted Brian I want to hear
your take on this
for developers I mean we didn't really
hear anything about we know whether the
barrier to entry for developing for the
one will be different than what has been
previously the city the state of xbox
360 which is like a pretty high barrier
to entry this is not a nap story you
know this is not like submit your stuff
and it gets on there and you know this
is clearly a super-powerful computer
right it's not just this is a you know
has many many functions that go way
beyond just gaming so did you have you
gotten any impression from anybody there
do you have any sense of and this is for
either one of you guys any sense of
whether or not they're gonna lower the
barrier to entry and make development
for this console more straightforward
than it was particularly for small
developers I mean I think I think they
have to I don't know if they're going to
they it's interesting that it's not
something they talked about now on the
one hand they could say look this was
supposed to be a presentation that
wasn't about games oddly enough they
snuck a lot of games into this
presentation but they didn't it all
address that question which is I think a
question that's incredibly important to
this coming generation of consoles and
that is can it really support indie
games can it find the next minecraft or
the next you know Angry Birds and
support it in a way that doesn't require
developers to put so much effort into
trying to get their game onto the system
and yeah that's a huge question it's
something they didn't talk about at all
so hopefully we're gonna hear about it
either today or at e3 well Brian I know
you need to get going to more coverage
and Justin I need to get back to our
hilarious banter which was and are
justified recap so yeah yeah we got a
lot of justified to talk about but
thanks for taking the time to to talk to
us and obviously you guys are gonna have
more stuff today so we'll keep our eyes
on polygon and I expect a full deep
emotional editorial from you by the end
of the ride was Jay Allard in the room
can you confirm for me whether or not
jaylen was in the room I I saw Phil
Harrison does that count
he's like a tall jailer does that work
doesn't does not count that does not
even in the vicinity of county naughty
thank you for leaving us on that sour
note Brian thank you thank you it so so
something that something we should talk
about is there was this sort of
controversy about always on you know if
the console would need to be connected
all the time to the internet if it would
be a requirement to play games that
apparently is not the case mm-hmm
according to Wired I'm reading this on
polygon but you guys you guys are citing
wired here I think and I don't know this
to me was not an issue everything in my
house was connected to the Internet
mmm-hmm am I crazy do you have any
devices that aren't connected to the
Internet
well the that are required to be on the
internet or are you know that have the
ability to I mean I'm just saying like
every new device you buy connects to the
Internet anyway exactly
these are problematic for you have you
ever thought like man I really got to
get this thing off the Wi-Fi - to me the
only problem is if I'm unable to play
games when I lose right Internet connect
that would be bad that would be bad but
other than that it doesn't it's not a
huge deal for me right this part one of
these reports is come out since the
event has has finished is that all Xbox
one games have to be installed and if
you're a secondhand player you have to
pay a fee if you're if you're the second
person to have the game you have to pay
to install if something gives you their
game or more more likely you buy it if
you buy it used you have to pay to to
use it on your console is that confirmed
that that's based on the same Wyatt
report yeah that seems insane I'm also
being told by one of our writers that
developers can require that games are
always on yeah so yeah which I mean
that's a development choice in and if
they want to do that and it makes sense
right but it will impact that will
impact players yeah absolutely that fee
stuff is insane no this is insane to me
thank you so you're telling me I just
want to be clear like I go to a store i
buy i buy a game of $60 right i go home
i install it then i also so I can still
play it is that what they're saying
you can still play it even if I sell the
game see that is where that's that's the
interesting question
because if there's a fee if there's a
fee and I can just sell the game off and
continue to play it that sort of makes
more sense it would seem this to that
you could continue to play it without
the disc which seems really bizarre that
seems completely crazy to you but like
it what it does mean is that if I am at
a you know if I want to take a game over
to a friend's house to you know not that
I do that Oh cuz I'm thirty T or it's
all good but like if I you know wonder
that I don't do things that I have any
friends exactly but I would have to
throw my whole console into my my
backpack and lug it over to his place
because I'm not gonna be able to just
put the disc in to his right and and
play it I mean that is a scenario that
doesn't exist for most people I don't
think people can't bring in games every
maybe younger people I think they think
I don't know what people do these days I
think people do everything that's the
weird that's quite angry so so so but we
don't know if if if you can play the
game if you can actually get rid of the
game and continue to play it's um he's
just paying a fee by the way these are
are your pieces are like very loud here
through this I just unplugged yeah I was
a say we could turn it down it's not
important to the viewers at home but
they couldn't care less they actually
are glad that we're in pain but you know
it is it is you know I think we need to
figure out what the case is that but if
it's like you can't play the game and
somebody has to pay an additional fee
because they're buying a secondhand game
that seems crazy troubling it's probably
that's a very kind way what's the end
game there what is that like you they
don't want you to ever sell your games
well they don't they want to make sure
that they're making a slice off of every
game that's sold which again that I
think that's a legitimate issue I mean
that's why we had the you know that's
why we had online passes in the first
place is because they use a slice off of
I mean you know once I buy the game I've
paid the full price for the game the
full retail price right and they do
value on things does decrease over time
over time right so it's the same thing
you know is there I guess the reason is
like we expect everybody to buy it at
full price but I mean even they don't
sell it at full price two months after
the game comes out well the problem is
that when I buy it initially they're
getting
you know they're getting a slice of that
they get a taste right when I buy it
from Gamestop a month later for five
bucks cheaper or what have you the the
they're not getting any of that they
want their flavors with gamestop it's
not real well this if this is accurate
then this is a this isn't just a shot
across the bow GameStop this is well but
this to me by gamestop was an indirect
assume now that all this opens up a
whole new like market forward like
consumer to consumer salad well no
because you still would have to what's
the fee though well that that's a good
point actor the fee into the price of
their profit margins are not going to be
able to remain the same they're not
gonna be able to sell it game at five
dollars you got to cut out the middleman
is what I'm saying
right cuz you have a new middle net
right before his game stop is the
middleman and they would like take your
stuff give you a little bit of money for
it and then sell it to somebody for more
money and make a profit on it just pure
profit now you could sell it directly
but somebody's still going to make a
profit on it I'm actually more
comfortable with that scenario because
at least then my money is going to
people who are making games rather than
right noe maybe that's the goal maybe
the goal is like they want people to
sell them on eBay not a Gamestop oh man
oh that's wrong with that it's not I
mean it's just I'm gonna Pierre who can
online retailers let me go into a big
forest or Detailers when pets.com for
example what I need pet knows what
you're gonna get from there right
business anymore right what I put in
there but it's better
it had a puppet have you look let's see
I don't I'm thinking about buying calm
it's my pet smart spats mark its Pet
Smart
yeah yeah it's part of them to buy that
I was actually really upset dated that
we were doing this live stream because I
haven't been able to register any Xbox
one related URLs we're thinking which if
you say the money now they will be gone
they will be gone
they disappeared like you can you can
you we could convince people to buy bad
domains like Xbox Xbox one stuff calm
that's actually pretty good
it's box I'll stall all on games nothing
else appalled all right what else what
are other things we need to talk about
I'm looking at our I mean
and really it's kind of light there
shouldn't be more to talk about well
okay there's a there's a big NFL deal of
the big original content original
concert doing original they're doing a
halo show executive produced by Steven
Spielberg like a hit shows a smash or
Terra Nova they're doing they'll be
reopened smash on other of the xbox
they go you know here's the thing about
Microsoft they know their audience and
they said what does our audience want
and the answer is another season of
smash I'm gonna do a musical about halo
nothing you say it's gonna stop a
musical about halo I would see I would
watch harpy the hell out of so they have
NFL a deal with NFL which is gonna be
it's gonna be live games right
Plus augmented stuff stuff writing me
things around the game the football
players look out and play the screen say
that one was for a year over me and then
they turn around and on the back of
their jerseys there's a huge ax box load
your day but it it's all automated
reality NFL games is what's happening I
love it I mean look don't get me wrong
look I okay so II heart looks over the
halo show okay halo show is just a show
right it's a live-action TV experience
starring Master Chief I don't know that
Master Chief court on oh okay if the
back and said like like an actor's name
Master Chief Liam Hemsworth to be he's
not in it what what was that wrong
sorry sorry okay so ready how so but
they are doing original content which is
they're sort of doing a Netflix thing
yeah where they're like we want to make
we want to be a channel so they they
want to be your cable box they want to
be your original content provider they
want to be your game system and you
really happy if you and see what it's
not that big of a deal okay
um so we have dieter bone live from the
event there he is hey dieter can you
hear us
hey hey how are you you little quiet I
can't get her up we jam jam up his
balloon I'm doing great we were having
up his his DBS dieter
your initials I can I can talk about
loudly what what happened today what did
you see
I saw a short compact incredibly dense
hour of a ton of Xbox one news this was
the the polar opposite of what I
remember from from Sony's ps4 event they
just they just they got on rail and they
just ran they ran through a ton of
features super super fast do you think
that do you think that this was a
reaction to this shortness of this was
reaction to the ps4 event or maybe
generations also the world's best
commentary what's happening also maybe
commentary on on Google's three hour
like insane ioki no because I know that
I know that between about that yeah no I
would be surprised at all and it it was
almost a little bit too fast it was a
little bit hard to keep up and there
were a bunch of features that I wanted
to know more about especially the the
NFL stuff I would like to see a bit more
of that but overall you know I mean they
sort of were much better about like
giving you like specific concrete things
you could grab onto like hardware they
showed the hardware I think within the
first 10 minutes maybe even sooner than
that they they put it on stage right
away dude how did that hey it's Justin
macro we've never met but hello how are
you what did that look like important
its we were as we were watching the
presentation it was hard to tell at some
points with lights and things if it was
silver if it was black whose glossy how
did it look real and in person since
you've seen that we haven't so it it
looks like a combination of your 1980s a
VCR ladies in jail in 13 introducing it
it it looks like a thing that's meant to
fit under your TV like any other console
box like like a DVR I kind of say it's a
little bit uninspiring you know it's
it's glossy black plastic it's pretty
square and the right side there's events
all over the thing there's vents on the
top and on the sides and across the back
so this is not something you're gonna
want to set anything else on because I
imagine it kicks off a lot of heat it
actually looks like two different boxes
glued together yeah there was actually a
moment where we were we saw
one of their interviews where it does
kind of look like they did click and
when I when I first saw I almost thought
for a second are there two components
here is there like the drive component
and the rest of the comments I think
it's like a CD yeah well like Sega CD or
like a mini system you know where you
can put it side-by-side or you can stack
them put sonic Knuckles summit convenes
right beside you cut that thing down the
middle Kimmy Solomon style you probably
couldn't but I mean dieter was there
anything today was there a moment where
you were like I'm surprised about this I
didn't see this coming
so the you know I'm not a huge gamer i
don't i don't play PC games so I mean I
was expecting to be blown away by
graphics which is you know once you
expected an event like this but when
they started showing the the stuff from
the new Call of Duty ghosts there was a
moment when like I was watching the
cutscene I knew it was a cutscene and
then I was watching gameplay but I was
like am i am i watching gameplay yet I
wasn't sure and that was super
impressive it wasn't just like the faces
look more real it was also that like the
the movements of the characters and like
they just didn't seem like awkward video
game guys running they seemed like
actual humans running which was
impressive for me and and other
surprises I guess the biggest biggest
surprise really is this multitasking
feature where you can switch immediately
from a game to a TV show to launching ie
when he said launched Internet Explorer
and it popped up and you weren't you
didn't have to wait for it to load at
all that was shocking and if they can
really nail having you know quick switch
just like switching a channels with
these interactive experiences on it like
it genuinely could be a really important
centerpiece for the living room
so did you feel like any of the any of
the gaming stuff I've been at I asked
Brian this and I'm gonna ask you you
just can't escape it did you feel like
any of the gaming stuff I mean for me I
don't know I was a little bit
underwhelmed in the room there was there
did you feel like there was anything
that was truly impressive and and didn't
even seem like did it just feel like
this was just you know we got III come
in and it's not I mean it seemed like
they kind of brush it out of the way
pretty quick
yeah I'm pretty sure I heard people say
that we'll tell you Marty three six or
eight times and you know I think we saw
four games and you know the better
graphics but you know better graphics is
fine I want like a different experience
and they hinted that they're gonna do
that with that quantum break game you
know they had like actual physical
actors and then they cut to a video game
thing and if there'll be some
interesting interplay between that
that'll be cool but if it's just like
dragon's lair where if you make a choice
in the game then they show you a
different like acting scene afterwards
nitrogen alright Peter I know you have
to get back to covering this event and
so I appreciate you taking the time
we're gonna have more on the verge from
you there live none of those words made
it he says the secrets that I just said
them but get mad but the peter is peter
is at this moment going to do more
coverage of the new Xbox the Xbox one
which I can't get used to saying by the
way poor HTC dieter I'm sure you feel
their pain right now but yeah but thanks
for joining us and we'll see more stuff
from you on the site later on yes stay
tuned guys thanks bye that delays it's
too much Rose can handle yeah I have
such incredible technology all around us
I mean we're sitting we're surrounded by
there's at least one TV here that you
can see in the shot there's this thing
and yet we can't fix the delay yeah
where is it going where does it come yet
like what are we shooting that was
shooting it into space we actually are
actually yeah they don't know what's
happening so I feel like I'm weird but
I'm like hard pressed to think of things
that we haven't talked about with this
console like it just felt like a very
brief compact like he said compact
mm-hmm it's it's got a new oh it was
actually one thing that we were talking
about during that we didn't get answered
for us was the the controller they
showed off oh my god we have another
controller at all yeah yes yes - yes
you're not as I said before you were
good for nothing and I take it back back
I didn't hate on the air but I said it
repeatedly before we went a little bit
it got off the controller so so
it's an Xbox controller two buttons on
it do you understand these two buttons
I'm not totally since what I did not
understand there's the there's the
square with a square on top of it okay
uh-huh and then there's the lines
there's a line line button what do you
think those buds do I think one we
probably could find out if we give to
the internet right now yeah we put
outside of just browse yeah
this is the speed of things we are in
because our inability to read internet
right now we're like babies we're lost
in the wilderness really are and so we
don't need instead and the old days
people just gone and gotten an
encyclopedia and they could've told you
all about it I mean here's what we know
it's got impulse triggers so that was
big one for me whatever that and there's
a Wi-Fi stack inside of it there's a
stack of Wi-Fi in there yeah is that
good in the in what in the control it
you got a thing backups like is there
Wi-Fi in the controller it looks like
there's Wi-Fi in the controller that
says well you can control the game from
anywhere in your house Oh perfect right
if even if you're not in the same room
with the system okay Wi-Fi direct radio
stack yeah that's like guys are weird
that's a pager to call out okay but I
don't know I'm sure sorry I sure there
are uses for it I don't know what they
are but there's got to be something I
open my fridge connectivity to things
some using Wireless of the line dala day
the lines and this I'm assuming that the
because any of the functionality that
they have in the system also has to work
without connect right because you have
to be able to disable it well I think I
don't know it doesn't work without
connect to see that would be my question
maybe they ship the consoles with
connect so maybe those buttons are
filling in some of that gap for when
you're in a noisy
I mean room or something yeah I also
wonder if there's a if there's a
microphone in the controller at all or
something because I feel like the voice
recognition particularly if you're in a
crowded room or you're in a room with a
family or jerks that display their game
huge dicks I don't I don't know yeah I
don't I'm at a loss here I don't have an
answer for this question I don't know
what this begs today they know at home I
one takes you to something what does
something now we've got the Guide button
it's a little more oh it's definitely
there are definitely answers I'm sure
people are tweeting angrily at me right
now the default looks nice they've done
away with the weird circle pad thing oh
boy that is the circle at the top an
actual button that looks I would assume
that's the Guide button right that is
the Guide button yeah I think that
remains and it glows yeah and it hope
you can turn that off because I feel
like for dark room late night scary game
dark room playing you don't want to
light on your they can make what if they
can make it like pull Rob red Rob and
Paul's watch I'm into that I don't know
if it's colored or not no in there hey
that's a free ID that's a freebie for
for Microsoft and then of course we saw
call of duty ghosts yeah
which they just got damaged they don't
want people to take this game seriously
they want you to feel very emotional I
love it I do love that they're like
talking about like the deep they have
this director of the writer and director
or Syriana of Syriana which is a great
movie actually and and he's like they
really wanted this call dude a game to
have real emotion they want these
character of real emotion and then it's
just like that bobbing gun it's just you
see the hand of the gun and it's like
look at that way you can interact with
the world you can shoot now you can
shoot besides people you can shoot
schools of fish can be shot at you can
shoot actual bricks on a building yeah
what I'm gonna show you is get the
texture of bricks it hits actual bricks
and then they actually try to brag about
the emotional connection you're going to
have to your dog which is a is a is a
classic phone or you know that the dog
is brought back the dog is the worst
part to me it's like if you're gonna
make me have v to feel pain for I
already struggled with you know I've
been playing far cry 3 gonna take a
little detour here going I've been
playing far cry 3 and and in order
missus hang glider in order to in order
to get ahead in Far Cry 3 you have to
kill several thousand animals right to
make pouches for yourself so why don't
you sell me the pouch at the store like
I'll go get money I'll kill humans
happily and take money I prefer not to
get us a lot of this beautiful leopard
but not like
they make the animals all super
aggressive so they always attack you
which is nice this is a hell of a segue
out of what we were talking about but I
feel you know I feel bad for the animals
in Far Cry and I really know that I'm
gonna be feeling emotionally connected
that's with a K by the way okay
connected to to this dog that I'm gonna
have to take care of and he's gonna go
scouting for me and then so we can take
him hostage
well it's assuming it's easier because
there's more and I think that this is
sort of telling is that the fact that
they say we want you have an emotional
connection and part of the way we're
achieving that is that we're going to
put a dog in it it really what to me
speaks to the how difficult it is to
create those emotional connection
there's still that valley you know and
it's easier to abstract a dog out to a
point where you can write where it can
be believed I might as well basically
we're gonna put the old guy from up in
the game exactly he's gonna be your
companion to horrible career but we
don't really want an emotional
connection and we can't do with the
phases here yet so here's a cake here's
a dog there's a dog and the dogs gonna
whimper he's gonna get shot in the leg
and whimper and you'll have that choice
is gonna eat him it is it's gonna be one
of the missions where you have to
prepare the dog that's how just how
realistic it is but it is interesting
that that you're right it's kind of this
it is totally abstracted it's not you
know they didn't show how the humans are
going to a moat in some meaningful way
or that the story is going to be boat
captain dog and man they were maybe they
showed them the motion capture of the
dog back in a bit guy and they showed
the arm detail and this is what arms
looked like a monitor horn 430 these
arms those arms look good I like that
they won't compare it to what ghost
looks like on 360 because they're still
gonna try to sell you that one make sure
you definitely start by that and they're
still gonna sell the 360 which they
haven't they haven't really talked about
but we have from from Marc Whitten and
and they're selling the 360 alongside
this I don't know if they're gonna
change price points it seems like they
would I would have to raise 99 yeah
that's what I think that if that's gonna
become they're like Media Console you're
right like they're there with that well
no but it's like if you just want to
like do basic stuff and play some games
mm I feel like right of course that is
what the new one is so what's the what's
the matter what why would I buy it
perhaps why is anybody buy anything to
say Bob let's just go to the teepees oh
I don't know CP like like a the one you
would put out in for camping yeah
exactly
or whatever the teepees are done
whatever people do in teepee give me a
Wi-Fi direct stack put it in my TV I'm
said yes as long as it's got that stack
and we know TVs would make good Wi-Fi
enabled devices when you think about it
cuz they kind of have an antenna they
would be pursuit have got like a
structure that's built for transmitting
Wi-Fi data that's gonna do it for us
yeah are we wrapping up yeah we are
think that's you brian croissant a yet d
dab on your bone bone zone as i do refer
to him everybody and yeah Ross Miller
all the crew here everybody yeah you
guys prefer for witnessing but it can
only be described as a thing an event
and it's an exciting time in in gaming I
don't excited and I just want to say I
just want to say that polygon and the
verge will be doing a lot more coverage
oh boy today of this disgusting way more
in-depth coverage there's stuff coming
you don't even know what's about to
happen so continue to rapidly or I would
say obsessively refresh your tabs the
only two tabs you should have open at
this point which is polygons in the
verge just man just briefly refresh next
box polygons Xbox the verge the Xbox but
that's you that's you at home and then
you're gonna do this and it's gonna all
go away and you're gonna see the smiling
face of Steve Ballmer hovering waiting
in jail or guys thank you to everybody
yeah I'm gonna do for us goodbye thanks
