welcome to the future yeah you were in
the password what this is the future
we're not we're no longer on the same
timeline I'm actually having schisms
yeah old time will jump at Diane
Torrance rother house five star exactly
that's what my grandma died again this
guy that's not cool but maybe you'll go
back and see her be born again would be
beautiful in that be nice my symmetry
I'm Josh Topolsky and this is Justin
McElroy of course who else would it be
it's not like I mean this could be ross
miller but it's not this time your
schism your timeline yeah rock we see
when we cross streams anyhow so we're
back after following the incredible
breathtaking emotional emotional
definitely um xbox one event TV heavy
what do you think may not me I am ready
to watch TV again I stopped watching TV
for a long time but now I'm ready no you
did fine what you're looking for I can
finally find some shows your void with
no it was their Airy it was a very
interesting comfortably didn't first off
we didn't get into games for about 30
minutes yeah game it was very light very
light relatively why I mean very known
quantities call of duty FIFA that was so
that was the interesting that the
features they show the connectivity and
stuff like that is is definitely much
more of a mass-market play I think then
Sony was was showing up during their
should week should we talk about like so
they started the event with make sure
the hardware before anything they sure
the hardware and the controller they
kind of like got into it and then they
very quickly went into TV and connect
functionality and there was a big
emphasis on gesture controls voice
controls and I feel like the thing that
people hear that you and I see most
excited about at the at first and other
people in the room was the whatever the
pinch to get ya something was like so
the Kinect is always watching you always
and always listening is that is the xbox
off connected care gonna keep watch the
so but in
and the xboxes is you can it's always on
like you wake it up by speaking to it
but its never fully asleep remember
Foley out oh it's always so it's
listening to you all the time at home
perfect and watching you perfect 2013
I'm ready dude yeah yg striker your
limit j-man fully nude yeah he's gonna
be like that's a great outfit hey listen
I'd like to recommend this new fitness
game we got not saying it's not be good
yeah like it's not casual uh maybe we're
trying exercises you you just said for
me to order your pizza are you sure you
want me to I'm not so sure I don't know
the ones still over there look I mean
but they didn't really address that
better that is no case it will be like
sort of a way so let's start with the TV
stuff yeah the illegal of interest what
do you think um it just seems so strange
to me because first off the the first TV
integration they showed off was actually
the ability to switch to live TV right
which is interesting from a perspective
of like connectivity I'm it's cool that
on to switch input I guess that's kind
of neat right one controller yeah that's
cool to have a guide a guide yet built
into it but who is I just didn't know
people were watching live TV I mean I
know that I know that people are
obviously still watching live tuition to
that but in terms of like a
forward-looking trend that we want to
get out in front of I mean they used
gesture and voice commands to switch to
a price is right Wow it was like that
when they first demoed how amazing it
was you could switch in a live she was
like the most dated right program that
you could possibly come up with and and
you know it's not their fault I mean it
was live TV mm-hmm but that's I think
you know it was interesting that they
had such an emphasis on that I mean
first off it's hdmi passthrough so
they're so it's not like there's some
how becoming your cable box like you
still need your cable box yet to get the
content onto there I think that there
their whole deal though is like we just
want to be you don't we'd only have any
other boxes right if you can help it in
your living room besides this thing and
it even kind of has like the design of
the hardware's kind of looks like it was
like a VCR I'm trying to get excited
about but that was the main sticking
point that I noticed early on was we had
it the controller looks great I
looks very much like you would you would
expect like an Xbox yeah and the the I
the the the brand new Kinect looks it
was a lot sleeker a lot more you know
compact it seems it's hard to scale yeah
but the box itself who wit book I mean
maybe this is the baby this just um sort
of reaffirms Sony's decision to not even
show a box yeah like does the box matter
I mean the truth is doesn't matter the
xbox is ugly the old xbox the first the
first the 36 notice we can call xbox one
original xbox crime is that was ugly the
xbox 360 i think is pretty ugly you like
it mmm now I mean I like the black a lot
more than I like the white inhales okay
yeah but but yeah the newer one you mean
this yeah another time was it called
yeah like s yes and then and then so
this is like actually kind of nicer but
it also looks like an htpc in the very
looks like something you might buy a new
egg if you're building like a home
theater it looks like socks that anybody
would be comfortable putting into a home
theater senator it doesn't say kitty it
doesn't say you're right right but but
you know anyhow that's that's beside the
point inside x86 eight core GPUs and
that memory it has memory Oh storage
definitely USB 3.0 oh yeah another
liberated blu-ray drive they caved on
that yeah they gave in like Microsoft
was like look if we're gonna be the
center of your home entertainment
situation like we're gonna have to give
you the blu-ray drive Oh or else you're
gonna buy sony prop in a tough meeting
you're gonna get ya they're like luxury
we the HD DVD thing didn't go great for
us we're just gonna try putting it in
what does this slide is in there but
but yeah I don't know I'm a little
underwhelmed by crazy for feeling that
way your a games guy your video game is
definitely not a there was I would not
say there was a big idea in terms of of
gaming I mean if your if you care about
gaming primarily I mean it apparently
will look better the the integration of
some of those other services into games
but they even that wasn't really shown
for gaming it was shown as it back up to
your TV experience what I think that
people want more than a supplemented
gaming experience that's that's pretty
odd they really emphasize the voice
control and the ability to switch
between things and even have that little
split screen sort of experience where
you can check some stuff out or make a
skype call I don't know to me it's just
like are people just like man i wish i
could be making skype calls while I'm
watching and move it it was weird about
it as it is in a the press release it
says something like you know watch it
play a game played like your favorite
action game while watching a movie at
the same time and it's like this is it a
future areas that I'm missing the people
are having where they're doing that
thing because to me that's like I want
to watch a movie or play a game and like
those don't need to be happening I get
pretty on the attention span especially
but when I'm by myself I wouldn't mind
having another diversion on the side of
the TV and the guy I'm serious Yeah Yeah
Yeah right while you're watching TV
while I'm watching TV I want to be doing
something else let me play real bad
player Gary whole scene here we're gonna
have to have a skype call while you're
watching movie yeah that doesn't sound
that well maybe TV show maybe not a
minute but a TV show my dad wants to
call and ask me how the episode of
justified I'm like that guy are you
watching justified I am I watched the
first few episodes I don't know not
didn't Ken's it take more time let's
just talk about justified yes what do
you guys think John hey what just what I
wouldn't what is your take on it I mean
olifant by the way to see other I've
said this for a long time he should have
if he doesn't have a fan club called
olefins yeah yeah that I right to make
that happen but so a lot of TV stuff uh
which was great I mean that it seemed
like the voice control worked really
well the guide seem really great like
the discoverability
of content and like recommendations and
all that stuff seemed really do
switching between all these
ramifications so yeah very fast uh and
then they got into game I mean there's
not a lot to say except like they've got
a hugely improve what it looks like a
hugely improved entertainment / TV
watching experience yeah and that which
looks great yes like a great way to
experience TV and then they got into
gaming I gotta say I I did not at the at
the ps4 event I felt like I said there
were glimmers of actual gameplay and I
was like this is really impressive like
this feels what was it was Killzone that
the game that they showed off that
somebody actually played on stage yeah
but seems statistically kill zone is
killed in an actual name of the game
franchise memory did I just make that
island memory condition where I actually
instantly forget kills on yeah anybody
Killzone roulette well anyhow they
showed off gameplay at the PlayStation
event I was like you know guys say this
does look vast and really detailed I do
feel like I saw any of that today it's a
microsoft event and no III they're gonna
have all the games you know back to the
call of duty if that was like the most
graphically impressive stuff that they
showed well it's also hard because the
only things we shall saw that they were
cinematics i mean even if they were
being presented in the gameplay engine
right you weren't seeing what it you
know you weren't able to they're using
jump cut these music yeah there it you
don't get a sense of what it would be
like to actually play the the game so
disappearing footage from this is act
this is really good this is quantum
break which apparently is part
television series part game yeah and
like unclear like if this if this is
rendered it is pre-rendered or rendered
in real time if it's in real time it's
pretty amazing yeah pretty awesome you
guys seem to think this was not
unattainable for real time but we don't
really see there's a little bit of we
don't know if it's this game play here
or not this is like a cinematic this is
x ray isaac you have to actually human
that's a human this is not an actual
human remedy who made Alan Wake which
actually integrated a lot of FMV into
the game itself so an integrated
approach for these guys is it makes a
lot of so yeah and have to say Alan Wake
I played like crazy yeah and I thought
it was very
all done the way they blended those two
things I mean I have no doubt these guys
at the capability of making a great game
it's just like getting trying to get a
sense of what the games will be like
what they look like what the actual feel
of it how it'll be different from what
we've already seen is tough and I think
we talked about this a little bit it's
also tough because we are all we've all
seen pc games on really great rigs and
this is basically what we're looking at
well it's part of the problem with
waiting so long in between two
generations is that pcs have had such a
long time to sort of advanced beyond
this that I don't think you're you're
going to be wowed by a lot of what you
saw and and you and I were talking about
this during the stream the jump is just
not going to be like it was when we went
from SD to HD or even you know 16-bit up
to PlayStation that was a huge I mean
that was a big jump we're not going to
go into coming from 16-bit to
PlayStation that was one rice was a huge
deal and I don't think you're gonna see
it's always going to feel more
incremental from this point on because
you're also running up against the cost
to actually make all these great assets
may God draw the polygons that's it seem
like I mean it seems like you know there
was a period I mean a long period where
off-the-shelf was in an option there was
no like off-the-shelf testbed for this
stuff you couldn't just come up with hey
we're gonna put these components
together and we're gonna have an
amazingly powerful gaming computer right
me people had to actually custom build I
mean they had to custom build the
components to make a great video game
system right you know is it going to
take I mean I wonder is there going to
be some quantum leap when somebody
actually says look we created something
that nobody else has and we're building
for this game system you know dude will
that happen again are we always going to
be on the track where it's just like the
iterative process of PC hardware well
there has to be some sort of as almost
we're in sort of a to console fight
there's always going to be some parity
like it's going to be hard to have
anybody make any sort of titanic jump
without the other person because it
doesn't make sense to develop games that
i can only be played on one if you're
not in exclusive deal speaking of
exclusive deal that was one piece of
gaming information that i was actually
pretty excited about is that they said
they were going to have in the first
year of the system which
is is actually before holiday of 2014's
holiday in the next holiday 15 exclusive
games uh eight of which are new this is
a little disheartening they say new
franchises which boy what I really get
what I charming whimsical way to talk
about video game a new McDonald's for
you right I'm transmedia it's just going
to me yeah it's like it's like why not
just announced the force equals now
exactly I just tell me about the novel
it is that is I mean that is exciting I
mean the franchise part but not the
franchise part but but the idea that
there's going to be some original and
we're going to see a ton of that at e3
of course they want to keep something in
the tank for their I just it seems to me
that when you're looking at something
like this and this kind of like tone
setting event and you actually started
out which I thought was smart with with
a sort of tone video with lots of
celebrities and people who worked on
games my man j allard was up in there
and if they're setting a tone with this
kind of event and the first half is TV
you know and then there's 10 minutes of
games and then they're back talking
about TV again like that to me as a
gamer primarily it's kind of a worrying
tone I mean I know that it's just that
but I get well that's the ton there's I
mean I think it's obvious that they have
to Microsoft has to own this space right
you know clearly google wants to be
there they've tried with Google TV then
you want to be in the living room Apple
is obviously like supposedly going to
try to get there Microsoft has been you
know they've not had a great couple of
years in terms of like stamping out
space in new markets or in markets where
they used to dominate right they're not
doing great with phones I mean they're
in third place now apparently but still
not like doing what Android and iPhone
are doing tablets I don't think the
surface is that much of an impact pc
sales are on the decline and a lot of
people aren't crazy about Windows 8 to
you know solid OS but they're not it's
not like Microsoft is just clearly
dominating everywhere you know search
they're not dominating like they're not
necessarily like as robust on the
internet as they want to be like but the
xbox has been just a completely separate
product for them
terms of right done well you know maybe
not dominance but just a superior
excellent product that many many people
in millions of people love and want to
use and have a tremendous affection for
so I feel like you know this is a place
where they not only have to keep that
moving right they bring all those people
along with them but they have to say
like we're all so this is a place where
we can and will succeed because we know
how to do it in the living room becoming
like this entertainment hub so today's
announcement felt very much like it was
you know it was almost like hey you know
we can do games like we've got great
franchises we have great hardware like
that's a foregone conclusion but we
really want to say we beat people to
this solution for TV which i think is
like weird because TV seems like I don't
know I we're doing a live TV I don't
watch that much live TV I kind of hate
flipping through channels and most of my
watching is like I heard something is
good or I know something's good i want
to go find it and watch it or I've dvr'd
something I'm going to watch it so you
know this doesn't necessarily add a lot
to the I mean to the live TV experience
like I'm not going to watch more TV now
because of it right and and I think that
you're right in that I not a lot of time
spent on gaming but as you say they mean
if you're if you like video games you're
going and you're in a financial position
where you can afford it you will buy one
of these like they don't really have to
sell that Markham and they've proven
concretely I think that they are the
channel for that now are they are they
showing me a strategy that says how
they're going to continue to and this I
think is one of the things that was
missing knit outside of specific games
are they showing a strategy that says
this is how we're going to continue to
stay relevant in a gaming industry that
is moving right so fast right I mean
they've showed stuff like this
illumiroom demo which to me is you guys
are talking about on the pre-show to me
is like really like if you showed
consumers that experience and you told
them that you can make it happen and it
would be easy I feel like consumers
would be like whoa this is a completely
different gaming experience right I've
known before this is a weird immersive
gaming experience they didn't really
show we know the kinect they said it's
it's more here
room footage right here we know the
Kinect is going to be higher resolution
more sensitive you know I don't feel
like Kinect certainly not penetrated I
mean I think it has a great penetration
in terms of consumer adoption but it's
not like it's a brand new home you know
new world graphically speaking I don't
think we saw anything that was
necessarily better than what Sonja
showing off so the question is you know
how do you do that is it is it those
franchises just like we have the best
content that's like that was part of the
message yeah another part of the the
message that was noticeably absent was
any mention of the the xbox 360 yeah and
how that that fits into the overall Xbox
world wired had a report that the new
xbox has no we actually have a deal oh
we have a report on it you have a report
well yeah I talk about work I talk to
marc whitten and one of the questions
right I lost him and he was very clear
that at this point there's no backwards
compatibility for the 360 and the day
i'ma hit this and they're actually gonna
be selling the 360 they're gonna
continue to sell the 360 alongside this
new xbox was called 11 ya know what's
that the Year donut and so I think
that's I was a little surprised I guess
a guy who's invested a lot of money in
xbox 360 games and as a guy who wants to
reduce the amount of consoles that I
have in my living room uh it's a little
disheartening they don't have some
option here obviously it's different
hardware right but some streaming option
or some kind of like we're gonna be back
filling these titles in some way
anything at all yeah or like here will
give you credit for some new game it's
like throughout me about I thought that
was actually really surprised I mean I
know that the expectation was it's not
me backwards compatible but I just feel
like there should be some little like
give me a little bit of a breadcrumb
towards some like me not trashing the
entire life James I said it before it's
really it's bad for preservation it's
bad for keeping gaming relevant it makes
it seem so so much like a commodity the
you know I use these games off steam box
of peas yeah and I play them like I go
back to old games
and I do that and it just seems like I
don't know it may be the minor thing
maybe it's for nerds only maybe we're
going to be the only guys in the world
who are pissed off about it but if
you're gonna have me spend they didn't
have the price we should say no price no
release date yet is it this year's year
so they means all I mean like November
black friday it'll be in stores yeah
it's not they blew it if if the honest
and out if this is it it stores for
black friday microsoft blew the console
words ever like any bit in in some ways
would be very badly out no member it'll
be definitely november um but no price
probably gonna be like what 500 or 99
hey sounds over so you know I spent a
bunch of money on my games now spent
five hundred dollars on this yes the
experiences would be great it just would
be nice if like I'd have to retire my
entire library and I understand there's
an argument to be made for well people
won't buy as many new games if they can
play all the old games on the system
break that I mean that's a very sort of
weird to me that's a better version to
watch I mean that's a reason to buy it's
like I get all the new stuff plus my old
stuff why would I keep why would I
continue to have the other ones sitting
around I'm gonna buy this new console
and move slide into the next generation
I actually have a lot less patience for
the downloadable games not being
backwards compatible I mean to be able
to download my I feel like I bought
those and I feel like I own the right
and they're not even like a disc that I
can like what about the xbox like what
about the the arcade stuff I mean all of
it apparently yeah that's in see that
seems crazy that's pretty de specially
since they were like sort of harping on
you know all of their you know all of
their you know these operating systems
they kept talking about three operating
systems yeah those odd there's three
os's there's a Windows kernel and then
there's the xbox Oh some variants and
then there's the thing that switches
between them and it sounds like kind of
 it sounded like the that we're
explaining the technology in the system
the way my physician wife explains
medical things to me like you basically
have to it's like a train that's in your
body they stake out a sick way exactly
no I mean it seems like an
oversimplified I mean like it's
abstracted so far that it doesn't really
mean is you're running though so it's
linux
mac and windows on this like you know
they're all running a yeah like are
you yeah I'd anyhow but so i don't i
don't really know I don't really know
what that means completely now we have
we have somebody that we're gonna bring
in whose for who we bringing in as a
guest here are you hearing something Oh
Brian Brian sent it oh I I know
something from a polygon no look at this
hey there is Ryan can you hear us no
again yes you can there's a massive
delay so this was gonna be awesome I can
put a little delay i think a little boy
yes Brian what was it like in the room
it was it was actually a surprisingly
small room it had about eight rows not a
lot of people in there and a lot of
Microsoft people i think in the back
because there was a lot of eruptions of
applause that odd like odd moments in
the presentation perhaps even
pre-planned moments in the presentation
possibly possibly they had people
applauding for specific things i
couldn't tell what they were applauding
for but yeah it was it was an
interesting sort of setting where it was
not a lot of people there but enough for
us to kind of get an idea of what was
going on and then just sort of this
backdrop of what had to be i think
employees who were sort of filling in
the silence with applause now game
journalists are incapable of not
beginning to critique something like
literally the moment it ends i have you
talked to anybody else was in the room
is there a sense of the tone of the of
their reaction to the to the
announcement so far yeah you know
actually the people i've talked to have
all been pretty positive i think a lot
of people i ran into some of the penny
arcade guys I was talking to them they
really liked it there one critique was
why they went with USB 3 and not some
other sort of input so that was I think
a joke critique but I think in general
people were I wouldn't say confused but
they're basically they want more
information this is a very a
presentation that painted with very
broad strokes so we got a sense of some
of the stuff going on but there's still
a lot of questions we all have about a
lot of the particulars I so we were
talking about the game
kind of what we saw of gaming did you
you know was there a moment did you see
something that felt like real gameplay
to you where you got a taste of what
this thing was capable of from a
graphics perspective because it was kind
of hard I mean watching the stream of a
sort of hard to distinguish what was pre
rendered or what was a cinematic versus
like any gameplay they really didn't
show any gameplay was there a moment
where there was a kind of like oh wow or
a gasp and people really got a sense of
what this thing could do there were no
gasps at all but I think that that
wasn't because people were not impressed
with what was going on I think again
they were sort of just sitting there
absorbing I mean there was it was one
hour and they didn't just present a new
console but they it presented like
something that obviously touches on a
lot of things outside of gaming in terms
of gameplay what we saw a lot of it did
look to me like pre-rendered stuff for
is up I think there was a moment where
they cut to real gameplay because it
looked real I mean it looked like
something that was happening in the game
the EA sports stuff to me looked a lot
like CGI I think ghosto gave us their
best look at what some gameplays going
to look like and that was pretty
impressive but honestly for me at least
as a gamer I'm at the point where I'm
not going to buy a console based on how
pretty the graphics are I'm gonna buy a
console based on the experience and what
else they're bringing to the table
beyond just you know what the game looks
like so so what's your take on this
versus that what you saw the ps4 is this
was this more compelling than what Sony
showed off yeah i mean i think they told
us a lot more about the console then the
playstation 4 then so needed during the
playstation 4 presentation I feel like
the sony sort of went into that and I
kind of think their philosophy is hey
entertainment hey TV hey movies we can
all get along let's see how we can all
work together we're gonna we're going to
sort of figure out a way where we can
share the audience Microsoft went in and
said no we're going to be the experience
and if you want to do anything with our
users you have to go through us and
whether or not you like that I approach
it's certainly a very direct approach
and it's one that can add something to
the experience so their idea is I think
you know let's take TV and add a little
bit of gaming experience to TV and let's
take movies and music and everything
else and essentially say gamma fight but
give
an element of gaming so essentially
gaming becomes one more channel one more
press button on your remote you know you
go from watching king of the game of
thrones to watching you know mad men to
playing call of duty ghosts and it's as
easy just pushing a button all right
that's what they want to do Brian let me
ask you something first off I wanted to
tell you that i took the notepad from
your desk and I borrowed your pen and I
didn't ask so for that I'm sorry I want
to apologize for that up front sorry
about that that's it I used a whole page
scribbling up what are you at we're
getting ready to go into III here in a
just a couple short weeks what do you
feel like you still need to hear from
from Microsoft about Xbox what are the
big lingering questions for you these
two one answer well I mean the obvious
one is the price and the release date
but I think also today it sounds like
looking at the schedule we're going to
get a lot more detail on some of the
broad strokes that they already sort of
laid out for us so we're going to find
out a lot more about how Xbox is going
to work we're going to find out about
backwards compatibility something that
they didn't talk about I would assume
because it wasn't brought up that it
won't be in the game in the xbox one
that they won't have a backwards
compatibility ah it's been probably
today going to be talking a little bit
more about oh do they did they confirm
that it's apt in there yeah it's not
good and affirmed yeah it wasn't in the
announce we had I talked to mark Whitten
so duh see he confirmed it and yeah so
that's not surprising I mean it's
disappointing but I think ultimately
it's something they'll only hurt them
for a small segment of people for a
short period of time but going into III
what I really want to see is I want to
see all these bells and whistles they've
been talking about and all these great
games no one seemed combined I don't
want to see a fancier looking call of
duty I want to see a game that I could
not play in my xbox 360 not just one
that looks different than my xbox 360
but something that's so compelling that
would make me want to buy a completely
new console so make it feel like it's a
new gaming so I have a question actually
going for both of you sorry I'm this
delay is insane but and I want Brian I
want to hear your take on this
for developers I mean we didn't really
hear anything about we know whether the
barrier to entry for developing for the
one will be different than what has been
previously the state of xbox 360 which
is like a pretty high barrier to entry
this is not an app store you know this
is not like submit your stuff and it
gets on there and you know this is
clearly a super powerful computer right
it's not just this is a you know has
many many functions that go way beyond
just gaming so did you have you gotten
any impression from anybody there do you
have any sense of and this is for either
one of you guys any sense of whether or
not they're going to lower the barrier
to entry and make development for this
console more straightforward than it was
particularly for small developers I mean
I think I think they have to I don't
know if they're going to day it's
interesting that it's not something they
talked about now on the one hand they
could say look this was supposed to be a
presentation that wasn't about games
oddly enough they snuck a lot of games
into this presentation but they didn't
it all address that question which is I
think a question that's incredibly
important to this coming generation of
consoles and that is can it really
support indie games can it find the next
minecraft or the next you know Angry
Birds and support it in a way that
doesn't require developers to put so
much effort into trying to get their
game onto the system and yeah that's a
huge question it's something they didn't
talk about it all so hopefully we're
going to hear about it either today or
at e3 well Brian I know you need to get
going to more coverage and Justin I need
to get back to our hilarious banter
which was and are justified recap so yes
everybody yeah we got a lot of justified
to talk about but thanks for taking the
time to to talk to us and obviously you
guys are gonna have more stuff today so
we'll keep our eyes on polygon and I
expect a full deep emotional editorial
from you by the end of the divide was j
allard in the room can you confirm for
me whether or not Jarrod was in the room
i I saw Phil Harrison does that count
he's like a tall jailer does that work
doesn't does not count that is not I've
it in the vicinity of County naughty
thank you for leaving us on that sour
note Brian sorry thanks thank you to it
so so something that something we should
talk about is there there was this sort
of controversy about always on you know
if the console would need to be
connected all the time to the Internet
if it would be a requirement to play
games that apparently is not the case
mmm according to Wired I'm reading this
on polygon but you guys you guys are
citing wired here I think and I don't
know this to me is not an issue
everything in my house is connected to
the Internet mm-hmm am I crazy do you
have any devices that are connected to
the Internet well that are required to
be on the internet or are you know that
have the ability to I mean I'm just
saying like every new device you buy
connects to the Internet same way
exactly is it problematic for you have
you ever thought like man I really got
to get this thing off the Wi-Fi to to me
the only problem is if I'm unable to
play games when I lose right internet
kinda that would be bad that would be
bad but other than that it doesn't um
it's not a huge deal for me right this
part one of these reports that has come
out since the event has has finished is
that all xbox one games have to be
installed and if you're a second hand
player you have to pay a fee if you're
if you're the second person to have the
game you have to pay to install if
something gives you their game or more
more likely you buy it if you buy it
used you have to pay to to use it on
your consoles that confirmed that that's
based on the same Wyatt report you that
seems insane I'm also being told by one
of our writers that developers can
require that games are always on yeah so
yet which I mean that's a development
choice in and if they want to do that
and make sense right but it will impact
that will impact players yeah absolutely
that Effie stuff is insane though this
is insane to me thank you so you're
telling me I just want to be clear like
I go to a store I vici gaming sixty
dollars right I got home I install it
then I oh so so I can still play it is
that what they're saying you can still
play it even if i sell the game see that
is where that's that's the interesting
question
because if the if there's a fee if
there's a fee and I can just sell the
game off and continue to play it that
sort of makes more sense it would seem
this tube that you could continue to
play it without the disc which seems
really bizarre that seems completely
crazy too but like it what it does mean
is that if I am at a you know if I want
to take a game over to a friend's house
to you know not that I do that up cuz
I'm 32 years all good but like if I you
know what if I don't do things that have
any friends exactly but i would have to
throw my whole console into my my
backpack and lug it over to his place
because i'm not gonna be able to just
put the disc in to his right and and
play it i mean that is a scenario that
doesn't exist for most people i don't
think people can't bring in games are a
maybe younger people i think they think
I don't know what people do these days I
I think people do everything that's the
weird that's quick Congress so so so but
we don't know if if if you can play the
gay if you can actually get rid of the
game and continued to play it amis just
paying a fee by the way these are our
your piece are like very loud right here
to this I didn't unplug yeah I was a way
we could turn it down it's not important
to the viewers at home but they couldn't
care less they actually are glad that
were in pain um but you know it is it is
you know I think we need to figure out
what the case is that but if it's like
you can't play the game and somebody has
to pay an additional fee because they're
buying a secondhand game that seems
crazy troubling it's probably that's
very kind wait what's the endgame there
what is that like you they don't want
you to ever sell your games well they
don't they want to make sure that
they're making a slice off of every game
that sold which again that I think
that's a legitimate issue I mean that's
why we had the you know that's why we
had online passes in the first place is
because they use what can I mean I to
slice off of I mean you know once i buy
the game I've paid the full price for
the game the full retail price right and
they do value on things does decrease
over time over time right so it's the
same thing you know is there I guess the
reason is like we expect everybody to
buy it at full price but I mean even
they don't sell it at full price two
months after the game comes out well the
problem is that when i buy it initially
they're getting
you know they're getting a slice of that
they get a taste right when I buy it
from gamestop a month later for five
bucks cheaper or what have you the the
they're not getting any of that they
want their flavors with gamestop it's
not real well this if this is accurate
then this is a this isn't just a shot
across the bow gamestop this is well but
this to me by gamestop was an
interactive so now that all this opens
up a whole new like market for like
consumer-to-consumer salad well no
because you still would have to leave
any so what's the fee though well that
that's a good point actor the fee into
the price of their profit margins are
not going to be able to remain the same
they're not gonna be able to sell it
game at five dollars you got to cut out
the middleman saying right cuz you have
a new middle net right before his game
stop is the middle mad and they would
like take your stuff give you a little
bit of money for it and then sell it to
somebody for more money and make a
profit on it just pure profit now you
could sell it directly but somebody's
still going to make a profit on it I'm
actually more comfortable with that
scenario because at least then my money
is going to people who are making games
rather than right no maybe that's the
goal maybe the goals like they want
people to sell them on ebay not a
gamestop oh man i'm not wrong with that
it's not i mean it's just I'm gonna peer
who contribute online retailers let me
go into a bit more sore detailers when
pets.com for example what I need pet
know what you're gonna get from there
right then I'm business anymore right
what I put in there but it's best com it
had a puppet have you look let's see
right I don't I'm fed about by tom it's
my pet smart dogs petsmart its petsmart
yeah yeah it's more of them to buy that
I was actually really upset dated that
we were doing this live stream because I
haven't been able to register any Xbox
one related URLs we're thinking which is
if you say the money now they will be
gone they will be gone they really
disappeared like you could you could you
we could convince people to buy bad
domains like xbox Xbox one stuff com
that's actually pretty good I think of
it exclaimed xbox I'll stall Oh on games
no that's a health the pole alright what
else what are other things we need to
talk about I'm looking at our I mean
really it's kind of light there should
be more to talk about well okay there's
a mess there's a big NFL deal of the big
original content original Congress doing
originals are doing a halo show
executive produced by Steven Spielberg
like a hit shows a smash or terra nova
they're doing they'll be real pain smash
on Andre of the xbox Frank season they
go you know here's the thing about
Microsoft they know their audience and
they said what does our audience want
and the answer is another season of
smash I'm gonna do a musical about halo
nothing you say it's gonna stop a
musical about halo I would see I would
watch her pee that hell out of so they
have NFL a deal with NFL which is going
to be it's gonna be live games right
plus augmented stuff stuff buying me
things around the game the football
players look out and play the screen say
that one was for year FFA and then they
turn around in the back of their jersey
there's a huge Xbox load your day but it
if it it's all the augmented reality NFL
games is what's half a day I love it I
mean look don't get me wrong look I ok
so a hard lets up with a halo show ok
halo show is just a show right it's a
live-action TV experience starring
Master Chief I don't know that bastard
chief court on oh ok is back said like
like an actor's name Master Chief Liam
Hemsworth to be he's not in it what what
was that wrong sorry sorry ok um so
ready how so but they are doing original
content which is there sort of doing a
netflix thing yeah where they're like we
want to make we want to be a channel so
they want to be your cable box they want
to be your original content provider
they want to be your game system well
their video we can be your gaze and you
really have to play go if you insist not
that big of a deal play games tom so we
have dieter bohn live from the event uh
there he is hey dieter can you hear us
hey hey how are you you little quiet I
can't get her up we jam jam up his
volume I'm doing great we were have up
his DBS dieter your initials I can I can
talk more lovely what what happened
today what did you see
I saw a short compact incredibly dense
hour of a ton of xbox one news this was
the the polar opposite of what I
remember from from Sony's ps4 event they
just they just they got on rail and they
just ran they ran through a ton of
features super super fast do you think
that do you think that this was a
reaction to this shortness of this was
reaction to the ps4 event for maybe
generation also the world's best
commentary what's happening also maybe
commentary on on Google's three-hour
like insane I okie know because I know
that I know that uh people might be
tweeting about that ya know I wouldn't
be surprised at all and it it was almost
a little bit too fast it was little bit
hard to keep up and there were a bunch
of features that I wanted to know more
about especially the the NFL stuff I
would like to see a bit more of that but
overall you know I mean they sort of
were much better about like giving you
like specific concrete things you could
grab onto like hardware they showed the
hardware I think within the first 10
minutes maybe even sooner than that they
they put it on stage right away dude how
did that deter hey it's justin macro
we've never met but hello how are you I
what did that look like in person it's
we were as we were watching the
presentation it was hard to tell at some
points with lights and things if it was
silver if it was black as glossy how did
it look real and in person since you've
seen that we haven't so it it looks like
a combination of your 1980s a VCR ladies
in jail in 13 introducing our it it it
looks like a thing that's meant to fit
under your TV like any other console box
like like a DVR I got to say it's a
little bit uninspiring you know it's
glossy black plastic it's pretty square
and the right side there's events all
over the thing there's vents on the top
and on the sides and across the back so
this is not something you're going to
want to set anything else on because I
imagine it kicks off a lot of heat it
actually looks like two different boxes
glued together yeah there was actually a
moment where we were we saw
one of their interviews where it does
kind of look like they did like it when
I when I first saw I almost thought for
a second are there two components here
is there like the drive component and
the rest of the guys I think it's like a
CD yeah a clutter like Sega CD or like a
mini system you know where you can put
it side-by-side or you can stack them
put sonic knuckle sama candles right
decidedly cut that thing down the middle
Kimmy Solomon style you probably
couldn't um but I mean dieter was there
anything today was there a moment where
you were like I'm surprised about this I
didn't see this coming so the you know
i'm not a huge gamer i don't i don't
play pc games so i mean i was expecting
to be blown away by graphics which is
you know what you expected an event like
this but when they started showing the
the stuff from the new call of duty
ghosts there was a moment when like I
was watching the cutscene I knew it was
a cutscene and then I was watching
gameplay but I was like am I am i
watching gameplay yet I wasn't sure and
that was super impressive it wasn't just
like the faces look more real it was
also that like the the movements of the
characters and like they just didn't
seem like awkward video game guys
running they seem like actual humans
running which was impressive for me and
and other surprises I guess the biggest
biggest surprise really is this
multitasking feature where you can
switch immediately from a game to a TV
show to launching ie when he said
launched internet explorer and it popped
up and you weren't you didn't have to
wait for it to load at all that was
shocking and if they can really nail a
having you know quick switch just like
switching channels with these
interactive experiences on it like it
genuinely could be a really important
centerpiece for the living Earth so did
you feel like any of the any of the
gaming stuff i've been at i asked brian
this and I'm gonna ask you you just
can't escape it did you feel like any of
the gaming something for me i don't know
i was a little bit underwhelmed in the
room there was there did you feel like
there was anything that was truly
impressive and and didn't even seem like
did it just feel like this is just you
know we got III coming and it's not i
mean it seemed like they kind of brush
it out of the way pretty quick
yeah I'm pretty sure I heard people say
they will tell you more day three six or
eight times and you know I think we saw
four games and you know the better
graphics but you know better graphics
it's fine i want like a different
experience and they hinted that they're
going to do that with that quantum break
game you know they have like actual
physical actors and then they cut to a
video game thing and if there'll be some
interesting interplay between that
that'll be cool but if it's just like
dragon's lair where if you make a choice
in the game then they show you a
different like acting scene afterwards I
become the greatest concentration
alright dieter I know you have to get
back to covering this event and so I
appreciate you taking the time we're
gonna have more on the verge from you
there live none of those words made it
he says secrets that I just said them
but get mad by the theater is peter is
at this moment going to do more coverage
of the new xbox the xbox one which I
can't get used to saying by the way poor
HTC dieter I'm sure you feel their pain
right now but uh yeah but thanks for
joining us and we'll see more stuff from
you on the site later on yeah stay tuned
guys thanks and by that delays it's too
many anthem at bros can handle yeah but
i have such incredible technology all
around us I mean we're sitting we're
surrounded by there's at least one TV
here that you can see in the shot
there's this thing and yet we can't fix
the delay yeah where is it going where
doesn't convey out like what are we
shooting and shooting it into space we
actually are shooting an industry yeah
that is literally what's happening um so
I feel like I'm it's weird but I'm like
hard-pressed to think of things that we
haven't talked about with this console
like it just felt like a very brief
compact like he said compact mm-hmm it's
it's got a new oh it was actually one
thing that we were talking about during
that we didn't get answered for us was
the the controller they showed off oh my
god we have talked about the controller
at all yeah yes he Austin yes you're not
as I said before you were good for
nothing and I take it back back I didn't
say on the air but I said it repeatedly
before we went earlier it got of the
controller so so
it's an Xbox controller two buttons on
it do you understand these two buttons
i'm not totally sis what i did not
understand there's the there's the
square with a square on top of it okay
uh-huh and then there's the lines
there's a line line button yeah what do
you think those buds do I think one we
probably could find out if we get to the
internet right now yeah we product I to
just browse yeah this is the speed of
things we aren't because our inability
to read internet right now we're like
babies were lost in the wilderness
really are and we don't know anything
but instead and the old days people have
just gone and gotten an encyclopedia and
they coulda told you all about it I mean
here's what we know it's got impulse
triggers so that was big one for me
whatever that and there's a Wi-Fi stack
inside of it there's a stack of Wi-Fi in
there yeah is that good in the in what
in the control it yeah you got a thing
back up sorry sir is it Wi-Fi in the
controller it looks like there's Wi-Fi
in the controller that you says that low
you can control the game from anywhere
in your house Oh perfect right if even
if you're not in the same room with the
system okay Wi-Fi direct radio stack
yeah that's like as a weird that's a
danger to call out okay but I don't know
I'm sure Harry I sure there are uses for
it I don't know what they are but
there's got to be something I open my
fridge connectivity to things some using
wireless to the line validate the lines
and this I'm assuming that the because
any of the functionality that they have
in the system also has to work without
connect right because you have to be
able to disable it well I think I don't
know it doesn't work without connect to
see that would be my question maybe they
ship the consoles with connect so maybe
those buttons are filling in some of
that gap for when you're in a noisy I
mean room or something yeah I also
wonder if there's a if there's a
microphone in the controller at all or
something because I feel like the voice
recognition particularly if you're in a
crowded room or you're in a room with a
family or jerks that display their a
game huge dicks um I don't I don't know
yeah i don't i'm at a loss here I don't
have an answer for this question I don't
know what this today they know at home I
one takes you to something wonder what
does something down got the guide button
it's a little morose definitely there
are definitely answers i'm sure people
are tweeting angrily at me right now the
d-pad looks nice they're done away with
the weird circle pad thing all boys that
is the circle at the top an actual
button that looks I would assume that's
the guide button right that is the guide
but yeah I think that remains in it
glows yeah and it is hope you can turn
that off because i feel like for dark
room late night scary game dark room
playing you don't want to light on your
they can make what if they can make it
like pull rob red Rob and Paul's watch
I'm into that I don't know if it's
colored or not know in there hey that's
a free I'd that's Debbie free before for
Microsoft and then of course we saw call
of duty ghosts yeah which they just got
damaged they don't want people to take
this game seriously they want you to
feel very pleased feel something on the
brain there's an emotional i loved it i
do love that they're like talking about
like the deep they have this director of
or the writer and director syriana
Syriana which is a great movie actually
and and he's like they really wanted
this call duty game to have real emotion
they want these character real emotion
and then it's just like that bobbing gun
yeah like it's just you see the can to
the gun and it's like look at that way
you can interact with the world you can
shoot now you can shoot besides people
you can shoot schools of fish can be
shot at you can shoot actual bricks on a
building ya what I'm gonna sugars hit
the texture of bricks it hits actual
bricks and then they actually try to
brag about the emotional connection
you're going to have to your dog which
is a is a is a classic film noir II know
that the dog brought back the dog is the
worst part to me it's like if you're
going to make me have fifth to feel pain
for I already struggled with you know
I've been playing far cry 3 and take a
little detour here going I've been
playing far cry 3 and and in order mrs
hang glider in order to in order to get
ahead in Far Cry 3 you have to kill
several thousand animals right to make
pouches for yourself the order to sell
me the pouch the store like I'll go get
money I'll kill humans happily in take
money I prefer not to cuss a lot of this
beautiful leopard um but not like
they make the animals all super
aggressive so they always attack you
which is nice this is a hell of a Segway
out of what we were talking about but I
feel you know I feel bad for the animals
and far cry and I really know that I'm
going to be feeling emotionally
connected that's with a k by the way
connected to to this dog that I'm gonna
have to take care of and he's gonna go
scouting for me and thence we can take
him hostage well it's assuming it's
easier because there's more and I think
that this is sort of telling is that the
fact that they say we want you have an
emotional connection and part of the way
we're achieving that is that we're going
to put a dog in it it really would to me
speaks to the how difficult it is to
create those emotional connection
there's still that Valley you know and
it's easier to abstract a dog out to a
point where you can right where it can
be believin might as well've is like
we're gonna put the old guy from up in
in the game exactly is gonna be your
companion to horrible career out of a
man but we will really want an emotional
connection and we can't we can't do with
the faces here yet so here's a case a
dog is a dog in the dogs gonna whimper
he's gonna get shot in the leg and
whimper and you'll have the choice it is
gonna eat him it is it's gonna be one of
the missions where you have to prepare
the dog that's how just how realistic it
is but it is interesting that that
you're right it's kind of this it is
totally abstracted it's not you know
they didn't show how the humans are
going to amote in some meaningful way or
that the story is going to be boat
captain dog and man they were maybe they
showed them the motion capture of the
dog back in a bit guy and they showed a
the armed detail and this is what arms
look like a modern warfare 3 these arms
those arms look good I like that they
won't compare it to what ghost looks
like on 360 because they're still gonna
try to sell you that one make sure you
definitely start by that and there's
still gonna sell the 360 which they
haven't they haven't really talked about
but we have from from Marc Whitten and
and they're selling the 360 alongside
this I don't know what if they're gonna
change price points seems like they
would not what happen right 99 yeah
that's what I think that it's that to
become their like media console right
like they're there with that well no but
it's like if you just want to like do
basic stuff and play some games mmm I
feel like right of course that is what
the new one is so what's the what's the
matter what I buy it
proud why is anybody buying anything to
see Bob let's just go to the TP live on
the water net CP like like a the one you
would put out in for camping yeah
exactly or whatever the TVs are done
whatever people do in TP give me a Wi-Fi
direct stack put it in my TV I'm Sam yes
as long as it's got the stack and we're
cheapies would make good Wi-Fi enabled
devices when you think about it cuz they
kind of have an antenna it / they would
be pursued have got like a structure
that's built for transmitting Wi-Fi data
so that's gonna do it Rick yeah are we
wrapping up yeah we are things I have to
uh Brian croissant a UH yet DW bone on
bone zones I do refer to him Ross ruler
or everybody yeah Ross Miller all the
crew here everybody yeah you guys know
prefer for witnessing but it can only be
described as a thing an event and it's
an exciting time in in gaming I'm
excited and I just want to say I just
want to say that polygon and the verge
will be doing a lot more coverage oh boy
today of this disgusting amount of way
more in-depth coverage of stuff coming
you don't even know what's about to
happen so continue to rapidly or i would
say obsessively refresh your tabs the
only two tabs you should have open at
this point which is polygon in the verge
just manjushri badly refreshed xbox
polygon xbox the verge the xbox but
that's you that's you at home and then
you're gonna do this and it's gonna all
go away and you're gonna see the smiley
face of Steve Ballmer hovering waiting
