it's a tiny little successor to the NES
classic and it's coming on September
29th for $79.99 it can play 21 different
Super Nintendo games but the big one to
be excited about is starfox 2 that game
was never actually released Nintendo
cancelled it way back when because it
was worried that the graphics couldn't
compete with the original PlayStation
now you have to unlock it and to do that
you play the original starfox game a
little bit and then you get access to
the sequel and yeah I mean Nintendo is
probably right to hold back on releasing
that game but it's still a blast to play
and honestly it's actually harder than
you might expect now for the hardware
it's good it has just an HDMI and a
power jack on the back and there are two
controller ports on the front Nintendo
has put them under this fiddly little
flap so that it can look way more like
the original SNES when you're carrying
it around and it uses these weird custom
plugs but they mean you can plug these
new controllers into the NES classic if
you want or into your old Wii Remote and
use them there on that Virtual Console
and the controllers they feel great
there's really no machinists in the
buttons and I'm really happy with the
d-pad which on modern controllers
usually feels kind of like an
afterthought plus the SNES classic ships
with two controllers and thankfully the
cable is long enough so you don't have
to sit three feet right directly in
front of your TV and there are new
features in the software too
the most important one is called rewind
when you suspend a game you can jump
right back in or with rewind you can
watch a replay of the last minute or so
of your game and if you screwed up you
can just start over at a few different
points before you suspended the game
it's basically like a do-over that's
built right into the console a couple
other things you can set a screensaver
that shows you know random gameplay of
the games that are on this console but
it shows your own gameplay instead of
just generic b-roll and lastly you can
also set the screen to get a few custom
settings so it looks like an old you
know CRT monitor just like the NES
classic but now you can put custom part
in the black areas on the left
right of that four by three aspect ratio
so you can put fake speakers on there or
my personal favorite wood paneling
unfortunately Nintendo did not tell us
exactly when free orders are going to
start for really real but that should be
pretty soon and Lou Tendo has promised
that it's going to make way more of
these than it did with the original NES
classic so hopefully you'll be able to
at your mouth I mean I mean hands on one
that's what she mode</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
