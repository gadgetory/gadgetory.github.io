no it really is okay wasn't okay a human
mission to Mars won't be quick a full
trip to the red planet could potentially
last up to two and a half years that
means Martian crew members will be
spending a lot of time together isolated
from Earth so NASA wants to know what
kind of traits a person will need to be
an ideal Mars astronaut the best way to
figure that out send people to Mars
before you send people to Mars it's
taken us about an hour to get to the
meeting place where we're meeting the
people from high seas and then it's
gonna take us another hour to get to the
high seas habitat and our ears are
definitely copy let's get higher and
higher we're on our way to high seas an
analogue Mars habitat run by the
University of Hawaii and funded by NASA
it's located on the state's Big Island
and getting there does feel a bit like
traveling to Mars there are plenty of
remote locations on earth so why pick
Hawaii well it has to do with the
terrain not the beaches or green valleys
though Pisces is located on the side of
an active volcano Mauna Loa what's great
about the geology out here is it's
actually pretty similar to what we might
find on Mars
thanks to past volcanic activity on the
planet this area we're about 7,000 feet
on Mauna lower right now is very very
similar to the surface of a young Mars
and since Mars hasn't had much in the
way of erosion over the years is not all
that different from the surface of
current Mars what are the some of the
things that you are specifically testing
for you know the data that you're
collecting and how are you giving that
to NASA and translating that for them
one of the focuses what NASA is funding
us to do here is to really look at crew
dynamics so how do you pick a crew how
do you pick individuals how do you put
them together into a crew so that
they'll work really well over these
long-duration missions because as I'm
sure you've seen maybe on a camping trip
there's some groups that work really
well over a long weekend but maybe you
wouldn't want to spend two and a half
years is the camping trip on a weekend
in my apartment
so welcome to the habitat home sweet
home so this area is the reconfigurable
area so they can move things around here
it's where they do most of their work
it's where they exercise it's where they
socialize really a lot of stuff happens
I'm missing a typical day in the habitat
consists of analyzing samples writing
reports fieldwork what Mars astronauts
would probably do each person has their
own bedroom though it's not very big
there's also cooking with mostly
non-perishable items and just general
free time to fill like reading books or
watching movies it didn't look like a
very glamorous life though so I decided
to ask someone who'd lived it meet Annie
Meyer she's a research test engineer at
NASA who spent four months at high seas
back in 2014 the crew was an
international crew from all over the
world we were from all different
upbringings and we all met fundamental
credentials to be on the mission but I
would say just like any family that's
the locks up in a house too long you
have some disagreements or different
approaches of how you solve a problem
and so if things ever did become an
issue we were pretty good about trying
to immediately extinguish an issue right
away and talking about it cuz you can't
just walk out the front door and go for
a walk you know like you're bad for you
yeah so we can only take showers we had
about what was it ten minutes of shower
water per crewmember per week and we
were working out I'm sorry
per week yeah so we were working out
every day around simulating reduced
gravity so a couple hours of sweating
and working out or if you went you put
on that big spacesuit and you've got all
sweaty you know you can't take a very
long shower so I definitely missed you
know modern plumbing but you made it
work speaking of modern plumbing the
toilets also don't have any have you
seen in the movie the Martian I have you
might remember that growing
in compost was a fairly central part
Nigerian call yeah well our crews to
have composting toilets and the
microbial community that lives in the
toilet turns your deposit into nice
clean compost oh well that's lovely so
you're kind of living with it for a
while you are and you're highly
motivated to keep that microbial
community happy and healthy making
matters worse all electronic
communication in and out of the habitat
is delayed by twenty minutes each way
that's roughly how long it would take
for a radio signal to travel the
distance from Mars to earth though
timing will vary depending on the
planets orbits so getting a reply from
someone on earth could take up to forty
minutes
yeah I was stressful if things were
going bad back home and you got an email
yeah you know you can't do anything
about it
you know everyone had their own personal
lives continuing without them friends
were celebrating milestones and you're
here you know doing the simulated Mars
mission and if you want to go for a
stroll the only way to go outside the
habitat is to suit up just like you
would have to on Mars
the thing is Martian astronauts won't be
spending that much time roaming around
the surface
Mars's atmosphere is much thinner than
Earth so it provides a little protection
from deep space radiation either from
incoming solar flares or cosmic rays
stemming from outside the galaxy so
rather than leave the habitats all the
time to get new samples astronauts are
going to want to send out recon missions
first to study the landscape the best
way to do that a radiation hardened
Rover and we've got just the thing you
want to minimize the amount of time that
humans spend outside a protected habitat
so what you do is you send the Rover out
to scout the location see what's around
if you have a special area that you're
interested in send the rover take images
take soil samples bring it back and then
once you've identified which are the key
location see if you want to send humans
there too to follow up then they don't
be there's not gonna be wasting time
trying to find a location it's already
pre identified by the road
I had some fun cruising with the rover
outside but in reality astronauts aren't
going to be anywhere near the vehicle
when they operate it do five more
degrees okay those elusive Martians it's
a tedious process operating the rover
from the control center it involves
typing in commands to enter the rover
forward or tilt the cameras ever so
slightly to get that perfect picture of
a rock or passing your driver's test
it's like being sixteen all over again
so one thing I'm learning here is that
you really need a lot of patience to
accomplish any task on Mars yes
everything is done very slowly there's
certain time delays involved the
instrumentation you're carrying onboard
is delicate it's expensive so yeah you
don't want to rush things right it's
like I say even though right now hello
Lonnie moves really slow it's ten times
faster than curiosity it just goes to
show that Martian astronauts will be
spending a lot of time inside cooped up
with not much room to roam around and
with the same people around you at all
times it's not going to be like a
vacation it's going to be an extreme
environment that most can't handle but
that's why high seas exists so that NASA
can figure out what it will be like and
to find the people who can handle it
