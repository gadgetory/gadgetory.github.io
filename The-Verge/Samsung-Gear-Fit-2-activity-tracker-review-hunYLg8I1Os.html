awesome it's likely going to happen in
baby steps not in leaps and bounds like
we've all been hoping for that's what
I've determined from wearing the Samsung
gear fit to over the past few weeks now
does this mean it's a bad wearable not
at all it's actually a pretty good
activity tracker it's just getting
harder to stand out amid all of the
activity trackers out there now the gear
fit 2 is a sports band not a SmartWatch
that manages to cram a pretty big
display and GPS into a wristband form
factor which is something that not many
step counting wristbands have for the
most part smartwatches don't make great
fitness trackers so Samsung is offering
something way more sport focused and an
attempt to get more people into its
hardware ecosystem the good news is that
the gear fit 2 has improved and a lot of
the ways that needed to from the first
Samsung gear fit from 2 years ago the
bad news is that I had a really spotty
experience of battery life which is
still one of the biggest drawbacks of
wearables with full resolution displays
but the bigger question is whether you
should spend a hundred and eighty
dollars on this thing if you're watching
this video I'm guessing you might
already be interested in it or you have
an Android phone if you don't have an
Android phone I'm going to save you some
time you can stop watching right now
because the Samsung gear fit 2 only
works with Android phones hardware wise
it's pretty standard all the usual
suspects are in the build there's a
flexible plastic wristband with a
railroad style strap and it has two
physical buttons one that acts as a
power and home button and another that
acts as a back button the display though
is what really stands out it's a rich
glossy curved Super AMOLED touchscreen
and you'll notice it displays
information in a vertical format so that
you don't have to twist your wrist to
see stuff the only downside to the Super
AMOLED display is that it's not that
easy to see an outdoor lighting which
outdoor fitness enthusiasts aren't going
to like but then again it's not easy to
see the displays of smart watches and
other color displays in bright light
either there are optical sensors on the
underside of the band for measuring your
heart rate and in stable workout
environments I found heart rate readings
to be very consistent with a chest
monitor and Bonus Time the gear fit to
has that built-in GPS I mentioned this
makes it one of the very few wristband
style trackers to include GPS along with
the Microsoft band 2 and the garmin
vivosmart HR plus so what exactly is the
gear fit to track it's more like what
doesn't
they records running walking hiking
cycling stair stepper stationary biking
elliptical training treadmill running a
whole bunch of other stuff including
yoga and then there's an other tile that
will let you record any other type of
activity that might not be categorized
like a lot of other fitness trackers
these days the band will automatically
recognize some activities and Samsung
has tried to display the data in an
interesting way so for example there's a
24-hour time line view of your activity
and if you use GPS you'll see a map
after your workout is completed all of
your data from the band is going to sync
to Samsung's s health application
I like the s health app and it syncs
pretty quickly but I will say as with a
lot of Samsung software I kind of wish
it was simpler first you're going to be
two apps even use this band if your
manager app which is the same one you
use to manage Samsung smartwatches and
the s health app the gear app is where
you're going to manage all the
notifications that appear on your band
and the s health app is where you're
going to manage your health settings so
you'll see a bunch of tiles here which
you can tap on to measure your stress or
log your food or see more information
about a specific workout but personally
I'd rather see it all in a linear or a
chronological format and then the app
will share data with partner apps like
RunKeeper and Strava but this is where
it gets confusing there are a bunch of
partner apps under more in the app and
then there's a different set of partner
apps in the settings area of the app and
then even when you go to download
something like the Spotify app onto the
wristband you have to go to the galaxy
app store it's not in the partner apps
list
so yeah sharing data and getting apps
onto the device that's sort of all over
the place another downside to this band
well it's big at least for my wrist it's
flexible but it's big the display takes
up a lot of space I would not call this
delicate second its water-resistant but
it's not fully waterproof so you can't
swim with it okay and then there's
battery life Samsung is promising three
to four days but my first review unit
may have been a dud because in a couple
of occasions it didn't even last a day
especially if I worked out using GPS my
second review unit seems much more
consistent with Samsung's promises
then my colleague Dan Seifert tried
another review unit and his lasted about
a day bottom line is that battery life
seems to be a crapshoot with early
versions of this which is part of the
reason why I can't give it a
wholehearted recommendation despite all
that I have to give Samsung credit where
it's due its first gear fit wrist fan
felt kind of like a me-too wearable like
hey let's just make a wearable because
every one of their mother and their
cousin is making an activity tracker
right now this one shows commitment it's
a more serious sport band it tracks a
whole bunch of different Fitness
activities and it tries to display the
data to you in an interesting way do I
think it's the best sports band out
there no I'm going to reserve that for
something that works with multiple
operating systems is fully waterproof
and has a display you can see outdoors
this makes it a pretty serious contender
among all the other bands out there you
only down scientists sorry ready and
action
perfect
