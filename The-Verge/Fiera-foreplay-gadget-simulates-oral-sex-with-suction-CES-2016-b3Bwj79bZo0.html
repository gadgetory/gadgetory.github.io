showstoppers at CES 2016 now my daily
life I am a science reporter and one of
the coolest things about science it can
be used to improve your sex life and a
good example is the Viera right here so
this thing isn't your average vibrator
it's more like foreplay in your hand I
don't know about you but sometimes life
gets in the way it's hard to get things
jump-started in the bedroom so you
really need a way to kind of cross over
from A to B and this thing's supposed to
help you so it's got a suction cup that
fits over your clitoris and underneath
are three little massage tools and what
they do is they massage the clitoral
area drawing blood flow down to your
pelvic region and that's supposed to
increase arousal and lubrication and you
wear it for 3 to 15 minutes you go have
sex with your partner and then that sex
is even much more pleasurable because
you have increased blood flow and it's
enjoyable for everybody the cool thing
about this product is they're actually
trying to get some science to back it up
a third party researcher tested the
product on 12 postmenopausal women all
of whom said that they experienced
increased arousal afterwards so they're
going to try and get that study
published in a peer-reviewed journal
that's kind of the gold standard when it
comes to accepting research in the
scientific community so if that happens
that'll be pretty cool we don't really
see a lot of science backing up
wearables at CES so it's a refreshing
take to get something that does so if
the Fiera sounds like something you're
interested in it's going for 250 and
it's out now to learn more go to the
verge comm slash CES or subscribe to our
