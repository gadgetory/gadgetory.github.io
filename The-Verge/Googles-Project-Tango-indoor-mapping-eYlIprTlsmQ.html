Barcelona today at mobile Congress and
lenovo has invited us to a museum now
normally I would walk in the museum and
not have an idea where I was going the
whole idea of the event today is to show
us Google's Project tango in action so
we've seen this before it's a tablet
with crazy Freedy sensing cameras on the
back but really today it's not about
gaming or any of the other augmented
reality purposes you could use it for
it's for indoor navigation obviously
Google's the king of mapping outdoors
but they're really trying to be the king
of mapping indoors too so we went in
there's a tablet it's as usual project
tango development kit so we don't up
seeing it on a phone yet that's the big
promise but the tablet essentially
allows you to navigate around this
museum the interface is very much like
Google Maps you get a live view which is
an augmented reality view so you get
blue lines and dots that you can see and
basically travel around the museum from
floor to floor or from painting to
painting and essentially what it does is
it's guiding you around the museum
allowing you to find your way without
them to ask someone without leave the
traditional ways and this was just a
museum today you can imagine this would
be great in a mall any retail stores any
sort of setting like that so you can tap
on the tablet once you get to say the
painting you're trying to find you can
tap on on the painting they'll have
little markers to give you information
about the things so and it's actually
good to see it in action today and so we
spoke with Google and Lenovo after the
quick demonstration they basically told
us that the idea is obviously to get
this into a smartphone and so at the
moment the promise is a six inch all
around that sort of figure as
smartphones there's going to be a pretty
large device and but trying to keep it
real simple on the hardware and keeping
the camera in line with what you would
expect from a normal camera on a phone
and then the other promise is that to
map these rooms and to get all this
indoor data and they're trying to hope
that this is like a crowdsource thing or
something that moles Warne appears to do
themselves is like a selling point to
attract customers try and get them in
and make it a lot easier to navigate
around
in reality we'll see if people want to
walk around with their cameras on and
capturing this data for Google and I
think their idea is that you'll get
something back from it if you
participate in this crowdsourcing the
idea and the dream of navigating indoors
is very much alive we just saw a really
small taste of it today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
