with the verge I'm checking out the
inspire camera mouse now I've written
about the inspire before it's probably
the coolest drone on the market right
now what this does is it takes the
camera which is true
DJ eyes first camera that they built
in-house you can detach it from the
drone and put it on this handheld amount
and then you can use this as a
stabilizer and a viewfinder while you're
out shooting so a basic idea is if I was
a filmmaker and I wanted to go out today
I wanted to get some aerial stuff with
my drone I didn't want to bring a second
camera I have this sort of miniature 4k
camera that works really well with DJI
stabilizer they're known in the film
industry for the rhone and other things
like that so building gimble's building
handheld stabilizers that's something
they're kind of top in class this is
combining their drone technology the
camera they built for the drone the
gimbal they built for the drone with the
handheld stuff that they do on the film
side so kind of cool gonna be available
in q2 of this year no pricing yet but
definitely something that filmmakers
both amateur and pro will probably want
to check out for more great videos be
