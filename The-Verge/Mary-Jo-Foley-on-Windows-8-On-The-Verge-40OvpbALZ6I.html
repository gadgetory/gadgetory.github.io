Windows 8 is going to be very
interesting on touch tablets and
possibly on touch laptops I think people
who install it on existing non touch
laptops are going to be surprised if
they haven't tried it already about what
that experience is like surprise in a
negative way that see that's very makes
me feel very sad those are the people
who are gonna be installing it there i
mean it's not everybody's gonna be a new
pc purchaser well you know the way most
people get windows anymore is getting it
on a new pc most people aren't like you
know techies you know go to tiana legs
it's kind of like we're gonna take our
chances right but I mean but if you get
it on a traditional laptop the
experience is your Start menu is
suddenly yours the more start button
right there's no start button right it's
a completely different experience like
people will be shocked and confused like
people who only know that you know who
are using like it's gonna be a directory
right now or something that's gonna be a
learning curve was a learning curve for
you like it was really weird for me it's
really weird yeah I don't I I'll tell
you i don't use windows 8 on my laptop
that i use for work I don't well that's
not a ringing endorsement use linux all
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
