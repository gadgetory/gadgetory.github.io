and I spent my fourth of July watching
the best Marvel movie Howard the Duck
this is 90 seconds on the verge nothing
says Independence Day like a bunch of
companies buying up smaller ones over
the holiday weekend the FCC finally
approves softbank's 20 1.6 billion
dollar acquisition of mobile carrier
sprint and sprint acquisition of
clearwire it's like a nesting doll but
with regulatory oversight both deals are
expected to close early this month in a
surprising move samsung also picked up
set-top box maker boxy for a reported 30
million dollars what about hulu bidding
for the company has reportedly ended but
it's not clear who if anyone has emerged
the winner just yet it's the fifth
anniversary of Apple's iOS App Store and
that means free stuff to celebrate the
occasion games like Tiny Wings Infinity
Blade 2 and bad land are all free for a
limited time along with apps like
traktor DJ and the journal app day one
Apple's mobile app store opened in 2008
with 500 apps now it has over 900,000
apps it's all bad why have a running his
friends requests and finally Samsung
offered a million customers a free early
copy of jay-z's magna carta holy grail
there was a price the jay-z magna carta
mobile app required users to provide
access to their phone status and
location information luckily the
internet took care of that problem
almost immediately as prior to downloads
and torrents of the album spread the
album is out officially julyman and
that's it for today's top stories coming
up tomorrow the man who made a moleskine
using only field notes and duct tapes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
