verge and this week Facebook released
chat heads for Android it's essentially
facebook Messenger all over your phone
and just yesterday they updated their
iOS apps to support chat heads but those
are restricted to within the app
developer Adam Bell has been hacking
away at the iOS version for the last 24
hours and now we have a working build of
chat heads on the iPhone all right let's
take a look so we'll launch the facebook
app and go into messages when you enter
messages you see a chat head pop up and
you can hit the home button and the chat
head will still be here you can drag it
around as you normally would and you can
open it up and send messages and
stickers are supported which is kind of
neat you can you know chat other people
as well so let's say hi to Ellis and
just like on the android version you can
drag them down and get rid of them and
once you close the facebook app chat
heads will close so while Chad heads is
great there's a few bugs so right now we
left it inactive for about a minute and
you can't access the chat heads anymore
so you have to go in force close the app
and reopen them keyboard sometimes a
little bit buggy but you know this thing
was hacked together in 24 hours and
actually we spoke to Adam Bell who says
he's hoping to have this in the city of
store within just a few days so expect
it soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
