party always a good place to be a
rolls-royce party seems like appropriate
for champagne and the open air because
it's LA and tonight they are showing the
dawn which is a very cool old-school
throwback glamorous convertible so the
silver Donna is also here which was this
particular model is 1953 very limited
edition high-dollar collector car it's
the great thing about the rolls-royce is
there's a through-line from the history
you can look at that card you look at
this car and know that they actually are
a similar model you can look at a
Bentley and say yeah there's
similarities there it's turning a
Porsche oh you know those similarities
but to me a rolls-royce is a one mater
brand that truly looks like the old
school and I mean hand-built obviously
like such a big British brand that we've
all recognized this out into the spirit
of the ecstasy I mean exactly I mean
yeah you look at you have to be a
certain kind of person to drive a Rolls
Royce they people look at you in a way
they wonder who you are the race which
is sort of the coupe version of this is
is a younger car and I think this is
even more this is a quintessential Los
Angeles vehicle type thing mm-hmm
so if you have like an extra 335 this is
your is you know built on BMW parts so
it's gonna feel modern they ride
beautifully they're actually pretty fast
so it's fun but this is
very cool let's go for it right in the
old one though yeah I think that's my
one I went right in the old one yes I
went to get my Lana Turner on la baby</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
