I'm checking out the physics it's a new
gadget that helps anyone create the
perfect pour
get that foam head on top of your beer
as if it was coming right out of the
draft so you put in a bottle or a can
and this uses a medical grade sound wave
oscillator and a very specific and
controlled flow to give you bubbles
under 30 microns which apparently
improves mouthfeel
you can see it's got a little bit of
foam but when I'm really ready for my
head I back this off and I straighten
out and I go backwards now I'm getting
on top some sweet sweet foam these are
tiny really tightly packed bubbles and
the idea the inventors had was to use
that sound wave oscillator and keep the
bubbles as small as possible under 30
microns I don't know what a micron looks
like but it definitely improves the
flavor I think this is a Miller Lite
which is a pretty classy beer oh yeah
tastes expensive now so I've probably
had you know four or five beers at this
points like almost 4:15 in the afternoon
and the difference is usually that it's
kind of creamier smoother there's more
of a sort of aroma the beer is generally
a little bit less you know kind of
accurate and sharp and I would say it
makes a good beer tastes kind of great
and a pretty bad beer tastes pretty good
so the physics just kicked off its
IndieGoGo campaign if you are one of the
early backers for the crowdfunding you
can get it for around one hundred and
nineteen dollars and then when it goes
to retail the goal is to sell it for
about one hundred ninety nine bucks I
have to say as a guy who drinks a lot of
beer this would definitely elevate my
home game without hurting my budget can
I tell the difference between a beer
that was poured from here in a hand pour
absolutely doesn't make this Miller Lite
so fantastic that I would drink it
regularly probably not</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
