verge reporting from Silicon Valley and
I'm here today to report that we have
hit peak Silicon Valley you can now use
an iPhone app to have gas delivered to
your car rather than having to go to the
trouble of going to a gas station the
latest app in the App Store is called
refuel and we decided to give me fuel a
trial as you can see B fuel is not the
only startup that is trying to disrupt
gas let's go into the app and see what
we can find the first thing to know
about we fuel is that it's currently
only servicing the California towns of
Palo Alto and Menlo Park where we happen
to be today it's interesting because
anecdotally I think these towns have the
highest concentration of Tesla's of
anywhere I've ever seen but that's
besides the point as you can see here
regular fuel is going to cost 289 a
gallon today you can also do a premium
and we fuel says that that's based on
average rates per zip code so it's
dynamic it changes throughout the day or
from day to day so let's request some
gas I will never have been so relieved
to have gotten gas right now at launch
the company is offering this for
basically free I think it's a penny just
to get people using the service but
otherwise it's going to cost you almost
seven dollars and 50 cents plus the cost
of gas the company also plans to
introduce a $20 per month subscription
service for a refuel which won't cover
the cost of gas but will cover all of
your service fees for an unlimited
number of Phillips and they plan on
equipping their customers with some type
of electronic device that will let the
company know when you've run out of fuel
and they'll come by and refill up your
car automatically so you don't even have
to request it through the app so that's
we fuel in a nutshell would you pay more
than seven dollars to have gas delivered
to your car
