phone the essential phone was made bad
team and led by the creator of Android
itself Andy Rubin he has a brand new
billion-dollar company that's trying to
create a whole new operating system for
the connected world and a smart home
device that will run on it but before
all that happens this phone has to
happen it runs Android and it costs six
hundred and ninety nine dollars but it
feels like a million bucks and it has an
all new wireless module system and the
camera well we'll get to that but first
pay attention I mean just look at this
the striking design starts of course
with the screen it goes all the way to
the top with a cutout that accommodates
the selfie camera and a couple of little
sensors it goes very nearly to the edges
of the sides without any gimmicky curves
and on the bottom it does have a little
chin but it's not much bigger than what
you'd get on say a samsung galaxy you
should know that it's LCD instead of
AMOLED which means it won't work for VR
if you care about that sort of thing but
what's most impressive about the 5.7
inch screen is that it's bigger than the
screen on the pixel XL or the iPhone 7
plus but in a package that's way smaller
than either one now I know what you're
thinking is it this weird
Cyclops eye or selfie camera in the
middle of the screen annoying in a word
no in more words it basically becomes
invisible once you start using it
because Android never puts anything in
that zone of the screen look I'm just
going to say it the essential phone has
an aesthetic that I like better than any
other phone I've tried in the past year
I really like that this isn't just some
derivative knockoff of an iPhone or a
galaxy phone it's it's only thing the
essential phone feels substantial feel
dense it's pretty much the same weight
as an iPhone 7 plus but in this much
smaller package
I do wish it was waterproof though
there's nothing here to distract from
the clean lines of the device there's no
camera bump and the earpiece speaker is
the tiny thin rail you don't even see
until the lead charging light turns on
and of course there are any logos on it
anywhere at all the rail on the edge is
titanium and it rides the line of being
just dripping enough to instill
confidence the back is ceramic which
cuts down on antenna lines and it's also
I have to admit glossy as all get-out
and it shows every little smudge and
fingerprint but at least it wipes down
easily essential says that all these
materials will keep this thing from
shattering if you drop it or scratching
in your pocket but we didn't actually
test those things sorry there isn't a
headphone jack and I know that's the way
things are going but I'm still going to
be a curmudgeon about it
here's the USBC dongle a nice dongle but
once I left this dongle and my bluetooth
headphones at the office and so I was
out of luck oh and the fingerprint
sensor it's on the back in middle where
you can actually reach it where it
belongs Samsung and here we come to it
the most important part really of any
Android phone review a camera hey
everybody you may have noticed I'm not
wearing a suit and I'm in an office with
Verein behind the camera and Tyler
editing the video you're watching right
now here's the story a mere hours for we
needed to publish this review essential
pushed out a software update for the
camera which changed the quality of its
photos from dumpster fire to pretty good
this is the section the video we're
going to tell you about the camera so I
will there's actually two lenses on the
back one is black and white the other
one is color and they combine the two
images together to make a better photo
than you'd get from either one on its
own and it means that there's no camera
bump so I compared it to a pixel XL and
the pixel cell is still way faster and
this pictures are slightly better so
we're gonna go back to the rest of the
video we're going to talk about the
modules and everything else that's going
on with this phone and then at the end
I'm going to come back to the camera a
little bit and what I say there at the
end it's still true but if I had the
original software that I have now
I might not have been quite so I don't
know emotional about it so check it out
there's one more interesting thing to
talk about with the essential phone and
it's related to these two little metal
pins on the back just like Motorola
essential is trying to get you to buy a
bunch of modules but the centrioles
approach is potentially more exciting
what Motorola is doing these two little
metal contacts here are just for
providing power the data is transmitted
over wireless USB and the modules attach
Maya magnets
the first module that essential shipping
is a 360-degree camera which costs $1.99
Izone but you can get it bundled with a
phone for 50 bucks for a limited time
it's an intriguing little widget it
doesn't need its own battery or display
or Bluetooth radio so it's super small
it attaches via those magnets with a
really pleasing firm snap and when you
do it automatically fires up the phone's
camera also hilarious plot twist when
you attach the 360 camera to the back of
the essential phone a tiny little fan
spins up in the camera to keep the
electronics cool now it doesn't actually
do it while you're actually recording so
it's not really a problem but kind of
weird right once the camera app is open
you can shoot 360 stills or video in 4k
and even stream live it works but
sometimes it is a little bit buggy for
now the best thing I can say about it is
that it's a really fun toy but we have
to compare its actual quality to other
360 cameras we just haven't had enough
time to do that yet
so I haven't bothered to talk about the
usual phone specs and software stuff
because essentially basically did all
the obvious and right things it's
running on the same modern hardware that
you can get on other fly shop Android
phones it has a Qualcomm 835 processor
and has all the radio bands need to work
on any US carrier plus plenty more for
around the rest of the world there's
four gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage
so you cannot expand it I've been
getting better battery life than usual
for big Android phones this thing is
easily lasting through a whole day for
me with up to 7 hours of screen on time
as for the software essential basically
did nothing to Android 7.1 here there is
a custom camera app and the bits to
enabled
and of course there's a setting to send
Diagnostics act of the company and
that's literally it anyway I popped a
sprint stem into the bottom of this
thing and sure enough there was zero
crap where and sprint tells me he'll be
exactly the same if you buy one of these
phones directly from a Sprint store so
seriously everybody
Bravo I guess I should say that it
doesn't necessarily have the fine-tuning
of the pixel and you do miss out on some
of the neat little tricks that the
galaxy can do but whatever I didn't miss
it
there are a lot of stories you could
tell about the essential phone you could
say it's a luxury phone for people who
care about something with a unique
design and high-end materials you could
say it's the tip of the spear for Annie
Rubens grand plan to create the next
great platformer that comes after mobile
you could say it's the new harbinger of
the return of modular gadgets where you
can plug little things into your phone
and your TV and your thermostat anything
else you can think of you could say it's
a phone that's snuck in right before the
pixel xl2 and beat Google at its own
game if it works with a disappointing
camera that might have been the story
that I'm telling you right here and
maybe it could be someday with a
software update but we've heard that
software update story before and it
usually doesn't turn out well so I think
the most likely story for the essential
phone is that it's a phone you really
want to love but it keeps breaking your
damn heart and yeah it's a fine screen
it's not a concealer thick film and
really good responsible okay yeah okay
ready
