professor at University of California
Berkeley and I work on something called
gene editing I think in the future it
will be possible to use gene editing to
help species that are under tremendous
pressure from the environment in
different ways and you know the example
that I like to think about actually is
it's protecting trees trees that are
under reeled arrest due to the bark
beetle what if we could actually put
protective genes into the trees that
would protect them or possibly going the
other way make modifications to the bark
beetles so they don't have the
capability to attack the trees I think
scientists have been really tethered to
a few model organisms that could be
manipulated genetically and now with
this tool we have a way to change the
DNA in essentially any type of organism
and so what we're seeing in the
scientific world is that this is opening
up opportunities to understand life in
many new niches being able to make a
single letter change in the DNA of the
human genome in a way that would for
example cure genetic disease the gene
editing technology that is available
today is already you know sufficient to
cure the defect that causes sickle cell
anemia in cells that are cultured in the
laboratory by 2021 we will certainly see
more clinical trials going forward right
now the trials that are approved are all
for cancer and they're for doing a
particular type of editing that might be
impactful in treating cancer namely
being able to program a patient's own
immune cells to target and destroy their
cancer cells but I think that going
forward we will see increasing efforts
to address genetic diseases of the blood
of the eye of the liver and then
probably farther down the road diseases
that affect other tissues the
opportunities to really understand and
we hope in the future to effectively
treat or even cure genetic disease and
humans is just
you know there's a lot of interest in
what's called de-extinction
the idea that you could bring back an
organism that is no longer walking the
earth by using gene editing to make
modifications to a genome of an existing
organism let's say that it reintroduces
genes that have been lost whether you
could really bring back a dinosaur um
you know that's much harder challenge we
don't really know the DNA sequence that
would encode a dinosaur and you know in
Jurassic Park you may remember that the
premise of Michael Crichton's story was
that you know that there were insects
trapped in resin that contained blood
from dinosaurs that had DNA still
available for sequencing and
unfortunately DNA just is a chemical
that doesn't last 65 million years so I
think you know being able to do that is
not so likely but you know maybe it's
possible to by sort of bootstrapping
piecing together information we have
about amphibians about birds it might be
possible to start sort of walking in
that direction and I don't know how
close you could get to a real dinosaur
but certainly we'll learn a lot about
the genetic traits that are encoded in
DNA that give rise to some of the traits
that we think dinosaurs had another area
that is a little bit farther afield but
I think again might intersect in
interesting ways with gene editing is
imaging being able to visualize cells at
a level that has been impossible in the
past so what if you could really look
inside of a cell and see molecules watch
them behaving watch them functioning I
think this is going to be incredible and
I think this will probably really again
be a very transformative type of effort
that will happen over the next few years
is to really start allowing us to see
the cellular world in ways that have
been impossible before
