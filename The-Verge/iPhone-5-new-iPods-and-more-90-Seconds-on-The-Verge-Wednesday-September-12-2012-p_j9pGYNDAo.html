David Pierce broken bruised forgotten
sore this is 90 seconds on the verge as
expected Apple today unveiled the iphone
5 in addition to being thinner and
lighter the device now has a taller 4
inch 16 by 9 Retina Display other big
features include LTE support a faster a6
processor and a smaller dock connector
Apple is calling lightning the iphone 5
will cost two hundred dollars on
contract both the 4 and 4s have received
hundreds cuts and consequently the 3gs
is now in retirement the iphone 5 will
begin shipping worldwide on September
21st pre-orders start Friday it seems
like most of the details from today's
event relief months ahead of time but
here's one that was kind of a surprise
new ipods the super thin completely
redesigned ipod touch has the same
4-inch Retina display as the new iphone
5 and now features a built-in hook for
lanyards it starts at two hundred ninety
nine dollars with 32 gigs of storage
meanwhile 149 dollar ipod nano loses its
watch face friendly form factor for a
more rounded iOS like interface both new
ipods are doing october in a variety of
colors and don't worry the loop matches
the chassis and in non apple news yes we
can do that sony is betting big on small
cameras with really large sensors in
addition to the new and improved 850
dollar nex-6 sony today announced the
cyber-shot rx100 murah has a full-frame
DSLR quality sensor in a much smaller
form factor there's a catch though the
rx1 does not support interchangeable
lenses we hope you really like 35
millimeters the rx1 is due in november
for twenty eight hundred dollars but hey
at least that includes a lens that's it
for today's top stories tune in tomorrow
for the very first iphone 6 rumor</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
