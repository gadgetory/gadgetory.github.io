not just my opinion it's not just how we
all feel it's true robocall complaints
to the Federal Trade Commission have
quintupled since 2009 and they jumped
steeply in just the past year to four
and a half million total and that's just
robo calls they're another two and a
half million complaints about live
telemarketers so one North can we do to
start fighting back against all these
spammy calls there are three steps you
can take
they won't solve the problem entirely
but if you're fed up this is what you
can do to start fighting back okay so
step number one use a call blocking out
there are a whole bunch of these and
they all try to do the same thing block
spam calls before you have to answer
your phone some of the most popular
include hiya and true caller which are
free and nomorobo and robo killer which
require a subscription we're gonna use
nomorobo because it won the FTC's robo
call block new challenge but these all
work more or less the same and they work
for both iOS and Android once you've
installed it you'll have to give that
permission to handle your caller ID
that's all store a huge constantly
updating list of known spammers and then
it checks those numbers against screws
calling you if it sees that known
spammer is calling you and either won't
let the number through order to identify
you when they're calling if the app does
let a spam call through by accident then
you can tell it that and it'll then
factor that information in for everybody
else to help lock even more spin up
calls since most of these apps are free
there's no harm in just trying went out
to see how it works for you but before
we go any further what's behind all
these spam calls anyway well since
certain private numbers are basically
everywhere now linked to our online
accounts pasted in our own email
signatures and printed on business cards
and giving our phone numbers to pretty
much everyone there's a good chance
they'll be shuffled along to someone
they shouldn't plus thanks to
autodialing software any internet
scammers can place thousands of calls a
minute
for really cheap they can even guess at
numbers if they want to and once they're
dialed the auto dialer can then play
back a prerecorded message there's no
makeup technology is also making
spammers more clever letting them
disguise their phone number as a local
one with your own area code that way
you're more likely to answer given each
fake call a better chance of landing but
why do we receive so many spam calls
well as you can guess someone is
profiting from this
the caller-id company trueCaller
estimates that phone scammers made 9.5
billion in 2016 from Americans alone and
the more calls they send out the more
chances they have of finding a target
and while this is a huge problem it's
actually really hard to crack down on
making spammy calls like these are
largely illegal in the US but robo calls
can be placed from overseas and there's
not much the United States can do about
that and for phone service providers it
can be hard to tell whether a call
that's coming in is from a scammer or
from someone you actually want to get in
touch with they have to be careful not
to block any calls that really should
have been let through and it's important
to note that some robo calls are legal
your pharmacy might call you your
prescription is ready or your child's
school we're closed due to inclement
weather or even an airline your gate has
changed generally speaking these are all
legal the focus is on those calls from
scammers claiming you want a free cruise
or they can lower your interest rate or
that the FBI is looking for you the
service you mail estimates that 30 to 40
percent of all robo calls are scams and
you definitely shouldn't be receiving
those calls all right so what else can
you do to stop spam calls well there are
a few other things first make sure your
number is on the National Do Not Call
Registry if you're in the United States
assuming those calls were coming in
legally that could start to cut down on
some of them second scene your phone
provider can do AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile both
offer services that are designed to
identify spammy callers when they hit
your phone Verizon and Sprint have
similar services but they all charge you
for it and finally know what's doing you
do get a spam call don't talk don't
press any buttons don't let them know
that a human is on the line or there
might be more likely to call back also
be aware of what some of the common
phone scams are like free travel
packages so you don't give them your
time or money if you really do want to
talk to somebody
consider calling them back from a number
that you know is legitimate also and
this is really important where you're
handing out your information over the
phone make sure you're really
identifying yourself rather than handing
your identity to somebody who doesn't
are
unfortunately it might never be possible
to fully put a stop to robo calls but
you're not defenseless against them the
government and phone carriers are doing
their best put a stop to them and if you
take some of these steps you'll be able
to start reducing the annoyance hey
