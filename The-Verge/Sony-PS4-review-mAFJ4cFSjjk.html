is the PlayStation for seven years after
the ps3 Sony's built a new console
designed to last the next seven years
this console represents Sony's best
guess about what we're going to do on
our TVs in the next decade and how we're
going to do it but more than anything
it's a $399 love letter to gamers
everywhere Sony learned a lot from its
last console which was essentially a
bulky expensive supercomputer the ps4 is
just about half the width of the
original ps3 and also considerably
lighter it's even thinner than Sony's
latest ultra-thin ps3 which is a
considerable feat the console ditches
the iconic curves of its predecessor for
a parallelogram design with sharp
sloping edges it's really nice-looking
standing out without being too gaudy
it's certainly a prettier than what
we've seen of Microsoft's upcoming Xbox
one the front has two USB 3.0 ports next
to the slot loading optical disk drive
and the power an eject button sliced
down the middle of the ps4 on the back
of the console is a surprisingly small
set of ports optical audio out HDMI
Ethernet and a proprietary port for the
PlayStation camera there's no power
brick everything is actually inside the
console it just makes everything smaller
and simpler if you've a ps3 you can even
use the same cables you already had
hooked up and just drop the new box into
your existing set up inside the ps4 is
some seriously powerful silicon it has a
custom processor with eight AMD Jaguar
CPU cores and a next-gen radeon GPU it's
based on the x86 architecture which is
fairly ubiquitous but also means the ps4
isn't backwards compatible that means
you won't be able to play any ps3 games
on this console it has 8 gigs of memory
a 500 gigabyte hard drive and a 6-speed
blu-ray drive for the most part it's
impressively powerful with plenty of
headroom to last the next several years
but there are a couple of odd oversights
the ps4 doesn't support 802 11 AC Wi-Fi
or 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi both of which would
have allowed for faster more reliable
internet connections and they're clearly
the future it's just a weird thing to
leave out ultimately the look and feel
of the console are nice but the
controller is what you'll end up holding
in your hands all day as you play games
it's called the Dual Shock 4 and it's
easily the best controller Sony's ever
made it looks a fair amount like the
DualShock 3 from the PlayStation 3 but
it has longer much more comfortable
grips with better spaced concave analog
sticks more comfortable triggers on the
back and only a couple of awkward
buttons in the middle the Dual Shock 4
also has a light bar on the back which
the system can use to identify
by the controllers along with a touchpad
in the middle that works well for some
things but won't exactly replace some
house there's even a speaker in the
controller itself plus a headphone jack
that means you can use it for voice chat
or even plug in any old pair of
headphones import all the ps4's audio
through the controller instead the first
thing you see after a quick mostly
painless setup process is a blue screen
with Sony's normal soft music and moving
backgrounds plus a list of everything
you've ever done on your console it
shows all the games you've played in
reverse chronological order with your
library at the very end of the list at
first it makes getting to the games you
want to play really easy but the long
list you can't sort yourself gets
cumbersome really fast click into any
game you've ever installed or played and
you'll see the most recent activity
within that game what your friends are
playing what they're sharing from that
game and achievements they've earned all
the social gaming is tied really tightly
into the core OS and it makes playing
with or alongside your friends a lot
more fun there's also an endless stream
of your friends activity in the what's
new section of the menu which is cool
but it can get really cluttered if you
have more than a few friends flick the
analog stick up and you're taken into
the primary menu that's where you see
your profile friend requests
notifications and settings there are
still a lot of text menus to go through
a lot of options to check and select but
the interface is really fast and mostly
looks really good on the TV if nothing
else it's the speed that makes that a
lot more fun to use even switching
between users is easier than ever using
your controllers and the light bars to
figure out who's trying to do something
you'll need to pay $49.99 a year for a
PlayStation Plus subscription in order
to join others in online gaming all this
systems social features are still free
so you don't necessarily need to pay
just to interact with your friends but
with that subscription you also get
discounts on games free games and more
it's really worth the price of admission
there are a few media apps that come
with the ps4 from Netflix and Hulu to
crackle and NBA gametime they're mostly
good apps and Sony likes to talk about
how popular the ps3 was for Netflix but
the apps are clearly not the point of
the console they're all buried in one
menu item on the home screen and the
library itself is pretty small and as if
to further drive the point home Sony's
actually removed the ability to play
back local content like music videos and
photos on the console every single thing
about the ps4 is designed in service of
making games great and nothing else like
the totally seamless way to share clips
from your gameplay on Twitch or Ustream
or to see what your friends are doing of
course watching people play games is
going to get a lot better when the
actual game
themselves get better most of the ps4
launch titles look great more detailed
and impressive than ever but most of
them just look better there's not really
much in the way of meaningful different
gameplay here a few games like Need for
Speed rivals even run into occasional
framerate issues it looks great when it
works well but it doesn't always work
well and that's kind of worrisome given
that this is the console that's supposed
to have plenty of power left to spare
for the next decade Mac is one of the
big exclusives for ps4 s launch and the
games a lot of fun it's not
overwhelmingly impressive technically
but it's a fun relentless game you can
play for hours games like Battlefield 4
and Call of Duty ghosts don't feel that
different than they did on the old
consoles and while Killzone Shadowfall
is beautiful it's really just a basic
shooter but that's the thing about
launch games they're almost never good
and the ps4 is certain to get good games
even if the most fun game right now is
resogun an ultra simple game that feels
a bit like geometry Wars
what's coming next is really what's most
interesting about the ps4 this is a
console designed to last a long time to
sell eight years from now as much as to
sell today the ability to stream games
from your ps4 to your PlayStation Vita
is remarkable and works really well even
if it's not always optimized for the
small screen you're using the
PlayStation camera for now is incredibly
basic you get a couple of voice controls
and it does a nice job of identifying
you but there's no game support or even
really useful system control that could
come soon though even the PlayStation
app for Android and iOS which for now
acts mostly as a better alternative to
the on-screen keyboard has some huge
potential and in general the ps4 is all
about potential it's a faster simpler
console with a great new design and a
great new controller it has a fun few
games though the lineup is going to get
a lot better over time
Sony fixed a lot of what ailed the ps3
but it's clearly only at the beginning
of its journey here if you don't have
your heart set on buying a console right
now the best course of action is to wait
we haven't seen what the Xbox one can do
yet and even the ps4 has a lot of
growing left to do but it's clear that
Sony's built a fast useful console
designed to make a lot of gamers very
happy and there's little doubt this 399
device will do just that the only
question is how long it's going to take
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
