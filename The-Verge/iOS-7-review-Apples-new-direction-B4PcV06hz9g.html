is iOS 7 this Apple says is the biggest
change ever made to iOS and more than
any hardware change it's made in the
last six years this new software
fundamentally changes how you'll use
your iPhone Apple has been accused of
being boring of being stale of not
keeping up with the times
iOS 7 is its response it starts with the
overall look which is completely
different from anything I OS has ever
been it's not exactly unrecognizable but
it's totally new different font weights
white backgrounds a nifty parallax
effect on the homescreen text as
basically everything in the design
there's nothing to the contacts app or
the calendar other than different fonts
and simpler backgrounds it's a much
cleaner simpler look but in some ways
it's not nearly as intuitive as iOS used
to be there used to be skeuomorphism
everywhere I'm glad that's all gone but
Apple threw the baby out with the
bathwater to some extent so many visual
cues are gone with buttons replaced by
words that you're just supposed to know
to tap or a back gesture which works in
some apps but not all and only in some
places in those apps to alleviate that
problem somewhat Apple swapped these
guideposts for feedback whenever you do
something something seems to happen when
you open an app it's like the app
explodes from its icon on your home
screen when you close it it gets sucked
back in when you swipe to unlock your
phone the passcode screen doesn't just
appear anymore it slides in from the
side as if you dragged it over these
animations are helpful in some places
but they're often slow and always kind
of jarring I don't need to watch my app
open I just wanted to open Apple's big
bet with iOS 7 is that you already know
how to use a smart phone you
instinctively reach to the top left
corner to go back and you know to swipe
from left to right to unlock your phone
once you figure it all out it works
basically like it always has and it's
definitely cleaner and nicer but iOS
just doesn't feel obvious anymore but
there is truth to the idea that if you
already know how to use a smart phone
you'll figure out iOS 7 quickly because
in most ways the OS here hasn't actually
changed much there's only one really new
feature that will actually affect how
you use your phone
that's control center a transparent
window that slides up from the bottom of
the screen and sits over top of whatever
you're doing it finally gives iOS users
a quick way to change screen brightness
toggle Wi-Fi or launch the camera app
from anywhere it's kind of a cluttered
odd-looking collection of icons and
sliders but it's really really useful
most of the other quote-unquote new
features are just tweaks to the way
things always were
when you double tap the home button to
see the multitasking screen you get an
icon and also a screenshot of each app
you have running and you can close them
easily by swiping the screen shot upward
it's just like webOS always was but the
basic multitasking and task switching
haven't changed here your apps will be
much more current as you jump around
because apps that are running can
finally update in the background in iOS
7 but getting around the OS itself
hasn't really changed speaking of
background updating apps themselves can
now update without your intervention you
just see a blue dot when the apps move
to a new version the app store itself is
nicer looking as is iTunes with the
Pandora like features of iTunes radio
and the fact that your purchases now
show up in your library without you
having to hunt them down in the store I
actually found myself using iTunes
regularly for the first time in a long
time there's a new panel in
notifications called today which shows
your appointments for the day along with
the weather and even your alarm clock
for tomorrow it's not particularly
powerful but I loved not having to open
the clock app every night to check my
alarm series also a lot more useful now
you can pick between male and female
voices and use Siri to do much more than
just search the web just being able to
say Siri turn off Bluetooth or Siri what
was my last text message is really
awesome
series not quite as powerful or as
contextual as Google now and still
awkwardly asks too many questions and
defaults to web search too often but
it's a huge improvement there are lots
of little features to which are neat but
not exactly earth-shattering FaceTime
audio is nice but it obviously only
works with other people with compatible
devices it's not going to replace my
actual phone which by the way has a nice
wrap than before anytime soon airdrop
should be a handy way to share files
pictures and notes between iOS devices
but it's kind of clunky people have to
be really near you for the phone to find
them and they tend to appear and
disappear in the list for no reason
nearly every one of apples core apps has
a new look a new uglier icon and very
little new functionality male has a
swiping gesture that makes triaging your
email a little easier which I
appreciated reminders and notes are just
better-looking versions of themselves
Calendar is still harder to use than
most third party options so far has been
cleaned up and improved a lot with a
unified toolbar for searching and
browsing are really easy rolodex for
switching between tabs and all the app
chrome at least on the iPhone does a
nice job of getting out of the way if
Apple did one thing well with iOS 7 it's
that chrome really does get out of the
way most of the time it's much flatter
much cleaner and much more about the
apps themselves
which is good or at least will be one
more apps update for now non optimized
apps don't even get to use the new
cleaner keyboard the one exception here
is the camera app which did change in a
big way it's jarring at first not having
the aperture blades close and open every
time you take a picture and there is a
lot more interface chrome here than
there used to be but it's super easy to
switch from video to photos to panoramas
to Instagram style square shots
it feels faster and surfaces some of the
features people might have missed before
and there are filters too so you can
basically just skip Instagram altogether
the Photos app is a fun scrolling way to
see all of your pictures at once or just
one it automatically sorts all your
photos and makes finding old ones much
easier but mostly it's also just awesome
looking there's a lot more than just
this in iOS 7 basically every part of
the OS has a new look and feel even if
only a few places actually work
differently than they used to the OS is
out now for every iPhone after the
iPhone 4 the most recent iPod Touch the
iPad 2 and later and the iPad Mini
it's pretty buggy on the iPad right now
by the way so I'd hold off updating for
a while if you can get away with it iOS
has always been a good operating system
but iOS 7 isn't some huge change some
complete rethinking of how we use our
smart phones it's really just a coat of
paint
iOS still has a Tico system which is
just completely unrivaled but at this
point Android has a much richer sharing
system which lets you move easily
between apps and do much more than tap I
Oh s7 s inscrutable icon and upload
things to Flickr it also has a better
richer notification system which on iOS
is still just things that pop over top
of what you're doing and have to be
dismissed individually but those are
existing problems ones that many iOS
users live happily with iOS 7 is a very
good operating system just as iOS has
been since 2007 for now it's just a
bunch of mostly useful tweaks like
background updating in the today's
screen there are lots of new api's and
tools for developers that could
eventually lead to really fantastically
useful features and better-looking and
more consistent apps but right now it's
awesome what less than that
