is this thing that a lot of normal
people who care about video games
probably don't know about right listen
oh yeah why would you but you can't come
no sorry you can't get it you can't come
because it's super expensive but it
turns out it's very very important and
it's not important like III where
there's like lots of big announcements
but there is a reason to kind of care
what would you say GDC is unlike the
most top level it's a bunch of lectures
its panels its developers gathering to
talk about games how they're made what
people want to do with their games GDC
itself has been around for a very long
time Judy's days actually older than me
which is like a bunch of so2 DC got its
start and may 42 okay I'm sorry I'm
dying
so anyway away from plants inevitable
death so it started as a bunch of people
about 25 people gathered in somebody's
living room to meet and talk about games
and since then it's I mean it's blown up
like they they've been doing this for a
very long time they have like thousands
of people that show up every year to
come talk they just keep taking over
space like this year we were walking
past the mall and there was like a big
sign I'm like oh I thought Games
connection was part of GDC it was in the
Moscone Center these things normally
aren't like oh no now it's moved to the
mall it's just it's like it's in this
other big building and it's like oh sure
the fourth floor there is now just this
it seems like every time we're here it's
a it's taking over more of San Francisco
today yeah the previous time since I
came here the first time probably in
2009 it's it's I mean obviously grew a
lot larger
but it's this weird place where you can
kind of see what the thing is everybody
thinks they're going to make the most
money off of video games where it's like
there's a while where it's like
everything that you went to was mobile
focused and then specifically it was
like free-to-play the focused and then
this year there are tons and tons of
panels about
negotiating peace with your community
yeah you can tell like it's kind of this
like shell-shocked from events of last
year that has affected what GDC is this
year so it's kind of like a weird test
of where the video game community is
that at any given time and I think
that's one way that it changes I mean
what I mean even in you've been here
three times right right right even in
that amount of time have you seen any
changes it's hard to say I feel like not
a ton I will say that one of the big
things that I at least heard is that
they apparently have more women ever
than speaking so at this point 20% I
believe is about what it is it's like
breakdown of how many women they have
speaking this year I mean that's a big
thing right like we don't even at e3 we
still don't see that many women on stage
yeah and I think they're making a
concentrated effort to make those
changes which again it is kind of the
nice part about Game Developers
Conference is it feels a little bit more
like the aspirational idea of the video
game industry or it's like this is what
we want to be and when there are years
where I've been where that was a little
depressing because it felt like there is
so many negative things happening that I
that I couldn't imagine that being an
aspirational goal but this year and I'm
hoping in and last year I felt like they
were kind of finding their footing and
realizing this needs to be a much more
inclusive space yeah
in terms of it being an important part
for the average consumer is there
anything about it that you think is
interesting for the normal person um I
mean gosh like the thing that I take
away is there's like a bigger focus on
Indies here I feel like sure that's for
me personally that's what I want to know
because Indies I think don't get as much
attention at the bigger shows so you
feel I feel like there's a lot more any
coverage at you know events like this
even i GF like the awards yeah you know
we're going to get to see those like big
any games be highlighted and sometimes
there are any games there that are up
for awards that I haven't even heard of
so I feel like it's a good chance to
like really dip your toe into that yeah
I think there's the IGF Ward's and I
mean basically the GDC Awards you can go
out for Choice Awards and I think both
of those feel more useful for the
consumer yeah the person who's going out
and buying games and probably
any of the other award shows while I
enjoy other award shows they feel very
closely connected to the companies that
they're giving games to right um well
this feels more like oh these are the
games that people who actually make
games are paying attention to which is
like an interesting way of looking at or
to a lot of the awards that are given
out in Hollywood it's a great place for
us as the press who want to report for
our readers what's actually going on in
the industry because it is this place
where you actually get to talk to the
people who make the game so you're not
talking to just the publicist or the
marketing team or just you know being
sent a demo in the mail you're actually
talking to the people who are making
these games and getting an idea of like
what it's like to make them and what
it's like to work in this industry and I
think that is maybe the most valuable
thing about covering this places I think
the stories that you see across the are
influenced by the conversations that are
had here where we get an idea of what
it's actually like to make games</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
