adrianne jeffries or as my friends call
me the regulator this is 90 seconds on
the verge presented by virgin mobile
google has proposed a set of search
changes it hopes will alleviate
antitrust concerns in European Union the
company is volunteering to separate
promoted links from regular search
results with quote clear graphical
features when it links to its own
products like Google Maps it's also
offering to include links to three rival
services the proposed changes would be
in effect for five years but the
European Commission has asked Google's
competitors to weigh in before anything
moves forward ABC wants you to share how
you're feeling when you're watching the
news a new web and iPhone app called
social soundtracker will let users tap
one of five buttons to register how
they're feeling during a given story
what are the options clap boo laughs
gasps and all the app will sync up with
facebook so users can see how their
friends are feeling as well social
soundtracker will debut Saturday as part
of ABC's live stream of the White House
Correspondents Dinner but the iphone app
will be out until May and finally yahoo
has closed a deal to become the
exclusive online home for Saturday Night
Live CEO Marissa Mayer announced that on
September first Yahoo will become the
sole streaming destination for snl's
38-year back catalogs as well as clips
from the show's current season however
that exclusivity applies only to its
clip library which means full episodes
of SNL Pask still be featured on
services like Hulu and NBC com just tell
me where I can watch unfrozen caveman
lawyer that's all I ask that's it for
today's top stories coming up tomorrow
for step authentication how comfortable

account security</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
