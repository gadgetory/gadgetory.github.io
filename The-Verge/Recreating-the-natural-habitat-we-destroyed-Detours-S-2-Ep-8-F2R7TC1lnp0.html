features of Oregon it served as a source
of drinking water and recreational
fishing for generations a coho salmon
and steelhead trout were abundant in the
river and its tributaries
but historic floods and River
manipulation endangered about a dozen
native species conservationists group
the freshwater trust is using
cutting-edge laser technology in its
effort to restore the damaged ecosystem
and after decades of displacement salmon
and steelhead are finding their way home
the reason that we're here doing River
restoration is because for like thirty
forty fifty sixty years they've been
clearing out the large wood out of the
stream for various reasons to reduce
with the idea of reducing floods
collecting firewood they've been doing
timber harvest in this area and that
that also stops back in the 1980s and so
since then we've been doing stream
restoration in this area and what
happens is when you remove these
roughness elements from the system the
the river responds by getting shorter
and straighter and as you get shorter
and straighter you have more energy and
as it has more energy it tends to down
cut and become further removed from the
floodplain and what we really want is
the water out on the floodplain because
that gives us the habitat complexity and
diversity that juvenile salmon steelhead
need River restoration requires
topographic surveys traditionally
watersheds have been examined on foot
but freshwater trust uses lidar or light
detection and ranging an infrared laser
that provides three-dimensional details
of the land this remote sensing
technology creates a detailed map of the
watershed which enables them to find
restoration sites from a distance once
we've collected lidar data via remote
sensing from the office you could
essentially see all the historic meander
patterns and it really accelerated our
ability to find the side channels and
figure out how they should work as a
system in haul currently the river is
this angry river coming off the mountain
going straight down the mountain very
low sanyasa t large cobbles and boulders
not very much spawning gravel very
simple stream and what we're trying to
do is make it complex
today we are actually tipping over whole
trees to give us that instrument so with
a very low risk that infrastructure we
can kick water out onto the floodplain
and essentially let nature decide where
it wants the side channel or off-channel
habitats and be
a little bit like Christmas morning
right now you don't know what you're
gonna
so the project objective here was to add
whole trees to restore floodplain
connectivity on this river Left
floodplain right now you're looking down
at a secondary channel the trees three
trees got pulled over they bridge the
secondary channel landed down in the
main channel and carried across the
floodplain when we get high water events
next winter the water is going to come
down this main channel get kicked out of
the main channel by these three pieces
of large wood we just added and AD
habitat over there on the floodplain
some people come out here and say oh
this is the most beautiful stream ever
seen when you're looking at from a
fish's eye is a very simple habitat and
so using limited resources and the
challenges that come with that and going
out here and creating to me what feels
like a magical place for fish it's just
extremely rewarding you know I love
seeing the habitat in biological
response that we'll get out of these
projects I mean one thing that's really
unique about this is that applied
restoration it's pretty good at going
out there and getting the habitat
response that that you want to get
whether it's recruiting large wood
whether it's recruiting gravels what's
really neat about salmon and still Creek
is that there's enough productivity in
the salmon and steelhead that will open
a side channel in weeks later it'll fill
a juvenile fish will create a main stem
pool or a log jam on the main stem
salmon recruit gravels that winter and
then the following spring will have
winter steelhead spawning in it so they
immediately see that biological response
it's tremendously rewarding</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
