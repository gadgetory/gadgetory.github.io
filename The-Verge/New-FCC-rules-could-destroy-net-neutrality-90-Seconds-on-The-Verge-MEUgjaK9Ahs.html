parties we just don't know what that
means I'm Adrienne Jeffries and this is
ninety seconds on the Virge the internet
could be getting a fast lane reserved
only for those rich enough to use it the
FCC is considering new rules for
Internet service providers that would
harm a key principle of net neutrality
that all traffic should be treated
equally right now is PS aren't allowed
to give special treatment meaning
companies like Comcast can't decide if
data from Facebook is more important
than a movie from Netflix but the new
rules would allow ISPs to discriminate
between data on so-called last mile
where the network connects to your home
it's a toll that would allow ISPs to tax
Internet companies for the privilege of
connecting with customers who are
already paying for the network all this
could be avoided if the government would
just declare what most people already
take for granted the internet like water
and electricity is a public utility
but the major ISPs continue to fight
against that label warning that net
neutrality is a meddlesome government
regulation a draft of the open Internet
notice of proposed rulemaking is being
circulated to the Commission today an
FCC Chairman Tom wheeler said that he
intends to have enforceable rules by the
end of the year be sure to let your
congressional representatives know how
you feel about a free and open Internet
and while you're at it give FCC Chairman
Tom wheeler a call here's his number we
will not let that kind of control take
over the Internet
