the drone zone at CES behind me you see
booths for unique and DGI and these are
probably the only two companies I can
say with confidence will actually be
around next year
take off
we went to check out the Motordrome
which was advertised as a very expensive
piece of military-grade equipment
turned out to be an empty plastic shell
a prop increasingly it feels like drones
are used to signify high technology when
really they're just cheap toys we're
going to take in a walk around the drone
zone and show you some of what we found
this year
so here we are with the e hang 180 for
this one the award for best vapor where
last year at CES and once again it is
the hit of the show
tracking lots of attention and not
flying at all
it's easy to get confused with drones
about what's technology and what's a toy
the stuff behind me is definitely going
to sell well but it hasn't made any real
improvements in the way drones operate
behind us there's a lot of competitors
we're seeing but they're in a much
smaller platform right now but you see
them they look like they have a really
good product and it looks cool it has
great features but then that you're
later they're going yeah and you don't
see him and do they change names and
they get bought up I don't know like
that it looks cool but I mean if you're
really going to get into this market you
know you got to compete with us and you
got to compete with DJI this is the
power vision booth I was actually
supposed to swim in a giant tank full of
water with a mermaid and some underwater
drums the whole thing collapsed and
soaked this booth which is kind of a
metaphor for where I think the industry
is headed the slogan here is change the
fishing world because we all know
there's nothing fish are more attracted
to than a loud angry machine with very
bright lights
so I'm here with the flying magic air
cleaner it's a parrot bebop drone and
then on top it's got a nifty little
velcro mount and three rings of
negatively charged ion particulate
cleaners sure to follow the dust and
pollen out of your room
so like what's the average age of people
who are buying this what we found
through some customer research that
we're about 27 years old which means
that we have people that are going down
and not worried about buying it at
Target Toys R Us or Walmart you're
walking out with a great consumer
electronics package but with a drone
that they can actually afford and then
play well right so full-grown men going
to the toy that's me right that's what
we do
the drones on STS is getting bigger
every year but it's hard to believe a
lot of these companies will still be
flying in a year's time
the line between toy and technology is
increasingly hard to distinguish still
gotta admit it's pretty fun
get that one yeah right</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
