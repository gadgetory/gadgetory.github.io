live in the dark when the Sun Goes Down
over many developing nations the
percentage of the population that has no
electricity has to fend for itself they
battled the night using kerosene lamps
and other inefficient methods
productivity goes down and they're
unable to study or work factors that
perpetuate inequality in poverty can
anything be done to lift these people
out of the darkness
it has been a horrifying week here in
port-au-prince a week were the dead the
injured and the homeless are sharing a
city largely reduced to rubble the
earthquake rocked this impoverished
Caribbean nation late this afternoon
three hundred and sixteen thousand
people died and many more lost their
homes in the winter of 2010 Haiti was
devastated by the most powerful
earthquake to hit the island in two
centuries between two hundred and thirty
thousand and three hundred and fifteen
thousand individuals were killed and
more than a million were displaced the
country's infrastructure never robust to
begin with had been ravaged by severe
tropical storms and hurricanes in
previous years after the earthquake many
were left without basic necessities food
water shelter and not least of all like
in many of those parts of the world a
lot of the violence occurs in places of
darkness so we knew we wanted to start
with light I was born in New York but I
spent every summer nating and after the
earthquake I brought seven delegations
of influencers and people who I thought
could be helpful to the development
efforts and it was clear given that
Haiti's about 80 percent off-grid
there's a preponderance of solar and so
if we can bring those things together
we could have tremendous impact and we
will areas where we work that day and
basically 6 p.m. and many kids cannot
read at night unless the plants are able
to buy left to light in their houses and
and and even many families do not have
the means to do that
born out of a desire to eradicate these
problems and power developed Lucille
enter a compact lightweight inflatable
LED light that harnesses small solar
panels to illuminate the darkest corners
of these developing areas so their pitch
was that they wanted to develop a
lighting product that could be sold for
a profit
and really do good but also be a
business model so the goal was could we
make a solar charge product that could
provide as much light if not more and a
cost that was lower than what it would
be for kerosene so the Lucille answer is
lightweight super compact weighs about
four ounces
waterproof and your provides
significantly more light than other
products that cost five to ten dollars
more but it also does so in an elegant
manner it's something that you can have
in any room whether it's developing or
developed market and it's beautiful
simple press of the button turns the
unit on a normal output setting which
lasts about 12 hours and in a high
setting which lasts about six hours on
the bottom side you can see the solar
panel we came up with a very reliable
design which is easy to produce the
battery stores the energy here the solar
panel on this side the LED is around and
then the control electronics for
controlling both the charging and
discharging in the battery and also the
various lighting modes it's completely
waterproof submersible to more than a
meter
you would think actually it's pretty
minimal but really you know it's an
incredible amount of stress and remains
very very rugged and reliable part of
our focus is create the best-in-class
solar-powered products in the space we
want to be clear that at least initially
we're focused on getting the best
technologies to the people who need it
most
the type of feedback we get is
incredible maybe the people who are
seeing our product and they're like wow
my life is gonna change in so many ways
people are for the first time
experiencing these lanterns and and the
reaction is just incredible I mean they
cry they literally break down and cry
over something that you and I look at as
a toy but it's because we haven't ever
had the opportunity to really be in the
dark our whole life and for the first
time ever actually have a really quality
Lantern inside the home or in a school
the impacts are enormous I witnessed
firsthand the importance of these lights
for this for the children and other
families so then what happened is the
developed markets are like wow that's
super cool I wanted to now what the
developed started to pick it up that
quickly increases revenues lower costs
allow us to pour morn's R&amp;amp;D and develop
products that were resonate with that
base of the pyramid even more so that we
can come back to market with products
that are as impactful if not more so but
even at a lower cost so our sales here
do enable us to do good in the
developing world because we're such a
large consumer market in the United
States the the ability to generate
volume here enables us to fund what we
want to do elsewhere in the world for
every order we get from one of our major
retailers whether it's Lowe's or
EMS that in turn it affords us to be
able to give more through our NGO
partners and what I hope to see is a
continuation of that kind of
relationship right the days of simply
maximizing profits are behind us
information flows too quickly it's
understanding that we live in an
interconnected world and figuring out
what each part of that world can offer
to the other in order to ensure that
everyone benefits
