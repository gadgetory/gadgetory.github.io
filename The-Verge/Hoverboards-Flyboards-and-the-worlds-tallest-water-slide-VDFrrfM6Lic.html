offer a fine means of frolic for the
expert with real speed essential to keep
those skimmers on top of the water we've
come pretty far from plain old
waterskiing and traditional water parks
and today we are going even further so a
little while ago I came across these
YouTube videos of people riding these
insane water things I had never seen
before
turns out they're called fly boards let
me tell you they are sick
after watching maybe two seconds of this
footage I knew I had to try this for
myself
this is Jimmy Bisset he owns a fly
boarding company out on Long Island this
is Trey shallow horn the Verge's video
producer oh and I'm Sam Scheffer he gave
Jimmy a call he brought out some jet
skis and fly boards and I could not
contain myself oh and by the way he's
really good at this
what is a fly board fly board is a water
jet propelled board and little you can
fly in the air above the water with so
how do these work I know there's a jet
ski involved the board is involved but
there's pipes and there's engines and
what what happens yeah so you got the
jet ski the hood the hose folks right to
the back of the jet pump and then
there's a you pipe that gets connected
right to that so all that water that's
getting pushed through just like your
regular jet ski and just getting
redirected through the hose and out and
out to the boots so high limit is there
a speed limit how does that stuff work
the the hose will be flying today was 50
foot long
they do make ones either you know about
65 or 70 foot hose you know when I'm
flying I can get up you know 35 40 feet
you know at max now are you are you
stationary for the most part is the idea
that you want to keep movement you're
pretty much moving all the time like the
fly boarder is pulling the jet ski
around so wherever the fly board goes
the jet ski is just following as in that
has enough power to pull the jet ski
correct yeah usually when you're on the
fly board you don't even realize that's
it's the jet ski is getting pulled you
know because it's the design of the ski
it's just very light it just floats on
top so like more most board devices
emits it's about balance right it's a
little bit about balance but it's it's a
very it's the board itself is very
balanced I say just relax you know I
mean keep your body pretty loose and
just look straight ahead will I die
today not at all
I got strapped into the flyboard and I
was ready to go I swam out tethered to
the jet ski and Jimmy gave me some
throttle I managed to hover for a few
seconds but it did not last long turns
out I needed some practice so to balance
the fly board you need to relax your
body and pay very close attention to
your feet point them too far forward and
I'd fall down pick my feet up and I'd
fall backwards but I didn't have nearly
as tough of a time as traded honestly I
was focusing too much of my legs and not
enough of my feet by the time actually
realized what I need to do I just simply
kept falling over but hey at least I was
putting on a show for the crew even
though I was struggling a bit at first
it wasn't very long until I got the hang
of it I felt confident enough to hover
move around a bit and I even tried some
backflips
that was so sick I definitely was
feeling it and next I tried the
hoverboard which is basically a
surfboard that uses the same technology
as fly board so it's water powered oh
and Trey was actually good at this one I
killed on the hoverboard
I slept as a teenager so you know it
came a little bit more naturally to me
do you think these are gonna keep
evolving and do you think that the sport
is growing yeah 100%
just in a couple years I've been in it
now we have competitions I mean its
worldwide right now the different style
boards are coming out different
movements with the board you know so you
can so the ability to do different
tricks is evolving to you know cuz it's
so new a new tricks coming out every day
you know someone's just throwing
something and oh what's that looks cool
you know today was awesome it was
amazing one of the best days of my life
absolutely absolutely I felt like I
didn't have enough time and I just
wanted to spend like that's entire
summer doing it yeah and what's cool up
these things are not out of the world
you can go buy one the granted they're
very expensive like but it's just I
think it's fascinating that you know a
year or two ago we were just watching
these videos on YouTube today we tried
them and then you can you just own them
you can buy them it's a real thing yeah
no not at all now trying it back to it
now if you're landlocked I feel too
uncomfortable standing on the board then
your other option is an old school water
park when I was a kid I'd love to go
into water parks lazy rivers large wave
pools two slides couldn't get enough of
it
and since then with the rise in
technology we've seen some pretty cool
things like wave simulators which allows
you to surf the perfect wave without
ever having to get into the ocean and
here at Schlitterbahn in Kansas City
they constructed the world's tallest
waterslide four-roomed and let me tell
you being there it's pretty big so bucht
is kind of an extreme example of some
shorter bond technology as the blaster
water coaster type technology that we've
implemented through our park system over
the years you're looking at a 170 foot
roughly tall almost 700 linear feet ride
that only takes about 18 seconds to
complete it may only take 18 seconds to
go down the slide but the climb up was
pretty rough the farooq stands at
roughly 17 stories tall which translates
into about 264 stairs
and when you reach the top know you're
the tallest thing for miles around
you're even higher than a Statue of
Liberty being on the top was
breathtaking I really appreciated the
views I could see Kansas City way out in
the distance but it was super windy
which scared me more than the slide
itself oh and then there's verrucas
growl it's a little bit of a
revolutionary ride in the fact that not
only is it the world's tallest but we've
also gone through with some of the
technology and combined air and water to
power the boat up over the hill in order
to get over that hill Farouk uses a
combination of compressed air and water
to shoot the raft over the hump they had
to get this perfect it even delayed the
opening of the ride itself not enough
for us and the raft doesn't make it over
the hill too much force whoa let's just
say it's not very pretty so you can
understand when I was at the top
strapped in pieces of velcro I was
pretty scared
sorry for the screams you're about to
hear
when you come over like nothing drops
you in and then you get to a point where
it doesn't look like their slide you
just sort of you just drop and then you
see a slide and there's like a little
bit of anti-gravity I feel like you're
floating a little bit on that it's
really fast it's over so quickly so I
notice on the the very beginning of the
drop it almost felt you were going very
or you're going vertical yeah so you've
got that sense of weightlessness similar
to what you experienced on a roller
coaster
that's another unique feature that
verruckt offers so not only are you
gonna go through a feeling of freefall
from 170 feet you're also gonna get to
experience it on the second smaller drop
at roughly 65 feet and other plants and
continue breaking your own record well I
always tell people that said part of the
unique thing of on parks wells that were
ever-evolving and ever-changing adding
and expanding our attractions and our
amenities the next attraction probably
won't be anything quite as tall but I
would never put anything past Jeff Henry
he is a wizard of water and he continues
to surprise the world of water parks
every day riding the fly board and hover
board are easily some of the coolest
things I've ever done
and sliding down the tallest waterslide
in the world wasn't too bad either so
now that summer is officially here I
cannot recommend it enough
go find a fly board get on and become
your own wizard of water
