Francisco we had to come to Silicon
Valley though because small empires has
never covered a hardware startup and we
found a pretty interesting one called
August and we're gonna learn just what
it takes to go from an idea in your head
to something actually on a shelf I'm
Alexis Ohanian start-up founder and Y
Combinator partner over the last year I
went on a two hundred event book tour
and met people building small empires
all across North America now I'm back
with a new season revisiting some of my
favorite stuff shows it's over ever
since pebble technologies $10,000,000
kick-started for Annie watch in 2012 a
lot of upstart entrepreneurs and
established players alike have been
trying to enter the hardware space but
what many don't realize is just because
you made a cool video and you have a
working prototype it doesn't mean you
can get your product to shelves on
budget with the same degree of quality
that you or more importantly your
customers desire the August smart log
just came out and it looks like they may
have cracked the code they have a
beautiful working product on the shelves
but getting it there wasn't easy
I'm Jason Johnson the CEO and co-founder
of August we make the August smart lock
this is a new line of product called a
smart lock and so I can control it with
my phone I'm going to just lock the door
it's authorizing its telling me that a
screen so that means the doors open
let's close it there we go
the door is left it's a device you put
on the inside of a door August is
designed to go on the inside of your
door so it's just on the inside of the
door it attaches to your existing
deadbolt lock to allow you to stop using
metal keys and instead use your smart
phone to access a house or
and also to give keys to say your your
family your housekeeper you can set the
time the hours it works and it really
solves the problem keys also it knows
when I get home by geolocation so if
I've got my hands full of baby in
grocery I come near it opens up the main
advantage of this is that you can invite
people to your house without actually
having to give them a physical key all
right or you don't have to worry about
whether your maid you know like made
multiple copies of your keys or the
ex-boyfriend ex-girlfriend situation so
there's a lot of convenience and some
security elements to it that are really
compelling for a lot of our customers
why solve this problem of our locking
doors like why do you eat keys yeah so
you know it's funny the past two years
we're working on this is a phrase I've
heard more than anything it's that it's
I hate keys her dot hundred of times and
we do hate keys in fact that in New York
City two million people a year are
locked out of their houses keys are a
pain we working another job got locked
out of your house just said get it I'm
solving this problem right now
ending keys forever yeah I I I wish it
was it was that dramatic for me it was
actually somebody else that actually
suffered it i I had a friend staying at
my house and and they got locked out and
I had to crawl through the dog door in
the back of the house
alright is very small doctor out boy I'm
not a proud person yeah that's how they
got in
and and so they're telling you this
story and you're sympathetic I presume
and you're like I'm going to solve this
problem so you never have to crawl
through my dog yeah you know I got built
a couple technology companies and so I
you know I have a good idea what you can
do with technology you know it's got to
be way to do this way to kind of change
those old metal locks and keys that we
have and do it with them electronics
because of crowdfunding and pre-orders a
lot more people are thinking about
starting hardware companies that's great
thing is when you start a software
company you really just need a laptop
internet connection and time with
hardware companies you need all of those
things as well as contacts and factories
distribution supply prototyping so much
more the list goes on and all of those
things cost a lot of money yeah so you
know I'm fortunate that I've built a
couple companies previously and and when
I started August I started over a
founders den which is a private
co-working space in San Francisco the
great thing about being in a space like
that is you're around all kinds of
interesting people they're entrepreneurs
also investors so I casually started
mentioning the idea of August 2 a few
people that are active angel investors
and I was very fortunate I got I got
great reception everyone could relate to
the problem of keys and the hassle of
keys and so very quickly people started
asking if if if I would be interested
them investing in the company
there are a lot of folks who have tried
different approaches to creating like
the smart lock how did you settle on
this one I'm always interested in
technology that becomes you know
universal I become that's easily
attainable I'm not so interested in
technology that is exclusive or
expensive and this is what a home
automation has been for you know the
last 20 years or so you know very
complex very expensive systems that
usually you know it's the person who
installed them in the home who likes
them and then everybody else in the
household really like hates it right
because it's over complicated and it
breaks down and it requires you know
specific equipment so this was been one
of the ideas how do we make automatic
kind of smart door lock how do we make
it very easy and very attainable the key
was to make it to not make it a full
replacement product do not force people
to remove their hardware remove their
doors right n - and to make it an add-on
essentially to what you already have so
what you say you know you look at all
your front door well actually when you
look at your front door you see whatever
was there before from the outside right
we're not changing the the outer part of
the deadbolt you know if somebody has a
key they can still use it and the fact
that this just attaches on the inside is
a smart robot that will be able to
determine whether you're getting close
and will unlock and lock for you you
know that's a way to make the product
attainable meaning anybody can install
it you know people don't have to have a
big discussion or a big you know change
in what they already have the secret was
to to kind of tackle it in a way that is
really cognizant cognizant of you know
what people already have what they live
with and maybe they don't want a big
flashing you know techie product on the
outside or the inside of their doors you
know sort of with a big screen maybe
they want something that is subtle and
discreet and so this is this was an
exercise in restraint in a way
great design should be invisible
well-designed products are beautiful
elegant and simple and that simplicity
takes a lot of work that's one thing to
build one version of a beautiful product
to scale that to thousands or even
millions is a whole new challenge does
this start on a cocktail napkin how in
there are a lot a lot of companies a lot
of approaches to this it seems simple
right get rid of the key unlock the door
magically but there are a bunch of
different ways to do that you've settled
on a solution that is pretty elegant
certainly very sexy I'm also simple and
and why why was this the right choice
for August so we spent a lot of time on
this issue we thought you know you can
you can you can replace doors you could
replace whole locking mechanisms you
could do a lot of different ways to to
address the issue and what we wanted to
do was to make what we thought would be
the most simple solution possible
something that anybody could go to a
retail store take it home and install it
themselves in under 15 minutes that was
always our that was a design intent and
so we spent two years in fact doing
doing a design towards that to test it
with many people people that aren't
technically sophisticated the people
they don't know how to use power tools
one make it really simple so it just
takes a a simple screwdriver and about
roughly 10 minutes with regard to this
August lock in particular water what are
some of your favorite parts so so from
the very beginning my my philosophy is
is you know it's it's not about sticking
a display on the wall on the fridge
which is kind of a lot of what you've
seen in the home automation or you know
the smart home environment for me it's
all about discretion I know the friction
of using a key you have to kind of look
forward you have to dig in your bag for
it you have to remember it you have to
physically take it out and and so
everything I've tried to do is how do we
make you know that experience so much
more fluid and so much more discreet at
the same time so being able to hide you
know a little bit of an indication of
okay the lock is turning and it's it's
working for example with the LEDs that
you know I peer through metal
through a technology which is about sort
of microscopic laser etching of the
metal for example being able to just get
that little vibration in your back
pocket so that you know that it's
working in the background without you
having to actually look at your phone
and look at the display for me what you
know where this is going and it's going
to go more and more there is this notion
of the invisible interface meaning
invisible interactions as well so you
get signals and it tells you in the
background that oh my doors locking me
after after I've come in or my door is
locking after I've left the house or
it's unlocking as I'm approaching you
want this to be happening in ways that
are are not disruptive of everything
else that you're doing you know they're
just it's just lets you kind of live
your life fluidly and it works in the
background to to make that happen but
humans still need signals to tell them
that it's happening right and those sub
signals can be very subtle and so that's
what I'm excited about is in a way the
product reveals itself through the
experience not what is trying to scream
with unto itself in a way
you have a problem with that you've
engineered a solution for and it's a
clever one right cuz you don't need a
drill it doesn't take a very long to set
up yeah it's a it's a clever way to get
the robot to do your bidding
what is it like then building a product
not just one that you know in theory
scales beyond a few articles but like
you can actually scales to thousands and
tens of thousands of units yes when you
know you've set some pretty high
expectations once we came up with the
initial concept like automatic door lock
right smart door lock then you know we
work with Eve and his team you know we
want to make something that is
attractive to end-users we want to make
it a very beautiful and magical
experience when you're coming in and out
of the house then you have to figure out
how are we going to actually engineer
and build this you know for mass
production and that's where a lot of the
real challenges came in right so for
example this aluminum face for example
from a design standpoint we wanted it to
look basically completely like a flat
piece of metal there no holes or no
penetrations in here at all but at the
same time there's a set of LEDs behind
right which we want to shine through
here and that's that's you know what an
ID goal and both for the brand as well
from a design standpoint industrial
design industrial design yes and then in
order to make the the light shine
through the the aluminum we had to
execute a series of micro perforations
using a combination of laser and CNC
right so how do we find the right
manufacturing process for this how do we
control that process well how do we
match it up with the LEDs and how do we
ensure that we get enough light shining
through here that it's an accurate
indicator the end user it's such a
subtle simple feature but we went
through at least a dozen different
iterations of this combination here and
working with different factories to try
and execute this design really really
well
one of Eve's amazing genius is it is how
he's able to push the envelope on most
everything so so over our two-year
development cycle
we've had you know many our every week
every week hours and hours and hours in
a room with the creatives with the
engineers looking at how we can just
tweak the smallest of things and and Eve
has this amazing ability to just ask
questions like oh can we make that a
little bit smaller we make it a little
bit smoother can we make that a little
bit you know blank and it you just asks
questions he keeps asking questions
until it's refined and refined and
refined and either either you refine it
right or you just you just your exhaust
you're like you know I we know it it
answers no II actually we cannot I got
any different line is drawn but he's
asks you know Anna Anna Anna in a in a
challenging way but but also in a very
respectful way he just has this great
creative process you just he pushes
everybody on the team Twitter was
conceived right here in South Park and
at that time let's face it it was pretty
janky crashed a lot the nice thing with
software is you can deal with bugs like
that as long as what you're making is
still what users want hardware on the
other hand is harder if you're shipping
something it needs to be really good
especially when the thing that you're
shipping is keeping people's homes and
loved ones safe you only really pay a
cost in time when you're iterating with
software right when you're dealing with
Adams
obviously there's all kinds of other
things that come into it how do things
like shipping and maybe even 3d printing
how do those things affect how you can
create maybe a little bit more easily
right so this this particular element
you know this is the the heart the
mechanical heart of the system we went
through several different iterations of
this this particular design to get the
right torque output to have everything
match up mechanically and electrically
for instance 3d printing allowed us 3d
modeling 3d CAD 3d printing allowed us
to prototype a lot of different types of
case designs
mechanical features in terms of how it's
going to fit but you know the ultimate
you know drivetrain that's in here is
made of at least the case the case part
is made of injection molded plastic and
this is where a lot of people who are in
hardware like this is where your tooling
costs come in there's a lot of physical
you know plant property and equipment
that you have to have in place and you
pay a lot of money for it and it takes a
lot of time to make it in order to
produce mass-produce these parts you can
only really have maybe one or two
iterations on it soft and hard tooling
so you try and do as you do as much
prototyping as possible this one happens
to be machined aluminum prototype it's
all in a relative sense cheaper and
faster than creating hard tools for
making the parts but that that's kind of
the cycle that we have to go through we
try and use every single prototyping
technology that's out there whether it's
3d printing CNC machining before we get
to the point where we actually have to
buy and cut soft and hard tools because
at that point it's that's serious
commitment that's that's a serious
commitment yeah yeah that's usually you
know under a normal schedule maybe a
month to build a set of tools so you'd
been CEO before of a couple of companies
but never a hardware company how much
did that help or hinder you yeah so I
had a little blot right so I've done a
couple of software companies I did a
sizable services company but the
hardware was new for me which meant that
you know I had to rely upon some of
Eve's expertise but also outsourcing
right and using using firms that have
done hardware before and you know if I
had known two years ago that I would
know so much about hardware than I do
today boy I'm not sure I would have
would have been as excited that it was
it's been a tremendous learning curve
because it's a device that has 167
components inside of it right and
ostensibly the doesn't look that
complicate it doesn't look at that
complicate is is the beauty of good
hardware yeah you know you kind of
hide all that insides but it's a very
complex device so what's your advice to
someone who wants to they want to start
the next August hmm
and let's say they don't even have the
experience of being CEO before maybe
they've tinkered a little bit with
hardware but if you could take those two
years of lots of lessons and distill
that in some way what would you say so I
would probably more readily encourage
them at work software honestly because
you want the competition no I know I'm
not so concerned about that it hardware
it requires a tremendous amount of
capital it's uh and I had some great
people you know give me advice on this
when I when I saw council at the
beginning and they said yeah prepared
spent a lot of money because you know
prototyping is is an expensive endeavor
and and tooling for manufacturing is a
very expensive and Sunday and I change
the tools and now you spend several
hundred thousand dollars on our tool and
you gotta redo the entire thing right
you know not not to trivialize when you
put a lot of hours into software but you
don't have that level of cost generally
yeah with software no definitely not so
it's really hardware founders beware it
is it an expensive endeavor and and I
don't want to scare people off but just
be prepared for that because the worst
thing you want to do is spend a lot of
time and energy and your own money
working on something and then you find
out you can't actually make it into a
product because it require a lot more
capital to turn into the actual project
itself
there's no beta in hardware you know
people's expectations in hardware is
that it has to work and it has to be you
know of high quality and I think you
know in many ways the reason why
hardware is becoming more Sexy's also
because generally the public has become
a lot more you know sensitive to to
quality I mean sometimes you know when
you when you when you struggle to kind
of explain design to people if you just
change the word design to the word
quality then people started getting it
a lot faster right you're welcome
Silicon Valley we came here we shot a
small empires episode and we taught you
something really important Hardware is
hard what software is one thing get away
with a few bugs here and there but
Hardware may seem really cool really
sexy you can put together a really
compelling video people get really
excited money pre-orders all this stuff
starts coming in you still kind of build
something got to build a lot of
something and it has to be good because
if you don't build something great your
focus smartlock found success by
bringing home safety into the internet
age but it isn't just about having a
great product having a clear process
will help your business work efficiently
and greatly succeed start by identifying
specific areas of your business that are
struggling and tackle those right away
make sure everyone knows exactly what
their responsibilities are and then no
two people are working on the same thing
are you spending too much time on work
that isn't necessary eliminate time
wasters and keep your team focused on a
simplified workflow and finally don't
get tied down to any specific step
scheduling reviews will allow you to
make sure that everything is running
smoothly and let you adapt to anything
that might come your way for more
business advice is an 80's business
