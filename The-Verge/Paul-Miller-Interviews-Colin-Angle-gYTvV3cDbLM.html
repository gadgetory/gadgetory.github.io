with Colin angle the CEO of my robot
we're going to talk about robots which
is my favorite subject in the entire
world and thank you so much for joining
us it's so hard to figure out where you
guys are focus because you do those wild
crazy amphibian thing you're talking
about just really serious military stuff
you do cleaning stuff I where's where's
your focus what do you spend your time
well you know I think that the consumer
side of our business has really become a
very very important part so that the
amount of energy we are investing in the
consumer aspects our business Trump's
most of the most of our programs the
military side is very important for us
we have the PackBot the scuba and we've
just launched a small first look robot
which you can you can throw probably as
far as you can because and have that
survive and send back information and
also are looking at remote presence we
have a mission we have a purpose it's
all long-term going toward extending
independent living in the home for the
customer and so that as the country ages
as the world ages we need solutions to
allow people to live independently we
need robots in the home that not just
clean the home that's necessary but not
sufficient we also need technology to
allow doctors and nurses and caregivers
to come into the home and provide
special purpose care or else you end up
moving into assisted living
and that's very expensive and
increasingly unaffordable for people
right so we're developed while we
develop these cleaning technologies
we're also working on robots a good
provide medical care and so we also just
announced an hour what a Segway by the
way well done well we've got this very
cool new robot which is the rp-vita and
its mission is to start allowing doctors
to actually treat and diagnose patients
at a distance so with this robot and an
ipad right a doctor can first send the
robot to whatever patient he wants to
see and when the robot arrives there
interact with that person zoom in using
a high-definition camera take bio
readings your your use a stethoscope or
interface with any of the other
instruments in that the patient's room
and make a diagnosis so what's the next
step after this dude do you know you
talked about helping people aged
independently in the home is this going
to work in the home I mean it's a little
bulky it's not going to do stairs well
there's you know ultimately you want the
robot to do stairs so that's a problem
to go solve minute the in the home
ultimately what we'll what we'll see is
the robots like rumbo slowly
disappearing they'll still be there but
you'll have to do less and less in order
to maintain them hey Selena you see
robot and Frank I of course does that is
that the dream well you know we're not
sure that we want the robot to have the
same willingness to go along with
questionable activities but you know I
think that's not FDA approved yet not
yet nice
there seems to me to be sort of a leap
recently with these sort of a you know
Baxter and these cheaper robotic arms
that's something you guys are looking at
that is that getting easier quickly I
mean it's as robots have a less
expensive ability to understand in their
environment it opens doors for the
robots to do more sophisticated things
Baxter is an is a manufacturing robot so
it operates in a unstructured
environment but it also is designed to
be used in close proximity with people
so it's cool because you no longer have
to separate the robot and the and the
worker yeah and so that type of
technology ultimately will become
important as we add manipulation onto
our robots and you see that technology
accelerating absolutely i mean i think
that what Baxter does is shows that
lower-cost manipulation is possible
where we trade artificial intelligence
for mechanical precision and that's
that's a great and exciting trend robots
light using more artificial intelligence
instead of spending more on mechanical
correct and then you mentioned this
becoming like a robot Butler or that's
your dream I remember you talking about
that before of a bigger robot helping
operate the other robots but a lot of
that is about the user interface and
we're seeing Siri and Google now these
really exciting artificial intelligent
natural language user interfaces is that
something you guys are looking at or how
do you also will be a consumer of that
technology the mobile industry is a
fantastic boon for the robot industry
right because I can just put an Android
or an iOS device as the head of my robot
and have access to all of that
functionality at a very very low cost
and so
the home robot that's interacting with
you will be leveraging the the mobile
user interface technology that exists
and I robot will be focusing on obstacle
avoidance navigation map building
manipulation in New Age there you go and
well again it's an accelerator for the
industry so we'll be able to see more
and more capable robots first attacking
commercial applications and then moving
down in price right so when do I get to
buy one of these when could I afford
this with an arm to take my frozen
chicken out of my freezer to defrost it
for me while I'm at work how well do
they pay you at the verge you know I
think it that's the hell do they pay me
at the road the technology to do that at
a relatively expensive price exists
today and you know over the next 10
years we're going to see it go down and
down and I won't predict exactly what
the date is but it certainly is rapidly
approaching and in ten years for serious
this time right we've heard that number
a lot in the robotics industry but not
for me not from you I may I believe one
step at a time I think that when people
start making grandiose statements about
what in a mere few years as possible or
what their fear is in a few years we're
not we're not close okay we need to pick
applications that have real concrete
value to customers deliver exceed their
expectations and move on i mean i think
that the room is such an amazing example
of what can happen if you do something
very basic but not credibly not right
but very well I mean the there's over 8
million rumbas that have been sold and
we are the fastest growing segment of
the vacuuming industry and around the
world robot vacuuming that's a few years
ago went from being non-existent to
being a category on itself where in many
countries we are one of the leading
vacuum cleaners soul and so that's a
business that's something that will
allow us to make money reinvest money
create new things and accelerate the
marketplace so pick something do it very
well move on to the next thing and then
over time as I mentioned these point
solutions for cleaning will becoming
increasingly self-reliant so you may
have to interact with them you know once
a year and a robot like this comes along
greet you at the door you interact with
it and from there your house knows what
to do and how to take care of itself
awesome well thank you so much i look
forward to that future ok
I don't know really what to say to a
robot I love you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
