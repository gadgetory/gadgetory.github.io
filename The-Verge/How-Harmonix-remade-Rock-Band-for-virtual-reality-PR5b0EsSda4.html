rockstar you might have lived out that
fantasy through a little video game
called rock band but what if you could
do the same thing in virtual reality and
make it feel more real than it ever has
that's what harmonic music system which
has made games like Guitar Hero rock
band and Dance Central is trying to do
rock band VR isn't just the normal rock
band chord it into the oculus rift it's
a total rethinking of the system and
what it actually means to play rock band
and live out the fantasy of being a rock
star so we went to the Harmonix offices
in Boston to check it out for ourselves
rock band VR uses the same plastic
guitar as older versions of the game but
it's not the rock band you remember for
one thing you'll be adding an oculus
touch motion controller which brings
that guitar into the game for another
you'll be playing with a completely
different system this is your classic
rock band formula when the song starts
individual notes start rolling down
what's called a note highway to ace a
song you have to hit the right buttons
on your guitar at the right time
unfortunately this doesn't work in
virtual reality on a normal TV you don't
really care about what's behind or
around the note highway you're pretty
much just staring in a box in your
living room in a headset the point is
that you feel like you're on a stage
with your bandmates as it stands you're
spending the whole time staring at that
line whether it's floating in the crowd
or coming out at the end of your guitar
what harmonics came up with turns a game
about notes into a game about chords
instead of a highway you can see the
structure of the whole song with dots
that represent different chords when one
is coming up your guitars headstock
starts flashing the pattern you need to
play you'll get points for hitting it on
the bead and well that's it if you're
doing the bare minimum the rest of the
song you can play whatever you want or
you can stop playing altogether in
teleport around the stage for casual
players the game is more about having
the rock star experience than nailing
guitar riffs the VR crowd isn't going to
start booing and whatever you play it'll
sound alright the game also gives you
specific optional challenges to meet
being a high level player means finding
good rhythms for each song and staying
on beat while still mixing up your
chords and patterns or at least that's
what Harmonix tells us I didn't have
time to go deep into this
one of the great things about non VR
rockband is that it's such a social
approachable experience and right now VR
isn't great at those things instead of a
full band rock band VR only has one
instrument the guitar
you've got band mates inside the game
but the rift separates you completely
from the real world
if you get embarrassed by other people
watching you rock out rock band VR will
at least let you avoid seeing them but
if you like putting on impromptu
concerts with your friends it's a little
isolating and even if you're totally
alone not being able to see your own
fingers is weird in future generations
Harmonix wants to put the band back into
rock band but it'll be a different kind
of social experience instead of making
you round up for headsets to play
locally the game will let you team up
with people around the world if
everything goes right you'll feel as
close to them in VR as you would with
your friends in real life but there's
still something intimate about playing
with people in the flesh and VR hasn't
captured it yet
rock band VR is a launch title for the
oculus touch controllers and it's one of
the most exciting games we've seen for
the rift not because it's the most
polished one but because the underlying
formula is so solid but we still haven't
been able to answer one big question how
much of a game will it be being a
rockstar in VR is fun for a while but
without a challenge or with a challenge
that's too confusing to meet it's hard
to imagine coming back to it over and
over and that's the kind of thing you
can't figure out in a few songs so are
we fans right now definitely will we
still be fans in October when the full
game comes out that we're still waiting
to decide</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
