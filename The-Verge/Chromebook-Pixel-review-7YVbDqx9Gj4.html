we're taking a look at the Chromebook
pixel which is actually one of the more
confusing devices I've seen in a while
so Google's been building Chrome OS for
a while and until now there's been kind
of a race to see how cheap a Chromebook
companies could build they were $249 or
$199 but now from Google itself comes
the pixel an incredibly high-end laptop
that cost twelve hundred ninety nine
dollars it's something completely
different this is Google trying to
position Chrome OS next to Windows and
OS 10 as a legitimate third desktop
operating system the OS is one thing and
might be a harder sell but the pixels
hardware is definitely on par with the
best laptops out there it really starts
with the screen the twelve point eight
five inch 2560 by seventeen hundred
touchscreen display that's insanely high
resolution even more so than the MacBook
Pro with Retina display and the screen
looks incredible this really is probably
the best screen I've ever seen on a
laptop it has a 3:2 aspect ratio which
means it's a little taller than a lot of
laptops that's really good for web
browsing but it does mean movies get
letterboxes above and below the touch
screen works well enough the real
limiting factor is Chrome OS there just
aren't a lot of apps that are
particularly touch optimized though
google has shown there changing that a
little the rest of the hardware is just
as good to the all-metal body is a
little thicker and heavier than a
MacBook Air and it doesn't taper so it
feels much bigger but it's sleek sturdy
and looks almost kind of futuristic
especially the light bar on the back
which really serves no purpose other
than to glow and look awesome but it
looks really awesome it's a really basic
simple body the keyboard and trackpad
are both pretty excellent the trackpad
is smooth and glassy and it works great
for to finger scrolling or pinch-to-zoom
it's kind of limited though it doesn't
have a lot of gestures available and it
really doesn't do much other than just
scroll and work as a cursor but it's
smooth and responsive and does
everything it does perfectly the
keyboard is really good too it clacks
nicely and the keys are really well
spaced out it actually feels a lot like
a MacBook keyboard with the chiclet keys
there are a bunch of chrome specific
tweaks like the search key instead of
caps lock and a whole row of function
keys above the number row those top keys
are a little stiff and kind of hard to
find with your finger which is a little
awkward but overall I really like the
keyboard so the pixels Hardware stands
up to any laptop on the market it's
beautiful well made and basically
flawless in its design but making the
case for a $1300 computer that's really
only a web
browser gets kind of difficult Chrome OS
saw some really smart things to disguise
the fact that it's basically just a web
browser you can open websites in
separate windows that kind of feel like
apps and there's even a new app launcher
that I actually like better than the OS
10 dock but the thing is you're still
mostly just using a web browser not only
do not get access to all the native apps
you'd get on OS 10 or Windows you don't
get a lot of the functionality either
RDO is totally useless offline for
instance and even little things like
switching between apps gets a lot harder
there's a file browser but it's
incredibly basic and Google pushes you
constantly to use Google Drive and
actually you should the pixel comes with
just 32 or 64 gigs of internal storage
but you do get a terabyte of drive
storage and the Chrome OS file manager
is the best way I've seen to manage your
Drive files the pixel oddly doesn't do a
great job of playing back local files
for some reason despite the fact that
it's powered by an Intel Core i5
processor a 1080p video looks great and
sounds great the pixels speakers push
sound through the keyboard and it's
pretty loud and clear but it stuttered a
lot throughout the whole movie weirdly
streaming YouTube videos at 1080p worked
much better for the most part though the
pixel just worked like any other
Chromebook it's smooth and fast without
a lot of problems but of course most
Chromebooks work about the same we
didn't really have issues with $200
Chromebooks so I'm not surprised that
you'd get good performance for $1000
more than that one thing Chromebooks
should have over windows or OS 10 is
battery life but that's not really the
case here we only got four and a half
hours on our battery test which isn't
necessarily surprising given the high
res screen but still seems like less
than such a simple browser based OS
should get I am convinced that a certain
kind of person could do just fine with a
Chromebook as a primary machine
especially if you don't travel a lot and
you don't have a lot of need for offline
use it works really well it's the most
stable browser I've ever used by far and
almost never lags or crashes I wish
chrome was this good on Windows or OS 10
it's also just a simpler and sometimes
smarter OS but unless you're comfortable
using web services for absolutely
everything and don't need something as
powerful as Photoshop or word and don't
want to play games it's still pretty
hard to say that your $1300 is better
spent on any Chromebook over a MacBook
or a Windows Ultrabook you can also get
an LTE capable pixel for fourteen
hundred and forty nine dollars and you
even get some free data from Verizon but
that's again an extra
from a pure hardware standpoint I like
to pixel better than any laptop I've
ever used but it just has some
limitations its competitors don't when
for $100 less you can get a MacBook Air
limitations are pretty close to
unacceptable</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
