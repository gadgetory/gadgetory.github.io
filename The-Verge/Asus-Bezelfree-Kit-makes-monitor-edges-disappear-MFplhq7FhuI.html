here at CES checking out the asus rog
bezel free kit now this is a pair of
accessories that you use with a three
monitors setup to remove the bezel
between the monitors their giant lenses
and they actually mount to the corners
of the monitors and they use light
refraction to bend the picture from one
monitor to the next let the black bezel
in between goes away AC since there is
no hardware no software required these
things will have to plug into power I
don't have to be running any sort of
Windows application they just mount to
your monitors and they work right away
now because this kit doesn't use
hardware or software you can basically
just take it off or put it back on
really really easily like just grabbing
it here at the top sliding it up to put
it back on you basically just attach one
end at the top and one end at the bottom
and there you go the company says it'll
work with 24 or 2.5 and 25 inch monitors
but they're also gonna design a kit for
27 inch monitors and also 32 inch
monitors now you don't have to have a
C's monitors for these to work they work
with any thin bezel monitors the company
says they do recommend that you use
three monitors of the same size you get
a little bit tricky if you're using a
twenty-five and a twenty seven or a 27
and then 32 but if you have three of the
same size 325 327 or 330 twos you should
be totally fine I've been using the kit
right here on this setup for a little
while now on a steam version of project
cars and it works exactly as designed
now it's not perfect you're not going to
get a complete removal of the bezel as
if you had one giant curved monitor you
can see through the lenses a little bit
you can notice a little bit of a
blurring effect going on and it doesn't
necessarily detract from the experience
I'm playing you do get one gigantic
curved
works pretty well
now AC says this is still just a
prototype so they're fine-tuning a
little bit of the design and that means
they don't have pricing or release date
details quite yet they do say it's
coming out later this year so if you own
three monitors or you're in the market
to buy three giant thin bezel gaming
monitors and you want to have one
seamless curved display this is
definitely something to check out for
more gaming news and other product
