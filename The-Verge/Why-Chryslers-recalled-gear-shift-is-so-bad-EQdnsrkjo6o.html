fiat-chrysler is accelerating the recall
of 1.1 million jeep and dodge vehicles
with a really confusing electronic
shifter the 2014 and 2015 Jeep Grand
Cherokee and other cars had an
electronic shifter that's so confusing
to use it's actually implicated in the
death of Star Trek actor Anton Yelchin
now as it happens I own a 2014 Dodge
Grand Cherokee I have the shifter and it
is really confusing it's a weird mix of
software and hardware that doesn't quite
work way to expect so here's the shifter
in the 2014 and 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee
it's called the monostable shifter and
it's because when you pull it back it
returns to that center position this is
the big problem it doesn't give you
feedback about what gear you're in
because it always comes back to that
center position there's little clicks
they are very very subtle you can't see
them but when you're shifting the car
you can feel them so to pull back and
drive I feel one two three of those
clicks to put it back in a park I can
feel one two three of those clicks that
last one between reverse and park is
really hard to feel so here's the
problem when you've got it in Drive if
you don't get it right you'll just end
up in Reverse if you've got it in Drive
and you just hit it you end up in
neutral all of those emotions are the
same motion is to get it in the park and
there's no feedback about being all the
way in the front like with a regular car
the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration tested the shifter and in
February of this year said that
operation of the monostable shifter is
not intuitive and provides a poor
tactile and visual feedback to the
driver increasing the potential for
unintended gear selection the agency
found 306 incidents of vehicle roll away
following intended shifts to park that
resulted in 117 alleged crashes 2800
scratches actually caused injuries and
now there's an investigation into
Yelchin staff so because this is really
a software problem the recall doesn't
involve changing any parts it's a
three-and-a-half-hour software upgrade
where a Jeep dealer will plug in your
engine computer and change the software
so that if you open the door while
you're in neutral the car will
automatically apply the parking brake
that's it it's just a software fix and
it's taken months to roll out but now
Jeep has released it they've accelerated
the schedule and if you have a 2014 23
teen Jeep Grand Cherokee or another FCA
vehicle that's affected by the recall
you should take it in immediately
