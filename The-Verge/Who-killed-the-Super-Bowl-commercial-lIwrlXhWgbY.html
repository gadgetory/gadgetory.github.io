was up guys 20 years ago the Super Bowl
was a showcase for the absurd funded by
companies like Budweiser but in the
decades since the Super Bowl ad has lost
its weirdness what once would've felt
strange
now just looks normal who killed the
Super Bowl ad well the Internet is the
likely culprit in 1995 Super Bowl ads
were one of the few venues for high-end
oddball short films for most of the
country but overtime TV channels like
Cartoon Network's Adult Swim cornered
the weird market inspiring a generation
of young YouTube video makers leading to
the ages of anti humor weird Twitter in
parody videos Molag Nancy this beloved
Nancy Superbowl commercials are
restrained by time and regulation can't
compete with this let alone this that's
youtube poop anyway brands haven't
totally been left behind companies like
Denny's and Sega have released their
inner weirdness onto Twitter where
millions of Superbowl viewers turned for
entertainment during commercial breaks
for good reason who needs
puppymonkeybaby puppymonkeybaby when we
have Sonic the Hedgehog throwing actual
shade of course the Super Bowl still
contains plenty of juicy weirdness for
the discerning viewer you just have to
feed the event to the Internet machine
where it will be recontextualized by
brands and normal people alike and it's
been this way for a little while now
remember the rise of left shark that
wasn't done by Budweiser it was done by
us this is the democratization of
awareness
in 1996 the Super Bowl was an
opportunity for bud in 2016 the Super
Bowl is an opportunity for everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
