better that's the question I'm asking as
I pick up the fujifilm x100t fortunately
Fujifilm realized it had a good thing
going with the first two models but it
didn't drastically change the design
shooting experience or image quality
that were loved in the earlier versions
the x100t x' design is so slightly
changed from its predecessor that really
only experts on the older models will be
able to easily tell them apart some of
the corners have been sharpened the
knurled textures and the dials have been
improved and there's a tee on the front
where there used to be an S the fixed 23
millimeter F 2.0 lens is the same as on
earlier models but it's aperture ring
now supports third stop adjustments
instead of the full stops that is
limited to before the back of the camera
is a slightly larger display in a new
button layout and it's where Fujifilm
made most of the changes in the x100s
the odd thumb rocker has been replaced
with a more traditional dial and the
four-way scroll wheel has been swapped
for four distinct buttons all of which
can be customized there's a new menu for
accessing Wi-Fi and the quick menu
button has been moved to be easier to
read with your thumb the ones to the
side of the display are smaller and
clicker than the x100s buttons but the
experience of using really hasn't
changed that much
Bucci film will also improve the
electronic viewfinder with a faster
refresh rate and better coverage this
time around the company added a third
mode which provides an optical
viewfinder with a tiny electronic
display in the lower right field of view
you can check white balance exposure and
most importantly manual focus with the
pop-up display making it much easier to
shoot manually when you're using the
optical viewfinder the x100t is the same
16 megapixel resolution as the s but
it's got a faster processor can now
shoot up to ISO 50 1200 and you can
adjust exposure compensation by up to
plus or minus three stops as opposed to
the two that the s was limited to those
still image quality isn't hugely
different between the x100t in the
earlier camera fujifilm did upgrade the
video capabilities it's got a new 24
frames per second mode for more
cinematic recording but the x100t is
still a much better camera for still
photography than it is for shooting
video the cameras new Wi-Fi feature was
lifted straight from the xt-1
it works just as well here to transfer
images to your phone or your computer
and you can use your phone to remotely
control the x100t
including full manual exposure controls
there are plenty of other little
improvements on the x100t including more
slots for custom settings and a new film
style mode that emulates codecs vaunted
Kodachrome slide film both of those
things are nice additions over the x100s
and I hope Fujifilm brings them to the
older camera with a firmware update
which is something it's done with other
features in the past
if you haven't yet shot with fujifilm
x100t ruiz the x100t is easily the best
option yet fujifilm x100t are amazingly
fun to shoot with and the x100t is the
most fun one yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
