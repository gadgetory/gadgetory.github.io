Chicago sun-times and this is 90 seconds
on the verge brought to you by motorola
if cool gmail clients getting snapped up
wasn't a trend before it is now Dropbox
has purchased the company behind mailbox
the iphone app launched just over a
month ago to critical acclaim and an
extremely long waiting list the app
won't be going away however instead the
mailbox team is joining Dropbox to
develop it even further and the company
has hinted there's some clever Dropbox
file attachment integration on the way
this probably means you won't have to
wait that much longer to get on that
waiting list hey unveiling the galaxy s4
wasn't enough for samsung they also
announced two new CEOs company
presidents JK shin and boo Koo Yin will
be joining the current CEO yes that's
three CEOs in total the move will let
Samsung's three major divisions mobile
TVs and components each have their own
representative at the top of the company
hey work great for research in motion's
and finally Ridley Scott Harrison Ford
and you weren't the only people who
hated the voice over in Blade Runner a
page of scathing screening notes for the
sci-fi classic recently surfaced on
reddit in them producer Jerry / nco
writes quote why is this voiceover track
so terrible hopefully this is not being
dubbed in he sounds drugged were they
all on drugs when they did this chemical
he probably hates unicorns too that's it
for today's top stories join us tomorrow
with a sneak peek of CBS's latest hit
sitcom 2 Broke drones</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
