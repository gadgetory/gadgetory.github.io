here at a CES is Capcom gadget show we
are checking out the music's played it's
a pair of AR glasses and it's the real
deal this is Google glass but it
actually works so similar to Google
glass this floats a little square image
in your view but unlike Google glass
this is doing it directly over a pair of
standard sunglasses so you don't have to
look through a little prism you don't
have to look very high up into the right
corner of your vision it floats it right
there in front of you in fact you can
even move it up and down in the settings
of the glasses themselves the company
musics they're from Rochester New York
they've been working in this technology
for almost two decades now and they've
pretty much finally cracked it right now
when AR is having a big moment we're
seeing a ton of AR goggles and glasses
from all these different companies
musics here has come out the prototype
device that actually works so right now
with these glasses you can do a number
of different things right now I'm
looking at a home screen as it floats
right above my videographer Biren right
here now if I swipe with my right hand I
can go through different apps there's an
Amazon Alexa app now that's what makes
these pair of a our goggles really stand
out is they've integrated Amazon's
digital assistant right into them so you
can speak to them as if you were
speaking to an echo speaker or any
number of other Amazon devices now if
you keep scrolling go from Alexa there's
a little tank game that you can play
there's a photo gallery so you can pin
some high-res images and watch as they
float around your field of vision they
even have a firefox browser here that
unfortunately does not work either
because the Wi-Fi is a little bit spotty
in here but the really cool thing is
they have a camera so if I tap right
here
I get a live view of what my glasses are
seeing and then I can tap and take a
photo
now I can't stress enough how how good
this actually is this is the first pay P
up here pay our classes that are
actually comfortable they feel natural
as they sit on my head I don't feel any
weirdness any discomfort they're not
squeezing the backs of my heads it's not
lurching off the front of my nose in a
really awkward way they sit comfortably
on your head and the image floats
perfectly clear right in front of your
face now music says they've only been
able to accomplish this by spending so
many years working on DLP projection
which is what they have miniaturized and
put right here in the side of the
glasses and then using a waveguide
system to basically send the light back
towards my eye so you're probably
wondering how can I interact with the
views explained without either using the
touchpad or using my voice down the line
music says they will actually be able to
enable gesture controls so you can reach
out in front of you and touch the
digital image and interact with it now a
lot of other companies are trying this
exact same thing DLP projection
waveguides companies like magic leap
down in Florida and we've seen in a
number of other companies here at CES -
but no no company has really figured it
out quite like Music's has I can't say
enough that this is a pair of AR glasses
that really feels that gets ready for
primetime if they sold this next month I
would certainly consider buying it now
the company does plan on selling it very
soon they plan on bringing a developer
version to marketing q1 for $2,000 now
they that gets you a developer version
and also a consumer version when that
comes out in the second quarter of this
if you just want the consumer version
you can buy that for $1000 for all your
augmented reality coverage both the
devices that don't work and the devices
that like the views explained actually
do work check out the verge comm or
