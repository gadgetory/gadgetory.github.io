promises but to most people really
high-end VR is still a novel to your
dream it's expensive finicky and still
hasn't offered a killer app that will
keep people using it PlayStation VR is
supposed to be the solution coming out
next week it's the only big tethered
virtual reality headset powered by
something lots of people already have
the PlayStation 4 gaming console
it's cheaper than either the oculus rift
or the HTC vive and is backed by Sony
one of the world's great gaming
companies PlayStation VR just has to be
good enough to make a worthwhile holiday
splurge but for something is new as
virtual reality good enough is still a
tough standard to pin down the heart of
PlayStation VR is the space-age black
and white visor once known as project
Morpheus on paper the PS VR headset has
some disadvantages compared to the rift
and vibe it's the heaviest of all of
them and the lowest resolution using a
single panel instead of one for each eye
but in practice the comparison isn't so
clear for one thing psvr fits on your
head completely differently where most
headsets strap onto your face like ski
masks PS VR is mounted on a plastic ring
that stretches around the upper part of
your head balanced by weights on the
back this means that it's not putting as
much pressure on your face especially
your cheek bones its eye pieces slide
out with the push of a button so it's
wearable with glasses it seems just hair
green e'er than other headsets and some
experiences can look a little muddy but
with a well-designed game you won't even
notice the difference in resolution the
hardware is full of nice touches like an
inline remote that your headphones can
plug into letting you easily adjust the
volume and turn the headset on and off I
haven't worked up much of a sweat in the
psvr yet but it's the only major headset
with a smooth and easily cleanable
rubber facemask not one made of fabric
or foam it's also easier to get to the
point of using psvr in the first place
setting up the system means connecting a
lot of wires you plug a small processing
box into your ps4 in the wall plug your
TV and headset into the box and plug a
tracking camera straight into the
console but you don't have to worry
about hunting down software and drivers
like you would on PC because the console
just guides you through an extremely
simple introduction the toughest part is
positioning the camera right if your
space is too big it might not pick up
the tracking lights on the headset when
you sit back on the couch and although
you have enough room to walk a few steps
in psvr
it's not a room scale experience one of
the problems with PlayStation VR is
that's not a completely new system it's
a setup cobbled together from various
pieces of Sony hardware the core $399
psvr bundle comes with the headset the
box and all its cables in order to use
it though you'll also need a PlayStation
camera which is sold separately and in
order to fully take advantage of the
catalog you'll need to PlayStation Move
controllers in addition to the DualShock
gamepad that comes with any PlayStation
4 adding move and a camera costs an
extra hundred dollars although that's
still cheaper than the Rifton 5 and you
might want to splurge on a charging dock
so you won't start running out of USB
ports for all those controllers
PlayStation Move is the weakest part of
PlayStation VR the move controllers were
first released back in 2010 and they
don't feel designed for virtual reality
they're covered in tiny buttons that are
tough to hit even when you can see
what's written on them so the only
really useful elements are a button on
the top and a trigger on the bottom
that's enough to handle most experiences
but it feels limited compared to the
vive controllers oculus touch or
sometimes even a regular game pad in
some games the move sticks feel just as
accurate as something like the vibe
controllers in others the camera doesn't
seem to quite reach far enough to give
you a good range of motion or the
controllers drift slightly as you play a
big problem when you're in an action
game sony has previously said that most
of its games will be playable with the
normal gamepad the DualShock actually
has limited motion tracking of its own
thanks to a light bar in the back but in
some cases it still feels like an
incredibly awkward two-handed remote
control if a game says it's best played
with the Move controllers believe it
that said there are cases where a normal
controller works perfectly well or is
the only choice take for example super
hypercube a game where you have to look
around virtual reality and rotate
three-dimensional objects to fit through
a series of holes a lot of PS VR is
upcoming fly
ship titles or gamepad base including
res infinite rigs and start recruit crew
there are over two dozen games and
experiences launching with PlayStation
VR with more listed for later this year
so far we've seen about ten of them
including a spatial puzzle game a Trancy
series of music minigames a horror
rail-shooter and a cute adventure game
while it's not exclusively a gaming
device it's definitely geared toward it
but there's enough out there that almost
anyone should be able to have some fun
from the start setting it up doesn't
feel like installing a new cyberspace
terminal in your living room and putting
it on doesn't feel like jacking into the
matrix it's not exactly normal looking
but it at least starts to fit into your
life in a way that other high-end
headsets don't it don't even create some
kind of new virtual environment for you
to enter just a big-screen version of
the normal PlayStation 4 interface in
some ways this makes psvr a little less
exciting than its competition but it
hits close to the same quality bar while
being cheaper more accessible and more
comfortable maybe the are that doesn't
feel futuristic is exactly what the
world needs right now
