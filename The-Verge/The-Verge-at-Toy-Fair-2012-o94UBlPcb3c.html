got addy Robertson with us and this is
probably the greatest day in my
professional career isn't Sunday it
should be home at a brunch or anywhere
else for that matter but I'm working
because it is torture I'm honestly very
worried that this is gonna be with us
very corporate conventions I mean yes
it's a toy fair but it's a bunch of
people in suits going this is the
greatest toy these kids are gonna love
it and it's like you know Star Trek
action figures actually that'll be cool
I like some trick action figures oh my
god how long did it take to make take
about a bunt took a month to make over
250,000 blocks 250,000 block weighs
about a ton Wow yeah we're all the kids
um well actually there isn't any kids
allowed being that it's some only among
the distributors the exhibitors
licensors buyers and everything so
there's no kids at all this week no no
no it's a toy show and everything but
yeah there's no kids but there's no
smiling faces everyone looks very
serious they're now working a lot it's
business but it's fun what why aren't
they having fun I have no I
can you tell me a little about yourself
oh you better off talking to one of the
other characters this is Lola Lola is a
monster don't be scared she's always
smiling you'll see them at retail
throughout all the specialty retail
stores we're real excited about them the
price is about 599 to 1099 great pricing
we cover everything from plush to
novelty to drink where we have slippers
we have pool toys we have rubber balls
we have anything you could want for your
home or your office or your car we have
this is going to the next big item
coming next Christmas we specialize in a
mostly light up products Highway Patrol
no skateboarding all sorts different
things that appeal the children we're
waiting outside the mega bloks we tried
going in but a security won't have that
apparently mega bloks is like the
fortress of solitude and that it's all
white fortress and that's all I know
about Superman apparently this fortress
was probably more than 8 feet tall
they're very secret about letting people
in they're basically putting these large
barricades up to block out all these
smiling faces so why is there like this
giant kind of fortress hiding within
behind the mega bloks why not be it open
to everybody uh because we have a lot of
new things coming up and a lot of secret
things coming up so we can't have
everybody see it right away we're at
Lego we've actually seen a fortress of
solitude much like this before and it is
about I say about 30 feet down that way
and that is mega bloks all we can say is
that when the war finally breaks out
between them we would not want to be
Walters or those doll maker's down there
and ask you about the other fortress
yeah absolutely um the lego group has a
private booth because we actually show
products that aren't on shelves just yet
so there's sets that are coming out in
August so they're just stuff that we
will show to the media some of the
a one-off sets but we never show the
entire line just you know so we're the
first ones are putting on the shelf so
we have DC comics and Marvel Comics and
then we will also have two sets based on
upcoming Avengers movie glory just came
back last year in a big way with samurai
and now it's coming super samurai for
next year Florida ranges where we have
everything so I'm not sure if you're
familiar with World of Warcraft or if
you play a little too much we also have
lego star wars sets based on everything
from the Clone Wars to all of the movies
so this is really bringing the world of
halo into construction with vehicles
characters this is our third year with
halo we've had a lot of success we try
to stay true to our licenses actually so
now you'll see in our licenses that if
it's something that's in the movie we
will recreate it for them but when it
becomes our own licenses of Lego themes
that we create we really still try to
steer clear of violence once its first
put the fortress you guys or mega bloks
oh my gosh it's a good question i've
known it was like a cold war how close
you guys are well yeah I don't know we
were talking with Lego a little bit kind
of curious what the portress up and he
said that like this is all the big
companies and he just had these big kind
of fortress areas if you look up you can
see this very very creepy ominous mattel
window there's one here there's one
across the way kind of looking down so
basically Patel can see everything I'll
just kind of corporate overlords these
are like the master toy company if they
want to know all Lego secrets they just
have to look down
how much they could get rid of in a day
doing this in a day 150 to 200 bottles
throughout toy fair we had last year i
think we had 600 bottles oh my god
innovation first is the parent company
we have several different divisions one
of them being robotics to do educational
base robotics and that knowledge of the
robotics is actually what drove us into
the toy industry so instead of other
companies being a toy company trying to
do robotics we know robotics and we can
then make toys out of them so five years
ago on a whim we kind of decided to make
the original and this is a crack eynde
of a six-legged walking robot so he
walks and he's got a little bump sensors
and so when he encounters an obstacle he
will stop and move he also has a sound
sensor OOP so that way if he hears his
loud noise he'll stop and he'll go try
to go the other directions and try to
get away from it from there we moved to
a crab it also has a sound sensor the
next product has bump sensors on the
front and back it changes directions and
so it becomes very chaotic the larva has
got a really creepy motion it has a
wheel that spins and so as the wheel
moves back and forth it's actually
pushing a drive carrier show you this
one here is called a scarab and this is
new for this year then we have two other
products that currently are remote
control but they're using an infrared
remote and the first one is the inchworm
you go forward and go back it uses the
center pedestal to make it turn round
left and right and then it has big giant
looping legs to go forward and back so
it's in combination when you get some
really unique motions and turn turns and
straights and stuff our goal is to try
to make robots that are emulate real
animals but try to make them look like
robots first the animal second and try
to emulate them a little bit in how they
work
you
we're here with Randy Faulk the man who
actually designed the replica portal gun
so who came to you for it to all come to
you or do you guys go to valve and say I
want to make a portal gun valve actually
came to us at Toy Fair last year they
were looking to get into consumer
products and do more collectibles for a
more affordable price to reach more of
their fans and they saw what we were
doing with gears of war Bioshock
Assassin's Creed and that's how it began
so we started developing figures from
left for dead and team fortress and at
the same time a portal gun was like a
no-brainer because everyone loves portal
and portal 2 had just come out at the
time and we've seen some fans make some
really impressive replicas themselves
but they're like crazy amounts of money
so how can we do one that's affordable
that anyone who wants one can have one
this is the the initial prototype or
making a few final tweaks but we'll be
out on the market hopefully may june
this year and five thousand edition 130
dollar retail and you see how can you
say you mentioned you seen the other
portal gun creators out there and we
were reached out to them saying okay we
like what you do you let me come work
for us these are expertise here I
haven't yet I mean there's some guys
that do amazing stuff the problem is
when you're doing one of a kind or doing
it just for a labor of love you can put
all the bells and whistles and you want
and make it balls out awesome but it's
also you know a thousand dollars whereas
we have to figure out how we can do this
that a factory in China can mass produce
it for an affordable price all the
original designs come from the game
creators themselves but we adapted or
make it work as a toy or as a replica oh
my god I hope you're filming every
detail this raised detail there that's
depressed oh my god</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
