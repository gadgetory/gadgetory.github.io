was expecting a relatively low end
Windows computer to go with its
relatively low end processor I was
expecting to be unimpressed with the
tiny keyboard and I was expecting to be
unimpressed with its speed what I wasn't
expecting is how much of a joy this
thing is to use surface go is a 10-inch
Windows hybrid device it's basically
like a really small surface pro the base
model costs 399 but the model everybody
should probably get starts at 550 but
you have to get a keyboard to go with it
and you really should and that's either
$100 or 130 dollars if you want the very
soft and nice Alcantara fabric to get
the surface go down to size Microsoft
had to do a bunch of engineering
obviously but it also had to make a few
compromises compared to what you might
be used to on a larger Windows laptop
those laptops tend to run Intel Core i5
processors which are pretty speedy but
this has an Intel Pentium Gold processor
and what that means is it's a little bit
slower but it's still better than what
you get in the cheapest you know Windows
or Chrome laptops that are out there as
long as you adjust your expectations
accordingly you can do just fine with
this thing I was able to run a bunch of
apps and although they were simple it
still felt relatively responsive for
this review what I want to do is answer
a bunch of the questions that have come
in from the community now I can't answer
them all but I really think we're gonna
hit on all the major themes here so the
first round of questions that we've got
are about how powerful this machine is
and a lot of people wanted us to compare
it to the cheaper model so jail clardy
asked if we'd be able to compare the
models and he specifically brought up
the emmc storage on the base model so
let's talk about that a little bit
the base model again starts at 399 and
it has only four gigs of ram which maybe
isn't enough to run what you want on
Windows but it also has this thing
called emmc storage or 64 gigs of it and
that type of storage is a little bit
slower than a proper SSD unfortunately I
haven't been able to test it I'm sorry
but my very strong suspicion is you'll
want to get this model which starts at
550 and for that extra price you get a
proper 128 SSD and you get 8 gigs of ram
which is plenty for running a bunch of
apps as long as they're relatively easy
to use
simple apps another way to get at this
question of how powerful this machine is
to talk about gaming so here's the real
story with gaming we installed some
Windows Store games a cup had crashed on
launch title deals there Ori in the
blind forest which doesn't seem that
intense of a game to me
it ran but it was just a little bit
sluggish as far as steam goes I'll be
honest I didn't do anything crazy I
didn't install pub GE I don't even think
this would be great for fortnight but I
did install game called transistor which
is really fun and relatively lightweight
and it ran just fine so you can game on
this thing but you're not gonna be
frightening anybody in first-person
shooters on this thing it's just not
that powerful
Geoffrey gromek on Twitter wants to know
if the screen quality is enough for
light photo editing I want to talk about
that and power at the same time so we
went ahead and installed Adobe Lightroom
CC and a W Lightroom cc classic and it
does better than you expect you can edit
a couple of photos in a pinch there's a
little bit of lag but you can pinch and
zoom things are pretty good but if
you're doing anything super intense in
terms of batch photo editing or
stitching panoramas together this is not
your machine the bigger deal when it
comes to photo editing is that this 10
inch screen just feels a little bit
cramped if you're doing really intense
photo editing there was just not enough
real estate here and you end up really
zooming in on it really closely and
speaking of things being small a lot of
people asked about the keyboard of the
trackpad because they're not full-sized
but you get used to both right away the
keys are really easy to type on the
trackpad is glass and it's precision too
and so it's very very accurate I haven't
had a problem at all alright let's get
through some other build quality stuff
really quick Steven Harris wants know
about battery life I've been getting
about 6 hours of active use which is
pretty solid
Microsoft rates it for 9 hours of video
playback but you should never expect
that the good news is that you can
charge it either via the surface
connector that comes with it or USB C
and depending on how high your USB C
thing is you can charge it relatively
fast I've been impressed with how
quickly this thing charges
Nathan Norris wants to know if that USB
C port we just talked about is also
Thunderbolt 3 didn't work when I plugged
a Thunderbolt 3 into it but it did work
with my dongles to power my monitor and
get other USB stuff going on it Samrat
asked what the speakers they are
front-facing stereo speakers they're on
the left and the right of the screen and
they sound really good especially for a
device of this price class they're much
better than I expected they're great for
watching
you movin Campton on Twitter wants to
know about the pen I'm not a huge
surface pen user but I haven't seen much
lag which is a bunch of other people
have asked about so that's impressive
and the build quality here is solid
you're not going to feel any give or
whatever on the screen it's really
really good probably the most questions
that we've received have been about s
mode and so it's time to talk about s
mode and I have feelings here's the deal
with S mode it ships on by default on
the surface Co and that means you can
only use the edge browser and apps from
the Microsoft Windows Store and in
theory that could be great because you
know that you're getting a bunch of
lightweight apps and they'll run really
well on the surface Co in practice the
apps just aren't there my personal
favorite example is I need one password
not on the Windows Store but the browser
extension is and so I got error messages
whatever you're gonna end up turning s
mode off and that's fine and fast and
easy you don't even have to reboot but
it's gonna mean you're gonna install
apps are gonna bog this thing down a
little bit like I don't know Chrome kind
of boxing down a little bit it's all
emotional for me because Microsoft has
the right idea
taking mobile apps and making them for
larger screens they did it before chrome
did it with Android they did it before
Apple did it with marzipan apps on the
Mac they've got the right idea but the
execution is still broken they don't
have the apps yet we got a lot of
questions asking me to compare the
surface go to Chromebook or to an iPad
or to a bigger Windows laptop or even I
don't know to the Mac hello not so much
of the Mac there are so many variables
especially in this mid-range that making
a comprehensive comparison is basically
impossible compared to an iPad on a
basic level you could probably be more
productive with this thing but the
tablet apps are like they're worse
compared to a Chromebook you can you
know get more apps do more stuff but
it's nowhere near as simple as a
Chromebook can be and compared to the
Mac I mean that's just a whole different
category my bottom line is if you like
Windows this is a really great tiny
Windows machine all right I think we're
gonna cut it off there thank you
everybody for your questions I'm sorry
if I didn't get to yours but hopefully
we touched on the major themes I want to
talk about my take on this machine one
of my favorite things about Windows is
it never really stops you from doing
one of the questions we got was can you
do CAD work on this and sure you can do
it I just don't think it'll be a very
good experience when you use a Windows
machine you kind of have to know the
limits of that machine and that applies
especially to the surface go if you know
what to expect and you stay within those
limits this thing will totally impress
you and when you use it there's just
something about the design and the
curves and everything that just makes
you kind of love this thing and that at
the end of the day is quite an
achievement everybody thanks for
watching let me know if you were to get
this thing what would you use it for
tell me in the comments and then when
you're done if you're looking for
another gadget video to watch we just
did a this is my next of the best
smartphone under $300 Jake made it it's
really good advice and a really fun
video so you should check that out bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
