it's not called the PlayStation 5
it's the PlayStation 4 Pro and it's
bigger and faster than the regular ps4
as double the graphics power it's got a
faster CPU faster RAM and this gives
developers a lot more power to play with
but it's up to them how they use it
Sony's big emphasis is 4k and the games
I've played in 4k really do look sharp
but 4k is four times the pixels of 1080p
and the piece were pros only twice as
fast is the regular ps4 that means
there's some fudging involved to bring
the typical 1080p game up to 4k well the
number of pixels on screen might be
stunning it's hard to call the graphics
revolutionary you don't mean like the
sharp is not the same thing as
photorealistic of course this happens
every time we get a new console it takes
developers a while to take advantage of
all the new power that's available to
them I'm guessing eventually we'll get
ps4 pro games that look way better than
regular piece wargames but those titles
are not here right now unfortunately
unlike the Xbox 1s the PlayStation 4 Pro
does not play 4k blu-rays it has 4k
Netflix 4k YouTube but Sony seems mostly
focused on games and in my experience
for kick games do look a lot better on a
4k TV then with a typical 4k film or TV
show and that's mostly just due to
compression because you're streaming
these shows over the Internet and this
game is right here and it's sharp and
you see all the pixels it's not all
about 4k thankfully because not
everybody has a 4k TV some games will
have improved frame rates or better
graphics at 1080p and some games will
you'll even be able to choose whether
you want a better frame rate or better
graphics
but again it's all up to the developers
and this is kind of going to be a niche
console so they might not put in the
time to give you all those options the
ps4 pro isn't supposed to be a new
console it's compatible with all the
games and accessories even PlayStation
VR everything that works with the ps4 is
going to work with the pro and also any
game that comes out that ps4 pro
enhanced will work just fine on the ps4
but I can't help but feel that the pro
is a new generation with all the promise
and pitfalls of any new console there
are a few titles that take advantage of
all the horsepower there's a lot of
headroom and it's big and expensive like
a new console it's three hundred and
ninety nine dollars while the regular
ps4 is only $2.99 if you don't have a 4k
TV or don't obsess over graphics you're
probably safe to skip over the ps4 Pro
but if you want the absolute best
graphics that are available on a home
console this year as marginal as that
advantage is the ps4 pro as your best
choice but Sony seems mostly focused on
gaming and in my experience 4k games
look way better than 4k film and
television especially 4k film and
television that's been compressed and
streamed over the Internet which is the
only thing that the PlayStation 4 pro
can play</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
