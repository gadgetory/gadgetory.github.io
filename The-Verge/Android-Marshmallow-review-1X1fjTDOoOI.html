6.0 marshmallow it's a whole new
operating system from Google and it's
coming to your Android phone
eventually this year's update to Android
includes a whole lot of little things
and one potentially huge thing it's
called now on tap and it basically lets
any app ask Google anything from
anywhere automatically it's a little bit
like every single app on your phone just
got a Google now superpower to use now
on tap you just hold down the home
button inside any app Android then read
your phone screen and searches for stuff
that might be related if you're in a
chat and talking about dinner in a movie
you'll get movie times and a link to the
Yelp app to check out restaurant reviews
if you're reading an article about
lovely human being Billy Zane you'll get
a card showing a link to his IMDB
profile if there's a phone number or an
address on your screen you'll be able to
call or navigate without having to
copy/paste from one app to another it's
a really great idea and it should save
you a ton of time on your phone but
should is the operative word because in
my testing now on tap just doesn't seem
to be smart enough this is my friend
Ross Miller on the screen he and I have
been emailing and texting me and calling
each other for years so you'd think that
when I hit now on tap it would know who
he is and give me his contact card but
nope that is definitely a different Ross
Miller and that's the thing about now on
tap right now it should be great but
it's actually a little bit frustrating
it's a little bit like the early days of
Siri when she got more wrong than she
did right and you just kind of learn to
stop using her now Google can fix all of
these problems and hopefully it will
eventually but for right now it's just
kind of a crapshoot then there's other
little things in Android marshmallow and
every single one of them is a nice
improvement it starts with a Google now
launcher which has a smarter app drawer
that gives you a press right up at the
top super fast scrolling to any letter
or you can quickly search by holding
down the app drawer button the new kind
of cartoony Google logo is a little
cartoony but otherwise the design here
is a nice subtle evolution from what we
had before the next biggest change is
battery life and no you're not going to
magically get way way more but you are
going to see some improvements there's a
new thing called doze that shuts apps
down when you're
or tablet is just sitting on a table it
helps keep it alive when you pick it up
hours or even days later androids also
being way more helpful at managing apps
they only ask for permissions when they
need them now and the OS is also just
doing a better job in general of keeping
the weird ones in check when you're not
using them little things like that are
all over the place in marshmallow my
favorite new one is the share sheet
which puts the people you send stuff to
above all of the apps the volume sliders
make more sense now and Do Not Disturb
has been shuffled to a way less annoying
place oh and the cut copy paste buttons
are way better to Google basically
decided to just do it the way the iPhone
has always done it and that's
marshmallow in a nutshell it's not a
huge change it's just a little bit
smarter and it's softened a lot of
androids rough edges it's good but I do
wish that now on tap where as
mind-blowing as Google had kind of
hinted that it would be back when it
first announced it and since most of the
best features are under the hood you're
not really going to notice them until
developers start using them but really
all of these features just plain aren't
going to hit your Android phone anytime
soon the funny thing about reviewing a
new version of Android is that you know
that so few people are actually going to
be able to use it in the next six to
eight months it's actually kind of
depressing we're seven years into the
lifecycle this OS and Google still
hasn't figured out how to keep every
Android phone updated and reliable or a
timely way
but don't stress out if you can't
install right now even though
marshmallow is Android 6.0 for an end
user it feels more like 5.3 I like it
but if I'm being honest I have to admit
that I was hoping for some more</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
