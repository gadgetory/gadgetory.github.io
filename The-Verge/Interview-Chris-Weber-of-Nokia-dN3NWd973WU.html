announcement made on the Lumia 900 and a
month ago we announced the Lumia 710 and
by the way that 710 is for sale and
t-mobile stores tomorrow so the level of
excitement optimism incredibly high
highest I've ever seen in any of my
business life I think people are excited
I think we have a differentiated product
differentiated value we can bring to the
consumer now it's about great execution
so still a lot of heavy lifting to be
done but I think we've set the
foundation for our turnaround in the US
now I think the first thing that that is
quite clear in the u.s. in this journey
on our turnaround is our strategy which
is windows phones with operators so very
simple very focused and what that means
though is bringing unique devices and
experiences and business models to each
of the operators we're working with so
they have something differentiated they
can offer their consumers that is the
most important part so differentiated
and exclusive devices and business
models that allows us to get the right
operator support to launch these devices
and so if you think about the Lumia 710
unbelievable support we're getting from
t-mobile starting tomorrow you're going
to their 24 hundred stores we have
prominent placement in the stores
they're going to be doing above the line
marketing we'll be doing marketing as
well to tell the story but it that type
of business model is what's going to
make us successful here because we're
doing things unique and exclusive for
each of those operators so we haven't
made any decisions on them yet i think
that the one question i got when i came
in in February's how committed is nokia
to the US market will you do exclusive
things here unique and will you bring
those to the US first you don't have to
look any further than the 900 that we
announced it will be here first it says
our first windows LTE phone and it is
built for the windows market or the US
market and particularly AT&amp;amp;T so we
haven't made any other announcements but
I think what you'll see to continue that
happens at nokia is our portfolio across
price points user experiences and
operators in the US will continue to
expand and obviously you can expect to
see that same thing
bully so I don't think we're talking
about number of design language would I
say it's greater than one but you're not
going to see you know double digit
design language but we do think we have
a couple unique design languages that
will continue to evolve and develop it
against and I think the backdrop of that
is creating head-turning designs for
consumers and then using that design
language to really expand to think about
what are the user experiences that we're
trying to create what are the value
proposition the messaging the business
models that we ultimately want to work
with carriers to give something that's
differentiated and unique to that end
user well I think what we have stated
publicly is we want to take the windows
portfolio at Nokia and drive the price
down lower and even move it up on the
high end so across the spectrum I think
there's still a huge play in the US on
price and taking that down as well as
going upward I mean if you think about
the the 710 and one of the beauties is
we pack a ton of value in here for 49
bucks so incredibly low price because if
you think about the dynamics in the u.s.
there's still more people who don't own
a smartphone than do now that's rapidly
changing because every day you get more
smartphone users on but price is a big
part of why people haven't moved and
it's priced both on acquisition cost of
the device and the plan itself and then
obviously making the technology for
people to on board a lintel but I think
that's the unique value proposition that
note you can bring and bring that global
scale I'm if you think about this is the
first device we're bringing in the US
and the price point value were put in
here I think is unmatched well I think
the primary reason is in order to be
successful here you've got to have
support and commitment from the
operators and so doing that unlocked I
think it does two things you lose that
support support could be marketing
retail presence subsidy against the
phone but it makes it very hard to be
competitive from price perspective if
you don't have that operator support and
so again we've narrowed our folks and
strategies say it's Windows smart phones
with operators everything will do is to
create that unique value proposition for
the operators that they can take to
their customers for us at this point
it's really important that we're focused
on the strategy is going to get us the
market share the quickest and where the
predominant majority of the business is
and
that's absolutely through operators and
so one of the keys is it's very easy to
get the focused on a strategy and say
well let's go focus over here we can
pick up a little bit here a little bit
here the majority of the business in the
u.s. is through operators and we're
going to be myopically focused on that
well first of all what I'd say is I
think the partnerships off to a great
start maybe you think about it we
announced it februari 11th we actually
got the deal signed after that in less
than six months they delivered two
phones in Europe and now we've
delivering one tomorrow in the US and we
just announced another one so we feel
very good on that mango was essentially
done when we announced the partnership
so our input is really you know moving
forward mango LT I think is a good
example of the collaboration that
happened between Microsoft and Nokia we
feel good about it and I think moving
forward you'll continue to see that
collaboration our input on the portfolio
broadly I think will be will be felt yes
so I think one of the things that we
have sort of redone is how we bring
value to operators and it's not just
about a device a piece of hardware I
think it's about a set of experiences
it's a value proposition and those
experiences our hardware capabilities
software cloud services and accessories
all that together I think we're thinking
about this in a holistic way so you talk
about accessories and really bringing
unique value propositions that the
operators can offer the consumers that's
a good business model for the operators
and then you can also think about it
particularly like with our monster
headsets here not only bring in a value
proposition something unique for
consumers but you bring a really cool
brand in that's good both for nokia and
the operators and so I think it's
twofold it's a business model and being
able to offer something different to
consumers but it's also about bringing
in some really prominent different cool
brands that I think is beneficial to all
parties yes so we haven't announced any
further plans other than the 710 with
tmobile 900 with ATT I will restate what
I've said since the beginning for 2012
is we're committed to a broad portfolio
devices across multiple price points
multiple operators multiple user
experiences and we've used this saying
internally called Rolling Thunder which
is really this concept that we want the
noise get louder and louder
the portfolio broadens and our marketing
efforts really kick into gear and again
I think what we're announcing today with
the 900 what we announced and our
shipping starting tomorrow at seven ten
that's the start of our journey I think
you can expect that to broaden over time
I think there is a big demand and room
and desire to basically get to
lower-cost LTE phones is what I'd say
and do correct and to do it with an
experience that's not compromised for
the user because I would argue today is
where that's happened with LT on some
other platforms the experience has not
been great and consistent and integrated
seamless way for the consumers and so we
look forward to doing that in a broader
perspective but we're not announcing
anything so is it fair to say that LTE
is a very strong focus for us presence
absolutely i mean i think if you look at
the trends with the operators and where
the technology is going and the fact
that we just announced our first LTE
phone LTE is a high priority for us one
of the things that we did in the 900 I
mean it's single core but the
performance on this I'd put up against
any dual or quad core phone so the
performance on this phone it's fast it's
responds with incredible it's LTE but I
don't think you sacrifice on the battery
life because of the dual cores or quad
cores etc on top of that we're putting
in an eighteen hundred and thirty
million milliamp battery and it's one of
the biggest we've ever put in so that I
think the statement we can make to users
is you can focus on your content during
the day without having to worry about
charging or recharging so we feel really
good about what we're seeing but we're
still also in the process of testing etc
and I think we'll have more to say as we
move forward i think in i think it's the
same which is i think it can be a huge
differentiator for us and you'll see it
so when we launched these phones like on
the tmobile 710 it'll come with nokia
drive which is the industry-leading best
turn-by-turn navigation system that's
about a two hundred dollar value we
provide free as part of the the apps
that we preload on the phone ESPN is a
unique app that nokia with Windows Phone
users get exclusive to them you'll see a
whole host of those type applications
either be pre-loaded on the phone are
available in the marketplace under nokia
election for nokia with Windows users so
you know we talked about ESPN nokia
drive things like Univision EA sports
announced about 20 tiles the titles that
will have exclusivity for about a six
month period you'll see unique things
from CNN from Muppets etc soho lyssa so
i think that ecosystem we're seeing
incredible interest from significant
brands to do some unique things with us
and again some of those might be unique
for a period of time someone might be
unique for longer but that overall app
ecosystem content i think will be a
significant differentiator for nokia
well what's interesting is it on this
one just be clear is the radar what you
see traditionally is ninety nine dollars
the 710 will be forty nine dollars in
the data we show that fifty dollars
particularly for the smartphone and
tenders that's a big delta for people
are jumping into the smartphone business
so we do think it's a significant price
difference from the 99 249 i call it a
combination of price and value because
then what we pack into the phone and
he's quite significantly this has a 1.4
gigahertz process the same that's in the
900 or the 800 so there's a lot of
horsepower underneath the hood here when
you combine that with price combine it
with the value-add like nokia drive then
one other thing i call tying the bow on
it something nokia is doing unique is
it's called Smart Start so anybody who
buys a nokia with Windows Phone they
basically get access to a nokia customer
care person so what happens if you walk
into mall tomorrow and you by tomorrow
and you buy this phone they'll give you
a card gives you a website to go to
you'll register tell it tell us who you
are when you want us to call and then
you check box say here's what I want to
talk about email setup social network
integration you tell us and basically
you'll get a live person call you at
that time we can walk you through
whether its initial setup advanced tips
and tricks you just want to get more
enjoyment out of the device really
trying to make that experience
world-class and so those are the things
we talked about price value and the
overall experience is the way we're
going to differentiate ourselves I think
it's the same message which is let's
focus on the value that's in that device
and I think you start with head-turning
design or iconic design you talk about
the quality and the capabilities in the
device you talk about the uniqueness of
the
does phone system which is unique
compared to the competitive ecosystems
out there it's not a static set of icons
and apps it's these live tiles and hubs
and seamlessly integrated so you focus
on that and then when you talk about
nokia not only the design the imaging
technology you talk about the value add
things like the Smart Start whether it's
the Nokia drive thing it's the
applications etc we pack a whole set of
value in there but it's the total story
that we have to talk about versus one
specific thing and one final very
important question will we see more
devices available in multiple colors
because the cyan Lumia 900 is the
best-looking but I've ever seen thank
you that's awesome yeah I what I will
tell you is the company overall
historically has at a large part to play
in colors we will make it a key part of
our relaunch in the US and I think
you'll continue to see us emphasize
colors more and more both in the devices
the marketing etc the accessories and
you see sort of the magenta headsets and
black headsets you'll see cyan as well
colors will be a key differentiator for
us and we think that's really important
whether it's in our marketing message
whether the device that people are using
or in the retail presence there so I
appreciate the comment on Sian and I
think that confirms that we're on the
right path there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
