looking at the Alcatel pixie free tablet
Sochi this is an 8 inch Windows tablet
the really unique thing about it is it's
actually running Windows 10 mobile
that's like Windows 10 mobile and not
the regular Windows 10 so essentially
it's like an upscaled version of what
you'd find on the Lumia 950 or any other
Windows 10 mobile phone and doesn't seem
that much has done a lot to change the
apps and make them make use of this a
inch display and so essentially when you
launch stuff like the meshing app it all
sort of scales up and there's no like
additional sidebars or anything else in
most of the building apps and word I
think looks a little bit better than
perhaps that some of the built in apps
and we haven't got any documents to sort
play around with here but it seems to
scale up a little bit better in terms of
the actual hardware the device it's a
kind of a low-end 8 inch tablet it's
going to debut for under $200 and it's
got an 8 inch display as we said earlier
but it's a WXGA resolution which is 1280
by 800 and there's one for three
gigahertz quad-core processor inside so
it's going to be a pretty low-end tablet
and you're not going to get this sort of
continuing support because of the
processor and but most of the other
Windows 10 features will work regardless
and it feels pretty good in the hand
it's not exactly heavy its plasticky and
it's quite well weighted and at the back
you've always got five megapixel camera
as well and the space for sim and
microSD so really it's a basic low-end
Windows 10 mobile tablet which you
haven't seen yet and but hopefully we'll
see a few more running Windows 10 mobile
rather than the sort of full version of
Windows 10 okay that was a quick look at
the Alcatel pixie free and it's due out
in the first quarter of this year and
it's gonna be under $200 if you want to
