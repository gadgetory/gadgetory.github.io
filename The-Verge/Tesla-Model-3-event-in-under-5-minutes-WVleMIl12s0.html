Franz one-hole Towson I lead the design
team here at Tesla we are here tonight
to talk about model 3 it is my honor to
welcome to the stage mr. Ilan my welcome
everyone welcome everyone to the model 3
unveiled but I want to start talking it
just just preface this by talking about
why why are we doing this why is Tesla
widest has exist why why are we making
electric cars we have record high co2
levels combustion cars emit toxic gases
if a vehicle is spewing toxic gas that's
obviously bad for your health to address
this what we came up with the test
though was what we call the secret
master plan but it needed to we needed
to figure out how could we as a tiny
company with very few resources actually
make a difference so step one was was
the Roadster it showed the world that
you could make a compelling electric car
you could make a great electric car and
people said well the roads is nice but
it's sort of a toy and it's very
expensive with it ok we're going to make
the Model S and now for 4 cars about
half the market wants a sedan about half
the market wants an SUV so we thought
well I will extend the the Model S
platform into the Model X both of these
are very important because the revenue
from the Model S and the acts is what's
needed to develop the model 3 so as when
I say for all of you who bought an S or
an X thank you for helping paper model 3
that's nice plan with with steps 2 and
2.5 and now going to - to the model 3
first of all I want to start off by
saying the model 3 is going to be an
incredibly safe car the model 3 will be
not just be five-star on average we 5
star in every category even the base
model 3 will do 0 to 60 miles an hour or
0 to 100 kill us an hour in less than 6
seconds at Tesla we don't we don't make
slow cars and of course there will be
versions of the model 3 that go much
faster but the range will be at least an
EPA rating of 250 miles these are
minimum numbers we we hope to exceed
them it will also all model 3s will come
standard with autopilot hardware and
although autopilot safety features will
be present in every card that you don't
by an option the auto pod safety
features will always be there but the
model 3 also fits five adults
comfortably the challenge obviously with
building a smaller car is how do you how
do you still make it comfortable with a
bunch of people inside there are two
important design steps we did with the
model 3 to achieve a 1 ways to move the
instant panel with the firewall there
really isn't a firewall if you don't
have a big combustion engine in front
that's what gives you the legroom to
have 5 out of the rear roof area is
actually one continuous pane of glass
just like the Model S that has a front
and rear trunks all model 3s will come
with supercharging standard we're now at
the point where we will pad over 3,600
superchargers worldwide by the end of
next year we will double the number of
superchargers and and quadruple the
number of destination charges so where
we are today with Tesla's we've got 215
locations by the end of next year we
expect to more than double that to 441
locations now how are we going to make
these cars are pretty more factory in
the past has actually made almost
500,000 per year so we're confident that
we can it that Tesla can achieve that
number in the future in terms the
vehicle production and then what about
what about batteries in order to produce
half million cars a year
we're basically to absorb the entire
world's lithium ion production that
that's why we are building the
gigafactory
so to give you a sense of scale the
gigafactory will actually have the
largest footprint of any building of any
kind so when when our deliveries both
there next year and then in terms of
price well of course it'll be $35,000 or
you will not be able to buy a better car
for $35,000 or even close even if you if
you get no options
alright let's bring them out
I just told that the total number of
orders for the model 3 in the past 24
hours has now passed 115,000 for those
on line you can order at tezo calm thank
you well we don't have it for you
tonight
I'm just kidding boy it's April Fool
