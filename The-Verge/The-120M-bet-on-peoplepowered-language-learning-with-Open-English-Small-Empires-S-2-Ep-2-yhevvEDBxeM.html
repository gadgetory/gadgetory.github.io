America and I'm here because it started
this season I went on Twitter and I
asked everyone what is the company in
Miami tech that I need a visit and
everybody said open English now open
English is a platform that connects
people all over the world to live
instruction as well as tutorials so that
any Spanish or Portuguese speaker and
learn to speak English and what's so
cool is this company started in Caracas
we're gonna find out what brought them
here to Miami
mm I'm Alexis Ohanian start-up founder
and Y Combinator partner over the last
year I went on a two hundred event book
tour and met people building small
empires all across North America now I'm
back with a new season revisiting some
of my favorite stuffs from the tour the
thing that makes software companies so
attractive to venture capitalists is
that once you have enough finished the
costs of scaling that business are
really low you could sell it at an app
marketplace and cost for cloud software
are getting cheaper every day startups
you have to hire humans to grow face a
much more challenging environment if you
have to hire a new salesperson driver or
stock boy for every hundred new
customers that's gonna eat a lot of your
eyes open English a language learning
startup is dealing with this plastic
connector it's service is popular and
can be distributed anywhere in the world
but the company has to hire salespeople
and teachers to support that growth the
trick here is to make sure your costs
don't outweigh your revenue obviously
otherwise all the money and time that
have been invested in open English will
fall by the wayside
open English is the leading online
English school in the Americas so we are
in 20 different markets all Spanish
speaking Latin America Brazil the US
Hispanic market and what we created was
an alternative for emerging market
consumers to learn English that wasn't
going to the brick-and-mortar school we
created a open English which is
available 24/7 you just open your laptop
or your tablet as we speak there's
hundreds of teachers working with our
students today they're all ESL certified
they're all native you pay a flat fee
every month it's very affordable is
about a fifth of the cost of your
traditional school and you're going to
get unlimited access to these teachers
that are committed to your fluency and
actually what happens is then you're not
just taking notes and learning the past
progressive tense of a verb to actually
talking and losing you know that fear of
speaking which makes a big difference
when you have to go into a job interview
when you have to travel and have to do
any of these things
it's invaluable invaluable if you don't
speak English here you know you can't
communicate you can't hear you're
actually that into just like if you were
backing to Bower any other country you
know worldwide English is always being
the language of business being the
language that's opened the doors for you
everywhere you went the last year long
hundred thousand people in the company
and you know we're ventured funding to
raise over a hundred million dollars
from some of the premier VCS here in the
US
Wow all right you've been busy we had
been very busy I always had a passion
for languages actually grew up traveling
around the world my dad as a diplomat to
live in nine different places got to see
a lot of different cultures in English
was I realized not just the language but
it's a tool for success and a tool for
global communication we see it as really
a transformational step in your
development normally I advise startups
against running expensive television ads
the conversion rates usually are pretty
low and it's really hard to track how
well you're actually doing that said
most of the companies I'm advising are
looking at the American market I'm not
necessarily looking at the Latin
American market what's so interesting
about this is for open English they
found a way to build a brand through
television spots probably because so
many of their market audience isn't
spending a dominant amount of their time
online just the watching a lot of TV so
the bottom line is if you're gonna do
marketing understand your market
we did a commercial agreement with a TV
station in Venezuela actually where they
helped us shoot a couple of TV ads were
very simple and put it on TV you know
that generates 6,000 leads that month
keep in mind we had a call center with
like three wireless phones in our inner
small offices it was like okay this is
real people do want this product yeah
how much of opening wishes success is
because of those campaigns and in
particular how much that can you tribute
to your own ability as an actor at the
time when we started we didn't have any
money so we needed somebody goes
bilingual and we look Latin so he said
and res why don't you do the other guy
for this first commercially yeah we see
where it goes and the first commercial
went viral and it was very hard to
change you know the faces and the ads
that I didn't what five years and I'm
still doing ads every month we we go
nice to actually write our own scripts
and we micromanage that process you know
a lot to do a new ad every month and the
last tab that we had was that called
persuasion it got 12 million views on
Facebook the day before it went on today
so the whole following there that's just
waiting for the next open English
commercial do an app presumably you get
stopped on the streets yeah so when I go
down to what AM it's a bit of a
production so we have these uh
derailleur disguisers are sweet
seriously yeah they they go with us if
you can't get for the airport you like
the minute I sit down with my cereal are
instagramming and tweeting and all that
that's and you look and you get to the
airport and people waiting it's a bit of
a cook
there's different methodologies on how
to teach English the the methodology
that we find to be the most successful
as immersion will run you know a hundred
thousand students of live instruction
classes every single month so we teach
classes 24/7 every hour of the day every
day of the week and so there's been a
lot of human interaction right so rather
than you just trying to go through a
lesson on your own
we actually supplement that with a lot
of live instruction to talk to many
teachers now this platform is designed
for native Spanish speakers to be
learning English I wish I spoke Spanish
we're gonna still walk through I'm
pretty good at English that's really
process can you walk me through what
we're doing right now so we use a
combination of methods to teach our
students so on the platform the students
can choose between practice units and
lessons or live instruction practice
allows them to watch videos and just
really kind of go back and forth say out
loud they can get pronunciation live
instruction which is what you're saying
here is speaking with a native English
teacher so unlike some other language
programs they actually have access to
teachers 24 hours a day seven days a
week
they're native English teachers that
they live across the world but they're
generally Americans became English
teachers they can actually learn from
their little village wherever they're at
and really understood that opportunity
to speak with someone who speaks perfect
English without an accent which you
don't see in most countries it's really
hard to find a teacher on-site that you
know that is an American that speaks
perfect English
these are educated highly educated they
come with a strong missile background so
they are bringing a skill set to open
English that we don't have right we are
contracting these teachers for a reason
we really hope to find teachers that
have a great sense of empathy this
process learning the language is not
easy specifically for an adult and so
our teachers we hope that have had that
experience which is why we hope to find
teachers that also speak Spanish or
Portuguese they've gone through the
process before and so they're definitely
much more empathetic to how a student
learns
we have a big marketing function that
basically just drives a lot of traffic
to our website which we capture lead
information and then basically we become
a call center you know we have a very
aggressive sales team we have a pretty
consistent call campaign that will call
you within the first 30 days to try to
convert you onto a student so all that
started with a handful of people in you
know an apartment in Venezuela which
then grew to a call center that which
then expanded into you know the rest of
the town you know learning English is
hard so I mean there's a lot of
engagement that needs to take place
we'll call you when you're not logging
on so how many different call centers do
you have right now we have three call
centers today about 10 percent of our
business is from Venezuela today so we
have all the call center operations
supporting the sales and service those
students there we then have the rest of
the team so all Spanish speaking Latin
America it's service out of Bogota
Colombia and we have you know a between
sales and service we have another 500
reps what we there and then we have
started and launched Brazil which is our
newest market but we've been there
probably about 18 months and when we
started Brazil we set up operations in
San Paulo so we have got a hundred reps
there across sales and service what I
think about this and and where it is
today I it is easy to get caught up with
like holy with all the success I
want to go back I want to bring it all
back to where it started I had literally
$700 left my name and I bought a ticket
with my holes and I took my 700 bucks
and remember on the flight just feeling
this sense of weight that my co-founder
had told me look if you don't come back
with a check and you know some way to
sustain this thing I'm out I have to you
know to generate some money for my
family and pretty much everybody was on
that same boat so I literally had like a
two-week window to you know actually get
a check from someone it is
and people there they understood how to
invest in startups but they didn't
really understand Latin America so when
trying to sell them on this vision of an
$80 to $100 a month description product
for the emerging middle class in Latin
America that we were going to promote
through TV commercials it was completely
contrary to everything they they were
seeing it okay but Netflix is $7.99 even
charge $80 to someone that may not have
a credit card
really so it was very hard to raise
money from VCS and so we started raising
money twenty thousand fifty thousand
dollars at a time to two years but we
raised two million dollars and and it
was you know there were so many moments
I think youyou I don't know what if you
believe in faith or God or you don't but
I think there's so many moments during
that that the company was about to shut
down and literally like something
happened the day before that changed our
course and we would not be here if it
weren't for that one person doing that
one specific act open English has raised
a little over 120 million dollars and I
really hate it when ever I see
fundraising announcements get celebrated
as if it were some big milestone look
that's not your money right you're
giving up equity in exchange for money
that you'll put back into the business
to hopefully grow it to justify that
investment in open English's case they
want open into a new market Brazil which
is a different language very different
culture and it's a question whether or
not they can do it because that's what
they have to know they have to grow and
it means expanding its new countries
will see if they're up for the challenge
it can't be as simple as fine to replace
yeah right it's gonna be more
complicated how do you go about Duke
launching a new country well I our
platform is very English focus there's
very very little Spanish on our learning
platform so that does allow it to
transfer events from pretty easily the
only thing I would say is there some
entry-level things like if you don't
know any English there's some basic
stuff so that's where we tend to focus
our you know our product and try to
optimize up for the different levels of
Spanish or Portuguese or wherever it
might be but even beyond that I would
say that's just like the
perspective if you take a look at the
people side of the business right you
know selling to different countries you
know I think you know accents are
extremely important and making sure that
you have you know the right sales rep
trying to convince you that you want to
you know purchase the platform here and
I don't think it's as simple as you know
just one dialect or you know one
approach I think what open English has
been able to figure out is you know what
is the value proposition for my country
instead of just trying to spread it like
vanilla across that you know like just
icing the cake right rather than just
ice the cake you know ultimately you
know be a little bit more sophisticated
about it and start thinking about
individual markets and how how do you
keep this scaling right because like
software is great at this humans not
great at scaling and when you're doing
someone like education we're great
teachers is such a funny little particle
business but how do you keep that
growing and keep the quality at the same
time I think it's been a little bit of
our secret sauce right where lots of
companies even some in the u.s. that are
doing language learning they wanted to
create great software and it wanted to
create software that would not require a
human to teach you and we always work
the opinion that you need a great
teacher to succeed and especially if
you're learning a language you need to
be able to speak and have a conversation
and feel comfortable listen to different
types of accents and understand them and
get comfortable with your own voice and
so we went about using technology not to
eliminate human interaction but to make
it more efficient what we did is we
spent a lot of time thinking about like
what are those poor customer facing
processes that need to be standardized
to a point that you know work but are
still able to be localized so we've
basically automated all those processes
as much as we possibly could and then we
supplemented with you know bodies when
necessary
speaking things in on scale right how do
you build and maintain a great network
of instructors I think ultimately if you
can set up like good operations where
you have a funnel that is constantly out
marketing to new teachers and bringing
them on certifying that they fit open
English and then setting them up for
success you know at open English you're
always gonna be ahead of it do you think
there's any kind of an upper bound to
that where you just the demand for
teachers just outpaces your ability to
create the supply um I do I don't
foresee us running out of teachers I
think we may have to change our way it's
right we may have to be a little more
innovative on how we go out and we find
those teachers and bring them on and I
think open English has built a brand in
the marketplace as well where you know
teachers are reaching out to us now
we're very picky with who we allowed to
become teachers and I want to hold that
quality standard a certain level so we
want to maintain that but I think they
will be able to figure it out as we move
forward to the software
this is blackboard yep so you've built
on the curriculum and then you didn't
have to write your own software for this
you're just using a blackboard to power
the actual teaching correct we use
Blackboard Collaborate and
essentially just allows us to access our
students across the world is there an
option for video the teachers are able
to an extra students are able to do
video we don't use the video for the
most part because most students and
South American countries don't have the
bandwidth to handle it if the sometimes
the teachers will try and of save it if
any of the students has an issue we
don't want to cause a problem with them
sure are we doing well in this class I
can't get a sense so probably not we're
not doing labs for companies that are
here in Miami today getting started or
maybe they want to start the company
here well what is the board of the yet
what are the strengths of the Miami tech
community it's very tough to if your
main market turns out to be a Latin
America to be on the west coast and to
fly you know for a day and then get down
to Sao Paulo or Argentina or Bogota or
Mexico City so move the company to Miami
you can be in a place where there's
highly international highly diverse
write the climate helps right but now in
on top of all of that which is fantastic
you actually have a really cool cultural
community you I basically went to
Twitter and said I'm coming to Miami
what is these startup I need to meet
everyone said open English well I mean
Andres is just question right what is it
gonna take to create more open English
is here in Miami we need to sort of
create more stars and to turn those
stars and to funders and mentors of the
next group yeah you know this sure
that's a sort of virtuous cycle of
course is the big prize that all cities
are active oh yeah and so a guy like
Andres is now he's on the board of
endeavor which is all about finding
those high potential entrepreneurs and
turning them into stars and then having
them
from the next helping the next coming up
there's two and a half million people in
Miami and about 40% to 50% of those
people have not reached they walk great
and half of those people never reach the
eighth grade so you know we have a
difficulty attracting major technology
companies to come down here to to South
Florida because this companies are
looking for people who are trainable you
know this is a service community so a
lot of these people are working here is
all you know cleaning all their rules or
cafeteria servers or you know whatever
it is because of you know they lack of
the language and a level of education
and so on and so forth
and so what's what's the future no but
English where is this going - well you
know we are still continuing to deepen
our presence in Spanish 15 Latin America
and in Brazil we feel like we're just
scratching the surface
we've already enrolled about a quarter
million students in the region but we
think that you know we should be 10x the
size in the next few years because
there's so many people that need English
as a tool for success now that we
understand that the power of EdTech and
how it transformed the lives of our
students what else can we do to further
that transformation in their lives and I
think we're talking a lot about that
program and perhaps my most important
question when are you going to appear in
one of the commercials I won't be
appearing at first
all right that's on during this thing
I'll let Andres alright you're so sure
the commercials showing yourself sure is
the face of the company so I'll let him
participate in tomorrow you'll be busy
running the operation I will be great
start-up communities are born when
entrepreneurs realized the unique
strengths of their cities and then
embrace them and utilize open English is
doing just that
remember this company started out in
Caracas and it moved to Miami all those
jobs all that innovation could have
stayed in Venezuela but it came to the
United States of America clearly more
and more companies are gonna be involved
in the Latin American market as that
region continues to develop they're
gonna be more opportunities and I want
those opportunities to happen in the
United States we've already got
companies like Open English that are
leading the way the question is who will
follow
open English is conquering the already
crowded field of online language courses
but by keeping things focused and simple
it's quickly standing out among the rest
so how can you use these same ideas to
make your business succeed try starting
with your website make sure your site is
responsive and it's easy to use across
all devices as well as giving customers
the ability to make their online
purchases using phones and tablets try
utilizing services like PayPal for easy
mobile payments most importantly keep
everything simple and focused learn what
your customers want and richer sight of
any confusing extra features you'll be
on your way to success in no time
