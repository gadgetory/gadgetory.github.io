would argue that Motorola's beautiful
moto 360 smartwatch is the most exciting
tech product to be announced in years in
fact I'd take it a step further as the
opportunity to be the most
transformational product in the most
transformational product category since
the smartphone that's not an
overstatement every company from Apple
to Google has its brightest minds trying
to dream up the device that's going to
finally push wearables from nerdy
gadgets to must-have accessories this
isn't just a hobby some kind of fad or
corporate sideshow that'll pass in a
year or two wearables are here to stay
and whoever gets to market with the
first no-compromise SmartWatch stands to
reap the spoils but at this point the
360 is just being dangled at us from
afar with precious few details apart
from the promise of a summer launch come
on just do something everybody here
wants to see your watch do something I
know why did you bring it then the job
of turning it into a real thing that URI
can buy now falls to some of the nearly
2000 Motorola Mobility employees who to
put it lightly have other things on
their minds earlier this year Google
rather suddenly announced that it was
selling Motorola which it had acquired
just a year and a half earlier to
Chinese computing giant lenovo meanwhile
moto is in the final stages of a long
planned move of its corporate
headquarters from a jury campus north of
Chicago to the heart of the city where
it got its start over 80 years ago the
tumultuous process of engineering the
kinks out of the 360 a complex and
absolutely critical product for Motorola
is stressful enough but when you tack on
the drama of a high-profile corporate
divorce coupled with a relocation an
event aimed important enough to bring
out Chicago's unfiltered Mayor Rahm
Emanuel well that's just a lot to deal
with
well we're used to change as you know oh
in that last three or four years there's
been a lot of change and this is you
know another another phase of it but you
know if change is good in so many ways
it gets you out of your comfort zone
that's a challenge some things you
typically wouldn't so you know the
change actually is turning out to be
really quite good for us and what are
your first priorities in the new
facility or your first product
priorities what are you working on that
you
to just kind of hit the ground running
in a brand new building not everything
right you know you don't skip a beat you
can't skip a beat as you know in our
industry right so we're continuing to
you know Drive them what we're doing in
terms of old moto franchise of products
with the X's and the GS and the
follow-ons for those products of course
and the droids and then Moto 360 and you
know the whole wearable set of products
that I think are gonna be really
interesting over the next couple years
like Motorola Motorola's new home is an
octogenarian to the enormous Merchandise
Mart on the north bank of the Chicago
River one of the most imposing and
spectacular structures in the city
opened just two years after Motorola was
founded in 1928 the company has been
renovating it for months
transforming it into a ridiculously hip
space that centralizes practically all
R&amp;amp;D operations into the top few floors
of the building what might come as a
surprise is that it's dotted with all
the spoils of a well-funded Valley
startup mini kitchens that are stocked
to the ceiling with snacks and caffeine
an enormous game room and an open
rooftop that commands one of the best
views in the entire city feels a little
shall we say googly but this isn't a
Google company anymore this Lenovo is
turned to try making Motorola into the
global force it once was and with the
Moto X in the rear view it's all on the
360 the expectation I'm assuming is that
anyone who wears a watcher might wear a
watch is a potential customer for this
versus someone you just want to get it
on the wrist right yeah we think it
actually broadens the appeal and it does
what you know one of the one of the
people in the watch industry are talking
you know to said it was the first device
that really broke the fashion barrier
and we think we've done that so people
will consider it as a watch that also
does all these amazing things right so
you definitely have your watch face
which is gonna be cool and iconic
because that's a central part of a watch
but what we're doing with Android wear
and how contextually relevant the
information is that's gonna be delivered
I think it's gonna really going to be a
reinvention of the modern-day timepiece
both from the services and what it does
in terms of maybe rethinking what I'm
telling and time is to the form factor
itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
