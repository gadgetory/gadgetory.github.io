and I'm standing outside of this giant
strange-looking garage of atap the
secret of projects group within Google
they're doing a big keynote tomorrow but
they've somehow put everything out today
so we're gonna take a look at what it is
come with me
this is project Ricard six of me a bunch
of sensors woven into fabrics so you
could say maybe I have a shirt sleeve
that controls your music basically some
of the stuff that has been done in
snowboarding badly it seems like they
kind of want to make it into clothing
that we wear so the kind of crazy thing
that it's doing right now is its
tracking not just where my finger is on
this fabric is how hard I'm pressing too
so if I press lightly it's just a little
bit or a key go all the way it also does
a couple fingers at once and you look at
this it basically just looks like a
piece of fabric that's been crossed over
thank you through the RIP stop but it's
a touch pad nuts there's a good example
of what you could actually do with this
it's not just eye candy this is
basically a small strip of sensors woven
into the fabric and it recreates the
entire control for your music so I can
go between tracks by swiping left to
right I can hit play just by tapping or
I can go up and down to adjust the
volume this is all the stuff you just do
with the remote or on your phone and
imagine just having this on maybe your
pants so now I'm checking out something
called project soli
they won't tell me anything about it
today but we're gonna find out more
about tomorrow it's basically a tiny
little sensor that picks up movements
micro movements
they're pretty cagey on what you can do
with it but they're the cool thing here
is that you can actually cover up the
sensor with the piece paper and it's
built picking up my hand I don't know
what this data means but it actually
looks pretty cool this is for
stereoscopic cameras looped together and
I have complete control of them
if stitching everything together and
seemingly real-time and I'm using
basically an Xbox controller which is I
think the only way to have this
experience this rig is actually using
four 6k red dragon epic cameras so let
me do all sorts of fun things to control
who in focusing on it's a terrifying
amount of power but as you can see it's
stitching the images together there's
some weird stuff going on here
but all in all it's really impressive I
want one of these for my house behind me
are a bunch of set pieces for project
ara what neat app is probably best known
for its a modular smartphone you can
swap parts out it's really cool it's
also not here presumably Google will be
showing it off tomorrow they'd have a
keynote but it's really what I'm most
looking forward to and that's kind of
like this garage in general we've seen a
lot of things that are cool and
interesting and maybe will be something
one day but they're not quite here yet
and that's
makes it wonderful as parts of Google</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
