spine in a diving accident while
vacationing with friends that accident
left him paralyzed from the chest down
but thanks to a neural implant he's been
able to bypass his spinal cord injury
and send signals from his brain down to
his right arm that technology means that
Ian cannot grasp objects and even move
his fingers independently from each
other which is the definite scientific
burst in general when a person wants to
move their finger their brain sends the
signal through their spine to their hand
but in Ian's case that signal gets
blocked to bypass that problem the
neural implant detects the signal that
Ian's brain wants to send to the finger
and relays them to a sleeve on his arm
from there the sleeve will send the
right electrical impulses through the
muscles in his arm so he can complete
the movement this happens in real-time
which means that all inna has to do is
think of a movement to actually make it
happen and one really good example of
that is ins ability to play video games
like Guitar Hero the system took months
to perfect but Ian can now swipe a
credit card and play video games that
demand a lot of dexterity with more
practice he can increase his range of
movement even further but there's only
so much he can do with the current
implant right now the size of the system
fits on a tabletop which makes that
impossible for him to use it outside the
lab and then there's the problem of the
implants precision it currently uses 96
electrodes to capture signals from man's
brain that's not enough to translate
precise movements like those that let us
spread fingers on a keyboard for
instance so the researchers plan to
increase the number of electrodes to a
couple thousand they'd also like to
compress the computer so that if it's
entirely inside the implant if they can
do that then people might actually be
able to use it on the go but that's
still a long way off
the researchers wouldn't tell me exactly
how much the whole system costs but it's
clear that even making small changes is
going to be expensive and then there's
the fact that the technology isn't quite
there yet
that doesn't mean that Ian is gonna be
the first and last person to use the
implant though the researchers have
gotten approval to use it on four other
people which means that we might hear
some really great news about other cases
like Ian's very soon I'm probably going
to ad-lib the explanation
where I'm gonna fuck up is forgetting to
talk about like this happens in real
time I'm telling you because I'm hoping
that I brain will remember that that's
where I fuck up I'm just gonna try it
we'll see what</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
