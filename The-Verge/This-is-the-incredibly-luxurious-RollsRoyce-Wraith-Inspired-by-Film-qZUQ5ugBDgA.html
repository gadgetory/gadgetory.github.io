the New York International Auto Show and
we are looking right now at the
rolls-royce Wraith inspired by filming
that is actually the full name or to be
a little more specific is the rate with
the inspired by film package so what
this is rolls-royce is kind of giving
you a full package customizations in
case you just don't want to think about
other stuff yourself the card slope is
really really nice and the
customizations are pretty awesome again
it's inspired by films which you guys a
two-tone silver paint job on the outside
there's really nice angel hood ornament
the doors themselves there's a button to
close them so you don't actually have to
hit the panel yourself the coolest
feature though probably is you push a
button and a constellation literally
pops up on the ceiling it really is a
cool feature but again let's kind of
talk about what this car means who this
car is for if you have $280,000 and
that's the base cost of a race for
another $40,000 you do not have to think
about design officers do not have to
think about customization you can get a
nice complete full package again
inspired by film walking away three
hundred and twenty thousand dollars of a
really nice looking cool not sporty but
just a cool luxury car and if that
that's the kind of person you are if
that's the market you're in if you just
want a really nice car and not think
about it during twenty thousand dollars
it's now available to order</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
