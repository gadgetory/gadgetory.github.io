so we have a lot to share today to get
started I'd like to welcome Mark
Zuckerberg we're here to make virtual
reality
the next major computing platform you
know the magic of VR software is this
feeling of presence we should build
software and experiences that follow the
way that we that our minds work in the
way that we process the world first live
demo and VR hey guys how's it going hey
Mark it's great to see ya hey Mark I can
smile I can look surprised
Oh take a look at your own avatar well
why did you make me look like a young
version of Justin Timberlake how could I
take us to the bottom of the ocean
sounds good alright welcome to Mars you
want to play a game oh it sounds great
let's try let's try a quick game with
cards huh there we go two for you two
for you all right what do we plan let's
just do a quick game of high card ready
flipping over on three one two three huh
I win out there I'll go first
wave it's Center aboard making my own
row that's really good this you're like
so gonna go like that alright I know it
haha watch a simple video now unlike on
the phone I can zoom this up to any size
with light
Hey hi how's it going there is one more
kind of software that I'm really excited
to talk about today and that's computer
vision software today there are two
primary categories of virtual reality
products right there's mobile but it's a
great and affordable experience the
second category is PCP are the highest
quality of virtual reality experience
that you can get today we believe that
there is a sweet spot between these
we're working on this now and we're
going to continue making progress on
computer vision until we can unlock this
completely new category of virtual
reality product I want to talk about a
few of the platform investments that
we're making
but there's another content ecosystem
that we think is super important you can
think of this ecosystem as the VR web
the VR web is going to be one of the
easiest ways to develop and share your
content so you can imagine receiving a
URL hitting that link and instantly
being teleported inside this car this is
a really neat demo you can actually
configure the car live and see it and
this is all this all this can all run at
90 FPS on rift so today we want to
enable social presence at the platform
level I'm excited to introduce oculus
avatars people can actually feel like
themselves and easily recognize their
friends so first things first I've got
the hairstyle and face shape and my
avatar so I'm going to go for something
a little bit you know that's a look I
want to go for let's try putting them on
oh yeah I'm gonna go for this
I got the scarf guy you know the bowtie
guy by metal first so Wow
okay so oculus avatars are going to be
launching on rift at touch launch we
also have them coming to mobile in early
2017 you've wanted to be able to talk to
your friends wallet VR so I'm excited to
announce parties with parties up to
eight people can talk while you're in VR
today we're excited to announce
oculus rooms there's a bunch of
different things to do in the room
itself you can watch TV with some of the
best videos available on Facebook you
can listen to music with friends and you
could play minigames with up to eight
people and look at all of the options we
have to explore together both parties
and oculus rooms will be shipping on
gear in a few weeks and early next year
on rift so now let's jump back to the
oculus ready program we started with six
partners and eleven machines over the
last year we've grown this program to 11
partners and more than 40 machines and
like I said this spec started around
$1000 last year you can now get in for
under $700 now let's talk about the rift
headset now we want to give you a new
option for even deeper immersion the
oculus earphones these sound is good as
some of the highest end earphones in the
world so oculus earphones will be
available for $49 and start shipping
later this year now let's talk about
touch touch delivers the magic of VR
imput touches $1.99 and start shipping

titles with all pre-orders VR sports and
the unspoken will touch support room
scale yes it will we've created a room
scale option using a third sensor and
extra sensors will be available for
purchase for $79 and SCHIP on December 6
we are incredibly pleased to announce a
collaboration with walt disney studios
we're going to bring Blade Runner to the
our our promise it's to deliver the best
VR products the best VR platform and the
innovations that continue to drive this
industry forward I realize that you
could find almost any type of content
that you wanted on the
except for the one thing that we all
care the most about which is what's
going on with the people that we care
about around us so so I built that and
it's going pretty well so far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
