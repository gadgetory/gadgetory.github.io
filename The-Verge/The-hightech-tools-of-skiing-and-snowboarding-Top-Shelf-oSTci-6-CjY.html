a decade ago the only technology I had
with me was a third-generation iPod
since then technology has hit the
mountain in a big way people make every
run with their smart phones in their
pocket there's gear everywhere from
Google glass like devices to Bluetooth
gloves but the thing you see most on the
slopes now is action cameras GoPro and
others made it possible to capture every
move every run and show it all to the
world and everybody got on board with
that
one skier using action cameras to his
full advantage is also at the top of his
game Tom Wallisch is a professional
skier with gold medals in the X Games
and the winter Dew Tour and he probably
would have been an Olympian in Sochi if
it wasn't for an ACL injury Wallisch was
originally discovered in 2007 thanks to
a home video competition called the
super unknown
you film that with a sony VX 2100 a big
expensive camera that used digital video
tapes now he uses nothing but the newest
and greatest the GoPro Hero 4 Black
Edition we headed out to his home
mountain in Park City Utah to see how a
real pro uses a GoPro it's progressive
sports because it used to be ski and
snowboard movies would come out every
fall and you'd have to watch it see it
in the fall and be like oh that's what
trick he learned last year now it's
instantaneous you know you'll see pro
snowboarder will be out here he does it
cool trick he filmed it himself
it's on YouTube the next run and some
guy in France at the same time can be
snowboarding to be like oh my god I
can't believe that guy just did that I'm
gonna learn it right now the progression
of it is just so fast hey want to take a
look at how you set up filming and run
these GoPros you got here
definitely so any walkthrough you guys
okay well I've got a handheld mount in
my pocket I love this three-piece design
for you know getting your friend
capturing footage of your friend or
capturing a little selfie you know
getting a little photo of yourself video
of yourself I keep that in my pocket for
whenever I'm skiing just busted out but
kind of my most important camera
definitely is the helmet cam it's the
one you'll see the most of on the hill
everybody's got something on the helmet
I'm gonna set one up here that sticky
mount I got a lighter in my pocket it's
a little trick of the trade I've learned
over the years and if you heat it up a
little bit even your helmet and the
sticky
you're gonna have a much better chance
of getting it to stick on there because
it's just a little warmer it's cold out
here or snowing you want that stick to
stay on there you're not really pushing
on there it's where all those big
muscles I've been working on come into
play get my camera back right up I
borrow that too I'm gonna try it yeah
then give it give it a run I don't have
those skiing muscles but this tech
journalist much of these those keyboard
muscles
walk me through like what's the first
thing you do once you get on the lift
yep sometime connect and control a GoPro
get in there we got the preview coming
up and I can kind of see what we're
seeing with it see what our shots are
like and then you can open up and just
look through and check out all your
shots is me grind and spin in I'm pretty
stoked with that I'll save it and then
from there I mean I could get that right
up on YouTube Facebook Instagram we got
28 30 seconds remaining and it's like
174 megabyte file it's pretty crazy how
fast the wireless is the amount of stuff
that you're posting and how easy it is
for people to see all this people know
who you are you've won a lot of really
big competitions how does that affect
your day to day here on the mountain
with social you know showcasing where
you are what you're doing I mean maybe
somebody's not skiing at Park City that
day and they they see that you're there
they see this photo immediately and
they're like I got to go I'm over at the
canyons but I got to go to Park City and
they come over and and see you in our
sport especially I mean skiing and
snowboarding if people aren't really
training at these closed off facilities
you go to the park you're gonna see me
and that's what makes it so cool you
know you see all these pros and
everybody out there it's accessible you
can go shake hands get an autograph you
know get a photo with the person get it
on your social and you know I see it
then everybody's so interconnected it's
crazy do you usually pump some music
while you're working or do you like to
just kind of ride and let the scene take
over just like to ride I'm mostly on no
music and listen to the sounds of nature
kind of guy do you have any goat cheese
when you do listen that a lot of hip-hop
I mean I'm a big 90s hip-hop fan but
yeah I don't know I bounce all over the
place who knows it could be the new
Beyonce track let me psych that day who
knows to say yeah maybe that'll inspire
you to get that extra operation just get
a little funky with yes action cameras
are expanding the social interaction on
the main slopes but there's still a
whole other side of the downhill winter
sports world that stays away from the
lips backcountry skiing out in the wild
the biggest worry isn't sharing your
sickest trick it's staying alive keeping
yourself safe can be a tedious process
but avataq is a company that's come up
with a smart way of helping you make
sure it happens
the company born out of MIT has created
a product that can measure the snowpack
in the backcountry and can instantly
share the data to a network called a
banette access to that kind of knowledge
can literally mean the difference
between life and death it's really a
communication device we're trying to get
people to talk to each other and share
information we're out here in the snow
and beautiful day but we really can't
see beneath the snowpack but if you take
some tests and share that information
broadly it'll help people make better
decisions and how does this device get
that information out to other people
it's web connected so Bluetooth syncs to
your phone there's also GPS enabled so
as you're putting it through the snow it
basically is just measuring all the
hardness and also measure slope aspect
and then geo tags it and then send that
live to our web platform so now your
fellow community you can see a lot more
information very quickly and the head of
snow safety could be looking at the
computer overseeing a map and seeing
where where the people are at okay so
obviously we're the early season
snowpack here which is often the most
dangerous time of year what we're
looking at is about six centimeters of a
very very hard hard layer here it's been
baked in the Sun and hasn't snowed in a
while here and then you kind of go into
little little softer and then sugar and
this is what we're looking for this is
why we're not over there skiing that
it's because the snow is sliding on the
very old snow that fell in October what
you want to look for is do I have a hard
layer over a soft layer do I have
something that is going to shear off and
cause some instability if you see a very
light layer you know that you have a
problematic situation on the other side
of that what would be an ideal situation
that you could look at with this device
and say okay we're good to go here we're
looking for Needy powder we're looking
for nice soft layer and gradually
getting harder to the base there's been
a lot of great evolutions and technology
and we've been you know skis are lighter
and we have incredible ways to stay on
top of an avalanche how to breathe
underneath an avalanche how to dig
people out of avalanches the fact of the
matter is that's after mistakes were
made and how do you survive an avalanche
is
the end result how to avoid an avalanche
is what technologies should be working
with so now I've seen how a pro uses the
same action cameras that many of us
already own and how creative hardware
mixed with social networking can help
save lives now how do I apply some of
this new technology PS and accelerometer
to gauge your speed altitude and
vertical jumps if you're good enough for
that apps like trace snow snow crew and
even runtastic s-- winter sports I'll
track your path just like a running app
does but most of them can apply it right
to the specific run on the mountain that
you're visiting which lets you compare
against your friends or strangers things
like who hit the fastest speed or who
made it down in the shortest amount of
time
there's Tekken almost everything you
wear on the slopes - most helmets now
come with audio inserts and can be
connected via bluetooth or an aux cord
and to control the music there are a
number of Bluetooth accessories my
favorite of which were the Bear Tech
Bluetooth gloves they're not cheap but
they work really well just tap the power
button on your thumb to unlock them and
your thumb becomes a remote each finger
has different controls like play pause
fast-forward and rewind and it can even
answer calls for the most impressive
thing you can take with you this ski
season comes from Recon instruments ski
goggles with a heads up display they
work almost exactly like Google glass
except the battery lasts longer the
colorful display sits below your vision
and the experience is tailored to show
you information you want on the mountain
you can check your speed and altitude in
real time
follow detailed resort maps to see what
run you're on or find the nearest
chairlift see the notifications from
your phone and even locate your friends
if you're all hooked up through the same
app it all works the remote that you can
stash in your pocket or hook to your
helmet strap and it is by far the
coolest tech you can bring with you on
the mountain every part of your day can
be captured and analyzed just like the
rest of your life purists will say it
all ruins the experience that too many
people are skiing distracted or care too
much about taking a selfie during a run
I didn't mind at all and I can't wait to
see what comes next
