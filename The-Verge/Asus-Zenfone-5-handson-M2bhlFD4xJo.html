iPhone sales knotch so this right here
is the zenfone 5 the brand new flagship
smartphone that asustor just announced
and as I say it has the iPhones and is
not a solution will tell you that it's
26 percent smaller but it is the iPhone
not like the iPhone if you swipe down
from the left edge you get one set of
notifications and functions if you swipe
down from the right you get the full set
of quick quick settings but otherwise
this doesn't have anything comparable to
face ID on the iPhone all you really
have here is a front facing camera a few
sensors as usual that usually get in a
bezel and you do get facing lock but
it's not a sophisticated based idea on
the iPhone aside from not to the top you
do also get a bit of a bezel at the
bottom unlike the iPhone but that being
said this is - a phone with a very
minimal bezel wherever you look it's got
a 90 percent screen to body ratio it
doesn't really have an LCD display
rather than OLED which is the more
popular and high quality display at the
moment but I do like it
you know as LCDs go it's a very good one
but if you take a look at the back of it
it comes in blue and silver options and
it is a fingerprint magnet like most one
of smartphones nowadays this is why you
will need is an essential accessory a
cuff as I always keep with myself
you can tidy it up nice and thing and
then I can show you the new q camera on
the back now a she's doing something
with this where they bond with a whole
bunch of so called AI features I don't
know how much it really lives up to the
quoted AI and being intelligent but the
highlight with this camera for me is
that it has one point 4 micron pixels on
the inside a 12 megapixel sensor also
has a wide-angle camera which uses for
depth detection for portrait mode you
get one point for micro pixels in the
ACU 11 which takes awesome photos
slightly large on the Google pixel which
again takes awesome photos
so this is promising just in terms of
pure image quality and then the AI stuff
I guess you can take it or leave it it's
worth pointing out in terms of the
display upgrade that asus has made this
is the zenfone 4 which is a 5.5 inch
screen and the new zenfone 5 is a 6.2
inch screen and a smaller footprint so
just in terms of issues devices this is
a massive upgrade this is a full HD Plus
display it's got a 19 behind ratio which
means it's 2,000 something
x 1080 pixels in terms of resolution so
in terms of the basic specs what you get
here is 4.com snapdragon 636 so it's not
the flagship tier processor but that
being said there's also zenfone 5 Z
which has a snapdragon 845 and I was
going to price it for $99 which is quite
affordable and going back to the iPhone
comparison it's half the price of an
iPhone 10 that does mean that this
amplifier will be more affordable and a
soos is also introducing a zenfone 5
lights as well which is going to be even
cheaper although that is almost entirely
the doors from the zenfone 5 it has an
entirely different design still within
bezels though it has dual cameras front
and back final highlight something that
I've tested for myself here at MWC is
the speaker on this thing it has a
really loud speaker it doesn't have that
much in the way of face or high end so
it isn't like any sort of audiophile
quality for the phone speakers you're
really looking for volume rather than
anything else and clarity at high
volumes and that's what this phone
achieves
also worth mentioning it does you have a
headphone jack so congratulations for
that reason phone five and it's iPhone
aping notch will be available from April
but it hasn't yet specified a price
break as I say though the 5z the
high-grade model which would be
available quite a bit later in june is
priced at $4.99 u.s. dollars so you can
expect the five to be a little bit
cheaper and five lights got a little bit
cheaper more
get a bigger bezel in the bottom to the
iPhone so please stay
thank you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
