Joyce sander spends most of her time
tending to her crops for many years her
in the seven out of ten farmers in
sub-saharan Africa have relied on going
and narrow variety crops as a result
malnutrition runs rampant across a
continent of farmers in 2012 life change
for Joyce when she started growing maize
seed bred to tolerate drought when
drought came most of her crops withered
and died but her new maize was more
productive than ever that seed made the
difference between hunger and prosperity
to get agricultural productivity up you
want many factors working in your favour
you want better seeds you want farmers
to adopt the best seeds the farmers have
got to be a lot more educated because
they could often grow two crops in the
season and the way they deal with soil
health by rotating the crops to make a
big difference they also need a credit
system because if they don't have the
money to get fertilizer that loan will
cut their productivity very
substantially and so that farmer
education system the Rd to make those
better seeds by managing those things
well we predict that we'll get African
productivity up to 1.5 times where it is
today and that will get Africa to the
point where even with its population
growth somewhat worse whether instead of
importing food it will be able to feed
itself improvements in critical
infrastructure will further Africa's
ability to feed itself investments in
road improvements will allow food to
move to places it needs to go and reduce
the need for expensive air transport
additional surpluses will be put away
and improved storage to better position
them for lean years well GMOs are very
well accepted in some countries like the
United States and not as well accepted
in Europe the African countries will
have a choice of whether to use those
tools the example I gave of a woman
using a drought resistant seed that was
actually done with conventional breeding
and there is quite a bit of improvement
still available with conventional
breeding but in this time frame the GMO
derived seeds will provide far better
productivity that
drought-tolerant salinity tolerance and
if the safety is proven then the African
countries will be among the the biggest
beneficiary so I think most of Africa
will see this as a way to improve their
productivity but it's a it's a sovereign
decision no no one makes that for them
fifteen years from now
stories like Joyce's become all the more
common as improvements in agriculture
drive down poverty and improve life
across the continent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
