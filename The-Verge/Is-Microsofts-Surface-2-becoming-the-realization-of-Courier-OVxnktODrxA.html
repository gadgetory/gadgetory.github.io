you know the big story here right all
right keep growing up the covers keep
going covered touch cover 2 120 at
launch again it's exist it's colorful uh
it is also one millimeter thinner than
the last touch cover which makes it kind
of paper thing and this one's really
interesting they keep talking about like
it's very book like mm-hmm um but yeah
the big thing is there's a thousand
ninety two sensors where the original
had 80 mm so they're really trying to
make it a much more tactile experience
much more sensitive to price so the
whole thing yes so the old one all the
keys had individual sensor in them right
and you could miss on this one now is
effectively one gigantic touch sensor
like a thousand ninety two sensors
effectively means everything is
sensitive to you if you miss a key it'll
like do predictive typing it's very much
like a touchscreen yeah and I kind of
thought before they come out was like oh
these sensors is the big reveal gonna be
like they just change what it looks like
the light up some key or they light up
whatever's like right actually because
there is a hint or something else
happening there right but that turns out
to be a separate piece of harbor
altogether right the surface remix
project yes the surface music covers the
official hardware name okay and the
whole thing together is a remix project
yes and do we have to do that video we
can roll yeah this this name is so crazy
so it's not the touch cover it's
actually a separate device you can buy
for remix that looks cool yeah I mean so
you use the xbox music app or special
version mean that what that guy just did
doesn't look cool I got it like this is
the dude from Lincoln Park that's what I
don't think he looks Johan yeah there's
a lot I have a lot of problems with this
already is it cuz it's Linkin Park yes I
but let's disagree I mean it looks very
interesting i'll say so this is music
covered we have a price in this yet uh I
didn't see a price yet i'll take a look
though so here's the thing about this
music cover and here's the thing about
the touch cover so i think the power
cover and the type cover are interesting
products they like they add features
that you need hardware to add right like
you need hardware to add like if you're
going to add a battery you got a like
plugin a battery if you're going to add
a keyboard to a tablet you got to plug
in a keyboard you need like mechanical
hardware to do these things right the
touch covers they're racing towards
building purpose-built like touched
vices which is the whole point of having
a touch screen in the first place right
and I at some point and I look at these
and that's great who's gonna buy this
like 10 people are gonna buy this thing
you can't have a market of like all
kinds of different crazy touch plates
right right i mean like are you gonna
carry around 10 of them yeah you've got
you've got an on-screen touchpad that
does almost 1,100 different sensor
points right I think that was cool but
there's that wrong way you can if that
one was reconfigurable or right did cool
stuff which in here's here's my crazy
theater theory there was a project at
Microsoft called the curry go on it was
a dual screen right that folded open
like a book in the urge and you know it
was famously cancelled we've been
mourning the courrier ever since it
would leaked and then Microsoft killed
it right there getting the fear closing
the gap the next step for Microsoft with
its touch cover stuff without question
is building a reconsider reconfigurable
touch cover that lights up in different
ways that is perhaps another screen
right the Hat is a sensitive touch than
she you know you click in the surface
that's sir phrase you click in the
surface and then this changes based on
what app you're running here right
that's where they that's where they're
obviously going with this stuff like you
I can't look at the type or the touch
cover with a you know a thousand sensors
in it eleven hundred sensors almost and
have it just be a keyboard it seems like
now that seems like the wrong it does
feel at ease and I said like they're
gonna just like make it like you can
change it a life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
