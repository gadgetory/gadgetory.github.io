augmented reality gaming system created
by Lenovo and Disney for around $200 you
get a phone powered Lenovo Mirage air
headset a lightsaber controller and a
light-up beacon you download a free Jedi
challenges Android or iOS app and then
slide your phone into an adjustable tray
mirrors reflect the phone's display in
front of your eyes so it looks like a
hologram cameras on the headset track
your beacon and lightsaber creating a
cheap and simple motion control system
the app opens a fictional Jedi archive
that trains you to become a Padawan and
Knight and eventually a master the
mirages images look like transparent
overlays not solid objects especially in
a well-lit room like most air headsets a
its field of view is small and boxy it
was good at matching a virtual
lightsaber blade to my controller
I had to recenter it a lot the tracking
performance was OK in both bright and
dark spaces but it was never great Jedi
challenges offers three game modes with
several hours of material you can play
holo chess matches or try a real-time
strategy game based on the Star Wars
universe but as you might have guessed
from the controller lightsaber fighting
the main attraction
the game pits you against waves of
droids and stormtroopers and then puts
you in one-on-one duels with kylo Ren
Darth Vader and other Star Wars villains
lines tell you where to block and dodge
and you have to get in the right
defensive position and then retaliate
you get power-ups by fighting
increasingly tough versions of these
duels which can be pretty challenging
you can even work up a sweat playing
unfortunately it's really not fun to set
up the app has a long startup tutorial
the bluetooth pairing can be finicky and
you have to plug the phone in with a
tiny easy to lose cable you have to keep
the headset and lightsaber charged via
USB and keep an eye on your phone
battery it's reasonable for a
sophisticated toy but it's not something
you can just pick up and put on also the
Mirage it's just heavy and badly
balanced I kept worrying it would fall
off when I dodged and ducked and it was
only fun for short sessions before
getting uncomfortable
the lightsaber fights were absolutely
worth it but after the novelty had worn
off the other games were just harder and
less fun than they'd be on a mobile AR
app if the Mirage were an open platform
it could be a fun super low-budget
err headset but for now it's an
expensive gaming device with one really
fun experience and a lot of rough edges
you'll have to decide whether it's worth
overlooking that to get a little taste
of the force
oh god I'm</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
