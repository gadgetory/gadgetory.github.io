that its cost billions of dollars it is
a war that has claimed many victims it
is a war with no end in sight it is the
war for your living room the war for
your television your living room has
long been ruled by one monarchy to
Dueling brothers cable and satellite
many have tried to challenge them and
many have failed but a new strategy has
emerged and you from the battle has
opened major players in the industry
Apple Microsoft Google Amazon and even
Netflix are now going directly to your
TV by using the internet they are going
over the top they're delivering TV and
movies directly to your TV through the
internet it's a risky strategy in world
war one going over the top meant leaping
out of a trench and charging directly at
the enemy almost certainly to your doom
1987 Sylvester Stallone went over the
top to win an arm wrestling tournament
against almost impossible odds but there
is rewards this risk these companies are
creating what it will almost certainly
be the next generation of television
they're changing how we create
distribute and consume what is arguably
the most important form of media that
has ever existed for these companies to
succeed they'll need to build complete
ecosystems they'll have to have all of
the movies all of the TV shows all the
music in some of the video games most of
all they'll need to convince a world of
eager consumers that it's finally time
to throw away the cable box that it is
time for a new king this revolution
won't be easy and not everyone will
survive the cable and satellite
companies have withstood challenges in
the past and they'll withstand this
challenge as well but just as a
revolution came for the smallest screens
in our lives of phones and tablets so
will come for the largest screen in our
life the revolution is coming and yes it
will be televised
