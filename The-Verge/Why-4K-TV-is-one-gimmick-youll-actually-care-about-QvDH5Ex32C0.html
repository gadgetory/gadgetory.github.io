are those but what this 4k actually me
there are two interpretations of 4k the
basic one is the panel resolution which
is 3840 victims across and 2160 down so
it's 8 million pixels which is four
times the resolution of a standard Full
HD panel the second interpretation is a
slightly greater number which is 4096 x
2160 which is what movies have been
produced in commonly nowadays
imagine the best picture you've seen x 4
is so much more details so much more
depth and texture is it's unbelievable
it's the biggest TV we've got here
standing behind me and it's the next
revolution of TV for the consumer so for
key means more dots how much that extra
resolution actually matter the answer is
not much on an average TV works from a
conventional sofas traveling distance
what we need to do this thing bigger
much bigger about four times as big at
50 inch it has the same pixel densities
and the pixels per square inch as a 32
inch full HD you start putting full HD
on 50 inch and above you can really
start to see the pixels that make other
pictures which is why the quad HD
resolution is so apt for the bigger
screen sizes living rooms tend to be you
know very big in some markets and if you
look in the US for example you know a
lot of people are going to projectors
and we're offering an option here
instead of a projector you can actually
have an LED there with much brighter
puncher colors great detail you know
Steven Spielberg's of the world you know
they would be a fact they would be a
great customer for our UD TV it matters
because people are getting used to
figure a bigger screens movie companies
are starting to film in 4k so we can let
customers enjoy that quality the
immediate problem in 4k is easy to guess
just because the TV will support super
high def content doesn't mean that you
have any such program to enjoy but the
same was true of HD at first and the
entertainment industry figured out a way
if there's a profit to be had the
content will flow in whatever format
people are willing to pay it's going to
take time at some point you know it's
it's going to have to be the TV will
have to be in the living rooms before
the content is ready we don't think
that's a huge problem though because
that was the same thing that happened
with HDTV the TVs were out there before
all the all the stations were providing
HD
10 but in the end they caught up to one
another give me a question left is how
many of us actually want I have the room
for an 84 inch TV in our living rooms
even if it is ultra high-definition we
do intend to bring it to Europe and
North America in the future costs in
Korea is about 23,000 US dollars but we
expected to be cheaper by the time it
launches in the other markets in the
next couple of months so this TV this is
the 84 inch sony TV it will be available
Christmas around 25 thousand euros so
there we are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
