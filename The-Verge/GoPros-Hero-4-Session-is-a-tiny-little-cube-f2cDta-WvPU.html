a verge and this is the new GoPro the
hero4 session so this is the first big
redesign for GoPro basically ever it's
fifty percent smaller than a hero4 black
and forty percent lighter and you can
see they've actually shrunk it down to
this sort of one inch cube size it looks
basically just like a polaroid cube
camera but with GoPros internals it's
got one button here on the top so all
you have to do to make it go is tap that
and within two or three seconds you're
recording simple hit it again and you
stop it and the camera turns off you do
have to change all the settings on the
GoPro app on your phone the only other
button on this thing
turns the Wi-Fi on and off the battery
on this thing lasts about two hours if
it's running consistently but you're
always turning it on and off so it lasts
even longer than that we went whitewater
rafting with it and it actually
outlasted the hero+ LCD and the hero4
black this is the last thing running at
the end of the trip the hero4 session
can shoot video photos and time lapses
but it only shoots eight megapixel
photos and can only go up to 1440 at 30
frames a second 1080p at 60 frames a
second and 720p 100 frames a second
there's no 4k hidden in this little cube
the video still looks great though it
works exactly like you'd expect a GoPro
to work it does really well in sunlight
know where it's great in low-light the
coolest thing about this camera though
is its size and shape you can fit it in
more places than any other GoPro and
it's waterproof right out of the box you
don't need any extra casing for it it
has two microphones - one on the front
and one on the back and it smartly
switches between the two of them so
there's less wind noise and it sounds
better when you come out of water those
are two pretty big complaints about
previous GoPros so the new camera also
comes with a new casing and you just
slide it inside and snap it in and it
attaches to all the same accessories
that GoPro sold throughout the years the
cool thing about it too is you can
rotate the camera around like that so no
matter where you have it stuck you can
always reposition the camera to make
sure you're pointed in the right
direction overall I really love this
thing it's really easy to use it lasts a
long time
and it's just harder to notice when
you're wearing it than any other GoPro
before the only real problem with it is
it's $399 that's the same price as the
hero4 silver which lets you shoot in
higher frame rates has a screen on the
back and doesn't require you to use your
phone to change the settings honestly if
you're buying your first GoPro that
might still be the best option but the
hero4 session is small it's simple and
it's a great camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
