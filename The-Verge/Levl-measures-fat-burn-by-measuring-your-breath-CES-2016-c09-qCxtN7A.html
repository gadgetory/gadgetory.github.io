and I'm here with the level breath pod
and the level device these are meant to
tell you how much fat you're burning
just by breathing into this tube it can
measure the levels of acetone in your
breath that correlates to how much fat
you're burning and it can help you lose
weight there's a corresponding app
that'll tell you how much fat burning
you've achieved each day I'll give you a
level if you want to learn more about
that you tap on it and it gives you the
parts per million of acetone and your
breath the amount of calories you burn
each day and then the pounds of fat you
burn each day so what this does is it
measures the levels of acetone and your
breath when we eat food or mostly
carbohydrates they're broken down into
glucose which we use for energy but
whenever we don't have a lot of
carbohydrates in our system our body
turns to breaking down fat and when that
happens we release acetone that goes out
in our breath so that's what we're
looking for with this it's able to
measure how much acetone and your breath
which correlates how much fat is being
burned in your body apparently I'm not
burning any fat I'm at a level 3 need to
be at a level 4 so I'm getting there
maybe if I just stopped eating up for
the rest of the night I get there yeah
if you want to learn more about this
technology why more on the verge comm
