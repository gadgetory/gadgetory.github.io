is the Mahindra Gen Z 2.0 an
all-electric scooter from one of the
biggest car manufacturers in the world
now this one here is actually made in
America they built this in Michigan
so let's actually take a closer look at
what it does and how fast it goes
so the gens e 2.0 is speed limited to 30
miles an hour so that you can ride it in
most states around the country without
needing a motorcycle license now that's
kind of a problem that it's also sort of
the point you don't want to be riding
this thing on roads that are speed
limited past 30 miles an hour 35 miles
an hour but that's not really what
Mahindra has made this for this is
really for city centers where people who
have short commutes and really get from
point A to point B quickly and can
charge it and bring it home later that
night and it's really good for that it's
a really stable scooter the front wheels
bigger than the back wheel and the
center of gravity is really low so it's
very easy to ride it's also super quiet
which is really important because you
want to be able to hear cars that are
coming up on either side of you so this
thing goes 30 miles an hour it also get
you 30 miles on a single charge and when
that charge runs out it'll take about
three and a half hours or four hours out
of a standard socket to recharge it you
don't actually plug the vehicle and you
take the battery out it weighs about 30
pounds it's not the easiest thing to
carry around in the world but you bring
that in to wherever you can find a
standard outlet and plug it in there
there's a lot more going on with the gen
Z - there's a touch screen display right
up on the handlebars that shows you
things like your speed and your battery
level lets you change settings like how
much torque you want and then inside the
scooter is also a 3G radio that beams
information up to the cloud so that the
app that Mahindra made can do things
like run Diagnostics change settings and
it can even route the shortest route for
you that's going to avoid things like
freeways so we have the gens e 2.0 for
the afternoon and we decided to take it
down the strip of Las Vegas here nothing
like rush-hour traffic
feel like I'm right back in New York
City and since it's built for that it
actually worked really well it was a lot
of fun to ride around even in
stop-and-go traffic
it's very maneuverable so it's easy to
get in and out of lanes and make your
way through all that traffic and it's
just a lot of fun to ride would it be
better if it went over 30 miles an hour
yeah probably sure if I had $3,000 to
spend is this the first thing I'd buy
probably not but Mahindra's gonna be
making more vehicles like these here in
America and around the world maybe this
isn't the one that I want right now
but whatever Mahendra makes next that's
what I'm waiting for for more electric
rideable and everything else recovering
