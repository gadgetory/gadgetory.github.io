thirteen i'm john lagomarsino and this
is 90 seconds on the verge presented by
ford CES 2013 is now officially over
it's been an exciting week we were
amazed by the oculus rift surprised by
project shield and frankly kind of
confused by Qualcomm and hey thanks for
watching and the Federal Aviation
Administration today says then we'll
watch a comprehensive review into the
Boeing 787 Dreamliner earlier this month
the battery packs in one plane actually
caught fire in what's become an
embarrassing series of stubbles for the
aircraft the FAA did caution that it
hasn't seen any data that suggests the
planes are in fact unsafe be sure to
fasten your seatbelt and turn off all
connected devices just in case finally
samsung says it will not launch a
Windows RT tablet in the US the company
blames weak demand and consumer
confusion over the difference between
Windows 8 and the arm-based RT which
can't run legacy software it's a
surprising bit of restraint for samsung
but we wouldn't really be surprised if
it made its own custom variant of
Windows so get ready for Smike Rosol
slab and slippy anse windows snake
that's it for today's top stories tune
in tomorrow to find out</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
