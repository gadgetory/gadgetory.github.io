and I'm looking at one of Sony's big new
announcements this is the PS HX 500 it's
coming in the spring to the United
States we don't know about global
availability but it might be available
don't know about its price so it's Co
kind of a mystery but we're looking at a
mock-up of it and in terms of design is
extremely bare-bones it's a very modern
take with something for a retro this is
the first turntable that is making its
debut here at CES technics announced a
return of one of his classics and now
Sony's doing its own thing and I was
curious to find out why people would
want this one of the options is
obviously have analog outputs you can
just use it a straight turntable but
there's also this label here high res
audio which Sony is really pushing and
Sony's trying to do kind of a hybrid
thing where it's doing the analog
classic vinyl quality but also wants to
bring that into the modern world and the
modern age which is with its high
powered Walkmans the high-res playing
Walkmans and what sony is doing is going
to have a USB output and it has an
application for PC and Mac where you can
get all your vinyls and you can make
backup files you can make them in wav
files or DSD up to six megahertz and
then you can convert that down to MP
freeze if you want to like simplify
things but for Sony that's what you want
to do when I send them into DSD files
and get them in onto your high quality
Walkman and then preserve that vinyl
quality wood high resolution audio now
so sony is pitching and selling to us
stuff to know a price and when this
thing is actually going to be on sale so
far all we know is it will be available
in the spring so that Sony's new
turntable here at CES 2016 for more
videos from the show where we'll be Sony
or all the other companies tune in to
the buzz calm or our YouTube channel</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
