really surreal yeah when you're there at
night they've the gondolas yes they have
the gondolas but but just the sky effect

about there's a hotel here in Las Vegas
that has fake sky I think in a fake
clouds yeah it's fake venice right and
it's a fetish yeah your specific it's
got to get struck out it's got a kid has
got a little lost there's gum it's got a
little caesars it's slowly sinking it to
the ground yeah I was walking the
leaning tower piece is nearby it's the
Leaning Tower of Pisa has a Domino's in
it uh no but what I say I said I got in
the car today and I said to Chris and
Michael or editorial assistant I said
that um Las Vegas is like one big
cheesecake factory and if you really
think about it that is exactly what
Vegas is like there's so many things
because everything is phony so much
she's getting is fake it's like fake
bricks I mean like cake factory there's
a lot cheesecake cheesecake factory at
so much anyhow we are we are live we are
live on the official really just
puzzling food we're live on the official
first day of CES and we are we're at the
sony booth right now so your contentions
on cheesecake factory somebody look
somebody's is young man cheesecake I
think that was carmen was that Carmen I
was thinking about anyone say Carmen
yelling I don't know it was a Howard
Stringer O'Hara's favor house tree was
yelling like a woman on stage heavy oz
yeah we're actually we're on the show
floor we're at the Sony it's the
broadcast tower yes we're the Sony
broadcast tower and I'm gonna read it
I'm not afraid to say that it's fairly
dope yeah sony has a lot of money
apparently and they have spent it on a
beautiful by the way we're not sponsored
by Sony but I will say this is a
beautiful nice to us I just stay here I
don't want to go back to the truck and
trailer when I we at home i want to buy
all of their product i'm gonna get a
sony blu-ray player no question but
we're here on the first day of CES and
we're going to talk about divine do you
mind we're going to talk about consumer
electronics mmm we're gonna talk about
technology we're gonna talk about i
would put our chances of talking about
those things that like fifty percent and
that's why i would put my chances i'm
drinking wondering last night after the
podcast the verge cast if you hell i
broke my new year's resolution to not
drink and I private any real and I don't
feel it felt amazing well then the
alcohol started coursing through my body
I knew it I could just I just said to
myself this is this is where I'm
supposed to be yeah I haven't time for
anything that's been a good day to you
today no but let's so let's get in the
news we shagged by the news Joanna you
did a ton of stuff today yeah I you know
I actually spent the entire day
with intel i think that's like kind of
what the news was today there were some
other thing I think Intel was the big
no-no there was other news i we hoping
but I think today was the biggest news
of today by far yeah well Intel's fun
stuff they showed off what one phone or
lenovo phone and then they got and there
any other motorola chat and there they
have like a yeah yeah intel showing a
prototype for you i know it's like so
can you don't make me go down this road
again what they announced yeah so they
announced medfield which is actually
been announced with that it's finally
over time but by the way it's very dry
in vegas i'm just gonna flexible lip
balm are you talking about that feel
glad i go on really you're getting ready
for it weird there's many jobs talk
about medfield go uh so yes they talked
about matfield what they talk about like
a million times but they're finally
ready to ship it in phones like Paul
Otellini came out during the press
conference is like it is ready for
phones we're gonna be in phones and time
they've been tell you a man feel for
what like three years meta fields Ferb
in the year they had the morristown
phone which never came out alright more
so never kids I don't think we're trying
to take out yeah so is it I mean they
said here's the phone this is going to
be a shipping device with more things
they first showed it like their
reference design phone which is a pretty
high-end phone in terms of specs and I
like this is what we're like showing
people this is what you can do with it's
running Android it's got Medfield that's
like so thank you like done that for
years that's the concept that will never
ship yeah that's the concept I'm that
will never ship then they had lenovo
come out what I don't even I don't know
how Trent everybody read our podcast
producer what else happen Ellen whether
you run game and chat or now and I tried
of like I'm gonna make you turn it
around so it's a keeps on going lower
lower their you how long ago why don't
you put on the other side though oh that
looks pretty good actually yeah hi Trent
alright see your hands they had another
phone did another class then lenovo came
out right oh you're like EULA we are
making a phone we are gonna be done
trash it huh we got a problem here come
back it fell off I don't know it's a
nice oh well joy my Intel quickly
happening Intel couldn't release a phone
because Trent kept coming on yeah surely
the the moorestown of microphone
placements
oh god you can do can you see anything
on yeah I get to fine I got a guide
really I don't leave our problem tread I
can you come back his car used to golf
man can you hand us the glasses on the
way back I can't talk to Josh for that
glasses go on this is I feel like if you
can I don't know no reason climb up on
ball and then hat my god oh look at you
want to give Trenton his happy for you
and keep try you ready for this wow yeah
wow alright guys so there was horrible
guys there was another ideas I don't
Thomas lenovo yet right right they
there's a prototype yes and then there
was a real phone so then lenovo came out
whenever lenovo came out another lenovo
came out on the stage and they announced
their phone and they're gonna be the
first to ship in medfield phone it's
gonna go to China only cuz lenovo
doesn't like to ship phone ring wait so
then over here you have found yeah it's
not called a little fun it's called the
k800 that is the worst much sketchy well
the Lumia 800 Lumia 900 decade and have
a hands-on about it we look like lefoux
no just think about so now so 10 there's
no indication that we're gonna get a
Medfield foam in the US where is now
them getting to the next part all right
but wait there's like a children's book
yeah let me show it to you here at my
transformer prime oh yeah you love the
Ice Cream Sandwich guys scream Sam I
think I think he knows you get the
update he has his OS he is although I
smile skeptic I was trying to push a
firmware up to update to me but the bat
last one was really bad song a lot of
fragmentation yeah so then this was like
it was actually kind of shocking like I
think a lot of people at the in the
audience were kind of like why is Sanjay
Jha showing up here and so you just had
to wander around yeah he was all around
in vegas it's late he took the stage to
announce that motorola is going to well
they've signed a multi-device multi-year
deal with intel they're going to bring
tablets and phones with Intel's medfield
chip out of the next year and which is
big did they mention any devices they
didn't mention any questions but I did
meet with Intel's I board to support I
met with Intel early early day I wasn't
as bad for at the Intel press conference
was I kind of knew about it but I met
with Intel earlier and they said they're
going to talk more about it at Mobile
World Congress ok but so I asked you a
question so Motorola has been like
pushing super thin sweet make obviously
super thin love your razor it's best run
ever yeah and then they have the razr
maxx you're gonna love it oh my god the
razorbacks is a 3300 milliamp battery
yeah I just say one more that's in the
nez insane well I 3300 is like a wagon
double everyone my ex ex ex or maybe XXL
I was a lame Johnny's access the
question well that's pretty good those
things are like Motorola's like Kayla
phones flagship phones yeah are they
gonna be able to build those phones with
Intel actually do them with our the
question I'm not worried about the
speeds like I they whatever i saute like
looked like pretty fast as off i was
running stock android so you really
don't really know but the big question
is no it's running too much well and
this they said ICS update is coming oh
yeah this one oh my god i love the
coming I this is a noble phone like we
got hands-on and this is not the
thinnest phone no and others are the
references Jackie right both are chunky
and they said like we can we can get a
say in it school like they were yeah I
don't know they hope the hell yeah
eventually yeah we're having our about
another yeah I do i do yeah i want to go
is very serious music oh my god wow wow
we're gonna rival you guys we're gonna
LG booth we're gonna have a way better
skin than you guys yeah hmm are you is
that racism I think it is that was aunt
Frankie better skin I mean thinking I
think you should be very fragmented I'm
finding some soup i watch
hey I me I'm excited about but what's
behind that excited I'm just happy to
happen is it because you know if you're
in this industry you've been following
right doctor are you as the biggest
Intel is finally gonna bring something
to market it's a smartphone like yeah a
chip on a smartphone yeah I also
actually like I was so for like consumer
like appeal there's something like you
know they were showing some stuff
working like with laptops and that sort
of ecosystem I think Intel could like
sort of make a dent there they have like
their wireless display technology and
they showed like swiping something to a
TV and they're now selling these tvs
with y dying in them did they mention
why died on Medfield they did that the
lenovo they said might have they had
would have wireless display my why would
it was the CEO said we'll have wireless
this way it was a little bit okay not
best english but look we have it he said
it he said it during a live blog I just
one thing to say like will make all of
our chipsets play together yeah why does
like one tiny feature of Windows
laughter so much that do people don't
care about NFC they can put the Enzo so
I all ready to go and I don't want to
say wait cuz we're gonna bring chris
ziegler out here but we actually had
that chance to sit down with sanjay jha
and some other people talk about what
Motorola's doing yeah and he talked
about intel wait and well he you know he
didn't want to say he couldn't say
everything obviously that he knew about
their relationship but the indication
that the vibe I got was that they're not
so much interested in medfield as they
are stuff that intel has down the road
my the sense that i got was that they're
very interested in the technologies that
Intel is developing right now that
you're not going to see for a few years
rent in phones or maybe a year or two
years in mobile devices but that stuff
would be like leapfrogging what other
people are working on the one they're
getting in now like they're they're
opening what why you give me that look I
Chris what was that what's the
technology that he made reference to
many transistors yes 33 transistors he
was like that technology we're very
interested in and the road map looks
really interesting down you know a
little further I signed something now
because they want to be in there and
partnering with them or
Lee on the ground well on the ground
floor so they can see an explosive
growth and profits oh I feel like I feel
like well their own hey Google I feel
like we're talking about the moral right
right the question is how does google
play into this relation I think I think
don't wants to be free of the
stranglehold of money over TI meni
Mendel is money I definitely think it's
money Motorola is struggling yeah
exactly right i mean cash rules
everything around this industry I see my
routing budget I was the next one is
gonna be HTC and Intel was like like
look we got we gotta get these
processors out there and if you're a
smartphone manufacturers like look these
aren't thin enough the power saving
isn't good enough let's wait for the
next guitar I forgot I've heard I've
heard the battery life is on pause they
say it's on I've heard from sources from
oh you're at the matter on par normally
means work no no that's right i was
gonna say that I've heard rumors that
it's not the performance and the battery
life or not as good as the better sound
ragan the dual core single hora person
that says dr. savage make up alarm but
hyper threading hybrid well I mean okay
so this is another thing that butter all
talked about was the hyper threading was
very significant and the dual core the
multiple cores are largely be a
sensationally isn't messy what's that's
a big thing to say I mean a motorola was
like first on the dual-core LT i'm
paraphrasing here crazy for the
indication i got is that of course huh
hardcore that's probably the intel soon
that's pretty good um but I'm just
saying clever see the indication i got
was that the dual core quad core race
and everybody's been saying this by the
way here at CES there's a dual core
versus quad core and whatever is all
essentially garbage yeah that it really
isn't about that mean for the
interesting thing you're not even with
that with them and that with some of
these arm chips is having a really slow
low power cord yeah that's a technique
that they can switch to your low power
mode I think that's much more things
like things I give me until and I don't
know what that means and does have some
stuff where it's dynamic and and the
boxes until can clock the cores down
like that dynamic
these cars the cook strait clock is
credible how do you know what I'm
talking about I don't know if that
sounds sexy yeah it's x SXT threatening
I know desktop processors Intel can kind
of around noon right what maybe we
should start a band called the sexy
threatening I work I'm sorry you've done
it I don't know oh yeah we got hey we
have a conversation to scrap it see
where D line I are able to have a
separate conversation you guys are so
far apart problem with four I'm just
gonna mmm cuz cuz who you know I talked
to after she was company three's a crowd
good talk to his story is upsetting do
you sometimes talk with your imaginary
friend when I'm not on the podcast yeah
yeah yeah you have another it's called
my rabid fan base and sorry Josh our
bags of direction I'm Tara we're doing
great we're doing that was a great what
is issue I would have to run a play now
no i don't what do you do i owe you man
what is that definitely all right dad
that you've that airplane why did he
wants us to go past second base on the
third base oh right stop it yeah yeah
all right let's talk about all trucks oh
ok look if human story of today was uh
in tow on phone talk about my ice cream
sandwich tablet no I don't talk about
else book oh I'll talk about Windows PCs
what are those we doing there this
you're extremely strange I know like
that ah again sexy you're threatening
who knows um else rooks give it on
phones I thought I find that threatening
I find it sexy yeah there yes see who
knows I'm gonna go now goodbye can you
talk on us remix for two minutes
ultrabooks are I am so tired of
ultrabooks why how many altered or a
laptop person didn't have any ultrabooks
I'm sammad is named them all and tell us
about I mean maybe at least ten you this
is Wow how can you handle all those all
tables how is it possible you bet even
take in so many ultrabooks at once
that's a lie lenovo has at least ten
just on their own well that's just like
now iteration no no it's a you're not
excited about the Ultrabook i am very
excited about your book so after you
love laptop tomorrow I do love laptops
and don't fact about you do
if you would if you had if you had a
trading card one of your factoids on the
back of me that you love laptop you
should get a tablet until it looked like
a laptop this isn't mine oh wait I will
kill again um so arable today dallin
Ansah I don't your book which I like a
lot um that was the what is it what is
it now announced today is called the XPS
13 yeah well the only important really
dering dering naming scheme there yeah I
mean um the double care so that's why I
should have gone what's been going on
with ultrabooks at the show is like
there's sort of these different
categories now within the Ultrabook
category so people are getting into
lower end ones for like nine hundred
dollars or less something even around
like seven ninety-nine this is like the
pc market yes I know but it's it's
spanning now to ultrabook category well
cuz cuz right right off the bat like
when they first showed them up and Aoife
like yeah none of them even broke a
thousand right right they were like
right around a thousand so is this more
oil subsidies here's my question they
didn't talk about that today at the
press conference where they talked about
it yesterday yeah um and yeah they are I
mean they were talking to 30 million
dollar fund and all that sort of stuff I
mean Intel's just pushing this so hard
so is this the answer is a CS basically
like Intel struggles for extreme
relevance across the industry right
because they're pushing ultrabook as you
don't need a tablet it just tells
definitely trying to wedge itself back
into the yeah there is a yen to the
conversation and I mean of course like
people are talking about arm and Windows
8 they were like apart like I would say
half of the presentation when they were
talking about windows 8 and like what's
coming with ultrabooks today they kept
emphasizing like you're gonna be able to
run your old desktop apps on here so
they know like arm is coming out so
they're talking about ultrabooks in the
sense that their future proof yeah yeah
that's I mean it's strange yes like they
mentioned it like a number of times
you're gonna be able to write soon some
batteries like you know the same cell
saying yeah you tell her all the men oh
you tell your apps will work on here
they saw that like a number on
ultrabooks that's good so that's no I'm
window so they're basically hinting the
desktop a bitch that's trim windows
right an intel on intel but not on arm
yeah
implying like when you get an arm one
you're not going to be able to that we
know that's a photo you know that's a
 lie that Intel's making that
their marketing we should they should be
is all they have to cling on to at this
point yeah it's the fact that when you
get an arm tablet or ultrabook or
whatever it is it will not run the stuff
you paid for for Intel for x86 but this
is the same scare tactics we've seen
with every big OS change where they go
like you it's not backwards compatible
and you know I think there's like
backwards compatibility is an overrated
quality who wants to go backwards let's
go forward you paid for photoshop fu
paver photoshopping medium I would be
upset I don't we wants to go backwards
let's go forwards is like I'm just wish
that you might walk around see every day
I'd be pissed look yeah I would you be
pissed about what like I just had to
switch my lap to have a number of times
in the last month and if I wanted to
switch to a new OS and some of them
didn't work you know if you're using an
open source OS like a boon to that
wouldn't be a problem cuz you guys
download whatever you need it are you
using that now no I wish I were 10-foot
pole because you compile your bun to all
day I write my own applications they can
pile up for whatever system with you and
whichever process with our whatever
whatever architecture all right yeah
yeah Michael just lost it yeah why that
was funny it's like he put all the Vegas
home his face he's turning red yeah you
just love that no nothing thing i don't
i don't get DP elders damn huge lols i
understand that Intel needs to you know
seal up this messaging and scare
everybody about going to arm but at the
same time shouldn't ultrabooks sell
themselves we're gonna get laptops now
that's exactly right but there's another
regular person I feel like people want
is just my people a year and we want to
destroy people at mainstream yeah but
the macbook air is probably one of
apple's best selling computers of all
time did you yeah yeah the current
generation what I'm saying is is like
they're not just going after the air and
that's what I was trying to talk about
going on your laptop you're going after
lap times they want to make mainstream
runs so like the ones that are like
lower down like
optic they don't want you to say and
they don't want you to say I want an
ultrabook they wanted to say I want a
one of those thin laptops well they want
you to say ultrabook because they love
that name so much stop interrupting me
okay they want you to say I want one of
those thin laptops and then your buddy
says Oh an ultrabook that's exactly what
you like me to the car is illegally
divorce your body this was an you go by
the laptop laptop it's an ultrabook that
was a quote from the privet that's just
marketing okay will.i.am said
that ultrabooks will.i.am is a puppet I
didn't tell puppet okay what are they
the new what did they point i gotta
feeling and will.i.am came on stage yes
go ahead it's just like all the guides
obvious What did he say the new ghetto
what's the blasters what he said this
well I said what we had a blast ultra
little ghetto blasters will.i.am was on
cocaine drunk and also getting paid by
Intel you say whatever I say whatever
what it is on his strength that is true
vlada got very mad because he said these
have the worst speakers and I don't know
let's be honest let's be honest that's a
load of okay legends juice there's
one by is it no I don't I don't wanna I
don't wanna I wanna cut any sony booth
you know what it can you swim in this
air today so she's raw Sony's very raw
yeah it will smith on stage the other
day carmen carmen was on series let's
just talk about the celebrities I've
seen any I don't wanna said that that's
been the highlight I don't want us to
base our opinions of the ultrabooks on
what will I am said funniest script for
sony so are they gonna be able to marry
I'm sorry I'd never sorry for Intel the
six hundred dollar windows laptop which
i think is the dominant laptop like in
the world wait is that gonna be an
ultrabook next year probably definitely
so that what is really in telecom but I
do want I question I don't know but I
want to talk about some of the other
ones that I like yeah what is in
accomplishing their would be great
they're pushing the entire industry
towards I think they want I think they
want people to associate altra book the
way they think of macbook I think they
want it I didn't want to have a brand a
thing
they go like this is when I had an tell
they had to discern out of PCs the neck
this right now but noone a pentium in
century no are from like the nine years
ago this is the next one I get it that's
their trademark know right but ultrabook
is is more it goes beyond a processor
yeah it it reaches into know I bought
you think they wanted a brain in popular
hotel is popular marketing these things
until inside pentium india these are
brands of people and they want ultrabook
to be the thing you say you're going to
strain say i want an ultrabook i will
definitely get an intelligent but we're
not getting buddy but the trunk door but
the truth of it is based on what we saw
today are starting out today by the last
couple of days there are gonna be a
couple of regular regular laptops and
then everything else is gonna basically
be an ultrabook because you don't need
you don't you don't need to make the
gaming pc anymore for the average
consumer you're making it runs windows
it's great with ie it's great with
running you know basic gaming hey we
made up we made a windows version of cut
the rope or whatever you know god I've
seen so many cut the me office great
your boom you're there right that's
enough that they don't need to and
they're talking about ivy bridge is
gonna have better graphics so you're not
gonna have to get like a wrecker laptop
so yeah I mean they strongly want to
create this idea of the Ultrabook as a
thing they've accomplished yeah but my
question and I think that when I say
what are they accomplished is they're
just selling more laptops yeah I don't
think they're gonna sell what if he gets
all once okay thank no no yeah let me
explain how this worked wed winning
nobody ships to the laptops Todd then
then OEMs I laughed I was always laptops
I mean that's great they did ultrabooks
they're not if they're not fighting this
they're not getting that well I like
Mayfield I'm corrosion you that you're
gonna do but that's not ultra bug that's
what I that's I'm saying this whole
ultrabook a bad fierros not ultrabooks I
agree with you so this whole initiative
all this money all this effort ultra
gonna they're gonna bunch of tabs
they're gonna tabs on tablets when they
have the right chip job looks so much
you're gonna turn it down I think the
reality is that it doesn't matter of
intel says we have a great prostitute
for tablets because until apple laptops
until Apple adopts their great tablet
architecture
Apple's sa lappa but I know but I or if
Intel pulls off like what they did with
ultrabook where you they've got like
four or five manufacturers ready to go
with a great intel no but have no
Macon's there Brandi no but I I disagree
because I wouldn't replace the laptop
they don't think that's gonna happen
well what are you doing what's happening
you walk towards happening stop right um
a video started playing I don't think
you can bring up tablet to talk about
what Intel wants to tablets and have it
mean anything because their business is
right now it's laptop okay so here's I'm
saying that's a great business for them
and they're obviously moving they're
trying to push that business but I think
overall in the industry that business is
diminishing overall laptops right yeah
well in so I do need a laptop I think
people still need laptops but if you try
baby a truck yeah not everybody needs a
truck anytime you don't want a car if
you accept the biggest growth cebula
need a motorcycle and other people want
to just use a scooter what is it jet ski
boris and yes he goes I want it why have
we had this conversation water is liquid
liquid is available at this conversation
a variety of forms mostly just gatorade
though how did you later it don't worry
about you pedialyte assocd away yeah

like out at Utah oh yeah it's always
nice it feels really nice really fast as
the trackpad the trackpad is a little
bit better than the first one it I
haven't played it if that gets your
juices flowing like the type that is a
little bit better than the first one
it's definitely not macbook air quality
what do you what is right and what is
the track what is macbook air quality
the macbook air what else in terms of
trackpad I don't know not even going to
say Joanna into pcs freely admits I was
not ripe add up to stop with the macbook
right and something i'm going to write
it also is like how much better Windows
works on
air like the touchpad works perfectly
fine with windows so I most doing
something great with the hardware and I
don't know what's going on I wanna drive
and they make the divers continue okay
we did the series 9 this I I mean this I
really like the env the env constructor
yeah i mean it is thick and it is heavy
because there's glass all over it that
makes no sense hey don't you you know
the best way to protect something
gorilla wrap it in glass Gorilla Glass
rabbiting glass gorilla is that the same
glass that breaks when you drop an
iphone yes oh yeah yeah no life under
that robe lat yeah it does yes yeah on
the back of their own I know it's grown
on the back it's improve in its grill
glass it's an adoption I don't read this
one it's grown really Apple I don't have
I don't have a large enough dude to put
that book away well get it on ebook that
one is your laptop nine and I really
like that but I just like has a lot of
cool stuff in it and then displays
awesome subscribe i900 gradients this
way really nice display so those those
are the three FFF 10-4 it's like not
really an ultrabook it's that Lenovo
yoga what about the VZ I think it's
really weird but the visit I you don't
need a video you liked it the 1600 by
the high-risk visitors of 16 by 9 yeah
yeah I'm all over that yeah I videos I
don't think we can like sweet there it's
really interesting they did a good job
they feel nice we don't know I think
like we use the keyboard and like
they're coming out I mean yeah I thought
I realize you're coming out easy won't
be on again yeah how do you know I know
for a fact what in st. hey what's coming
up you I don't trust them I we never saw
their phone the phone phones are hard
it's really bad laptops are easy no the
laptops on the bar not anyone can make a
laptop oh really yeah not anyone not
anyone you ever been to China have you
ever been to see yes yeah I've ever been
to you can make them a not good well
that wasn't our question was I think
they look I mean no look yeah they put
out the tablet because they'd have to go
through the carrier they could not put
out the phone because they had to go
through carriers just too hard yeah they
told me they took all their engineers
and put them on the from the phone to
the pc other pieces are coming out my
only reservation about it is that
cuz it looks showing what about the
touchpad on though I mean it was all
wonky but it's not coming out for six
off when you're like doing a quick
hands-on well that's insane yeah I mean
they said like made hanging somewhere
that shot look I'll fault I'll forgive
them like a walkie balti Tata
implementation during the demo CS they
get honor but when that thing comes out
yeah it's fair when I think comes out I
mean we have to know if the keyboard is
any good and if that track pad works but
overall it's like it there's promise on
that note I what are ya and it's the
lenovo yoga which like Ben's nothing's
not like the future how do you like
relax this cool form factor after school
yeah I mean I'm great aim oh you know
that I mean you don't have a keyboard
like I don't want to have this keyboard
glue to the back of this tablet every
time I use it as a tablet like that is
gonna be annoying like this is what it's
like so why do you like it this is just
cool and windows 8 works really well on
it i I'm really excited about Windows 8
you don't like how it were it's really
really well yeah yeah we should have tom
tom warren come on tomorrow yeah I mean
we were we've been playing with some
windows 8 stuff that we feel you got it
he got 80 got an awesome exclusive ok
any new windows a beta Joanna which is a
few what's your take on it on Microsoft
like not not even caring about windows
like they're hiding windows 8 at the
show basically i mean i think they not
time you that's why they're bailing from
i think next month they have a big
announcement it's time they don't want
to ruin it right now they want to be the
focus at next month and they're not
talking about hardware anyway right now
you're not gonna talk about hardware
till the fall or end of the year I mean
end of like well I think what's her
later I mean but and last year at this
show they announced windows on arm it
was I mean it went use the word one of
the worst of the house was every yeah it
was a physical at apria now a year later
I mean a year later that I think that
announcement has like kicked in Intel
like indie gear right they're doing all
the stuff well yeah but Microsoft
actually saw I mean they're like here's
some windows 8 it's gonna run it's
really fascinating about show it's
really crazy about that is that you know
we went to Qualcomm before the show and
we've had to Paul Jacobs the CEO and he
was talking about that you know Qualcomm
can now competing with Intel yeah like
Windows 8 devices and now Intel's is
reversing it and make
totally android device you know give me
power android i mean i think i was
talking to it crazy woman who I've known
for a while at the Intel thing we were
he started covering this industry when
they were um PCs and mids and I was like
it's on the stretcher wasn't it wasn't
Thomas Ricker but it was the 70s steve
payne chippy and he used to cover it
like me and um pcs and i was like
basically this is like Intel coming full
circle just realizing it had to put a
phone and that they were too early like
they had to make a phone early on I
think you're being a little apologetic
on their behalf no i mean i think in
telling you that like mobile was a thing
that you said what I took too long to
get here if anybody else I didn't have
the technology and right or the idea
it's all if I'm happy buddy you know
Intel owned read the mid own desk we had
an armed license and they blew it yeah
so it's what they were talking about
these terminable internet devices and
like like they have little nap things
they were showing all these things a
while ago they just did know how to do
it right then you're right they didn't
have the technical guy 92 hours about it
you know you can't actually cute get out
of my face all right on that note I'm
gonna get out of your face we should
take a break Joanna thank you for being
here yes I mean even though we're with
each other 24 7 yes I mean not ask you
got you and me yes I know don't worry
hey yeah but I mean it'll be bad we're
gonna be back before i'm born child yeah

take a break it will be right back with
justin bieber
if we have it under embargo do we need
we really really need is like to try to
get a hands-on or some live pictures of
whatever they're announcing what are
they announcing so bring it absolutely
ton of people to see us it's our entire
team from around the world got people
coming in from the Netherlands the UK
the west coast new york japan we should
request interviews with people that we
think would be significant or
interesting to get our hands on because
we'll have a set up at the trailer
please say you command we have the best
technology powering our site things like
storystream and the video technology
that we're using and our product
database we're really good at taking a
lot of information making it presentable
making it readable and still showing you
what's important what really is going to
make the coverage grade is that we have
a staff a big staff of really smart
really talented very sharp writers that
are putting these stories together that
are building narratives out of these
stories and they can tell the stories
better than anyone else in the industry
and we're back so actually it's only ten
baby I would love to have a baby I don't
say that the thing we just saw is you
know forward is sponsoring us and they
they we got an opportunity thanks to
their sponsorship to shoot some
behind-the-scenes stuff yeah which is
really cool and we can actually our
planning meeting but yeah we were
planning to yes on some of those shots
where I was actually you know figuring
out what we're doing here but um yeah I
think it's very cool yeah it looks like
a movie trailer no no it looks like
we're doing a really serious yeah she's
already what he's talking about Joanna
having a baby it's you yeah developing
world anyhow chris ziegler is here are
one of our senior editor senior mobile
out of there very happy together I'm
painful but i'll just give us your
spider house is why not okay why you
dont clap yourself I'm clever dog
photography for the cash okay not for me
lie down he's caught me for Chrissy lot
a lot of mobile news where are we
starting with this for what we have you
guys had a meeting so we had it so we
had okay that's good so I thought can I
just say one thing today was like for a
meetings day we took a lot of meetings
there me metal with water world there
were intimate gatherings yeah there were
what I would describe well I would
ascribe to this page of like a long car
ride pagan rituals yeah a doe see the
high dosing of acid yeah mushrooms
ecstasy 1i PCP you guys can't see is
there's a guy driving a vacuum busy here
bony this guy's going three blazing up
and down the aisle it's gas engine you
can burn like he's putting her down on
the batter now alright so we had a
meeting with Sanjay Jha the CEO of
motorola mobility yeah and and there was
a Maloney and a Maloney yes who runs
their home home connected home right and
and there are a handful of other
journalists there and
Sanjay got into it hey Monique of it but
uh but no he said some really i'll say
this he said some really interesting
things he was very honest yeah straight
up on the record very ken what's
happening behind me there's a Zamboni
it's just boy I think this guy's just
message every time you think I do you
think he's messing with us um if I don't
have to drive that thing I look freaked
out alright that guy's high and drunk
you got 30 seconds before he comes back
i do right but but a week but there were
some really big things that he said I
think yeah he said so I pressed him on
the skinny and stuff and that really set
him off you really what we published a
quote yeah it was the quote Eddie so I
said you could do smart actions as a nap
why is it necessary to skin these
devices and he went and by the way i
think was was very clear about i don't
think he was upset about the question he
here's a quote you verizon an eighteen t
don't want seven stock ice cream
sandwich devices on their cells we have
to make money and then he said there's
no way to make profit on Vice that isn't
differentiated yeah the vast majority of
changes we make to the OS are to meet
the requirements that the carriers have
so which is so the gist of what he was
saying actually was not that we don't
want to release you know we it's not
that we don't want to release a stock
phone a lot of it was the carriers have
they need things put on the phone they
need to do their testing and that's all
like part is nothing's all worth it well
like superfluous animations you know
serious passing the book no no but but I
think they're saying verizon saying
don't bring us a stock android phone
because we don't want it I think they're
saying verizon saying you better come
with something original or we can't
market it in our crazy violent act right
right and for a company like Motorola
the thought of verizon saying no we're
not going to take that device is a
pretty scared that's debt that would be
death to them right now hey motorola was
dead three year two years ago yeah okay
and they've been saved by android and
verizon well and they're in no position
way way way that they've been saved
they've been revitalized but they have
not actually been saving they are still
struggling well they've
beta been purchased but they're on their
way no he's your buyer just if thats not
purchase what's here between a con and a
great business deal the wording think
about that just like that's due by
everybody for a second uh let's let's
let's be very clear google tried to do
the unlocked phone thing with the nexus
one and even google failed so i don't
think that Google buying motorola legal
wasn't really trying they were just
riffing right but why would they were
definitely there definitely just like
let's try this out to it first of all
first of all Google's public public
statement on this whole situation is
that they're gonna be hands-off with
Motorola and for all I know that's true
I still don't know that that's
necessarily untrue I think it's untrue
yeah I got there's my god speaking
they're gonna give out access devices I
think that I don't know about that but I
think they're gonna a little does a lot
why do you want to own motorola pens
patents yeah they bought Motorola to own
patents and they're gonna let them keep
making the same phone as a change to
Google what's that again what is this
it's jump yeah okay haha alright I just
love the idea of like Sanjay Jha like
Larry page's making it right Thank You
strange image actually Larry Page has a
cannon so I is it you just like throw
him in its hundreds and yeah it's like a
helo todavia flower on his own
battleship yeah yeah he pushes a phone
by the time the money comes out is just
an attractant care what goes he goes in
his face and kind of burns upcoming
re-entry the atmosphere it's quite a
powerful making rain can sin beta it's
it dirty see how it feels you know what
happens what happens if we all make it
rain with this cannon do you think I
wish I can be sweet there right now but
I'm podcasting so I can't stop here yeah
what is the verge cast don't get too
precious a national here yeah really
profession well what we're in a
broadcast out my galaxy nexus does a lot
better than those other fault the other
stock phones I do you think that might
change some people's alliance I don't
think so because
now verizon still looks at it as a very
each product each device is a very
siloed device i think that they look at
each each phone in a vacuum and i really
don't think to be honest I see Sanjay's
point I think that that is the message
that carriers are delivering to him I
don't think that he was if you see each
phone in a vacuum why do you need a
differentiate because Touche because
just when you get out why don't you come
back when you have some real information
if you're it says these these empty is
empty you can show a distraction if you
promise you get pregnant by the way yeah
tamanna did it's a great effect guys
just don't do it well write my words I
will be pregnant by the time I leave Las
Vegas yes with the lace beeps will you
let your children use it all people
owner rolling with a motorola ice cream
sandwich that's way out of my wheelhouse
I'm not equipped to answer that yeah go
ahead will resume I have no idea could
be very differentiation uh give me back
a vacuum all right everybody back right
right so sorry i think that the galaxy
nexus and the nexus line in general is a
very specific case for verizon and for
other carriers and it's almost like the
iphone and that there's a lot of
pressure on the part of the for
nationals to carry Google's flagship
product and there's a lot of reluctance
I don't think that Verizon I mean look
at the marketing campaign that Verizon
put forth for the Galaxy Nexus versus
the droid razr for example the verizon
put out like three like feature-length
movies for the droid razr fees are
exploding motorcycles and well dudes and
you know and this this is the whole
thing is that a stock phone has never
gotten a fair shake so how can they be
so sure what will keep it really fail
here's the other part of that equation
is that a stock device cut completely
cuts verizon out of the the arpu picture
the revenue picture so you know beyond
the plan they're screwed and and they
want to minimize that as much as they
can there's so they're so screwed
because they're only getting a hundred
fifty dollars am I mean yeah daddy's
house
picture I'm sorry what how does the
stock phone cut him out of the picture
because they're not getting the phone
isn't filled with crap no but I can't
you know my argument is not you can fill
the phone with crap put the crab on
there those are the apps yeah their apps
or apks they don't affect exactly the
operation like on windows right so put
the crapware on there and let me have
the option to delete it or use it and I
would say most people probably end up
using it but don't reskin the phone
change the way it operates change the
mail client and do all this i mean i
know they have I know there's this
exchange issue but let's say they
include an exchange client don't change
the basic operation of the phone and
that was my argument today when we were
talking was smart actions is great but
isn't a some kind of a crazy system
level thing that cannot be done as an
APK they have it as an APK in the market
you can download it for you know the
appropriate motorola devices so the
issue is and what they would sanjay
basically said was we there are
pressures from carriers to differentiate
and we're not driving you know what i
think is at the end of the day I mean
we've had this conversation 100 times at
the end of the day that means there is a
huge gulf between what consumers want
and what the market is actually
dictating for these devices well there's
a lot of what they wanted to do but
that's over reaching consumers don't
know what they want to be very fair no
that's exactly right and Steve Jobs said
this and and and and so did so did Henry
Ford well I mean essentially here's yeah
he's quoting and by the way I know this
because we talked to for tonight but the
quote is something like if I ask
customers what they want they'd say a
faster horse yeah now that's right
that's that's not what I mean not at
that level like yeah consumers gonna
mail you a picture of what they really
want I'm saying these skins the overdog
touch Jacques touch yeah I'm saying
there's not it if the carriers are
saying we want this we don't want that
that's not there they're placing a
barrier between carriers are saying make
it different I don't think they're being
so specific no I think they're being
really special i don't think so i think
they're saying make it different but i
think they're being very specific
III mean I've heard really they're
giving about about LG and HTC and yeah
they order the phones basically right
then they building i got like on a fast
food menu look nationals absolutely do
the regionals don't they picked out of
the regional these guys are just yet
exactly but that verizon AT&amp;amp;T tmobile
Express ordering Philippa tweet their
rap are they ordering having a very
unhealthy diet or billing look you got
to get all this crap on there or did
they say like feature changes or no I
know but like oh is there a usability
expert at the carrier level that like
water was nothing I know that's what I'm
saying like and I think that's kind of
what you were saying like there there
are market forces that are dictating you
know for them to make a profit or a
bigger profit they need to put crap on
their phones but but there's nobody at
the carrier who is responsible for this
ultimate product because they made
themselves responsible if you is
actually completely focused on
delivering a well functioning perfectly
usually me like like a really smart like
a designer who know like yeah like yeah
you know I get Johnny I've who works at
the carrier yeah that did the person who
sees no sense no I don't know why was it
doesn't make sense but if they put this
they put themselves on this I know why
even though they need a wider on the
pedestal because the past will make some
money like no that's what I'm a hair
like they're excited this is the model
so at least they should go ahead and do
a good thing let's consider something
else which is that that I know once I
need to do if design and usability ruled
supreme the world would be rid of Comic
Sans if you you you think of how many so
much and I'm what a dream you know wait
how do you non-threatening Lisa wait how
do you how do you tell the world how
passive aggressive fall okay tell like
somebody has some yes yourselves
refrigerator door in a jokey way that's
a comic Sal can you tell what looks good
if Comic Sans ceases to exist so you're
saying every carrier needs one really
crappy phone yeah yeah every carrier
needs the fascinate with being on okay
no the continuum yeah but the one with
the total right that y'all gonna member
that huge innovation yeah what happened
gonna be it yeah can I ebi for the
little ICS touch screen buttons yeah
they got that from the continuum that's
right they ripped it off Google's look
at this on Andy Rubin was like that
that's what we need yeah do that no
multi-touch but I want that hey I go on
do you want to talk about you talk to
Steven oh yeah hold on wait but I wanted
to squeak latempa Sanjay job the other
things that he said was really
interesting um he said so they don't
want it they don't want a bunch of
unskinny phones they also said they're
gonna make fewer phones in the coming
year that's right well it is exciting
because what it means is that the
industry is waking up to what we know to
be true by editorial yes which is on day
one good job is not not only my only is
the demand not there but you are selling
yourself short as a make a phone maker
if you're like every iterate you're like
we can make the screen 1 inch bigger
that's actually big point point 1 inch
bigger let's make a new phone on that
one it should be a huge butt but like
it's like we found a way to have a
ripple back instead of a curvy back like
you don't I mean it's like every
innovation they keep issuing a new phone
I think you're starting to realize that
that doesn't exactly work in the market
at this point right and well I don't
think it will work for a long time I
don't I mean phones aren't laptops
laptops are rocks are not motorcycles
motorcycles are not cars stone but but
phones aren't they're not it's not the
same thing that we've been playing that
same game it's seeming with tablets so i
j-just said you go into a store and
there's 24 they're exactly the same
android tablets and nobody's buying them
Chris can you say the gist of your
editorial against people read it yeah I
would love to actually which the main
overarching theme in that editorial is
that by releasing a new device every two
to three months you're alienating your
best customers you're you're saying to
the to the people who are supporting
your brand and springing products f you
know like i said but you know what it's
funny motorola said that today right
Sean J I was like we want to put out
fewer phones yeah what he's doing at
this show is giving the finger to
everybody who just bought a razor cuz
they put out the razr maxx exactly are
you kidding me well i think i put up an
idea but i did enjoy hardcore no but
shud i think that's a hard to the joint
but i think this is part of their abing
right 17 but i think this is part of
their abing situation yeah sense that
they have been just iterative and tiny
changes in just so many heavens but you
don't accident your way into the razr
maxx you're like oh that's the end no I
think they did I think it's exactly what
they did I think they talked about it he
did he said an engineer said hey what if
we made the back like this we could do
and he was like what's the battery and
it was like 30 300 milliamps and he
freaked out or somebody freaked out said
that's awesome and it's for the power
users right but I think that but I think
that we're at the tail end of that for
them at least with him saying we
recognize the droid bionic the droid
razr the droid for the razr maxx in the
span of three or four months or
something is an untenable way to run
their business their phone business
because the truth is there aren't enough
people out there to support it what they
really need is like a low-end device a
high-end device about once really about
once a year maybe twice maximum well I
think I think you could legitimately a
low-end device and then to Honda a
couple form factors yeah like keyboard
you do keyboard no keyboard but we're
talking about substantial differences
right not like this one's thin this
one's slightly less than because that's
not substantial and consumers aren't
gonna buy into that and and this this
phone has ever slanting corners right
this she'll just be a trial did anybody
grill Sanjay on these horrible corners
know Butch Jones me corner himself
really yes he said he said in retrospect
I wish we had we had made the the the
razor a little less edgy and I think he
bent he meant the curve on the back
where it where it comes up so extreme
writing on the camera and I think he
actually was saying that he wishes it
was more like the max in a sense that
you can it doesn't feel as a continuous
yes instead of this kind of weird break
yeah but I don't find probably the
corner I'm seriously I have official I
saw hammer I would never buy a device
with those corners why they motivated
came out with the best phone of the
world I would not buy a device with the
corner that they have on the xyboard on
the razor like they're putting on all
orders are nobody yourself accidentally
liners I'm tired of like weird oblique
angles
those angles are important well that
that is no it's the essence of a useless
thing yes that is the perfect example of
meaningless differentiation yes where
they're like whoa but then they didn't
change the edges to differentiate they
change it because that's their design
language I mean it's purely aesthetic
and not at all functional right well
lots of things are purely aesthetic all
functional like the glass back on the
iphone 4 yeah right your earliest attic
and not at all functional unless you
consider both know there's no
functionality to was well i think i
think what Paul's getting added there's
also an aspect so simple to see her flu
asst that's right it's not a simple
design you can't argue that that super
superfluous design that that that a
design element is superfluous just
because no you don't think it needs to
be there the altar exam I I it's
superfluous oh it's like gavel tunes on
a fifties Cadillac yeah but superfluous
to do is it is but it's exactly what but
is what's making I tailfin sure are you
kidding me there's nothing like help it
off like a black well the xyboard is not
yeah if you took those tail fins off it
would be it would look like a different
totally different car yeah yeah 50 years
from now you're gonna have kids fixing
up a whole Bible they bring into Santa
ratchet and they're like okay guys and
by the way I'm not saying that I like
the edges but i will say that design is
designed and easy but it's there so you
don't like it nobody figured it's either
good or bad I mean I that's all there is
to this is an awesome segue into nokia
because i love the Lumia 900 years are
gonna go see you in every deal up today
wait soja just said one of the new deal
of today wait soja just said one other
thing I want to talk about kan ons in
chrome that keeps on Chrome yep on the
one stop chrome is coming to web top
that's hot and it looked casually it was
so weird we were like we said I've asked
monroe LA questions sewing we said I was
just bitching about the software and I
said you know the sovereigns not good
you know are you to put chrome on them
he's like that's coming we'll continue
to offer a Firefox option or something
like that and more generally he said
that ICS enables a number of things
that's going to make the webtop
experience more affluent yeah exactly so
i don't but i don't understood the
firefox offering yeah why don't you
continue to know how to offer that yeah
that's that no but so so segue into
nokia um okay uh say we know yeah I did
interview with well we saw the n900 yo
the Lumia 900 900 is the Mego device yes
that's rough late well their fault they
made it I just you know I gotta kiss
that goodbye you guys got a safe for a
while what station now Tizen Tizen no
that's actually harmattan no no that
nice all right oh we can sew sew sew sew
nokia introduced the Lumia 900 and we
had an interview with Stephen Elop today
and I go I mean which he was he was I
think I think he's legitimately psyched
about these devices but what's
interesting is that what I think what i
thought was interesting was that he we
also interviewed Erin women today did
that go up I don't have a gym we've seen
so many yeah it didn't go up not on
please well we interviewed air will be
from from Microsoft I news people yeah
yeah by the time you guys do this but
but he said that what i thought was most
interesting is that some of the
innovations in me go they were looking
at they would consider as you know
something they wanted to bring to mm-hmm
windows phone yeah and I feel like
that's I know he may have said stuff
along those lines before but it was he
was very candid about the fact that they
e that there was a lot of innovation
there and they weren't putting that
necessarily to bed and they would be
looking at it but the other thing the
things he had trouble answering were why
is this the real windows phone as
opposed to HTC or Samsung his answer was
because the dokey is fully focused on it
but that doesn't kind of skirts the
issue which is he's basically trying to
say that Samsung and HTC and LG are
making they're not the real thing
clearly he said the genuine article he's
saying because nokia is the only company
entirely spoke entirely focused on it
yeah except for a bachelor we're making
that megaphone
and simultaneously with that and they're
still selling like Symbian devices other
than that stuff it's completely their
laser focus land but he seemed
legitimately excited and the only thing
I I walked away from was that you know
they really think they've got this is
there he was reverie buddies were lucky
to call their halo device but this is
clearly the Windows Phone halo device
right but I I wanted to talk I wanted
have a longer conversation I think he's
got a lot more to say and I got it but
I'll say for no kids a big deal to have
a guy in charge who seems legitimate
invested in what they're making yeah I
don't think they've had that for a long
time think I've really said no but they
were legitimately invested in things
that that were obviously not going the
way they in their minds they thought
they were supposed to be going I think
it's a dangerous there's a dangerous
difference between liking something and
trying to get it to go in the right
direction and liking something trying to
get to go in the right direction it's
not going in the right direction and not
seeing that mm-hmm so we don't know Elop
has that we haven't we have yet to test
him yeah to see if he's seen it or not
you know hopefully it goes the right
direction because for you competition
sounds like you like kind of bro down a
little bit I mean we we there was a
period of growing down no I'm at it with
a brief interview and spoke we fist
pumped a few times I don't know but the
thing is that he's fairly down to earth
when he talked to him and I thought that
his attitude about there were some PR
stuff you know some scripted stuff yeah
but I think that generally he was fairly
loose and talkative about the device and
their strategy and they seemed really
happy to be back doing a North American
device hmm you know and they recognized
the importance of North America are they
bringing something to Mobile World
Congress well they haven't said well he
intimated that this you know he keeps
saying this is just one of many things
Microsoft is gonna have big
announcements right they haven't said I
thought I guess my place is that they
are gonna do you yeah version yeah the
thing is it that the Lumia 900 not the
amenities mascot not his job like he's
just coming out and then Mobile World
Congress is gonna happen like like these
specs are getting really
yeah specially specially the screen now
the resolution in the display I mean
that the Nokia display looks what is it
called pure black clear by looks clear
black not what was our thing sure sure
black it looks really really good yeah
but it's like I have to say I'm really
drinking the Microsoft kool aid of specs
not mattering with with these phones
because every time I've used a Windows
Phone going all the way back in the
original launch last November with the
exception of the surround best reliever
it everything feels so fluid it the
software is so well matched to the
hardware that I think that makes a big
difference that's one that's one thing
that has really hurt Android from the
beginning is the fact that the software
is so decoupled from the hardware that
even extremely high spec phones are
quite often stuttery right we've seen it
on 1.5 gigahertz dual-core phones yeah
that's I mean that's in the basic UI
windows phone but when you're launching
apps and the you know the game
performance is pretty low right now
really though I mean like there's some
really good xbox live games on on
windows yeah okay xbox live games I mean
there were not new one announced this
week I want to check it they should be
solving for they should be solving for a
real-time multiplayer that's ridiculous
they own an xbox live it's the most
popular multiplayer gaming service in
the world there's a ton of those apps
online and and there's no reason why
they can't do phone versions of apps
that you can play against people who are
on a console so you think there's so
many so much opportunity will see it the
next generation chassis well I mean
where are they gonna wear skype
integration yeah no I don't know but but
what I would say they need to do next
generation chassis next generation
software which includes skype
integration you know better multitasking
notifications which i think is still
rough on the platform and in better
heart whoa i said better job of
screening in the screen but but also
there's something else I have to put a
blanket on it but I think they need to
they need to come to us from Jon touch
each other they're not at a competitive
level but they're not at the I don't
think they're at lost level that's the
problem when I when I was like oh the
gaas a 720p display that to me was
a bump yeah I know there's this argument
about this and that you know the
technology it looks better than every
other 800 x 480 screen abused I'll tell
you what I spoke with chris webber today
and what that interview up soon too he
is the president of nokia's North
American operations and he made a very
interesting point to me which is that
you have that cyan Lumia 900 in this in
the store right you have so many people
that are walking in the store they don't
know what they want they're gonna
they're gonna you know just look at the
phones and pick what what looks good are
they they're gonna buy what the the
sales rep tells them goodbye so they see
that Sian Lumia 900 looks frickin
awesome and even if you don't buy it
even if you end up going up to the
counter and saying yeah that's a little
dangerous for me I'm gonna get the black
it's that that blue phone that bright
blue phone on the Shelf that talked you
into the Lumia and i think that's it
that's a an interesting play well I
think that it's the the question is how
many people are really psyched about a
bright blue I Lumia and I think that
number is it tracks your eyes that I I
think well yeah you plays a pretty weak
argue and roid might have done that a
little bit with like the large screen
it's not so much that because I don't
like you think that's a good problem
arch screen but but man a story you're
gonna notice that it's true you're
looking at the different phones and all
the sudden you see a 4.3 inch next to
the 3.5 and it's a notable difference I
mean I we it's not a notable difference
anymore it's not a no difference anymore
i'ii crime except for the note oh god
it's just I mean I we keep talking about
Android like Android as a holes
successful T strategies it's samsung
samsung is accompanied this out I think
motorola motoroi dural blazing motorola
blaze the patent a large we had a lot of
fights out there what other metrics do
you measure performance on bc is
struggling right the only the company's
always a struggling they're struggling
now they're doing okay no latest quarter
is little bear naked yeah but we've had
enough but but the entire economy is
taking except for samsung which is blown
up that's an order ever yeah i mean
there's one company that's really
succeeding with android its samsung yeah
the other companies they had an
accelerated growth curve because it was
a new platform people were switching the
smartphones yeah
was on verizon you can you could start
saying doom and gloom for android app
I'm not saying do you include Frank ya
know what is the platform seem to
include for motorola and I'm saying I'm
saying there's one company that is like
these strategies have worked for one
company it's not for android no I think
that's we don't need to early it's too
early to call this it's been like two
years sure I mean what technologies can
you call it to you whether or not that's
part of this it's part of this how I got
to be if you last what yes what
technology remember you're buying
webinar the vast majority of smartphones
sold in the world can you call it two
years now I'm not saying that I mean I I
just want us to be more careful come out
like new what Android is doing or how
Android but if you do but it's me real
no but if you look at the aggregate you
don't look at you know you don't look at
this quarter as the as the when you look
at her freights you see didn't just go
like this it's been going with you well
okay fine same for motorola means like
that then we'll know that it that that
piece of it has failed but you have to
look at a longer sure somebody playing
party rock anthem right now i hear it no
you're just hearing no i'm saying i'm
hearing it somebody's out here playing
it um under saying that that that that
you need to watch a longer curve that
they're not one or two years so you wore
one or one or two quarters it's that's
the longer dude don't get me wrong there
do what a cc yeah that their profits
have been down yeah they didn't try my
were they up last quarter no the most
recent corner a quarter they were down
year-over-year by a lot a lot like i was
just saying it's what we're in a
recession sure then you seized from you
may be right i I don't you know who I'm
bullish on LG we're scanning I actually
can I can I talk about two piece of news
I know where yeah we have to wrap it I
want to talk about to last piece of news
one of which i think is totally self but
a huge huge piece of news are the cs but
actually real quick on LG I think it's
really interesting that their android
phone skin is a totally unmitigated
disaster so the ugliest thing I've ever
seen but their google TV skin is like oh
that's kind of refined it's kind of
value
it's like hot where were these guys been
why do you just haven't make the phone
Jeremy asked you for a miracle I think
their remote is really wonky and bad I'm
not getting your remote discussion
anyway I thought you know I talked to to
research Anders ahead of Google TV today
and I was like what's with these remote
seems like I know we have to figure it
out and it was like but the big pieces
are sure to be that is it unmitigated
disaster let's be honest no it's the i
think is one of the stories of the show
man I mean they're all have them their
honor that someone's doing another
google TV they're all pushing it it was
an abject failure it was an object and
everybody admits it totally but this is
never just been just more magnanimous
about the fact that you blew it yeah or
whatever the emotion i'm interested in
the reaction but but whatever being like
yeah you know we blew it doesn't mean
that somehow you've like captured some
special moment of success workforce
coming don't you what's coming about you
blew it yeah yeah more scott me not
magnanimous that's just like being
religious yeah right there forthcoming
about the fabula yeah you know what we
screwed it up that's like saying like
yeah you know I killed a guy in a
hit-and-run I I wasn't really paying
attention where I'm getting back behind
the wheel I'll get back yo the guys dead
yeah kill them and you could never take
that back yeah that's what google TV is
but but it's no different from the
android phone right i mean that the g
one was not a runaway success no but it
was it was also wasn't a huge failure
it's true right room there's a
difference between not a success and a
failure and and what we saw was the g
one was that the the uptake was slow but
people weren't like this thing blows get
it out of my face i hate it yeah true
well there are only two things about the
first google TV that we're really
terrible three right 30 for real you
know i was three it was three very
specific ones one they didn't have apps
so everything came through chrome and
all the networks block prone mmm second
their performance is bad in general
because they're on intel processors are
underpowered and third they're utterly
reliant on flash and for what about the
IR blaster well that you know that's all
bad but that's like it was it was just
bad and like homicide you're like oh
velocity no I a blaster you love I mean
you overprice bed four or five hours
reflectively talking about the IR
blaster I'm
how much you had a problem right that's
like I agree that that was a problem it
wasn't like a fatal flaw problem that
was this is clunky problem this is
revisionist history so that's also an
issue with with the review specifically
right now Google TV as a platano it's a
problem with Google TVs a platform I'm
saying like uh if you I I thought I
think our blasters are stupid i think
it's very clear but those three problems
are fatal problems for everybody flash
flash slow performance no contact and
that makes that make sure my learned
dead is that what they say they have
tried to address this wrong I'll believe
it when I see it yeah we all know that
until until and by the way I saw Walt
Mossberg earlier tonight and we were
talking about smart TVs mm-hm and he was
saying basically the same thing that we
were saying Walt wasn't talking about
remotes he was talking about search and
discovery he was talking about the the
fire blasters he was talking about our
know he was saying he was saying any of
the problem is the content you can't get
the content from the people who make it
to the user because there's a bunch of
bottlenecks in between it yeah and
that's an unchanged google TV or no get
out of my face we can have this entire
yeah we all right we gotta wrap up one
more piece to do that's actually think
guesses please ultraviolet and i think
this is great movie I think really
underrated you know the generator
ultraviolet a lot of great Ronnie effect
I Josiah is actually a bottle necked
week it's a bottle each week but I'm
telling you describe it ultraviolet is
it's a centralized drm system Hollywood
like basically decided they're all gonna
use the same dr any way they want all
the retailers to use the same year so
like Bob's Bob's digital video store
I'll not Bob's you buy from walmart and
you know why i use it as i walk into a
physical store and then put a flash
drive in something walk out with well
maybe actually could do that now but i
don't know that you would that standard
drm for video with a standard drm for
all video providers right instead of
amazon and apple pie around today they
announced amazon is supporting the
standard so you buy a movie from amazon
you can play it back on any device that
supports ultraviolet you buy a movie
from walmart you can play back on any
device in sports Ultravox notable and
they're doing this thing where Samsung
there
you blu-ray players you put in a DVD it
says we're authenticating the DVD we're
giving you a digital copy with
ultraviolet erm if you want to uh pres
it to HD you pay quote a nominal fee
nobody knows of that fee 55 it'll be
some else no I feel like you know if i
get if i get a player that has
ultraviolet technology yeah i can put in
one of my old DVDs yep and it'll say on
this topic you want the blu ray here you
are the HD version i'll be another 50
what ifs what if like what if i buy that
me that is like that is a columnist
right and but i'm saying their problems
thus far has been the major players of
an apple and amazon and if you don't get
apple on amazon nobody cares right
because you're not gonna run out they
got a mistake out amazon and once you
get amazon that means every other so
goes Apple I think I but every other
retailers gonna run on board is this
primarily gonna be movies or is there a
chance shows its ultraviolet mean it's
Warner Brothers means you don't eat that
solves that solves one problem which is
like could this when the movies are out
I can get them in a digital format could
this be a netflix a competitor in a way
they don't have rental yet um and they
and actually I talked to you somebody
who works who works on the what happens
if I borrow my friends DVD I think
they're just letting it go everybody has
no until they're working on I kebab are
a bunch of dollar DVDs then pay like 15
bucks and get HD versus those movies I
don't know how this is gonna worry but
yes this is my DVDs it must be one
activation per DVD right you subscribe
to netflix yeah they're doing stuff
ready doing some uh Peggy like I owe
this they're like you five dollars get
the HD version they are you want the HD
versions good between in the center of
the DVD there's like a copter code and
also also netflix dvds are like
wholesale rental DVDs or not retail DVDs
please stop countering my awesome plan
with logic I understand what I'm saying
okay we I know you want to do not that
but but we got razor Fiona oh the gaming
thing because like this cut this I'd say
why can I see it I want to talk about it
can I not saying I was in a meeting
Oh massage a job yeah usiness what is it
it's a tablet but the genetics on the
side it's a core i7 really bizarro
gaming PC that isn't a tablet form
factor and with joysticks on the side
it's a Wii U but it's a PC allegedly
designed by the oqo guys as I understand
it really yeah Wow God knows that wasn't
a total success anyone yeah yeah come on
no I'm not well the problem is razor
comes out with these insane member lies
your reservation array and ever release
him it turns out this isn't the final
design ways you may just be messing with
us haha it's my favorite messing us with
us it a really expensive high-end yeah
you are there a billionaire troll
there's some guy they didn't put a
Photoshop up on a wall of their booth
they like built the edge off their
grandpa's car like Sean running Italy
yeah Sean played war hammer on this
thing it's got a 10-inch like 1080 x 800
screen if this is it's really crazy and
and you know it's fun because it's like
you can kind of do the wii u thing hey
tell me again yeah okay because there's
been two stories or the cs that have
been completely over then we have to
wrap I know but so you can tell thing
until did a demo but this morning last
night of ultrabooks gaming directx 11
they faked the demo mmm they played a
movie instead of him playing the game
right you like drove the car with no
hands he's like it's running backs age
it's not working screw it hmm i would i
would call it the mat press jumped all
over intel for faking the demo hmm right
for faking that they couldn't do what
they said they were going to do and then
later on they're like no we just did it
because everybody lies during demos and
they showed on and shimpi who runs on in
tech they showed him the game actually
worked what it definitely worked so it's
like shocking news demos at CA CS get
faked all the others right of course
because you don't want to glitch out
while you're crazy stuff happens like
it's like--there's hikers in the fight
you're saying it's it the microsoft
keynote they try to show voice control
right and it did didn't get it right and
that that isn't indicative of every time
you do it but when you're on stage
there's a bunch of videos and weird
stuff going on right
come on great that's one like crazy fake
outrage story the type of us yes the
other one is this ridiculous Samsung
swipe it story which has been driving me
crazy God but it just didn't it's like
no it's like people are library more
like Samsung as he described yeah yeah
yeah so there is a completely unsourced
like random investors blog post saying I
got an update to my samsung smart TV
with this app called swype it it's a
competitor airplay what's called swype
it haha samsung huh also at the bottom
that he says Apple yeah here's my
prediction apples gonna buy samsung
totally everybody the mac presley runs i
mean literally people people were source
on this random dude yes strategy of
horse as if he was as if he was the most
the most senior reporter at The Wall
Street Journal yeah you know like like
look at what's happening and apples
gonna buy samsung like you know in bold
lettering at the top of a page it's a
completely insipid I saw a roni that it
could came out and corrects no company
like we call them we talked to them
they're like you know we built this
platform to run apps on samsung loves
I've been on stuff like a year yeah they
want a competition for mega TV apps it's
in Samsung's they're like we love that
they're promoting but we're not
defending it the point is it doesn't
have things that are similar to airplay
yeah every single company it's been
around for a year it's not new it's been
on samsung devices really weird yeah
there's a issue devices for their
airplay competitor doesn't issue sorry
does it issue updates on their devices
it like you know it's a tuesday night at
nine thirty we're gonna issue our
airplay competitor has an update to your
Smart TV right before I round Yeah right
before CES no they come out and say they
say you like airplay you're gonna love
swipe it but that didn't happen because
this story is amazing I've been having
all week I mean I published the story of
a sir actually actually doing a rip off
with with a circuit out yeah yeah you
know Ezra cloud is its own thing and
it's a service and it has whatever
feature that it has but they use a slide
that was clearly a direct copy or
whatever the late and so for us it was
like oh this is a funny thing like they
use the same slide we put it up it's
been one of our biggest stories and see
us because because there's this sort of
this circle circle
vultures of people who see CES as a
vacuum of Apple news and they're just
looking for reasons to hate all that one
place where or two legitimate rip off
that is that is but but some of these
I'm there's no serviceable but I'll say
we tried good i try to be critical but
but i think there's there's a lot of
people out there that don't like see us
because apples not here right and then
they hate the others of it is an apple
right begin because it's not apple and
because they're not getting their hit of
apple news they're ready to just hate on
it so no but but but and we said about
this little bit last night in I think
you know we can wrap up on this point
but there's like this real back lash of
like all the stuff is derivative and
iterative and you know it's no you're
not you know changing the game involve
lot and it's like things like
ultraviolet and the push of ultrabooks
and these kind of hybridized ultrabook
tablet things and then what Microsoft is
talking about which is which I which was
what clearly they're talking about is
tablets that are you're doing these
tablet apps on and then you doc
somewhere to become a windows pc you
know people I'm not a winning this fan
everybody knows that but I am interested
in windows hate I think it's a really I
think it's really potentially awesome
operating system if they do it the right
way if they get away from what Windows 7
feels like but but in the windows before
but but I think it's I think it's a
really unfair you know technology is
iterative I think I think it's a
difference between being a technology
enthusiast and being an apple into right
you can be a technology enthusiast and
have mostly Apple products because you
like them because that they're
delivering the best technology yeah or
you can just blindly love apple and hate
anything that's my thing I think it's
like an integrated beautiful coherent
cohesive experience is great and I love
but you know it's actually really funny
is that the most iterative come the
company is the most successful being
iterative is Apple well right but hit
out your own question but their
marketing is very different and frankly
their products are very very different
forms of execution but but the idea that
that like the only way the technology
advances is through these breakthrough
revolutionary moments of utter beauty
from Apple
is a false now it's a false idea and we
know it's a false idea we've seen as a
false idea we're sitting in the middle
of a I mean I'm not cheer I never falls
like yeah I'm not right that's a pretty
wrong i'm not writing cheerlead for any
company here but we're sitting at the
sony you know in the sony area well the
Vita's the media limited the Vita is
back here no but like something like
yeah no data is great we'll push mobile
gaming forward in an iterative way not
in a we've never seen it before way but
this will make apple work harder to make
their names like a trick is a haters
gonna hate sort of it is that their
whole commercial for this should just be
that haters gonna hate animation of a
dude watch yeah that's it San Evita and
that's the end of the commercial that's
a freebie so you can at this right we're
