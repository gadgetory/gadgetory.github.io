impressive thing that Apple announced
last week I've been reviewing it since
then and I gotta tell ya it lives up to
the hype now we should start with the
hardware because more than on any other
part of this watch the hardware is where
they really knocked it out of the park
for the very first time since basically
the original Apple watch the hardware
here has been fully redesigned there's
new sizes new screens your speakers and
of course there's new stuff inside it
but it still looks like an Apple watch
so let's really get into it so at the
series 4 there's two new sizes there's
40 millimeter and 44 millimeter this is
a 44 millimeter now before this I was
using the 42 millimeter size the bigger
size on the series 3 and it's only
subtly bigger than it was before
but it's also subtly thinner and to me
the trade-off is totally worth it you're
really not going to notice that
difference all that much and I think
that also is going to apply to people
who prefer the smaller watch before we
get too deep into this we really should
talk pricing because these watches
they're they're really not that cheap
the least expensive model is the 40
millimeter with GPS plus Wi-Fi and
that's 399 but there's a whole bunch of
add-ons you can do so let's take a look
here it's 30 bucks more for the larger
size if you want to get LTE that's
usually about 100 bucks more plus the 10
bucks a month or so your carrier's gonna
charge you if you want to get one of the
steel models that's somewhere in the
neighborhood of 200 bucks more you also
could add AppleCare on top of that you
could easily spend six seven hundred
bucks on one of these things without
even noticing it and don't even get me
started on the Hermes Bob series for
looks and basically the same as before
it's got the same laws of the shape and
the same two button layout but Apple is
really careful with the curves on these
larger size so that it's still
compatible with existing watch bands
even third-party watch bands still look
fine on these watches where things start
to look different is when the screen
turns on because the screens on these
watches are just they're just incredibly
good they're 30% bigger than the old
models and they go closer to the edge of
the watch and they make the screens on
the older generations of the Apple wash
look really
I mean Crampton the corners of the
screen are rounded so it just feels more
natural to the watch it's still OLED so
the blacks are still true black and
these screen is big and they're
beautiful and I love them moving on
there are some other changes to the
hardware you should know about so the
back is now ceramic instead of metal
it's and that's to allow wireless
signals to pass through the ceramic
getting a better reception they've moved
the microphone over here in between the
two buttons and that makes it better for
calls but the thing that actually makes
it better for calls is the louder
speaker on this side it's seriously like
SuperDuper loud on the inside there is a
faster processor of course there's
bluetooth 5.0 on the w3 wireless chip
and there's a new set of more accurate
sensors which is going to become
important later there's also this haptic
feedback when you turn the digital crown
which I thought would be gimmicky but I
actually really like it the other thing
that they've done if you get the LTE
model is there's no longer a big dumb
red dot on the digital crown that's just
a nice little subtle red ring now so
good job as for battery life well it's
stupendous I use this thing all weekend
without charging it and that included
walking around for a couple of hours
using maps making a couple calls on LTE
and also doing some workout stuff which
is not me but I did it for science and I
didn't have to charge this thing until
the end of the day on Sunday
Apple says that it gets about 18 hours
of battery life or you can do about six
hours of outdoor workout time and you
know what they totally hit that number
in fact the battery life is so good that
I wish Apple gave me an option to have
the screen just be always on all the
time so you don't have to twist your
wrist to see the time but you can't do
that you still got a twister wrist see
the time it's fine
so the newest version of watch OS is
watch on us five and honestly it's kind
of a grab bag of new features there's
support for podcasts and streaming app
amuse ik and new fitness and health
options and walkie-talkie mode and you
can open links in iMessage to webpages
and they get displayed automatically in
readability mode oh no hooray for the
web I love reading the web on my watch
now you might remember that last year's
Apple watch had some launch issues with
LTE but a petha fix was up pretty
quickly and this year I haven't had any
major problems with LTE in fact when
people have called me and I've used the
watch to take the call they didn't
believe I wasn't talking to them on the
phone and the speaker on this thing is
so loud you don't have to like hold it
up to your ear to hear people you can
just kind of hold your wrist naturally
and like actually have a conversation
that's really impressive but it still
does take the watch a minute or two to
get connected on LTE which can be a
little bit frustrating because you don't
know if it's gonna work or not and
that's most clear and most obvious with
Siri Siri is still Siri one new neat
feature is you can just raise your wrist
and start talking and see really respond
but I don't know a lot of the time
instead of a series becoming available
it just says hang on dot and I'll tap
you when I'm ready dot dot dot
and you just never really trust Siri to
work the first time that you use it now
there's also some software features that
are exclusive to the series for and that
includes new watch faces the
electrocardiogram feature and fall
detection the new watch faces are
designed to show just how big these new
Apple watch screens are and some of them
are beautiful I especially love the
water watch face which like has an
animated water and shows a clock and I
think it's great but the one that Apple
is showing off is called infograph and
it's designed to show off how many
complications they can fit on a single
screen I'm okay with a ton of
complications but the colors here are
just they're all over the place this
one's orange and this one's yellow and
this one goes from green to yellow and I
know some people are gonna like it but I
super don't oh and Apple still isn't
allowing third-party wash faces which is
kind of a bummer I'd really like to get
an information dense watch screen like
this without so many just
everywhere so the walkie-talkie feature
on the Apple watch is pretty cool to use
it both you and your friend have to
agree to be friends and you both have to
be available and the reason that exists
is the first time you talk to somebody
on the walkie-talkie mode your voice
just calls out from their watch so to do
it you hit the complication or open up
the app you tap on the name of the
person you want to talk to you and then
there's just a big yellow talk button
and you just hold your finger down on it
and you talk so you could say hey Dan
how's it going I'm calling you in walkie
talkie obviously so that's nice but the
first time you do it there's this
message that says connecting to Dan
because what walkie-talkie mode actually
is is a FaceTime call that's just
interrupted by you tapping the
push-to-talk button so Dan just replied
hey I'm doing really good we're just
demoing this on video for you I'll
probably do this a couple of times yeah
it works really well except that this is
pretty great but you have to use your
other hand to tap the thing you can't
push a button and it's also like if
you've got one of your hands full you
basically can't use this thing right
that's the other problem with it I have
a trick hang on the trick if you've got
a coffee in your hand is a new thing
that I'm calling nose calling where the
thing is Dan you can use your nose it
totally works
the health and fitness side of watch OS
5 is in a lot of ways a lot more
interesting because Apple is separating
out the ideas of fitness and health so
on the fitness side the new features are
you can do these like workout
competitions with your friends over the
course of a week and it will also do
automatic workout detection in case you
forget to open up the little app and hit
start or a head workout on the health
side of the equation it's doing a bunch
of interesting stuff so it can now
detect low heart rates for example and
later this year it's going to be able to
detect irregular heart rates too it can
also do fall detection which is a really
interesting feature and I think it's
really gonna benefit a lot of people it
can automatically detect with these new
sensors whether or not you've had a hard
fall and if it thinks you've fallen and
hurt yourself it will offer to call
emergency services and if you don't
respond within a minute or something it
will just go ahead and call those
services and also text your emergency
contacts to let them know that something
might be wrong I have been trying to
manually trigger the fall detection by
curling myself onto the bed or the couch
and it hasn't worked yet I don't know
maybe the watch can tell that I'm acting
I do think it's a great feature I just
can't tell you whether or not it super
works the headline-grabbing feature of
the series 4 is the new
electrocardiogram feature so it's got
sensors on the bottom also on the
digital crown you hold it down and takes
a reading and then you can send a PDF to
your doctor unfortunately they haven't
turned that on yet so I can't test it
and tell you what you're not
when Apple introduced the very first
Apple watch it was it was kind of a mess
it was trying to do way too much and
both the software and the hardware just
couldn't live up to what they're trying
to do with it and on top of that Apple
really didn't know what the watches
purpose was but since then they've
really figured it out and this year they
focused on making everything better it
has a better screen it has better speed
it has better fitness features and most
of all it has better health features now
there are still some things I'd like to
see improved I wish there were more
watch space options and series still
kind of unreliable and you know these
things are still pretty expensive
especially given how quickly Apple's
iterating them it makes deciding whether
or not to upgrade are really hard call
but if you have an older Apple watch I
think you're gonna be blown away by this
year's updates heck it makes me feel bad
that about the series 3 last year
because this one is so much better
bottom line if you've been waiting to
buy or upgrade an Apple watch now's a
really good time to get one you know
what I mean
there are a lot of complications when it
comes to buying an Apple watch and
people are watching to see what we think
of it look I'm kind of expensive if
people just need to know the time time
is money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
