Samsung's tablet division but this year
at Mobile World Congress it's doing all
tablets and it's going pretty big with
them it's actually announcing three new
tablet models it's got the new tab s3
which runs Android and then it's got two
new Windows tablet models they're called
the galaxy book line there's a galaxy
book ten and a galaxy book 12 now the
tab s3 is a successor to the tab s2 from
a couple of years ago it's very similar
in size and appearance 9.7 inch display
Super AMOLED actually supports HDR this
time around it's really thin metal frame
what is new here is the new glass back
so it's similar to Samsung's Galaxy
smartphones and glass and it's you know
kind of fingerprint tea as you probably
expect inside it's got a Snapdragon 820
processor kind of all modern specs and
guts it runs Android 7.0 it supports
multi-window multitasking are there
hardware features four speakers one two
three four and this year it supports an
S Pen now it comes with the s-pen but
the S Pen doesn't actually go inside of
it but it still supports all the S Pen
features you might expect you can take
notes to screenshots capture gifts a lot
of things at the note 7 debuted before
it is Sapir the other thing that you can
do with the tab s3 this year is get a
new keyboard case and it connects my
these pogo pins on the bottom snap it on
and then you got your keyboard keyboard
itself is plastic it's got a nice key
travel it's actually pretty decent to
type on so that's a tab s3 the galaxy
book series which run Windows 10
like I said comes in two sizes you got
the galaxy book 10 and the galaxy book
12 12 is probably the more interesting
one obviously got the larger screen
sports HDR it's a Super AMOLED display
it is powered by a Intel 7th generation
Core i5 fanless processor so it's got a
lot of power still has the four speaker
feature and still comes with an S Pen
and it actually supports the same S Pen
features as the Android model now the
Windows versions come with a keyboard
case it's not an additional option it's
packed right in there and it's a larger
keyboard and it's got a larger trackpad
than on
have Pro s which came out last year
typing on these is actually pretty nice
the key travels about 1.5 millimeters
which is similar to what you get on a
laptop so there's really no difference
there you can adjust the screen a few
different orientations to get the angle
right such a really surprisingly nice
typing experience on the go it connected
value vote the same pogo pins as the
Android model so it's really similar in
that respect and the device itself is
pretty snappy
you know it's able to run all the
windows apps fold this desktop apps
Samsung's that you can even run
Photoshop on it without problems so
we'll have to see how well it does when
we test it but so far in our initial
impressions these devices are pretty
impressive and pretty cool now what
Samsung isn't saying is anything about
price or availability so we're gonna
have to hang tight for that and we'll be
spending more time with these in the
future we'll have plenty more to share
we're at MWC in Barcelona Spain this
week so we've got all this coverage on
tablets and phones and everything else
being announced so be sure you subscribe
