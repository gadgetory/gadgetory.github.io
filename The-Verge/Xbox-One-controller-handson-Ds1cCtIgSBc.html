got some hands-on time with the
prototype for the new Xbox one
controller now the big change here is
that they have improved the two triggers
they actually have got force feedback
they got little vibrating motors on each
trigger so when you're playing the game
and you like shooting a gun the feedback
has just done that it's just on your
right finger or left finger whatever is
appropriate they have moved the battery
inside the box itself so that it doesn't
it's not this big ugly hump at the
bottom and they've also added a new
Kinect multi connector on the bottom so
it doesn't plug it over USB anymore but
you can still add maybe one of those
little chat keyboards if you'd like to
otherwise it feels pretty much like an
Xbox controller your X ABY buttons are
still in basically the same spot they
have added a little bit of texture to
the thumbsticks and they say they've
improved the d-pad radically but of
course until we get to play actual games
with it we won't know for sure what it's
like we got to try a few different demos
on a earlier prototype on a PC we got to
fly a little helicopter and like feel
the brakes on a car and the feedback on
your fingers is actually really strong
in addition to the standard Rumble that
you get a controller you can really tell
if it's coming on the whole controller
or just on your fingers so that's it
that's the new controller for the Xbox
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
