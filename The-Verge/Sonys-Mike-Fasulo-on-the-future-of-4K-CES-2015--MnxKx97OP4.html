verge here at CES and i'm sitting down
with the president and coo of sony
electronics mike Fasulo mike thanks for
joining us this morning my players Brian
great to be here thank so much so you
have your press conference yesterday I
interests a lot of cool products
including the new Walkman which our
readers are going insane for it is
gorgeous it plays high resolution audio
and also cost twelve hundred dollars how
are you get people you know to buy into
that it's like a beautiful device but
it's expensive it's obviously our
pinnacle device I mean it's you know
stainless steel although components are
crafted particularly to optimize audio
so you know it is the pinnacle piece of
the listening experience on the go but
we've got the most broadest lineup of
high res audio in the industry and I
introduced quite a few products last
night in high res over so the key is
we're delivering better sound or all
applications of consumer use right you
think consumers are ready for that
because you're Rick we've been in an era
where it's like mp3s and people don't
kind of don't care I think they're ready
for it I think they're confused by you
know what does it mean you know the
industry oh good good news is i
announced last night that consumer
electronics association will adopt with
its members the high res audio logo
which was part of sony's founded right
now so they'll adopt that across the
industry at least Im consumers to see an
indicator on products and no this is
high res audio or not what we really
need to do is educate folks on why iris
why do I even care and it's you know
music is such a lifelong passion that
folks now you know they have large
libraries but they're interested in
better quality sound and now we can
deliver to the met affordable prices
that you know different applications on
the go in the home wireless multi-room
etcetera yeah with some beautiful
devices and I'm and also in the visual
front you had some insanely thin TVs
yesterday that were that were beautiful
and also some interesting content deals
you mentioned that Netflix is going to
be you know streaming on HDR high
dynamic range a 4k content to sony tvs
and 2015 you talk a little bit about
that partnership yeah so I mean last
year I and I think on the verge I
actually discussed this last year
we announced with with Netflix the
launch of streaming 4k we were the
world's largest delivery of 4k content
and Netflix partnered with us very
closely so we're expanding that we're
you know we're still going to build upon
the library and content delivery but the
two other areas that we're now moving
towards is taking the pain point away
from the consumer on how they receive
the content being strained right so you
know looking at bit rates of each home
you know is getting a different
broadband speeds and looking at
resolution coming in and making that
seamless to the consumer so that you
know when they click on there one-click
sony remote and hit Netflix that what
appears on the screen is living up to
their expectation in high quality so
that partnership is really working out
well our engineers and their engineers
are working hand-in-hand and we're
really excited sure yeah high dynamic
range is one of those things I first saw
true a HDR content you know last year's
CES and manufacturers are showing it off
and it's probably the biggest you know
most visceral jump in quality most
arresting changed since the jump to HD
do you think that's going to go and let
you know Sony's TVs with 4k with HDR
give me that push that's going to kind
of you'll get 4k into the mainstream I
would tell you 4k is in the mainstream
now much pleasant surprise we haven't
seen an acceleration of an adoption of a
new technology or even a TV platform
like we're seeing in 4k
I can't remember since when clearly
faster adoption than HD was and this
year you know usually I get asked the
question on estimation of how many units
no one can estimate because consumers
are buying in such high demand and I
think it's because i always say seeing
is believing so i think when customers
go and get a demonstration and they
actually see the difference in the
picture quality in the skin tones I mean
lifelike skin tones read your true reds
blues or true blues and you know this
leads to high dynamic range and with our
new products that I announced last
evening the x 900 city which frankly is
thinner than our smartphone xperia smart
right it's point2 i guess its inch right
because it's less than X 0 0 point 2
inch but it's got a processor in it that
we call the x1 what the x1 does is it
improves the picture quality of any
source coming in but it also looks at
the colors we also have a technology and
consumers I don't want them to care
about technology right I'm care about
what is it do for me so when you're
looking at a color palette you know it's
very difficult in a TV to attract red
green and blue equally all right you I
like one and another one diminishes but
with our X 1 processor in our true
luminous technology we can actually look
at trueness of color regardless of which
is coming at red green blue or any
variation of its really remarkable and
you can see you and I can see the
difference and I always encourage
consumers to go out and get a
demonstration yeah if the demos have
always been wonderful but I think for
people make it to their home obviously
about what they can actually watch at
home I think there were four stripping
partners you mentioned yesterday on
stage one was YouTube one with Sony's on
the other two were Amazon and Netflix is
that enough content like how much it's
it's taking a while obviously netflix
ruled out Breaking Bad which is like a
you know so many pictures you know
television program Sony's you know
working behind I assume to help like you
know put more 4k master content out
there is that enough do we need you need
more providers out there that are
offering 4k content UTVs I don't know if
it's ever enough you know but this
choice so you know today anything you
put on a sony 4k Ultra HD is going to
look better anything any broadcast
stream played back the best its download
right so if you buy our server and
downloaded comment content that's going
to be the best picture quality in native
4k short but anything is going to
upscale to a better picture then without
working so there's no reason to wait the
product automatically today make sure
your signal makes your screen that
screen better the industry is rally this
is this is going back to the adoption
you know with HD we didn't
adoption across all industries at the
same time you know it was kind of
chicken n da right you know content side
well there's not enough of hardware
install hardware side now sign up of
content with all verticals now moving in
4k and ultra high-definition from the
studio's from producers from the content
companies from new distribution
platforms whether it's streaming or
otherwise and clearly the manufacturers
so you're going to just see that
perpetuated you can see more and more
content coming more and more capability
but like I said any content
high-definition blu-ray terrestrial
looked better on a sony 4k television
yeah how does HDR fit into that because
that's I mean this there's certain
standards that they're still being
worked and obviously but you know
companies are basically things you can
master than that connects being created
a netflix is obviously going to be
showing it off you know are you ready
they're going to see a difference
between you know true HD our content and
there's regular 4k content when they're
seen on their CVS well i don't know if i
make the comparison to regular porque
and shoe HDR because what we try to do
is present it to the consumer in the
intention of the filmmaker in the
Creator whether it's a filmmaker or
creator right and different producers
directors creators have different you
know filmmakers like film but film has a
grain to it you know naturally has a
grand tour so you know to just we want
to be able to display that like the
filmmaker intended I you know some
consumers may say well there's a grain
in it well that was because the
filmmaker intended there to be for
anyone so what we try to do is the
the most natural picture quality that
was intended by whatever the customers
watching internet content you know like
i said filmmaker content so skin tones
are one of the most difficult things to
portray naturally on a screen and if you
look at our skin tones if you look at
our life light color palette I don't
think you'll find I know you won't find
anything better touch it and the
expecting other of your streaming
partners to adopt HDR in the year ahead
or is this can be netflix for 2015 I
would I would anticipate more I mean
specifically I can't tell you who but I
would anticipate with Sigma right and
how many titles you expect to see from
netflix this year we're not disclosing
that as as a good but we'll have some
time it'll be fun yeah well Breaking Bad
be involved I just asked because it's a
favorite show it was obviously like I
said it's a sony pictures television
show was one of the first shows on
netflix in 4k is that is that going to
be around the corner we both enjoy
breaking bad netflix and summers fair
enough fair enough one other question
was asked on the TV front android TV is
a big part obviously the TVs are running
a droid TV sony said a history of google
TV that may didn't work out so great
ahead of its time certainly but was
there any trepidation beforehand you're
like oh I'd move down this road it's not
so great or you just you know what was
it was no trepidation at all what the
good news with Google TV was with Sony
and Google able to learn from a consumer
application of what really matters and I
think the new venture that we're
entering into together is working like
Netflix hand in
Engineers with engineers on the consumer
experience you know what matters to the
consumer and what I loved about last
evenings I love a lot of things about
last evenings announcements but we were
able to show across multiple categories
across multiple screens across multiple
consumer products moberly as well as in
the home simplicity and better quality
with the Android level all right well
there's in your smartphone your
SmartWatch on your television now it's
it's seamless which no one else has done
so with google and android platform and
sony we're delivering more convenience
and obviously better fall right yeah i
got to say i love the google cast
integration and i love the remote the
remote is your straight up badly it's
awesome rotas attempt bar yeah I like it
a lot Billy nice well cool well this is
a lot of exciting products thanks so
much for taking the time really
appreciate it I'm gonna go look at some
really awesome and super thin TVs right
now but thanks for joining us guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
