this thing this is the new pixel slate
it's not quite the first Chrome OS
tablet ever but it is the first one that
signals Google is really trying to make
Chrome OS it's big screen computing
platform over the future it's a tablet
that runs the full desktop Chrome web
browser web apps and Android apps it can
cost as little as six hundred bucks but
the one that I'm testing right here
costs a thousand plus 200 bucks for this
keyboard right here this thing is weird
it's somewhere between a tablet and a
laptop and it's not great and either it
feels like an experiment in the future
of computing but not the actual future
so in a lot of ways I do kind of love it
but sometimes I really hate it let's
just get into the hardware the pixel
slate has a twelve point three inch
three thousand by two thousand screen
that Google calls a molecular display
but it pretty much just looks like any
other LCD to me it's good it has some
fairly sizable bezels partly because
there are two front-facing speakers that
sound great on the front of it it is
blue and it picks up fingerprints really
easily but overall it's pretty nice in
terms of quality you can login with your
fingerprint right there on the power
button there are a couple of cameras
that do camera things pretty well
there's no headphone jack and there are
two USB C ports and I'll get to those
USB C ports in a minute don't you fret
anyway as tablets go it's big but it's
still manageable it's sort of like that
twelve point nine inch iPad pro but
unlike that iPad pro this has an Intel
chip inside it and that's where things
start to get weird Google decided to
offer four different processor options
and three different RAM options in five
different price points so picking out a
pixel slate is complicated you can spend
as little as $5.99 but it won't do much
more than open up a few tabs and run the
Netflix app or you can kid it out with
the max specs and a keyboard and a pen
and spend $2,000 I think the only one
really worth considering is the core i5
model that I'm using right here but I
think that because I know how chrome OS
works and I know that I want to do more
than just use it as a basic tablet
and that's the thing you need to know a
lot about what you want out of Chrome OS
just to figure out which one to buy in
fact you need to know a lot about Chrome
OS to get the most out of the pixel
sleep no matter which one you buy so
let's talk about Chrome OS and more
specifically let's talk about how it
works on this hybrid pixel slate when
you have the keyboard attached it works
just like any other Chromebook you've
got a mouse and resizable windows you
can open up chrome tabs and chrome
windows and web apps and Android apps
that move them around the whole works
it's all really familiar right on down
to Android apps working but still
feeling just a little bit different than
the rest of the OS I gotta say though I
don't love this folio keyboard much it's
not the rounded keys they're fine
they're quiet in their backlit and
they're it's pretty nice and it's great
that you can use it in almost any angle
thanks to this really neat magnet trick
that puts it up at just the right spot
but the keyboard deck is connected by
this floppy flap and it flexes so much
that you can actually click the trackpad
by accidentally resting your palms on
what's on your lap just like it flexes
no good bridge makes a Bluetooth
keyboard specifically for the pixel
slate that's way better and it's $40
cheaper anyway when you detach the
keyboard or when you flip it under like
this it goes into tablet mode all your
windows go fullscreen but you can do
some split screen by dragging down from
the top and then over to the right and
there are some neat touches here I
really love that if you want you can
have this little thumb swipe keyboard
over on the right instead of having the
full screen keyboard taking up half the
screen it's kind of neat but the thing
is in tablet mode the animation feels
really kind of janky it's an elegant and
it's pretty stuttery and performance
overall is a mixed bag it's not bad most
of the time I can have like 20 tabs and
a few apps going at the same time so
that's good but sometimes you get really
bad lag where I feel like I shouldn't so
for example in the Google keep app
sometimes I pen with it it's totally
fine other times it lags really bad and
other times things are just kind of
unstable there are bugs the first review
unit that Google sent me straight up
crashed into a boot loop and it had to
be replaced the second one luckily
hasn't had that issue but I've still had
problems with bluetooth disconnecting
and since there's no headphone jack
that's kind of just a killer
now let's say you trust Google to fix
all those bugs there is a new version of
Chrome OS out every six weeks after all
that brings us to the next question
really the most important question can
you make this your main computer it's
the same question we asked about the
iPad pro I don't know if you notice but
I started this video with the exact same
line that Neal I used in his iPad pro
video because in a lot of ways these
devices are trying to do similar things
but from different directions either you
have to completely understand the
limitations of iOS so well that you can
make use of these little hacks all over
the place to get things done or you just
deal with it and accept the fact you
have to go back to a real computer from
time to time because it's just easier
yeah it's the same thing with the pixel
slave but for different reasons most
people should not make this their main
computer but Chrome OS experts could
there are a million examples like a site
here so I'm just going to pick one and
yeah it's finally time to talk about
those u.s. PC ports so let's just plug
some stuff in check check check
so the pixel slate isn't restricted like
the iPad pro there's a real file browser
that sees drives and if you plug a
microphone in it'll work and any app can
theoretically see whatever you plug in
it's not really limited by the OS
instead it's limited by the apps that
you can get on it so for example when I
plug in an SD card it just pops up the
files app so far so good but the Adobe
Lightroom Android app was designed to
work with phones and doesn't work with
Chrome OS as file browser so you have to
in just the photos into the file app
then go looking for them in Lightroom
and then go back and delete them in the
files app oh look I don't want to just
pick on Adobe here because this Android
app weirdness is kind of all over it's
nice that you have access to the full
Google Play library of Android apps but
most of the stuff you're really gonna
want to use instead of web apps are
stuff like video streaming apps and
games I mean I don't know Spotify just
looks silly here for example it's just
like a tacked on phone app the trade-off
though is you get a real desktop class
web browser you can't get that on an
iPad so I am able to get more work done
on this than I can on an iPad pro based
on my particular needs just the thing is
I got to admit this is way less fun to
use so look I've been hard on this pixel
slate but I think it's time to start
expecting more from Chromebooks this
thing is in the same price range as the
iPad pro the Microsoft Surface and tons
of high-end Windows and Mac laptops I
honestly think the only people who
should buy this are Chrome OS diehards
and you know what even for them I don't
think this makes sense Oh last year's
pixel book is still right there and it's
getting discounted all the time sure
it's last year's processor and you can't
attach the keyboard but otherwise it's
basically the same thing and it weighs a
quarter pound less than this tablet with
the keyboard attached I still love my
pixel book and I'm sticking with it now
the pixel slate has a lot going for it
but I think it's just too experimental
the bummer of it all is I really do like
what Google is trying to do here I just
wish it was less trying
and more doing hey thanks so much for
watching and let me know in the comments
what would it take for you to consider a
full chrome OS tablet I'm really curious
and you know I'm obsessed with these new
kinds of computers and a video that's a
good introduction to what I think about
them is the very first processor episode
where I try to answer the question
what's a computer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
