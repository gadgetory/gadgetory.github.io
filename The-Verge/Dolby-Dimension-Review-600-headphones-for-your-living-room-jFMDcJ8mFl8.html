product the new 599 dollar Dolby
dimension headphones now these are
high-end wireless headphones but they're
a little different than the wireless
headphones you're probably familiar with
see instead of being designed to be worn
on the go when you're commuting or maybe
on a plane these wireless headphones are
meant to be used in your home so kind of
like those old headphones your
grandparents might have had plugged into
their TV so they can listen to their
shows as loud as they want without
disturbing everyone in the house but
these are new modern headphones so they
have a bunch of new tricks that make
them a bit more interesting than those
old headphones now for starters the
dimension use bluetooth to connect to
your devices and you could save up to
eight pairings at a time you can also
program three devices to the buttons on
the side of the right ear cup to quickly
switch between them I've got this one
programmed to my phone this one to my
tablet and this one to my computer here
and since these are Adobe products the
dimensions have lots of audio processing
and enhancement features the company
says if you listen to content that's
been created and mixed for Atmos you'll
get the best sound for you can over
Bluetooth when you're wearing these
headphones
and they sound really good they have a
wide presence and a broad soundstage and
really crisp details now Adobe won't say
that they are tuned for any specific
activity but it's clear from my testing
that these are really meant to be worn
when you're watching a movie with lots
of sound effects and things going on
they don't necessarily sound bad for
music it's just a little less impressive
than when you're using them as a home
theater and then they also have a new
feature that's meant to make them easier
to use when you're wearing them in a
home with other people now many over ear
wireless headphones have active noise
cancellation features which use
microphones on the outside of the ear
cup to cancel out noises and cocoon you
in silence that's why everyone loves to
wear them on airplanes but the
dimensions do the opposite they use
microphones on the ear cup to mix in the
sounds of your environment with whatever
audio you're playing in the headphones
that means you can still hear someone
talks to you or baby cries or the
doorbell rings when you're wearing these
it's almost like an inverted noise
cancellation feature and the company
calls this life mix and you can adjust
the levels of the mix with the mobile
app if you want to completely block out
all external sound and then use them as
noise cancelling headphones you can do
that or you can crank up the outside
audio so you hear more of that than
whatever you're listening to so to test
this we're using these binaural
microphones I'm gonna put the headphones
on them here they're gonna play music
through the headphones and I'm gonna
play something on my laptop and I'll use
the app here to adjust the mix and see
how it sounds different let's fire up
something from the headphone
-
now the idea here is that if you're at
home and your partner wants to watch
something on TV and you want to watch
something different on your tablet you
can both be in the same room together
enjoying each other's own content yet
still be able to have a conversation
without having a razor voice or take
your headphones off
or maybe it's late at night and you're
watching a movie on your big flat panel
TV and you don't want to wake the kids
the dimensions let you watch the movie
without having to use closed captions
and still be able to hear someone gets
out of bed when they're not supposed to
there's some other neat things too like
a head tracking feature that will
automatically position the sound source
right in front of you and keep it there
whenever you turn your head just like if
you were listening to a real speaker so
to test the head tracking feature I've
got them back on these binaural
microphones I'm gonna play some music
and then I'm just going to turn the
microphones to see that you can hear any
difference
as for headphone features these are
high-end it got metal frames buttery
soft faux leather covers and these
really plush ear cups and a padded
headband for comfort for my head they're
really comfortable to wear even if I'm
binging an entire Netflix show for ten
hours straight
Dolby says that they will last up to ten
hours with all of the head tracking and
sound enhancement features enabled or up
to 16 hours if you turn those features
off they come with this neat little
magnetic dock that charges them up so
they're ready to go whenever you pick
them up or you can use a standard
microUSB cable if you don't have that
handy the dimensions also have most
other wireless headphone things they've
got swipe controls for volume and
playback on the earcup support for calls
when they're connected to your phone and
the ability to launch Siri or Google
assistant with a long press but what
you'll notice is they don't fold up
conveniently and they don't have a 3.5
millimeter headphone cable so you can't
use them within flight entertainment and
they really aren't great for travel or
on the go they're really designed to be
worn and used in your home and for me
that's a little strange
I wear headphones all the time on my
commute or at the office when I'm at
home I almost never wear them because
it's more comfortable to listen to
things in my son√≠s or from my TV sound
bar plus when I have headphones on I'm
isolated from the rest of my family
which feels a bit rude the dimensions do
alleviate this somewhat instead of being
completely isolated I could still hear
if my kids asked me something or my
spouse talks to me but there's still
headphones and there's social norms in
place that say when I have headphones on
I'm probably not listening to you the
dimensions don't quite overcome that
even if I can hear everything my wife is
saying when I wear them now I do think
that they are useful for parents of
young children that don't want to watch
TV or movies through closed captions but
still want to be able to hear if the
baby is crying or someone gets up if
that's you then you'll probably love
these things but I'm more interested in
where Dolby takes us next maybe in a
more portable pair that can travel with
me easier and go to places that I
actually do wear headphones all the time
maybe then I'll be interested in
spending 600 bucks thanks for watching
these are kind of like a new different
thing and I'm curious is this something
that you would buy would you buy
headphones and you really can't use
outside of the house
