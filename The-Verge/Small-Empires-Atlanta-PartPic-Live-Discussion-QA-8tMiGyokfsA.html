be here yeah take it away part pick
folks jewel you go okay I was like I
wish direction okay I'm jewel I am the
co-founder and CEO of park pick and i

big and I'm probably the second most
excited I'll give that to do I get
personal cool so so pretty tuning in uh
hopefully you caught the episode this
morning if you'll enough and we wanted
to take some time just to kind of chat
about part pick and field some questions
so if anybody has questions out there
use the hashtag small empires on Twitter
and we'll try to get to them that later
oh and we are supposed to have Alexis
Ohanian here today just want to just
want to point that out but he is in
Japan and it's four in the morning in
the middle of the morning oh maybe the
last sake train is running a little late
alright so first order of business how
do we find part fixed even you found
perfect how did this happen how do we
locate these fine folks okay I I wanted
to tell the story just cuz like it was
kind of important to me as we were
trying to put the season together and
you know starting to look at like what
kind of companies we were going to be
featuring I got to go out to TechCrunch
Disrupt in San Francisco this past
September and the lovely heart pick team
was presenting on the first day you guys
are on the first day right yes we were
anywhere if we had to wait I remember
yeah so walk us through what that's like
the the whole like presentation at
TechCrunch you I'm like I've seen the
Silicon Valley HBO TV show and I see how
like nervous all those guys got before
is it like that at all yes well okay so
i watch the show too and there's no one
like fighting on stage I remember that
part of the episode where there's a
fight but some of that happened which is
great but but it was very nerve-racking
I was very very nervous I'm like palm
sweaty and I've done a lot of
presentations before but I just feel
like the energy was really different
there is like high pressure you know
Marissa Myers on stage like it's just
really scary so she was one of the
judges for you guys yes yeah well it's
comes with the final stretches but still
she's a person I've always just admired
so and I've heard stories about so I was
just like oh my god that is so scary um
but I have a little like I don't want a
ritual but sort of like thing I do to
bring down the nerves before I go on
stage and actually as a team like me you
know said a prayer everyone's just like
this is going to be okay we're going to
do this we're going to kill it and I
think we did pretty well so it works out
so I sitting in the audience like I got
watching these guys and they came out
and you did like a like a presentation
and then you actually get like the demo
part of it right so you had your
technical team come out and they had
like a little like overhead projector
kind of thing that was showing what you
could do with the app and I just
remember the whole time I was like wow
this is like it's a really different
industry that you guys are attacking you
obviously have an incredible team and
you're based in Atlanta and at that
point we knew we were going to be like
going to like outside the Silicon Valley
and so when I heard Atlanta I was like
okay done uh you know let's talk guys
yeah that's I mean I think probably were
the most different you can be I mean
we're outside of Silicon Valley we're
working on a very unsexy industry um
we're doing a height we're mainly have a
very high tech solution I mean there's a
lot of high-tech companies at that
crunch but we're doing solving the
problem using really really difficult
technology so oh yeah i'm glad that
those things so that's you yeah and so
like what what what else happened after
an event like that like what does it
mean for a young company like you guys
to be able to get on stage somewhere
like that and to be able to show off
Jason would say that yeah sure the just
as joe said the energy techCrunch's
references nominal and you know for us
it was our introduction to Silicon
Valley we have had never really spoken
to any investors in Silicon Valley this
is a super you know large stage for us
and so it was so busy but it was for us
it was like okay we're here and now all
we have to do is to do our part you know
the the platform is there and so as far
as like know what happens happen
afterwards um it was pretty much
figuring out a way to address all of the
interests from you know investors just
techies in general people that are just
interested about the technology people
that
that scene is in doing sarna valley and
just wanted to add more questions so we
spend a lot of time just about dividing
and conquering and making sure that we
could talk to as many people as possible
awesome and so it was what's response
been like you know I mean after all this
after you know the episode went up today
but has anything changed drastically
since you know you guys were on stage
there and and now that we're talking
here yeah so I'll say you know I think
we had certain expectations about what
would happen after TechCrunch um and
honestly it hasn't been on ok so let's
take a step back it's only been like a
little bit over a month since TechCrunch
so you know things are happening but in
my mind and like always want things that
happen faster so we haven't like you
have enough thoroughly closing the
investors since TechCrunch we've had a
lot of really great meeting so we're
still kind of I don't know we're still
kind of waiting for something to drop um
so you know that's one thing where I was
just like oh we don't say just
TechCrunch and we do really well then
all their problems are going to be
solved and that's really not how it's
been um but it has been pretty full on
the customer side I mean we've had a
really steady flow of requests on our
website or our reach from companies so
that's been cool um but we really didn't
we never really had a problem with
customer interest so it still leaves us
in the same sort of predicament where we
have all these potential customers are
now even more and we don't really have
the resources to support them and people
are our life will want you just get them
to pay you and the answer that is well
yeah we will get them to pay us
eventually but it's their large
corporation they're not going to pay us
to build our team I'm you know they're
not going to pay us you get the pieces
in place to support them so that's
called kick starter yeah yeah I can't
start this right exactly so you know
that's where we kind of still need seed
funding to be able to get all the pieces
in place so that we can actually go and
watch with these
big corporations yeah i will add to that
that you know it's just it was really
like inspiring to see how many people
who reached out to us afterwards because
we didn't we didn't go and edit them we
didn't go call or anything like that we
sort of waited and you know every day by
day more and more people you know
reached out and call this and you know
it really speaks to you know how I'm how
well we can serve the industry because
people are eating for it but look a
while Alexis disappeared I guess Sarah
for the last was not a sleep i'll just
caught up in a board meeting I was like
and draw on your face with this yeah too
much sake look at it um well Cuba option
for everyone for everyone watching this
is alexis ohanian he is a co-creative
reddit and a bunch of other cool things
and the show's host um so Alexis how are
things how is Japan it's going really
well yeah having a wonderful time here
Ohio good morning to all if you actually
know where you have we're 20 here but uh
I guess it's I guess it's can eat you
are over yeah yeah uh so we were though
I'm all of his assessing guitar I was
gonna say like early stages of
fundraising kind of stuff and I like I
think I want to take this this time with
like the lab tested to get into more a
little bit more like technical stuff
that we don't get to get into into the
episode um so what what advice do you
guys have for for people that are
watching this episode and they're like
all right this is what I needed to
finally get everything together and like
start working all nights to put together
my company and they're just gonna get
they're gonna start approaching that
seed round what are the things to be
careful of like with term sheets maybe
what is a term sheet and yeah how do you
know what to look out for Wow so um a
term sheet is basically
document that sets out the the terms of
the deal so you know if you're going to
be giving a piece of your company in a
way to an investor or if you're going to
do a convertible notes which are just
two different ways to structure your
financing round those the sheet is
basically just details all the illegal
legalities of it so what's owed to you
at what point and those types of things
so at this point you know we are still
we're really instant of term sheets so
we've gotten a few we haven't liked a
few you know we've had people not be
able to still fulfill things that were
put into term sheets so you know we've
kind of seen the ins and outs in our
case so far it hasn't been the greatest
things that we've experienced as a voice
of term sheets but that's part of it and
the great thing is that we've had a
really amazing legal team that's helped
us from the time that we were in an
accelerator up until now and they send
everything to them so the one thing I
would say is like a piece of advice is
don't sign things that you don't and you
don't know what they mean I'm definitely
yeah yes I know of people just are like
oh yeah term sheet done a little through
that that contract that you gotta sign
when you came on the show yeah that
wasn't that wasn't a talent released our
church Alex media now owns card pic team
that fully already reviewed it we're
good don't try to trick me anyway I just
saying that I think people should make
sure that they're reading with um you
know what they're getting and then also
like having some ideas what are you not
going to say yes to I mean because I Lee
got some term sheets early and it's just
like now we're not going to give you
five percent of our company for like no
money or um you know for your guidance
no thanks um so you know those are some
things so let's to look out for people
will ask all you know they'll ask for it
a lot of stuff if you of you if you're
not confident and you don't know what
sort of what year your company is worth
or what you
to put on the table people will they'll
they'll push the limits so as you'll say
it is really important to have that that
foundation and no you know what you're
willing to negotiate on sit down at the
table and the last thing I thing on that
is just like knowing what you don't know
so I mean in my case I have a business
background but I never negotiate a new
term sheet before so it's really taken
of reaching out to people getting advice
and seeing okay what do you think about
this is this industry standard or no um
for all so um so that's kind of how I we
we worked it so far and one of the
things that a flower and I think it
makes it look nice thank you one of the
things that we've done that Y Combinator
is uh we've open sourced some safe
documents which it's kind of a remix of
the convertible note which is like which
was a clever hack to make it as easy as
possible to fundraise and saves are
slightly more elegant solution for this
but it's tricky Greg because like early
stage companies don't they it is really
hard to value them and the advantage of
using things like convertible debt or a
safe is that you get to basically put
off valuing them at all late around when
people can have a sort of better sense
of what they're all worth but even with
this added simplicity these things
didn't even exist nine years ago and
Steve and I were starting reddit or
having they existed they just weren't
common practice what is what this world
is moving towards now is one with I
think more transparency and more founder
friendliness although there still a ways
to go one of things I'd love to see is
for if anyone wants to go out there and
do this an anonymized place to upload
term sheets where you have to obviously
be you know pretty confident they were
going to stay that way weariness you
could do a little bit the self-censor
but basically see what is market alright
because right now its founders we kind
of have to go around and we have
inefficient knowledge to know what's
market here what's market there what's
markets it's the advantage of networks
that allow you to realize okay now
terms are ridiculous or are having that
lawyer to talk to says that's ridiculous
but if we actually knew in aggregate
what really is market you could then go
to an investor and be like please like I
actually know this is not standard
because here's a thousand deals just got
done last year that don't have this so
some enterprising founder can work on
this now yeah I really actually that's a
great idea because even for us in it
land art do it wyd share just for the
record is that slideshare yeah we're
like what if people had points here
nowadays nah nah man you need what you
you basically need to be able to extract
the very specific deal terms across the
board just to know like what what is a
normal you know what what is normal
right now for a typical kind of company
what sorry I was just going to shout out
to um I don't know if you guys saw what
buffer put out I think it looks like
yesterday or the day before um but
basically they're they're raising I
think they're raising my 3.5 million
dollars and they literally wrote out
every single reason why and the term
sheet and they put it on their website
and I we're be interesting just to see
first of all but they're being so
transparent I don't know what I don't
necessarily know like the motives or
everything but they put its whole dick
right up right up about it so maybe
that'll be a thing the kind of shift the
chasm if you will around transparency
and fundraising and I thought it was
just a really interesting little tip
yeah they're also they're also raising
its tasty Wow the mission they share
share everyone's costs know the revit
this is really interesting yeah yeah I
mean you can become an investor as well
hey Sam Kim can we put a link to that I
think it's an interesting article to
read I mean I guess part of the eye that
well we'll figure that up there's a chat
when they're a yes um
alright so big question of the episode
funding how do you get it where do you
get it from and we kind of answered this
in the episode but I think it would be
fun to hear where you're at now what
happens if you guys got some big thunder
and you guys were like super set and on
the right track what would you guys do
tomorrow we will launch well actually
what we would do is we would put our
team in place so right now full
transparency we have we have a really
great team of folks who have gotten us
to this point but because we haven't
been able to compete with you know
$100,000 plus offers that engineers of
God nor um you know things of that
nature we really have to just borrow
people when we can um but there are so
many people that actually want to work
for us full-time it's just the fact that
they have families to feed or loans to
pay off and so they really haven't been
able to commit one hundred percent of
their time to part big so the first
thing is just getting everyone who has
worked with us to this point and a few
other people we've identified to be cool
tano perfect and then honestly because
we've done so much work to this point
everything else we really have the plans
for it's just a matter of executing and
we really have the people on board to
execute with is just a matter of having
the team in place to do so so those are
you know really it's around building out
the team and launching um you know we've
submitted the probably proposals got an
initial approvals on those pilots and so
everything pretty much is in place on
the customer side as just a matter of
having everyone in place to watch it's
just can you support can you support it
when that happens yes exactly and what
we do launched in our start we're able
to start to know collect that data and
really you know analyze the results of
being in the market you know that will
go a long way with our funding
conversations that seems to be you know
one of the pieces that
unfortunately we're missing by in our
fundraising conversations while we have
the pipeline we have the interest from
both investors and clients because of
our small team and an inability to
support a large corporation on just a
few part-time no employees that that
will really help us in closing that gap
in the fundraiser I got a question for
you guys and I know it was sort of
addressed in the episode for those who
haven't seen the episode yet ah you
think it would help to be in Silicon
Valley like if you sort of just picked
up and move there at this point you know
the exposure is kind of snowballing in a
sense now and maybe being there you know
being at a coffee shop with you know
someone who knows someone who knows an
investor big I said you're you're you're
loyal to your hometown and then this
also ties into I got this question from
from someone on Twitter fair question
was why do you think the other why do
you think other founders don't see the
potential of where you guys live so you
know there's there's obviously value you
know you guys are in love with your your
own home which makes sense but uh yeah
so the answer on the Silicon Valley
question is so I've been kind of like oh
well maybe we could do it but honestly I
really don't think Silicon Valley is the
place for partake um the reason is
because I don't know very many if any
major manufacturers that are based there
so in terms of our customer base it's
really just not it's really nice to look
about here eat as far as investors
though yes they're probably you know it
probably would be easier maybe um
honestly it's it's hard to say if its
location is the thing that hasn't been
the number one thing that people have
given to me as an objection it may be
easier just because I'm kind of would be
able to be more in people's faces and I
think metaphors for a set period of time
would be great to be out there
but I just think for where we are the
most important thing is for us to be
close to our customers and close to the
talent so one thing we talked about the
episode is like Georgia Tech has are
really great there's a really great
pipeline coming out Georgia Tech and
then other schools on the East Coast so
we're seeing people coming from Carnegie
Mellon but have really great skills in
this area NYU so the schools that are
going to be the feeders for the
technology that we're working on are
really not I mean obviously Sanford has
a great program too but I just something
Silicon Valley is the place for carpet
temporarily maybe but in terms of
long-term and being close our customers
definitely think that Atlanta no New
York is getting more looks just because
there's more going on the in the
investment area there and then we are
still relatively close to a good
customer base but I'd say ethos for sure
and then my family and I really just
want to close my family so yeah go
Atlanta um and then you ask another
question sorry about wha um why do you
think why do you think other founders
don't see the potential where you live
maybe they just don't know you know your
sort of industry because you said like
you know your your business is not like
many other Silicon Valley but businesses
and the industry is you know very much
focused around Atlanta too um honestly I
think that has to do with the culture of
PEG right now and honestly really the
spirit of where people are starting
businesses I'm like what is it that that
is within them that makes them want to
start a business and not to say that
people aren't starting from genuine
places but it was really my experience
in this industry that that made me feel
like okay this is not this is little not
going to work for me I'm not going to be
able to work in this company because I
think this is so horrible that I really
just have to come up with something
because I candyland
but my team there are seamen every day
and they're just miserable they're
crying to me about how much they hate
their jobs and so you know I'm not I'm
not knocking any of the other companies
that are in Silicon Valley but I think a
lot of the companies are founded maybe
not from the most in you in place are
not from actually pain more like this is
a nice to have same or this would be
really fun or cool but not like no you
understand I'm depressed like I can't do
my job because it sucks so it's just
it's just different and I think I think
that there are a lot of are coming from
genuine areas of pain that are outside
of Silicon Valley and so I don't know
why people so I anyway I think maybe the
culture is just the thing that's a
little bit different that you'll find in
in different areas that you want to
surly fine without you no trouble it's
actually funny we were we were at a
factory shooting wasn't a factory but I
want to give away what's going to happen
we're at this place shooting and they
were on the mcmaster carr website and
this guy was just scrolling through a
page looking for something and you
couldn't find it and I just said to him
I was like hey we just did this piece on
this company where you can take a
picture the part that you need and and
if I'll just look it up for you and he
looked at me and he was just like what
are you serious really like yeah he's
like well how do I get it I was it you
can't he's like yeah he just got really
mad and I had to walk away in fact that
you but yet she heard people want to do
this like people people would be psyched
for this yeah it's really cool I think
you know starting Park Nick obviously
there's a lot of frustrating days and
things where I'm just like I want to
give up but the most energizing thing is
that every time I pitched it or every
time I tell someone this is what I'm
working on they always answer me with
the story they always say oh that's that
would be so helpful for this one time
and I was trying to fix this thing and I
couldn't figure out what it was i wish i
had perfect that's always the response
it never failed so that makes me feel
okay well at least this is something
that people find valuable I know that
for a fact because literally the
thousands of times I've been talking
with people they always give me a story
on a Segway with that there's another
Twitter question here what other
industries is part pixie itself aiming
at so oh go ahead listen yeah you know
as far as industries parts are parts and
everything you can look around the room
and everything you see is made up of you
know ton of different parts and and so
we really you know design the technology
to be able to adapt and be flexible you
know around you know all different types
of parts while we still have some
research and some things to do in our
roadmap to to address those other
industries we're confident that our
methodologies will work across across
other industries so we've started with
fasteners and plumbing you know some of
the low hanging fruit is is you know
automotive which is no a huge industry
not just in the US but globally
electrical supplies you know even doing
more around home repair you imagine that
having all of our Kia's parts in the
palm of your hand and accessible just
about taking a picture so you know
there's there's a ton of different
industries as far as like you know the
types of parts that we are catering to
but we also have to recognize that we're
you know we're trying to be aggressive
with visual recognition and our
methodology and then the way that we
approach visual recognition is very
different than a lot of visual
recognition for things that exist and
that attention to detail you know we'll
really we're hoping that it'll you know
continue to evolve in and push the the
recognition space and for and as you
know you know especially since
TechCrunch we've had so much interest
not just from potential clients but from
other partners who who are like you know
we could use that and we
use it for or something that we have you
know our Park hasn't even thought of yet
but it's still using the visual
recognition technology the you know the
artificial intelligence if you will your
computer simulated vision to be able to
solve problems and I think that's you
know one of the great you know flexible
points on your that party at public
narrative table so we didn't actually
get to show this in the episode but I
want you guys to talk about the the
thing that you've kind of dreamed up the
scanner belt yeah and you can you
explain that or I don't know if you have
a link that you can share um yes I for
you know so I'll tell you about that
that was really an answer to an
objection and the objection was part
pick sounds right but how are you want
to scale and in my mind I've always
thought okay there are tons and tons of
websites that have images of tons of
tons of things and so I never thought
that someone could say you know with a
straight face art because I'm going to
work with but they're not going to be
able to get all the images but that has
been one of the objections so as a
response to that I said okay well if we
needed to actually image all of the
parts what would be the quickest way for
us to do that um it's obviously not very
quick for me to take all the pictures of
the parts so what if we could just
automate that process and we got with
some mechanical engineers to spec out
this machine we're basically it's just a
conveyor belt and you just send parts
down the line and we have cameras on all
angles capturing images and cleaning
them automatically into our database and
so basically just automate that process
so it's pretty simple idea but um that's
kind of an answer to the objection of
like oh how are you going to scale well
now we have this idea really spectat
around getting a thousand parts into the
database per day so that's kind of the
thing there and that's another thing
that we're fundraising actually be able
to build it out and I can be fully
launched that
as well Jason because the database does
exist at all right like you guys are
doing this from scratch so to a certain
extent um the database for the clients
the customers national builder supply
could talk a little bit about this but
they do have they do have components of
it so for the parts of they sent us to
Clinton database they already had the
specs associated with each part but they
just didn't have good images associated
with those specs so we don't have to do
the database thing from start to finish
we just have to plug in to the existing
databases that they have and then
associate each of the six or given part
with an image so some customers that
we've talked to they do have pretty good
images that you can use most of them
really don't have good images so that's
the reason that we need to come up with
this with this mission but the great
thing is that we don't have to have
images for all the parts so this is
another question I what I got at
TechCrunch was that we're actually not
you don't have any goal to take pictures
of all the parts that's crazy talk we
really just need basically a base part
for every category and then we use
computer vision to tie to the metadata
associated with this is getting a little
bit yeah let's get the metas good Sam
can you bring up the video that we're
talking about I it's in that chat window
side I don't know if you have to troll
me sorry no assume okay say um yeah
Julie you were saying you said this and
we're talking to you that like if you
have a screw that's half an inch then
you can apply that whatever technology
you have to screw period any screw of
any kind right it does like is that the
simplest way to say it yeah so the thing
about it the way he's your to think
about is like a fingerprint and so we're
basically fingerprinting all the parts
and the thing the things that go into
the fingerprint are both visual
information that we get and the metadata
that's associated with that so and then
the other way to look at it is that
we're creating hierarchies so four
screws we have a hierarchy that is
fruits and then from there we break that
into the types of heads that are on each
screw and then from there we will get
the thread count on each of those headed
screws it's complicated but that's the
way that we that we do the search so in
that sense of a hierarchy we really just
need one part that represents each of
the state level three which is the type
of head that's on this group um and
that's how we do the search yeah I
usually have a question for you when
you're talking to like software people
and investors do they get weirded out
when you start talking about the real
world maybe real world like when when
you're talking about a physical object
or people like what what are you talking
that's not code like this is that ever a
reaction ha that's interesting I mean
honestly I feel like mostly we don't
talk to people who really understand
what we're talking about I mean in terms
of investors obviously there's with tons
of brilliant investors but a lot of
times there they are not in the position
to life deep dive about what's really
going on right so as long as we can show
them which the nice thing is that the
demo perfect is really simple um but the
back end of it is just there's a lot
going on um so typically you just say
okay look this is how it works we might
pull up our our our back in to show them
this is what's happening or this is how
we train our visit these are the the
different algorithms that we have
running but typically we don't go there
and maybe it means we haven't gone far
enough with some of the investors that
we've been talking to you but um but yes
usually they're like okay I get it I
understand generally like what's going
on yeah makes sense cool I was just
curious there isn't another question
that came across Twitter and Alexis I
think you should take a stab at this one
first um somebody asks that they're
they're writing from Austria
this is how I there on Twitter what's
their twitter handle is their twitter
handle hold almost all right in the
meantime gutentag use that I oh yeah
okay this is I'm gonna butcher this okay
sandy se de 1998 okay so intently all
right and they say i live in austria
innsbrook it is pretty hard to find a
co-founder that is great how did you
find yours ah ok well i didn't like if
people that are looking for Kovacs I
unfortunately my story is not very
helpful because I met him freshman year
at college on moving day so go to
college you know this is a common issue
I'm sure there are some great founders
in innsbrook maybe veen might be a
little better but uh ah universities are
really the best the best hub right what
makes so many started communities great
is usually a great school there or
schools because it's a bunch of young
people who usually don't have anything
holding them back from starting a
company hopefully you know I have
anything sort of dependent on them and
their their thinking and they're doing
and they're at this great time in their
lives so you can you can do that
traditional stuff whether I don't know
if your note of the age to be going to
school if you're not I don't judging
from your username you're probably right
that about that point um there are
actually more and more meetups than ever
like seriously meetup dot org Hacker
News has a bunch of international
meetups most major cities across the
world now I have some form of startup
weekend that shows up there to a startup
weekend do a hackathon Google is your
friend but there are plenty of chances
to meet up to in meatspace with other
people interested in start-up so take
advantage of that and then there's
actually a website um oh there's an app
for that founder dating oh isn't that
like like tinder for oh yeah it not
hinder ok 1 i'm thinking advances so
it's like it's like speed dating for
founders right it's like yeah i've
started to see more and more families
introduce themselves that way is having
met on
I mean he's 16 I don't know if I don't
know if he's ready for that oh wow okay
I'm di in 1998 I'm guessing that he's 16
yeah oh wow dude easy or you whoever you
are male or female uh it's so early to
be thinking about starting a start-up
but good for you great I have a
childhood first to said I think he has a
start-up it's called log you in it seems
pretty I don't know what it does I'll be
really cool please all right tweet at me
and and I'll try to help the thing is I
mean actually you all at part pick have
a great version of the story because
this is the other common way of founder
meetup happens yeah so Jason and I
worked together um actually it's funny
because we actually weren't in the same
office but we were really passionate
about the same thing so Jason recruiting
it's this is a funny story so Jason
recruited me to join his team which was
our kind of um twenty percent projects
around diversity and basically getting
more more minority owned businesses
using google products so this is one we
were both at Google and he heard about
me because I got Howard which I went to
Howard go bison um I got Howard using
google apps when I was still a student
after my internship at Google and so I
think I had created a little buzz for
myself well I smoke hey I'm the popular
dude around here who's this girl so
basically so he kind of hehe had called
me up even before i got like even before
my first day starting full-time at
Google he recruited me to join to join
the effort around getting more minority
owned businesses using google tools so
we started working together um business
like when I first got to google and we
we made it our mission to take what I
done at Howard and do that at all
historically black colleges and
universities
he had a lot of success we got was
around 2530 hbcus um transition to
google apps not just like considering it
but actually news over oh I'm yeah yeah
within a year so I'm like mega mezcla as
a side to our department day job right
this is either one of our day jobs so um
you know we discover okay we work really
well together and actually in this case
we're still not in the same place every
day so there's kind of a good I guess
practice for part pick because in a
sense we're still doing the same thing
because Jason's based in New York and
I'm in Atlanta so um so yeah that's how
we met and got started and we became you
know really great friends and he's one
of the first people i called when i had
the idea actually i'll say this i said
that a lot but the real story is i was
frustrated at mcmaster and I was talking
to Jason and telling him about it and he
was like why don't you try to you know
think of something that will make your
time go by really and I was like that's
that's a good point um and so that's
kind of how you know things really got
started and when I was like ah this is
what i need to do I called Jason and
he's working at Shazam that was like you
guys know about recognition stuff now
what are you doing what are you busy
I'll or those yeah give me those
geniuses come up with ways to recognize
music let's do it for parts so um but
yeah that's that kind of how we got
started and then we found our technical
team I just started like being really
creepy and hanging out of Georgia Tech
and meeting people like hey what's up um
but you know that kind of parlayed into
us building relationships and bring
people on board so that's our story
there you go go to college get a job or
just hang out at a college or me back or
yeah just just be aggressively cool and
have people come to you right is that
what you do and then find the people
that are cool
them and then once you go to them that's
them back to you later but you you you
close your laptop you go outside and you
experience the world yeah there's no
dress and meet people talk to people you
put on your oculus rift and your robe
and wizard hat Wow Stephen finds us
co-founder sir that is how you found me
yeah decisive oh cool uh yeah actually
we're coming up an hour yeah yeah we're
coming up on an hour which is great we
had I think this is a great discussion
cool does anyone have any final thoughts
or anything to say before I stop to this
broadcast well I'm going to say
something a little bit unrelated to our
Pig when I'm from Kansas City so go
Royals oh nice plug had to oh god good
enter the year just for one moment just
prepare again go on their team yeah I I
still very tough is out for me about
whether a small is really a sport mmm
only because if one of your look like
I'm gonna get a lot of like on Twitter
for this yeah yeah those are funny
babies possible all the fat guys in on
the dirt exactly if one of the greatest
baseball players ever in America was an
overweight alcoholic like is that really
a sport that guy see the chance to know
but like we did you're plenty of great
roles to play in football for instance
and again jewel I'm sorry about last
Sunday oh okay yes great that was pretty
legit I was really surprised that's a
great game that Redskins game because
the boy hold 45 yeah accepted the times
are continuing to disappoint me every
single week so
and the Falcons are no matter so yeah
haha it's all right there's room on this
bandwagon we're just getting started no
I will never join wow you went to school
bc anyway good nap um for anybody else

the direction it was going to go but I
think you guys did a really great job of
covering you know really the story like
how is how it is for us right now um
which I think a lot of people don't
really get to see this this segment of
the journey I'm so as much as for me it
feels like I'm so hard I just want to
get over this part of it um it is kind
of it is nice even just to see like okay

now people know we're still pressing
we're so going and you know we're gonna
make it by golly I'm thank you for

really helpful for a lot of people too
