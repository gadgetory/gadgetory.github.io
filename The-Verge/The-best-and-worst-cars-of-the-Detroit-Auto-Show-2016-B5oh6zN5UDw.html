joined by Jordan Golson and Sean O'Kane
we are on the floor of the Detroit Auto
Show 2016 also known as the North
American International Auto Show or n√¶ss
depending on who you ask that show has
many names no one calls it that except
no one calls the Venice itself people
yeah so we are in front of the Buick
Avista concept which is I think in
arguably one of the most interesting
cars of the show and not just the car
itself is interesting but the fact that
there's a trend here that I don't think
any of us saw coming which is that
several manufacturers here have debuted
luxury sports coupes coming into the
show it's like a year yeah and it's like
coming into this show who saw that
coming like who would have thought that
that would be a thing here but we have
the Avesta behind us which again is a
concept we'll talk about it more in a
second we have the Lexus LC which we'll
also talk about and we have the Infiniti
q60 which we'll also talk about let
start with the Avista though so the
story behind this vehicle is that it is
based on the new Camaro it has a
twin-turbo v6 I think for 400 horsepower
which is not too shabby whatever concept
specs are worth yeah well so the the
underlying story you should take away
there is that it's it shows how
adaptable the Alpha platform is which is
what the Camaro is on if they have a lot
of flexibility for doing very different
cars with it as you can tell I talked to
mark Royce earlier who is GM's senior
executive vice president of product
development and implored him to make it
because it's beautiful both in press
photos and in person but yeah I'm not
sure it's gonna happen we'll see he I
don't think that he was particularly
bullish on the prospects they just need
to make a business case for it and I
don't think that they have but the
design elements of the car are going to
go into future Buicks do you I mean is
this your car your your
the show or no I think it's I don't know
it Buick they're their ads are very
accurate in that that's a Buick and this
car I think I'm sums that up whether
they make it or not I don't know
GM makes a lot of cars that sort of
crossover and compete with itself and
you know it the use cases is does it
make sense to build this when you have a
Cadillac ATS and you have the Cadillac
CTS right and is there room for multiple
cars from one company I don't know that
that's true I think from a design
perspective it looks great and if this
is the new vision of Buick then I think
they'll do really well yep it is
definitely the car that I've heard more
people talk about walking around the
last two days I don't know I told you up
front from yesterday on this is the
thing that I wanted to see the most yeah
Acura which we'll talk about was the
thing I wanted to see maybe the least
and then I saw him and that sort of
flipped him in my mind which is really
strange
this is for sure the my favorite
interior just because it's so kind of
cool-looking a little bit that did with
the headrests and then that carbon fiber
titanium yeah its arguments when you
open the door it is really cool it is
one of the ones I could see myself
driving around and not feeling
self-conscious about but over the course
of two days I think it's slip from that
top spot and one of the things about
about auto shows in general especially
this one this year is that we knew so
much we knew coming in or we had a good
idea of what was coming and this was a
surprise yes coming in and so I think
for that reason alone people were oh I
got to see this because I haven't seen
leaked concepts or videos or whatever
right well so let's talk about another
luxury sports coupe and this one is real
which is arguably more exciting than a
concept Alexis LC yes you just saw them
just walked by it for the first time and
I think did a double-take
and it looks amazing yeah and I almost
think it's a concept yes it's so out
there and for Lexus to do that something
that's that interesting is really
exciting yeah and and you know you sort
of get away from the it's reliable and
beige and boring and it gets you from
point A to point B in comfort and this
is something else entirely so this
should be a lot of fun so the back story
with this car that LC is that it first
debuted as a concept in 2012 at the same
show as the lf-lc I would argue this
is one of those very rare cases where
the production version of the vehicle is
prettier than the copy made it better
yeah but like the taillights on the
concept for a really bizarre they kind
of toned him down for the production
model but fundamentally what we're
looking at here is a very large luxury
like a grand tourer it's designed to
compete with the like that BMW m6 the S
Coupe from Mercedes even a Maserati GT
somewhere in that range it has the
engine from the RC F driven and it's
it's fantastic the responsiveness is
great it makes a wonderful noise and I
think this one is supposed to make an
even better noise and more willingly and
it also it also makes you wonder if
they're gonna do an LLC F and what
engine that would have yeah will they
put like a twin turbo on this or no that
well they're really naturally as it is
naturally aspirated which I live in
Colorado and we lost a lot of power from
altitude and it is a very heavy car and
so I was missing that and I think there
are rumors that they're going to
turbocharged it and do something to give
it some more power it has 467 which is a
lot but when we compared at horsepower 4
and 6 seven horsepower which when you
compare to the competition it's a little
bit lacking but we'll see what they have
and they arguably make up for that with
design yes styling wise it looks amazing
yeah it looks really good
my favorite thing about that car there
are two things about that car one I'd
forgotten how many new Lexus cars have
that really wide grille on it and it's
our size yeah and it's the first one
that really actually makes it look good
yeah just because that low that front
end is so low and so wide and that
grille finally looks like it fits yeah
but my other favorite thing is that it
is it's very much like infinities Carney
car here the redesign q60 in that it
took lexus is a brand that I don't
usually love the look of its cars and
they just they did enough to it that
really made me like it so if you like
this car really ever that I've looked at
it I meant oh man I really like that
like I can see myself driving it but
infinity you do the same thing with the
q6 t I think that's a good that's a good
segue because the Infinity is a car I
really like yeah I think the q6 looks
great and I think I think we all like it
alright so I used to own a g35 coupe
which is the first generation this is
sort of the
success or the spirit if you kept buying
them yeah 37 and now you get this I
think this looks a lot better than the
old yeah I agree I love that they did
this car as a concept at the show last
year I loved it then and and yeah I
think it looks really good
the one shortcoming potentially is that
and correct me if I'm wrong I'm pretty
sure they're still in 37 litre v6 no 3 3
litre you got two options at the top and
three litre for 400 horsepower
another option for 300 and they were
doing a 2 liter for 208 horsepower at
the bottom it's so and then they're
pushing that all to the q50 line too so
they really took a new engine and did a
lot with it but why don't they make a
GTR version of this car they should I
mean yeah I don't know if you guys
remember what was that four or five
years ago they did the the Arusha
infiniti q50 when a man four of them are
whatever I did the the 3 5 litre
inline-six from the GTR and they should
have just that they should have got a
lot with this so yeah I built that this
is another good opportunity to do a
really high-end performance car with
this charge the same amount is gonna be
with the m3 or they'll see even what
they'll see is probably gonna be a 100
$120,000 car
the q6 t even with the top engine I'm
guessing is gonna be what 50 55 maybe I
will say announced so they should just
stick a giant engine in there and go all
out I thought that's that's my look I'm
not a businessman I just like cars and
so that's the coupe's that's the create
a lot of those and then wait lest we
forget
Acura oh yes no sorry that's well you
shouldn't forget it before we move on to
all we are then finishing up the
concepts there's the Acura precision
concept they're really terrible name but
a really accurate sedan concept is what
we will call it yes that's better yeah
and I just sat down with the designers
of it and it's not a car that they're
planning to build certainly not like
that but it's their vision for the
future of the Acura line yeah
and honestly the Acuras have gotten a
little stale yes
they're they're very reliable they have
nice interiors if you really like fan
letters not a car for you there they're
very nice Honda's but if like Buick with
this and like you know the Infiniti you
know sort of getting the new design
language the new Lexus if that's the
vision for Acura I think we're in to see
good stuff from them especially with the
NX s NSX coming along later this year
yeah well it sounds to me and this is
what they sent the press conference to
that this car really is a design
exercise that encompasses everything
that actor is going to be doing with
their new production cars over the
course of the next couple years so a lot
of the design elements like the new
grille which they have a name for it's
called the the diamond pentagram I mean
it looks like something out of a chick
ad it's like it looks like you could cut
your beard off with I mean it's really
bizarre and you can't really tell
diamond pentagon that looks like the
least ridiculous part of it up until I
got up close and then you get up there
and there are all these diamonds coming
out at you from the grille it's a smile
really bizarre like one of the weirdest
things and I think that's why I actually
came away liking it more than anything
else here because in the to press photos
that we got of it it looked just angular
for the sake of being angular and then
you get up close to it and it actually
isn't quite as aggressive on the
bodywork at least there are all these
really weird little touches like the
headlights have these lightning like
almost looks like 3d printed like
lightning sharp edges I noticed that all
that is being printed and there's like
flaking in the back windows it just it's
super weird and I and then it has the
suicide doors and it's just it's crazy
well one thing about about Acura that
I've seen in the past is that there a
lot of their concepts look really good
and then when they make it to reality
they're coming down so much they're not
as good the NSX hopefully will in view a
little excitment into that into the
brand and you know the brand and get
things going and so we have that to
hopefully look forward to one I really
like their cars but yeah I mean like you
said before it's it's it's a nice Honda
and it's a reliable car they just need
some fresh blood in that brand one more
thing we should say about the precision
concept it also has a new infotainment
system which i think is probably one of
the most production-ready elements of
that kind it's very obvious that's
what's coming
that's definitely coming right now they
have a dual screen thing which sorry
Acura it's
well yeah there's a lot of terrible
infotainment systems out there there's
is one of my least favorite yeah it's
another pretty interior but pretty in a
different way from what this one has
like yeah I like the concept
look it sort of reminded me of the
interior the the BMW i8 Spyder concept
it's very wide screen but narrow lots of
room to show information yep it seems
like that might be a trend in
infotainment over the next couple years
but we should talk about what's next
what else do we have lots of exec your
big sports sedans yes and there's a
boatload of them so just good then you
run a company even if it's not very big
this might have been the show for you
because there are a lot of cars that
you're probably gonna get driven around
in some time yeah yes there's the well
hande didn't just launch a car they
launched an entire brand yes Genesis yes
which is basically Genesis is to Hyundai
as Lexus IS to Toyota or Acura is done
to Honda you were at the g9b
event yeah what'd you think it was I as
far as the press events here go is
probably one of the better handled ones
different in a sense from the
Continental which we'll talk about in
the because they spoke all about
traditional car stuff and Tamara Warren
wrote a really good piece about why this
show still matters or whether it still
matters after CES has become such a big
car show and Genesis played right into
that they were talking about engines
they were talking about comfort is wrong
about ride the body design all that
stuff and not as much about some of the
features that they do have like you know
forward-facing collision warnings
rear-facing whereas the it it was it was
cool it's a nice car it probably wore
off on me that over the next 10 years
who whereas we had the Continental this
morning yeah we're the Continental and
that that was a total that was a totally
different experience it was like feature
feature feature also yeah the
Continental is all about the experience
they had a jazz band in the morning
which was awesome and they talked a lot
about the interior they didn't talk
about engine specs at all they didn't
talk about anything like that they
talked a lot about China and how many
dealerships they have and all that
that's a very China focused car Genesis
mentioned that too in their press
conference yeah that's a clear that's a
big market for everybody right now
but Ford is is hitting that hard with
that car and we'll see we'll see what
the reception is here it didn't blow me
away yeah you know the last few when I
saw the concept I I thought that it was
a really interesting car and it feels
like some of that was lost in
translation but they did keep the one
really trick feature which is the eel a
CH door that works so basically there
and I'm not sure why but I think they
they just wanted to make it special
getting in and out and so on the outside
you sort of pull and there's a little
electronic button you press and it pops
open the door and then on the inside
there's a physical button that you press
and that pops open the door and I was
talking to one of the engineers who
worked on that and he said there's
actually a super capacitor inside so if
you lose battery power for whatever
reason you can still open the door and
get out it's amazing actually tested it
under water for thirty minutes
they started underwater and then press
the button to make sure that if
something happened you could still get
out you were underwater in your
continental for thirty minutes you have
bigger problems there's like there's
like one person in the world who has
very specific needs like safety guys you
got to have safety so just finishing up
the last couple things one the Volvo s90
which we'd seen pictures of before looks
great in person as you know my the
taillights the read the car looks great
the interior looks amazing the
taillights I think are low polarizing
that's my opinion we'll see I mean they
took an exit 90 which just won Truck of
the Year they are calling it and this is
the sedan version of that and it's great
so also seeing the m2 before the BMW n2
this is the first time we really got a
closer rate in person you're already you
already have your check in the mail
right if I could afford that car like
it's they took a standard too and made
it way wider it's the most m looking
more like wonderful yeah it's great
and then finally the last thing was
introduced which might be the biggest
announcement of the show that people are
ignoring because it's we may not
ignoring but we're leaving it to lasses
in the Mercedes e-class yeah which is
the flagship it's the car that all these
other sports sedans
you know not an executive sedan but the
big sedans are competing with and they
drop the mic they came out and said
here's the new one it can pretty much
drive itself down the highway up to a
hundred and thirty miles an hour we were
only on the ground here before there I
mean Mercedes just like kind of kicked
back the rest of the show thank you guys
go ahead and do your thing
yeah you know the funny thing about
Mercedes strategy a number of people
pointed this out now is that they have
three they have the the CD in the ass
and they are all identical now except
like one is slightly larger than the
other which is I like I guess if you're
in a phase of consistent design language
that's great but like I just walked by
the e again and it like if that drove by
me I'm not sure I could tell the
difference read that into see okay
that's I could because this is really
big but the C in the ER so close in size
that it would be really tough to yeah
but you know what everybody's still
chasing them that's true that's from BMW
well that's it from the Detroit Auto
Show another one in the books lots of
stuff coming up we have Geneva in just a
few weeks we need we need to get some
sleep first we have the New York Auto
Show basically immediately after that so
lots of stuff in the pipeline lots of
announcements coming a lot more models
and variants so so keep it tuned we have
a YouTube channel you should check that
out it's the verge we have our own
Twitter account it's called verge cars
you should definitely check that out we
did a lot of cool stuff on periscope and
Facebook this week that and snapchat
Sean was great on on Facebook live this
week's network just verge on snapchat
all of these social media things you
should be checking out or trying to
reach or they're everywhere yeah which
whatever you need to pick you and you
know what it's the only January 12 we
have a long year you're the person who
can use a Lincoln Continental underwater
for 30 minutes then all we want to know
doesn't show for you hey guys thanks
guys we'll talk to you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
