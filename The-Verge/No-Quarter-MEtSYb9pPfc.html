give people a space to play games around
each other one of the things that really
inspired us when it comes to no quarter
is what's what's now been called the new
arcade movement as we've seen the
decline of the sort of commercial arcane
what we've seen is all of these people
getting together playing games testing
them you know having a great time and
and that's something that has just been
picking up steam the game that I'm
showing here at no quarter is called
guts of glory and it's a competitive
eating contest set in the
post-apocalyptic future it's basically
trying to take kind of deck building
card games and do something with them
that could work in the gallery contacts
the real mission of no quarter at least
as Charles has kind of explained it to
me is that they wanted to be able to
provide a way for people to make games
that they would not normally get to make
for a long time I've really wanted to
make a two-player game and I've really
wanted to try my hand at doing a
physical game because physical games are
a lot harder in a lot of ways board
games are very difficult because you
can't just throw in like timing an
action to increase the skill and
difficulty you have to make the
difficulty work out through the system I
made a game called yah move it's a
cooperative dance battle game where you
have a partner and you're supposed to
dance in sync with your partner to be
another team so just using an ipod touch
and it's using the accelerometer when i
first started this dansgame i realized
it's really hard to make people
song command it's like almost as hard as
crying on command the great thing about
making a game is that like you can
create this like safe space like this
magic circle that people can just feel
comfortable being themselves and like
and being like totally honest it's
definitely a trend of non screen based
games at one point it was like digital
mean screen you know like digital games
don't have to actually rely on screens
at all this stuff is kind of gonna merge
games are going to continue to be
popular in both board games end video
games and casual games are going to get
harder and more interesting there's a
space for these events to exist there's
a space for games to exist inside of
these types of events so that's a really
incredible point for games right now the
goal of no quarter is to preserve that
space of design we want all of the games
that come out of no perks they go to all
those other places to be played by their
audiences right we want to take games
that have been found in Austin and calm
and play them in New York and I think
that that would be amazing if we could
get accomplished man
