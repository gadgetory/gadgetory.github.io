today is all about software we're gonna
get started with iOS next big release of
iOS is you guessed it
iOS 12 and because we want these changes
to be available to the full range of our
customers iOS 12 will be available on
all the same devices as iOS 11 and we're
focusing our efforts especially on the
oldest devices this is the iPhone 6 plus
now in that device iOS 12 delivers a
number of improvements across common
operations you'll see that apps launch
up to 40% faster the keyboard can come
up up to 50 percent faster and you can
slide to take a photo at up to 70
percent faster and an iOS 12 we've
wanted to make an easy way to experience
AR across the system we created a new
file format for AR it's called USD Z you
can use USD Z across the system from the
files app to Safari even sharing them
over messages and Mail and what's great
is you can place these 3d objects into
the real world designers and developers
will now be able to use familiar apps
apps that they know and love like
Photoshop or dimension to create amazing
AR content and bring it easily via us DZ
in fact for the first time with Creative
Cloud and iOS you will have a
what-you-see-is-what-you-get editing in
AR so here I am at the Fender website
and actually let you configure your
guitar with a kind of finish and
pickguard that you want so I can select
configuration option here and then I can
see the guitar I've configured so I'm
just going to tap in of course I can see
the guitar here but wouldn't it be cool
if I could see it in the real world in
its real size well there it is so we're
introducing a new app and it's called
measure makes it really easy to measure
objects detect rectangles and get their
dimensions measure lines along surfaces
now I'm actually in the the measure app
you see I can easily measure
along the suitcase by just tapping and
dragging out a line like that and check
that out it's a measurement and we're on
a relentless pace of advancement with AR
and that continues today with AR KITT -
now this delivers true multi-user
augmented reality you and the people
around you will be able to able to see
your own perspective on a common virtual
environment and to help while you
developers get started we created this
sample app written in Swift that you'll
all be getting today now check out how
both players and even a third observer
can all experience the same environment
in real-time here we have assembly
square it's one of our lego creator sets
perfect because now they're kit twos
multi-user support we get to play it up
to four friends in the same space this
year we're making photos even better we
have an all new tab it's called for you
and with for you you have all of your
memories those great memory movies but
more like featured photos highlighting a
photo that you took on this day in past
years and effects suggestions for
instance suggesting looping a live photo
or applying a new portrait effect to one
of your portrait photos we've added
sharing suggestions so imagine you've
gone out for a great dinner with some
friends and you took some photos well
afterwards and for you you'll see a
suggestion like this to share those
photos if you tap in you'll see that
photos is even recommending a set of
photos that from that set that you might
want to share and suggest who you might
want to share them with based in part by
the people that appeared in the photos
let's turn to Siri we wanted to make
cereal to do much more for you and we're
doing that by taking advantage of the
power of apps with a new feature we call
shortcuts now say you have the tile app
because you're always losing your keys
well the tile app can expose the option
to
add a shortcut to Siri you can assign
your own phrase such as I lost my keys
be a good choice
and when you then say it Siri will
automatically activate tile and show you
right in the Siri UI start ringing your
tile we want to let you create your own
shortcuts as users like of multiple
steps across multiple applications and
we're doing it with a new shortcuts we
start in the gallery where there's
hundreds of pre-made shortcuts that you
can download or we can hop over to the
library and I've got a bunch of
shortcuts here but I want to show you my
heading home shortcut you can see that
it's just really a series of steps it
grabs my location and my travel time and
it sends my ETA to my roommate it sets
my home kit thermostat to 70 degrees and
it turns on my fan and lasts it gets
directions home with Apple maps with the
best route to avoid traffic I've already
added this shortcut to Siri with the
custom phrase heading home so now
whenever I leave work
I can just say heading home you will get
there in one hour I sent a message to
Sheryl your thermostat is set to 70
degrees and I turned on the fan playing
KQED radio we're bringing Apple news to
stocks top stories and stocks features
business news right curated by the Apple
news editors with iOS 12 we're bringing
stocks to iPad we've also completely
rebuilt voice memos to make it even
easier to use and we're bringing voice
memos to the iPad for the first time but
we also have a smart and safe way to use
your apps in the car I think you know
I'm talking about carplay you might not
know is with iOS 12 carplay will also
support third-party navigation there are
times of the day are times when you just
don't want to be disturbed and one of
those of course is it night and so we're
introducing do not disturb during
bedtime where all you'll see is this
nothing to get you spun up but we're
enabling what we call instant
for notifications right from the lock
screen you can press in to a
notification and from there you can
decide to send future notifications from
that app directly to Notification Center
bypassing your lock screen or turn them
off all together now we also wanted to
give you help managing large numbers of
notifications so I'm thrilled to
announce that we're bringing to iOS
support for grouped notifications group
not just by app but also by topic and
thread gives you a great overview of the
notifications you've received you can
tap in and look at a particular group of
course just as important with a single
swipe you can triage a whole group of
notifications away we wanted to go
further it's with a feature we call
screen time and it starts with reports
every week you get a weekly activity
summary the details how you used your
iPhone or iPad you get a summary of the
time you're spending in apps how much
time you're spending how often per hour
you're picking up your phone and what's
drawing you in and what apps are sending
you the most notifications app where you
might want to be spending a little bit
less time well you can set your own
limit and then during the day when
you're using the app you'll receive a
helpful notification letting you know
time is almost up we think this is gonna
be helpful for many people but
especially for some kids you can also
limit your kids time in apps by category
or by individual app and this year we're
taking an emoji to a whole new level
the breakthrough new technology we call
tongue detection you can make your
favorite an emoji do this
now we've also we're also introducing
some great new an emoji that I think
you're all gonna love like ghost
koala tiger and t-rex so I'm thrilled
today to announce the arrival of the era
of me emoji with me mode you can create
your very own personalized these an
emoji can look like you or the real you
now this year FaceTime is gonna take a
big leap forward because today we're
introducing group FaceTime two people
three people actually up to 32
simultaneous participants hey everybody
let's check it out so it's this
beautiful FaceTime UI next up I'd like
to talk about the Apple watch
so in watch OS 5 you can challenge any
of your activity sharing friends to a
7-day competition whenever you would
like now there's some times when you
forget to start a workout on watch but
you've started working out and to solve
this now we're adding automatic workout
detection in watch OS 5 you'll have an
entirely new way to communicate on your
watch that's real-time voice but with
the spontaneity of short messaging and
to do this you just press to talk and
then your friend can hear your voice
just like a walkie-talkie and we're also
adding series shortcuts so shortcuts you
saw coming to iOS 12 are also going to
be available in watch OS so in addition
to getting relevant information you'll
also receive predicted shortcuts right
on the Siri watch face so at a wrist
raise you'll be able to directly do
things like turn on your leaving home
scene or start an outdoor walk so you no
longer need to say hey Siri you just
raise your wrist and talk to Siri today
if someone sends you a web link you
aren't able to view it on your wrist
with watch OS 5 we've integrated WebKit
so now you have the ability to view web
content in mail or messages and now with
watch OS 5 we're giving you even more to
listen to the Apple podcast app is
coming to Apple watch now this is also
Pride Month
and we're really excited to introduce an
all-new pride addition watchbands next
up is Apple TV Apple TV 4k is bringing
you the latest in audio technology the
Apple TV app now offers a huge range of
live sports and we've added live news
and I'm really excited excited to
announce that here in the US charter
spectrum will be coming to Apple TV late
this year that means that up to 50
million homes will be able to choose
Apple TV to access all their live
channels next up is the Mac our next
release of Mac OS is Mac OS Mojave and
I'd like to show you a new side of
Mojave we call it dark mode all of the
contents of your desktop are
automatically arranged into these stacks
it can be arranged by kind by date or
even by tag and we call it desktop
stacks some great new changes to the
finder now we've added an all-new view
called gallery view and of course with
images sometimes you want to know more
detail about for instance how they were
captured and now the new sidebar in
Mojave really helps because it now
supports full metadata so for instance
if I have a photo like this and I want
to edit it I don't have to open it and
go or do a new app can rotate it right
here inside the finder now in Mojave
we've made quick look more powerful than
ever ever by integrating markup so you
see down here I have a permission slip
and it's a PDF document I'm just gonna
hit tap spacebar to quick look it and
you notice now I have the option to
invoke markup I click and now I have
access to my mark-up tools including my
ability to sign this document we meet
screenshots more powerful than ever I'm
gonna screenshot a selection of the page
and I want you to watch what happens in
the lower right
I get a thumbnail instantly of that
screenshot and when I double-click in I
get an accelerated workflow right in to
markup where I've access to all of my
tools but we've also added screen
capture for video I'd like to turn to
apps we are bringing news to the Mac we
also have stocks coming to the Mac we're
also bringing voice memos to the Mac
finally thrilled to announce home is
coming to the Mac as well all of your
accessories here you can run your scenes
as well as monitor your video cameras
and of course with Siri you can command
your home with your voice I'd like to
talk about security and privacy well
we've all seen these these like buttons
and share buttons and these comment
fields well it turns out these can be
used to track you whether you click on
them or not and so this year we are
shutting that down you want to interact
with one of these or one of these apps
tries to access that information you'll
get this and you can decide to keep your
information private
so we've redesigned an all-new Mac App
Store from the ground up Microsoft will
bring Office 365 to the Mac App Store
later this year and Adobe is bringing
Lightroom cc J's like this only come
from years of effort and hard work and
great sacrifice let's have an incredible
week together thank you
we've worked hard to build a deep set of
customization options to let our
customers create an incredibly diverse
set of momochi</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
