us patrolmen actually just got out of
kind of stop going to college well my
background previously I was a gym
automotive plant out in Lake at Lake
Orion run for I came when I worked at
Johnson's control it was similar for
Chrysler you know we always have
different companies coming into CCS the
building and we opened doors for them
all the time
this particular one had a weird name
shine noble I didn't know what that was
usually it's a you know something like
Apple or Microsoft that comes in here
and they want to do stuff but this was
different and I was interested I wanted
to it'll be a part of it the watch
company became it was introduced to me
because I had left the plant and I was
still seeking employment and my
recruiter called me and asked me was i
interested north and a watch company in
Detroit and at first I didn't believe
well it's like it's no watch company in
Detroit it is downtown I said okay but I
said I'm looting Detroit my whole life
so I never seen one so I went and took
the dexterity test after that he told me
that he would give me a car back you
know and he gave me a car back that day
and was like well when can you start
and I said are you serious it didn't
sound too bad it was something I was
just I needed money so that's all I was
worried about once I got here we
actually started some of the last you
start liking it a lot and became good at
it I was like really nervous at first
and learning how to use a steak and the
tweezer to put picked up you know little
itty-bitty pieces but then after a week
or two it just like every day it just
came second nature because it's like so
easy for me now the fact that they can
bring in like people that are familiar
with this
and then train people from the ground up
like we like we have no experience
whatsoever is huge so I mean and they
were really patient really nice you know
able to you know focus our minds to what
they knew you know and um kind of just
throw away our own vision of what
manufacturing is like as far as like
cars and stuff like that that we're
familiar with all my own relatives they
all worked in factories my floors and
Jim my grand I retired in June my dad I
retired from the forts and never crossed
my mind ever making a watch
I believe shinola adopts the Detroit
name because Detroit carries a lot of
weight
whether it be negative more positive the
manufacturing being a huge positive so I
mean I believe slapping that on top of
something that you're you know building
and manufacturing in the city this is
huge it's not really different from any
other city
I mean yet a crime rate is a little high
it's considered a bad City but I really
everyone really loves Detroit when I
know that that's in Detroit they love
their city they love me true almost
definitely I'm proud of my city I love
Detroit a lot of people move and go
elsewhere but I don't really feel the
need to move it has a lot of hope I mean
the way they want to statistically is
seem like it's going down but with all
the hope and good spirits hopefully for
come up and become a better city you
know one day I think it's very important
that we keep things here in the city
American made handmade this feels more
rewarding like I don't feel expendable
you know people don't see like like from
a car assembly line they're not gonna
see that same car go out like I know
that I had something to do with that
watch that had that movement and I know
that if I don't get something done and
something's not gonna go right so that's
it's it's a burden but it makes you feel
like you actually doing something when
everything else it was just like a job
and trying to go in I hated being there
I hated getting up to come in it was
just for the check just for the money
just like just say but this is I should
like doing it I don't mind standing over
for over time I don't mind coming in on
the weekend I just like being here I
like I like to work it's not everything
about it this is more than just work to
me it's like that's a career I think
when it's here in America my definitely
here in the city you gave people put
their all like we put our all into
everything that we do here I just think
they couldn't have chosen a place to
bring it soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
