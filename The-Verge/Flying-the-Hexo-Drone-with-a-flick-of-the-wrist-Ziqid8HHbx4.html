this last year this is the finished
version last year we saw a prototype now
and what is trying to do is make flying
as simple as possible they've got an app
here where I can make a bunch of choices
I want it to follow me from up close
from far away I want to circle around me
I want it to keep a focus on me but
maybe slide in from the left to the
right and so those are just a bunch of
you know menu choices you make and then
you hit a button and hopefully it goes
so I'm going to do a little biking now
and just see how well it follows me and
then we're going to get in the car and
really test this puppy out
so I'm just out here shredding some sick
turf getting followed by madrone good
some highlights ready for my sizzle reel
I'm thinking maybe redbull Tommy this is
not enough my wheelies black my wheelies
ok ok so clearly I can keep up with a
bike I'm also getting pretty tired too
now we're gonna see if it can keep up
with the car
now we saw this last year there did some
of the same stuff following us on a
bicycle or car but this year it's got
some cool new features they're still
kind of in the works like the magic wand
forget their remote just take your phone
set the drone up where you want it wave
your hand around like a conductor and
the drone follows your every move I've
become quite accustomed to flying a
drone with a to stick controller and
it's something I really enjoy doing but
I also I'm always trying to encourage
new people to fly a drone and typically
they're very intimidated by the
controller the magic wand seem like the
sort of thing that I could hand to an
older person or a younger child and they
would intuitively understand what to do
and be able to move the drone around and
sort of get excited about flying the
nice part of the magic wand was that it
gave you the sense of being sort of like
a Jedi you just wave your arm and the
drone flies out you know I also kind of
thought of like what it would have been
like to be a falconer and some weird
like sci-fi future where like somebody's
stolen my wallet and I just throw this
drone at them but you know a guy can
dream</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
