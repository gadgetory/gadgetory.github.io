inaugural panorama music festival this
year in New York City and we're going to
be hosting the lab an incredible
interactive art space that's running all
weekend long
we spoke to Gabriel Palacio an artist
with work featured in the space his
piece is called infinite wall
my name is Gabriel pleasure I'm a little
light artist based in Brooklyn New York
it's been it's been a very interesting
path for me into art because my I start
studying art and then I moved to motion
motion graphics and 3d design for
panorama we're building an immersive
installation made out of a infinity
mirrors and see-through mirrors and it's
funneled interactive installation so the
public comes it will be triggering
ripples of light through the
installation from the floor curling up
one of the walls the filling is like
more that you are floating in space and
you're like repeated infinite times I've
been doing like research and developing
on this for like several months but the
build four days are gonna be more or
less six six weeks everything is built
here motive is like later cut panels
regular LEDs and extruded aluminum frame
that holds the whole structure there are
three Kinect sensors in the ceiling that
pretty much are tracking the position of
each one of the other people inside and
then this is sent to like touch designer
which is taking that data triggering the
movies and several animations that will
be mapped into the LEDs
I think there is two sides of it and one
is it all the back end of the
installations that I'm doing it is
digital but the end result it's like an
analogue result which is light bouncing
inside of a mirror and creating these
graphics I think interaction is is key
because somehow the spectator the public
will immediately connect to the piece
the fact that it's interactive means
that it lives in this sort of fourth
dimension of time it's all about how
technology is tracked us from our
day-to-day and our second to second and
how we don't live in the present and
this piece of technology what it's doing
is creating ripples of light out of your
position so it's like technology telling
you again where you are and that you are
here right now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
