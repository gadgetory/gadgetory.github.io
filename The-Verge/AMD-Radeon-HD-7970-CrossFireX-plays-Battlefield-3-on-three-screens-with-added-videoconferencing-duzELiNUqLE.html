new demo that AMD is giving us this is
using my affinity we're using free
displays play battlefield 3 and then
we're using a couple more displays on
the side to talk with our buddies who
will claim with or against all I mean
what are we doing about sup at okay and
the interesting thing here with this
demo is actually that the sound is
related to the monitor so the person
speaking to us here from the left we get
the sound from the left and the person
speaking to us from the right we get
direction of sound this is done with the
AMD graphics card so this is going to be
pretty cool I presume when you play
multiplayer games we don't know too many
people have this much room to have five
screens up mr. it's a full ooh
additionally the offerings and
battlefield free itself and free massive
then bezel displays is a amazing
I don't know who I'm supposed to be on
shoot things that move she thinks that
shoot back doesn't mark away is
initially just happen but don't shoot
until you see the whites of their eyes
