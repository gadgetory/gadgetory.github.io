right now we're getting our first
hands-on with the Nokia n1 tablet up
until now it's been exclusive to China
and you can see it actually looks a lot
like an iPad Mini if you were to cover
up the logo here in the back you could
probably fool anybody that you showed
this to but it's got some really cool
unique features it's running a custom
version of Android 5.0 so you can see
the the launcher buttons down here are
from lollipop but it's got what Nokia is
calling the Z launcher which means that
all these apps here are actually loaded
in contextually by time so if you wake
up in the morning and you check email or
use maps to get to work those are gonna
populate up near the front and at night
if you use Chrome to browse the web or
Netflix to watch movies it'll move those
to the front tooth this kind of
contextual a presentation is actually a
trend we're seeing here at MWC the HTC
m9 will load apps into widgets based on
your location so if you get to work it's
gonna load up your work apps home it's
gonna load up your home apps whereas
here it's being loaded in by time so
maybe this is something we're gonna be
seeing more of in the future so the rest
of the apps you just swipe to the right
you find them in the app tray here or
you can actually use this kind of cool
feature scribble to search so you just
draw right here and F and it'll pull up
Facebook it'll also pull up sort of the
first letter and some other words too so
if you were like looking for a fruit
ninja you could type an end it'll bring
that up as well this is also the first
tablet with the new reversible USB cable
so it means you could actually plug this
in either way kind of like the lightning
cable on Apple's devices but this has a
hot catching heat name of a type C USB
3.1 so you're gonna see this a lot more
on devices in the future but this is the
first one to have it it's got an eight
megapixel camera on the back five
megapixel camera on the front if you're
into using your tablet for photography
but otherwise it's a pretty simple
tablet it runs for 249 but like we said
we it's all only available in China
right now
and Nokia says that they're looking to
bring it other markets but it's going to
depend on partnerships so if you like
the look of this thing you're probably
going to have to wait a little bit
longer to get your hands on it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
