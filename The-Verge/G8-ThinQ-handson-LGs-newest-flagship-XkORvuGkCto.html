and I'm here with the new LG G8 ThinQ.
It's LG's latest flagship that
it's announcing at MWC 2019.
(mellow music)
LG's focusing on a couple areas
as improvements with the G8.
It's focusing on biometric security,
new camera features, and just
generally improved hardware.
The biggest area that it's changing
is the new front-facing camera
which LG is calling the Z Camera.
The Z stands for z-axis,
and that's because LG's using
some IR 3D mapping technology
that'll allow you to detect
how far things are from the device.
LG's using this in a couple of cool ways.
(upbeat music)
The first is for face unlock,
so it can do face ID just like an iPhone.
Actually, very similar to the iPhone,
and it's using these IR sensors
to get better, 3D maps that
work well in low light.
LG says its system is actually
an improvement on Apple's
because LG's using a constant live feed
instead of more static 3D
images that Apple is using.
The second is in just
improved portrait selfies.
LG's using the added
data from the new sensor
for better depth mapping,
which it says should give
better portrait selfies
and allow it to use more effects
on those portrait pictures,
and the third is probably the
weirdest one that LG's doing,
which is something it's calling Hand ID.
That's where it's using the IR sensors
to reflect the IR lasers
off the hemoglobin
in the veins in your hand
and then using that vein map
as a way to identify that it
is your palm and no one else's.
LG says that this is a secure
way to unlock your phone,
and the net result is
that you can just kinda
hold your phone, hold
your hand over your phone,
and it just unlocks.
It's very weird, and honestly, like,
I had a lot of trouble getting it to work,
probably just because I'm not very used
to unlocking my phone that way.
I really don't think anyone is,
but I kinda see where LG is coming from,
and it ties into one of
the other big features
that they're introducing with the G8,
which is called Air Motion.
Now, that's LG's phrase for
its gesture control system.
So you activate it first
by holding your hand close to your phone,
and then, you draw it back a bit.
Then, you can tilt your
hand to play, pause music
or rotate it like a dial to adjust volume.
It's interesting and it kinda works.
Again, I had some difficulty,
largely due to the fact that
I had a few minutes to learn it,
and I'm just not very familiar with it,
and it's a feature that's meant
when your phone's like, on a table,
your hands are dirty, you're making bread,
or painting a picture or something,
and you still wanna change
music or answer a call,
but it doesn't work super well,
and I'm just not entirely convinced
by it just yet as a feature.
LG's completely eliminated the
top speaker from the phone.
That's nice just because the
notch gets to be smaller now,
but to replace it,
LG's using a pretty
weird and cool technology
which it's calling its Crystal Sound OLED,
which uses the entire pane of glass
that's the front of the
phone and vibrating that,
so you create sound instead.
Now, I tried it out.
It actually works pretty well,
but it's kind of bizarre in that
it doesn't really now
matter where you hold it,
so you can just kinda slide
it up and down your ear
and the sound quality
doesn't get any worse,
which is kinda weird.
The sound was a little muffled.
I'm not sure if that's just because
inherent of the speaker technology
or just because I had a
really bad cell connection,
but it's definitely a
nifty way to use the tech,
and the Crystal Sound OLED panel
also works in concert with the
regular speaker on the bottom
which is still there.
So if you're just trying to play music
or listen to your video,
it still will sound fine,
and it still will have stereo sound.
The rest of the specs of the G8
are a little more lackluster.
They're perfectly fine and,
you know, regular standard upgrades
for an Android phone in 2019.
There's a Snapdragon 855
processor, which is new and good,
six gigabytes of RAM, USB-C charging.
There's still a headphone
jack, which is great.
A 3500 milliamp-hour battery.
These are perfectly, you
know, it checks all the boxes.
Nothing here is just
super standout, though.
One nice thing, LG has gotten
rid of the camera bump.
The camera is actually
completely flush with the back,
which is great, just a
seamless piece of glass.
There are also a couple
upgrades to the camera.
There's a new Dark mode,
which layers up to 10
frames to help reduce noise,
and there's a new Video Portrait mode,
where you can shoot
videos in Portrait mode
with this live blur effect.
You can actually adjust
the blur in real time
while you're shooting,
which is certainly cool
from a tech perspective.
My, again, very brief test,
it didn't work outstanding.
Chunks of the background kept
flipping in and out of focus.
It wasn't super great at
focusing in on my subject,
but again, this is early
hardware, early software.
It's not out yet.
LG's probably gonna tweak it,
and this was absolutely not
a full hands-on demo, so.
(gentle music)
It's hard to say,
but it's certainly nifty.
So that's the LG G8, and honestly,
it's a perfectly
competent-looking smartphone.
It checks all the boxes for
specs and hardware and features,
but I think it's gonna suffer
from the same problem that the G7 had,
which is there's just not a lot here
that makes it stand out.
As a new phone, if you're looking at it,
there's nothing that's jumping
and screaming to say buy this
and even if you have a G7,
if you're already an LG fan,
there's just not a lot here to upgrade,
and in a world where we're
seeing just wild new innovations,
we have folding phones and 5G phones
and weird cameras and things,
I'm just not convinced that LG has,
you know, the pitch here to,
to make the G8 a compelling
argument in the face of that.
LG hasn't announced the price
or release date for the G8 yet,
although announcements should be coming
from its carrier partners
within the next couple days at MWC,
and again, this is
still an early hands-on,
so we'll have much more about the G8
and all the other phones at MWC
as the week and months go on.
Thanks so much for watching.
Please make sure to like and subscribe
for more great videos like this,
and keep it locked to the Verge all week.
We'll have tons more news from MWC.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
