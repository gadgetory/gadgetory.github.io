a company called Eaton Corporation and
when I graduated Eaton said we will hire
you but we would like to place you in
Southfield Michigan which is a suburb of
Detroit I didn't know a lot about
Detroit and so a lot of people told me
you know you're gonna get shot Detroit's
a scary place don't go there but I was
looking for a little bit of an adventure
and I kind of wanted to smudge myself I
mean that I haven't lived anywhere on
sides
Minnesota and so I said what the hell
I'll go for it
so while I get to be pretty creative at
my job at work I still have to develop
technologies that are very useful to
eating it has to make sense for you to
make that technology and I thought you
know what since I don't know anybody in
this state I'll go check out this place
called i3 Detroit
so I three Detroit runs classes and all
classes are run by the members so we
encourage our members to sort of
broadcast their skills to the membership
and to the general public when someone
comes in and builds something they
haven't done before for the first time
they kind of have this like first moment
of like turning on the electronic board
or you know taking the thing out of the
laser cutter and they go this is really
cool I made this for Valentine's Day
this year and I wanted to really impress
my new boyfriend at the time because
he's a computer engineer and I was
googling pictures and I found this
design for a circuit board and I was
like this is something I can do and it
just kind of goes through some really
pretty sequences I'm actually really
proud of it because it was the first
board that I made by myself
so traditionally these places have been
called hacker spaces the term hacker is
sort of a misunderstood term what hacker
means at a hacker space is someone who
takes things apart figures out how they
work makes it even better or just
somebody who wants to understand what
makes things run it's sort of having
that curious drive but a lot of people
when they hear the term hacker they
think of somebody stealing their bank
account so some people propose let's
just call these places maker spaces I
don't really see myself as a hacker I
actually do in this space because I
really like to make stuff I doodle and I
paint it's really great to be up here
and watch people use stuff and how they
use stuff so I can integrate it into my
own work I'm breaking on these like
light boxes right now I want to make
some out of acrylic actually so like the
whole thing kind of glows but these are
my first prototypes to see how it would
work and then eventually after I'm done
with this I'm going to paint on the
front of it to give it my Flair and
hopefully people buy it so I guess I
don't have altruistic motives for being
here it's not like a pure love of the
game it's for a job
been back about a year but for about
four years before that I worked in
Afghanistan
I've heard that referred to as Pakistan
conditions a little harsh not as
comfortable as as we might like things
aren't plenty so that causes you to
reach you know to to struggle a little
bit to make things better for yourself
you do that things get a little better
and it just builds momentum if it was
possible to have a place like this and
the place I worked which was Kandahar
wow you too really seen some things they
need a hackerspace
makerspace whatever you like to call it
there who knows maybe one will form
before all sudden done
the maker mentality or the maker
philosophy and was really important to
getting our society going and off the
ground it's gotten us through difficult
times historically and it's something
that unfortunately through our
comfortable lives we've slid away from a
little bit everybody wants to see
Detroit recover one thing that needs to
happen for that to happen is people need
to take ownership in the city they need
to feel proud to be there and they need
to feel like this is my city I'm gonna
make it awesome people need to to look
at this city not as a broken city like a
broken cellphone
they can't just throw it away and just
go well it's broken and we're just not
gonna use it anymore that sort of same
empowerment is what maker spaces and
hyper spaces can give to people
hopefully some of that culture even rubs
off into the people of Detroit I three
Detroit gives people a place that sort
of lets them have unrestricted
creativity right you don't need to think
about a business case you don't need to
think about why it's good for the
company or you know a specific business
unit you can just say wouldn't it be
really cool to have a mind-controlled
flamethrower this is like
oh yes
at the end of the day people build
everything even if it's an industrial
robot that builds something you know at
some point down the line someone had to
build the robot that built the robot
that built the robot right it's giving
that power back to the people
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
