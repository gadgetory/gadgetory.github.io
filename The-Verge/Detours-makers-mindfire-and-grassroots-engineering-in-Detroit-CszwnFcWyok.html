a company called Eaton Corporation and
when I graduated Eaton said we will hire
you but we would like to place you in
southfield michigan which is a suburb of
Detroit I didn't know a lot about
Detroit and so a lot of people told me
you know you're gonna get shot Detroit's
a scary place don't go there but I was
looking for a little bit of an adventure
and I kind of wanted to smudge myself I
mean that I haven't lived anywhere on
sides Minnesota and so I said what the
hell I'll go for it so while I get to be
pretty creative at my job at work I
still have to develop technologies that
are very useful to eating it has to make
sense for you to make that technology
and I thought you know what since I
don't know anybody in this state I'll go
check out this place called i3 detroit
so I three Detroit runs classes and all
classes are run by the members so we
encourage our members to sort of
broadcast their skills to the membership
and to the general public when someone
comes in and builds something they
haven't done before for the first time
they kind of have this like first moment
of like turning on the electronic board
or you know taking the thing out of the
laser cutter and they go this is really
cool I made this for Valentine's Day
this year and I wanted to really impress
my new boyfriend at the time because
he's a computer engineer and I was
googling pictures and I found this
design for a circuit board and I was
like this is something I can do it just
kind of goes through some really pretty
sequences I'm actually really proud of
it because it was the first board that I
made by myself
so traditionally these places have been
called hackerspaces the term hacker is
sort of a misunderstood term what hacker
means at a hacker space is someone who
takes things apart figures out how they
were makes it even better or just
somebody who wants to understand what
makes things run it's sort of having
that curious drive but a lot of people
when they hear the term hacker they
think of somebody stealing their bank
account so some people propose let's
just call these places maker spaces I
don't really see myself as a hacker I
actually do in this space because I
really like to make stuff i doodle and I
paint it's really great to be up here
and watch people use stuff and how they
use stuff so I can integrate it into my
own work I'm breaking on these like
light boxes right now I want to make
some out of acrylic actually so that the
whole thing kind of glows but these are
my first prototypes to see how work and
then eventually after i'm done with this
I'm going to paint on the front of it to
give it my flare then hopefully people
buy it so i guess i don't have
altruistic motives for being here it's
not like a pure love of the game it's
for a job
been back about a year but for about
four years before that I worked in
Afghanistan I've heard that referred to
as hack pianist and conditions a little
harsh not as comfortable as as we might
like things aren't plenty so that causes
you to reach you know to struggle a
little bit to make things better for
yourself you do that things get a little
better and it just builds momentum if it
was possible to have a place like this
and the place I worked which was
Kandahar wow you two really seen some
things they need a hackerspace
makerspace whatever you like to call it
there who knows maybe one will form
before all sudden done
the maker mentality or the maker
philosophy was really important to
getting our society going and off the
ground it's gotten us through difficult
times historically and it's something
that unfortunately through our
comfortable lives we've slid away from a
little bit everybody wants to see
Detroit recover one thing that needs to
happen for that to happen is people need
to take ownership in the city they need
to feel proud to be there and they need
to feel like this is my city I'm going
to make it awesome people need to to
look at this city not as a broken city
like a broken cell phone they can't just
throw it away and just go well it's
broken and we're just not going to use
it anymore that sort of same empowerment
is what maker spaces and hyper spaces
can give to people hopefully some of
that culture even rubs off into the
people of Detroit I three Detroit gives
people a place that sort of lets them
have unrestricted creativity right you
don't need to think about a business
case you don't need to think about why
it's good for the company or you know a
specific business unit you can just say
wouldn't it be really cool to have a
mind-controlled flamethrower oh
this is like
oh yeah
at the end of the day people build
everything even if it's an industrial
robot that builds something you know at
some point down the line someone had to
build the robot that built the robot
that built the robot right it's giving
that power back to the people
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
