based on my favorite part of any
hardware store because it's I don't like
taking a trip back in time I mean you
can still buy this guy which I don't
think it's changed since 1975 and
actually it controls about 50% of the
energy usage in your homes pretty
important it's not very smart now you
can try to upgrade and get somebody this
cost about a hundred dollars and it's
the smart model got a three inch black
and white resistive touchscreen has
Wi-Fi it has a Marvel processor but
because it was essentially designed by a
plumbing company you can see it's kind
of huge it requires external power to
work and it's got this interface with
all these buttons and a bunch of arrows
and stuff they don't make a lot of sense
now I was thinking about something like
this this is an iPod Touch it costs $200
it has a three and a half inch
multi-touch color display you probably
already know how to use it and it's
really thin with integrated Bluetooth
and Wi-Fi and a battery that kind of
lasts forever now what happens if we
take something as smart as this and use
it to control something as important as
that I'm Tony Fadell and I'm CEO of nest
I used to work at Apple for nine years
basically I managed the iPod division
created the iPod 18 generations and then
three generations of the iPhone it took
some time to decompress after running a
running a marathon for nine years we
want to just take some time we went
around the world we traveled all around
and and just kind of got our head out of
Silicon Valley and started really
concentrating on our kids and and and
learning about energy and learning about
how we might be able to leave the world
in a better place for our kids and our
grandkids we were building a green home
in Lake Tahoe my architect actually gave
us a spec for the heating and cooling
system was about fifteen thousand
dollars and then this fifteen thousand
dollar system was controlled by three
hundred fifty dollar thermostats it's
like three hundred fifty dollars
thermostats what do these do cell phones
are less than three hundred fifty
dollars these things got to be amazing
so give me the spec and they give me the
spec and I was like wait a second this
thing has their ugly they look like
computers from the 90s or all beige
boxes they have technology literally
from the 80s inside of them were 90s I'm
like why am I paying for such junk I
said I think I can design a better one
we decided to take all the things that
we've known in terms of building cell
phones and portable devices and a
of expertise to a space of energy
savings that we think is really
important that could help to to reduce
your energy bills and save the world
traditional thermostats today all they
are basically light switches they just
turn on and off these two wires but
there are lots of nuances about how you
turn things on and off there's no
standard interface like we have USB or
firewire or different types of
interfaces for a computer these
interfaces are all different for many
many systems and these systems can be 50
years old so we had to come up with all
the technology to identify the types of
heating and cooling units you have it's
simply a dial because 99.9 percent of
the time
all you're doing is turning up and down
your heating and cooling if you click on
anywhere on the face here or here
that's a button that's all it has is a
ring and a button you can then scroll
through various menu items we have five
different sensors we have temperature of
course and humidity but we also have
light sensors and we also have activity
sensors near and far field activity
centers which gives up a lot of sensor
data to do all kinds of very interesting
things today with the first product and
also in the future we can detect when
you're out of your house for a period of
time and then turn it down to a lower
energy setting when you come home we
turn right back on as if you were at
home the entire time so we've saved that
amount of energy just by you know you
just walking out of the house after the
first five to seven days it learns
everything it needs to know about your
schedule you can actually use our iOS
apps for iPad iPhone Android as well as
a web browser to get into all the
different settings it can help save the
environment and save a lot of money and
by the way it requires guys with my type
of skill to do it's really cool and
we're not going to be competing with
Apple you know we could make another
cell phone or we're but competing with
Apple would be hell on earth let's do
something that is not like Apple let's
go after big dumb slow companies
paparazzi yeah the Caminiti the model
great okay nuts you shooting for the
urge all right here we go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
