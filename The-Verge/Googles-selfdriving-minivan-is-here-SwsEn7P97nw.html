at the Detroit Auto Show where Google
just gave us the first look at its brand
new fully self-driving Chrysler Pacifica
minivan for the first time Google is
making all the autonomous technology
itself that means it's building all its
own vision equipment cameras sensors and
mapping technology instead of buying
parts off-the-shelf like it did before
the lidar laser sensors and camera are
more tightly integrated into the
vehicles architecture it looks like a
minivan that's been built from the
ground up with the specific mission to
drive itself not some car with a bunch
of fancy tech slapped on top these
autonomous minivans are going to hit the
public roads for the first time at the
end of January 2017 in two cities
Mountain View California in Phoenix
Arizona
late last year Google spun off its
self-driving car project into a separate
company called way mo in doing so it
dropped its plans to build its own
self-driving car without steering wheels
and pedals and refocused on Hardware the
idea was that it would start moving away
from using self-driving Lexus SUVs and
start packing these chrysler pacifica x'
with all the autonomous technology
Chrysler's minivans are super roomy and
about as high-tech as cars this size can
get but more importantly they can fit up
to seven passengers which could be
really important if Google decides to
launch its own self-driving taxi service
to compete with uber that's it for now
