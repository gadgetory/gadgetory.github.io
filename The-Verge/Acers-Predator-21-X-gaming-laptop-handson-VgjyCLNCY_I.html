completely insane predator 21x laptop it
is a 21 inch laptop with an ultra wide
display and it costs $9,000 it's the
only laptop in the world ASA says with a
curved display and it's also one of the
very few with a mechanical keyboard it
has two nvidia gtx 10a GPUs inside Intel
kvl expresses 64 gigabytes of RAM
because job to power supply's because
this thing made a lot of power and there
is a warning here that says hot surface
warning do not touch the keyboard is
pretty unusual among laptops and it's a
full mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX
switches these are the brown variety
which let's click even the Blues but may
be better for our gaming performance
above the keyboard you have this window
into the GPU blower or even more flair
you can customize this panel with ASA
design graphics or any image you want
next to the keyboard you have the
trackpad it's kind of tube to the side
which is a bit more unusual but the
reason for that is you can take it off
because it magnetically latches in and
you can turn it into a numpad in case
you want a full-on keyboard for MMO
shortcuts or Excel macros or God knows
what people do with these things and
then below the curved monitor you have
this panel here which is a Toby eye
tracking so you can it's not it's not
really a full control system but it's
been built into a bunch of games like
watchdogs 2 Deus Ex mankind divided so
it's like a kind of supplementary
control scheme where you can move the
camera by looking around with your eyes
unfortunately the only game installed on
this laptop right now is farmville 2 so
not quite the ideal software selection
to test out the gaming performance but
really I don't think you need to test
the gaming performance of this thing it
is clearly an insane luxury device for
people that want the absolute best
laptop physical object thing to put on
their desk it is not comfortable on a
lap I'm sat outside here on this chair
and I am worried I'm about to drop this
$9,000 laptop
probably no one's going to buy this
later knows that it's not it's not news
to them that we are going to call this
an impractical product it being an
impractical product is really kind of
the point it's a demonstration of what
is possible in the laptop if you really
go pulls out and throw every feature
imaginable into something and charge
nine thousand dollars for it I am NOT
going to buy one but I would like you to
buy me one so please add it to your
Christmas list for me and if you're not
a gamer this also serves double duty as
a macbook carrying case</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
