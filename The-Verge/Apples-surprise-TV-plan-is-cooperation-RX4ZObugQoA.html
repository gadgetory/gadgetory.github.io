- Here's the way that CES usually goes.
A ton of companies make
a ton of announcements
and Apple's not here, but they find a way
to remind everybody that they exist.
And that sign back here, that's
another way example of that.
It shows that Apple cares about privacy
the way that nobody else here really does.
Nobody talks about it, and that sucks.
But then, something
weird started happening,
iTunes on Samsung TVs,
AirPlay 2 on every other TVs,
a HomeKit on every damn thing.
Usually, Apple is way too
cool for school at CES,
but this year, seems
like class is in session.
(electronic dance music)
So, this is Google's booth, and
it's gigantic.
They have this wall over here with just
a ton of gadgets on it.
All the usual CES stuff,
because what happens at CES
is like a platform war, so, this year
it's Google Assist versus Alexa.
And, we are telling that
story, but I think there's
a more interesting story
happening here at CES,
and it has to do with TVs.
So, I want to go look at some TVs and see
what is really going on here.
(electronic music)
Welcome to Samsung City.
It is probably the biggest booth at CES.
It's all what we expected
but, what we didn't expect was
a big surprise, is not something
you can see at this booth,
it is iTunes coming to Samsung TVs.
And, okay, yeah,
it's not like 2004 manage
your music database iTunes,
it's iTunes TV and movies,
but it's still, a huge shock.
I mean, somewhere,
somebody is making an iTunes app
for Tizen Samsung TV's operating system.
Just, think about that for a minute
while you stare at the wall.
(electronic music)
Okay, that was nice.
Look, Samsung was crazy enough,
but then things started getting weirder.
LG announced support for
AirPlay 2 and HomeKit.
Visio announced support
for AirPlay 2 and HomeKit.
And then, Sony.
Sony announced support
for AirPlay 2 and HomeKit.
That means that you are
going to be able to ask Siri
to stream an iTunes
movie to and Android TV.
My friends, this is not
how CES usually goes.
CES is the land of platform battles.
It's HDR-10
versus Dolby Vision,
it's VHS versus Betamax.
It's Blueray versus HD-DVD.
All these companies start these big fights
and they try to make the other company sad
by being the winner and
they just fight it out.
Instead, this year it's all
hugs, and working together
and Kumbaya, I don't know
how to feel about any of it.
I'm honestly a little bit scared.
I need to go find something
comforting right now.
(relaxing electronic music)
So, look, this is what all this
making nice is actually all about.
Sometime this year, Apple
needs to launch a TV service.
You know how I know that?
Cause of all this make nice stuff.
And also because also, Tim Cook,
he kinda said so, basically,
in the C-NBC interview.
- On services,
you will see us announce
new services this year.
- Okay, let's say your Apple,
you wanna launch a TV service.
You want as many people as possible
to pay for this TV service.
So, what do you do?
Well, you start making nice
with the rest of the TV industry
so that your app will get on more TVs.
But, here's the thing about that.
That list of TVs that are
gonna support AirPlay,
it's actually pretty short,
and it's only new TVs
or very recent TVs, and so,
something else has to happened.
And, I kinda have a guess
on what it's gonna be,
and it kinda has to do with TCL.
So yeah, TCL, Apple didn't
cut a deal with TCL.
They're one of the biggest
TV makers in America.
They didn't cut a deal with Roku,
which is what runs on a bunch of TDL TVs.
They haven't cut a deal
with Amazon Fire TV yet.
So, yeah, I think you should
expect Apple to make apps
for all those platforms in the future.
And ya know what?
That could actually be good for your data.
One of the things about all of
the TVs we've talked about today
is they aggressively track
everything that you watch,
and some cases, they sell that data.
But Apple's not letting
them when you use AirPlay.
When you use AirPlay 2 to stream a video
to any of these TVs,
Apple's making the manufacturers
block the tracking.
(soft electronic music)
All of which brings me back
to this banner right here.
Apple may be willing to,
you know, AirPlay ball with
the rest of the industry,
but that doesn't mean
that they're giving up
they're privacy stance.
And that's great, I was sort of expecting
to see Siri versus
Google versus Alexa here,
but it turns it out it's more like
HomeKit versus the other assistants.
And maybe that's because
Siri's not ready yet
and we'll get that next
year, but whatever.
This year, I'm just
happy to see more stuff
that works with other stuff, altogether.
You can have a
Samsung TV running Tizen
OS that you can control
with Bixby, or Google, or Alexa.
Or you can run the iTunes app on it.
That's wild.
And, if that isn't the most
heartwarming CES story ever,
I don't know what is.
You know what else makes me feel better,
these LG rolling TVs behind me here.</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
