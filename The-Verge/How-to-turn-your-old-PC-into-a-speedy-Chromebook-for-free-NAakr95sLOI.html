gathering dust somewhere or a PC so slow
and loud you're afraid to turn it on
today we're going to show you a few
simple steps for breathing new life into
that machine turning it into a
Chromebook for free I'm gonna be using
software from a New York City startup
called Neverwhere it's helping schools
turn their old outdated hardware into
Chromebooks step 1 check to make sure
your machine is among the several
thousand units that are compatible with
never wears collaborative system step 2
get an 8 or 16 gigabyte USB thumb drive
and download the cloud ready software
from never wears web site onto your USB
stick step 3 plug that USB stick into
your computer turn it on you'll need to
hold down a couple keys to have the
device boot into the thumb drive it
varies by device you can check never
wears website for details step 4 install
the cloud writing software onto your old
device this will wipe out your old
operating system and everything on your
hard drive if you prefer you can choose
the dual boot option that allows you to
pick between cloud ready and your old
operating system every time you power on
it also preserves whatever was stored in
your computer there are a few
restrictions so check Neverwhere site to
ensure your device is compatible
step 5 install flash it's optional but a
good idea then login with your Google
credentials and you're ready to go step
6
you've now got a brand new Chrome device
what next you can head on over to the
Chrome Web Store and download some
applications Spotify Netflix even a
virtual reality viewer
step 7 if you want to get really fancy
you can actually boot into cloud ready
right from the USB stick without
installing anything on your old machine
so you can plug this into a compatible
machine wherever you are it's like
carrying the world's smallest Chromebook
around in your pocket it's pretty fun to
bring an old machine out of retirement
and in our experience you can get great
performance running Chrome on an old
machine that's one of the really
delightful ironies of the cloud
computing age you have more Hardware
packed into a five to ten year old
machine than you do with a brand new
Chromebook just coming to market
