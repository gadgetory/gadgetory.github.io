here we finally know it's inside the big
box it is the Apple watch first thing
you need to know is it won't be
available until early 2015 it's going to
start at 3:40
there's a whole bunch of features on
here the most important one for Apple is
this digital crown which we're running
through a demo loop here so you won't
actually see it do anything but it is a
zoom and it also lets you scroll through
stuff it's the primary interface for
this watch however it also has a
touchscreen it measures two different
kinds of taps you can just tap it but it
also measures force so if you tap it
hard
they call that a force touch and that's
what you bring up little activities and
so on there's another button on the side
here that brings up apple's custom
messaging app so you can send little
drawings to each other you can also send
your heartbeat to each other which is
pretty crazy if you swipe up you get
these things called glances and that's
like customizable information letting
you see you know your calendar
information and so on and then
notifications pop up you feel though the
taptic feedback they call it you just
turn your wrist up the screen turns on
and you see it so that's a super quick
look at the Apple watch can actually
show you this band here as well because
we can remove it here I'm not used to
how these band works there we go
I'm kind of clumsy on the back you can
see there's these sensors here so
measuring your heart rate look at the
digital crown on the side these straps
actually slide right out they click in
and out which lets you you know
customize they've got a whole bunch of
different route straps it comes in two
different sizes and it also comes with
lots of different varieties there's a
solid gold one there's a sports one and
then there's the standard license so
there you go that's just a very super
quick look of the Apple watch on a demo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
