Verge and I am wearing the new version
of Samsung's gear VR VR viewer now
there's not a ton of differences between
this and previous versions but I'm going
to point out the most important ones one
of them
skateboarding down a hill first off we
have a whole new touchpad Samsung's
really smooth it out so that it doesn't
have those grooves anymore it's just a
more flat touchpad and obviously this is
a whole new color we were used to the
gear VR being white this is more of like
a black blue kind of echoes some of this
style that Samsung put in its other
products recently another big difference
is that there's a new dedicated button
to bring you right back to oculus home
so you can get to the menus faster they
didn't remove the back button though so
that's still there if you need to want
if you want to just go through the menus
step by step another big change is
there's more cushioning on this one it
also feels like it breeds a little
better so that you don't fog up the
lenses easily because and that's a good
thing because there's actually a wider
field of view this time around 101
degrees versus 96 on the last version
whoa and now the last big difference
between this and previous gear VR
versions is that since this is coming
out with the note 7 it's actually USB
type-c connector in here but it's
modular so you can take the little piece
out that connects the USB type-c swap in
one that will come with the new gear VR
that is micro USB so all of Samsung's
other new phones s7 s7 edge and the
phone before it will be backwards
compatible with this new gear VR this is
going to cost the same as the last
version in gear VR $99 it's going to be
available August 19th when all the other
new stuff from Samsung drops like the
note 7 in the gear 360 yeah that's it
this is the new gear VR from Samsung I'm
gonna keep skateboarding see you guys
later but what's cool is that
it's actually shoot we can start back at
that spot right yeah yeah
