it might surface - it's just been an
ounce and what the first thing you
notice is it looks kind of the same as
the surface RT at the front if you spin
it some back there's a nice silver
option and most is actually taking away
the windows logo and replaced it with
the surface one at the black game and so
you apart from that visually it kind of
looks the same and got the usual volume
controls here and the speakers are
slightly bigger and the camera at the
front and the usual USB at the underside
and the power connector the real big
change with surface 2 and service pro 2
is the kickstand this is the normal
position and if I place it down
you notice that's the normal position
what you can actually do now is you can
pull it slightly further out and their
mics a-pink's the this is gonna be used
slightly better on on the lap we'll have
to test that out fully but it certainly
looks like a better angle to sort of
rest on your knees and it kind of clicks
into place and it holds it's fairly
sturdy doesn't look like it's gonna move
too much and now the other news sort of
thing today is a new type cover 2 which
has a bunch of new colors so this is the
pink options coming in blue as well now
this is actually thinner than the
original type cover by about a
millimeter and the the actual surface is
also a little thinner - and actually
overall it feels really light even with
the the cover on and it especially with
the cover cover off it's actually
considerably noticeably lighter and I
surf the original surface LT wasn't
particularly heavy so I wasn't really a
complaint but it's nice to see them sort
of trimming it down and making it a bit
lighter the other thing on the touch
cover is sort of see back there and
there's less sort of travel on the keys
so they've improved things with the new
sensors there and apart from that it's a
good check for processor much response
out to HD on the display so you can say
a couple of apps alongside each other it
doesn't look like in snap free ups here
and so funny side-by-side so
the young got the option and it seems
very fast though it's a lot better than
with surface RT and it was kind of one
of our original complaints about how how
sway that device was so they're
obviously making some pretty good
improvements overall this is a speck
bump and it's kind of a very similar
looking surface to the original and that
was the surface to but marks of</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
