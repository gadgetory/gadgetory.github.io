with Time Warner Cable the problem its
argument is complete I'm adi
robertson and this is 90 seconds on the
verge this week comcast is laying out
its arguments to the FCC for purchasing
Time Warner Cable basically it's defense
breaks down into two main points one
comcast is not directly competing with
Time Warner Cable in any market and to
the consumers still have lots of other
options for internet and TV well the
first point is technically true it fails
to acknowledge the sheer size of a
combined Comcast Time Warner Cable
network and the power it could wield if
the acquisition is approved Comcast
would have a combined 30 million
subscribers for internet and TV that
would be over three times the next
largest service as far as Comcast
arguing there will still be plenty of
competition out there it's important to
note what comcast considers competition
the company defines its businesses
internet and video that means that any
media box or video service from netflix
and youtube to even Apple and Facebook
Comcast counts as competition but the
thing is all those services actually
require Comcast to function and Comcast
argument about internet competition is
even flimsy Google fiber's potential
expansion is listed despite only
operating in two small markets right now
Comcast then goes for the mother of all
exaggerations by claiming 4G LTE
wireless as a potential choice for
customers despite having slower speeds
and much much smaller data caps for the
price none of this even takes into
account Comcast ownership of
nbcuniversal and all its properties for
more on the Comcast Time Warner Cable
merger check out the verge coming up
Comcast completes the last step in
vertical integration by acquiring your
