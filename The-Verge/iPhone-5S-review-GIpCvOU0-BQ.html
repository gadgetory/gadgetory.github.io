this is the iPhone 5s
this is Apple's flagship phone but it's
the mid cycle version like the 4s and
3GS before it this device comes with a
bunch of changes in improvements but no
huge design refresh on the plus side at
least this year unlike with the 4s
people will know you bought a new phone
yes the 5s is the same brushed aluminum
shell and chamfered edges as ever as
light and thin and comfortable in one
hand as ever I do wish there were an
option with a slightly bigger screen but
overall it's still hard to beat the
design and construction of the iPhone 5s
but it has new color options which give
it a great new look there's silver the
same color you can get on the 5 but now
there's also Space Gray a slightly
lighter version of last year's model
that I actually like better and then
there's gold the surprising new entrant
looks great the only other design
changes on the front of the 5s where
Apple has redesigned the home button
you'll press countless times every day
now there's a ring around the button
that matches the color of your phone
it's designed so that the iPhone 5s can
read your fingerprint which enables
easily the most innovative feature on
the 5s touch ID basically touch ID
replaces your itunes password and your
device PIN requiring only that you tap
on the button with your finger it'll
recognize up to five different fingers
so you and your family can all use your
phone and it's virtually instantaneous
it can be finicky at first while it gets
to know all the different ways and
angles you might touch the phone to turn
it on but it pretty quickly starts to
work perfectly as long as you really do
put your finger on there the 5s runs on
Apple's new a7 processor which comes
with the m7 coprocessor the m7 takes
inputs from the compass accelerometer
and other sensors and together they let
the phone tell when you're driving or
when the phone's idle or when you get
out of the car and start walking the a7
itself is kind of the same story it's
good now but there's really nothing to
do with all the power it offers Iowa 7
works great on the device even smoother
and faster than on the iPhone 5 but it's
not a massive difference all our
benchmarks and tests though say it's
remarkably faster and I think the
problem is that we're just not seeing
there are many apps that make use of its
power or its 64-bit architecture yet the
big question with the 5s is whether or
not you should upgrade from the iPhone 5
if you have a 4s or earlier of course
you should upgrade but if you have a 5
and you care about taking pictures you
probably showed as well the 8 megapixel
camera on the iPhone 5s is fantastic
it's the same megapixel count as the
iPhone 5 but the average
faster and more importantly the sensor
is bigger which means individual pixels
capture more light that makes the iPhone
5s a much better camera when lighting is
bad
the a7 processor also lets you use image
stabilization in your photos zoom in and
out wider shooting videos and best of
all shoot slow motion video it shoots at
120 frames per second at 720p then plays
back at 30 frames per second giving you
an awesome run from normal speed to slow
motion and back again the processor also
makes for better photos just because
it's able to shoot so many more of them
the phone captures 10 frames per second
and if you ask it to it will
automatically choose the best one for
you though I wound up just picking
myself a lot
regardless using burst mode is really
easy and a great failsafe if you want to
make sure you always get the right shot
so is the true tone flash but I almost
never use that it uses two different
colored flashes to light your subject
better and match the scene around you
and it's definitely better than most
flashes but it's still a lot worse than
just not using a flash battery was the
one slight disappointment in the 5s
upgrade that's not to say it's bad it's
not it's not even worse it's just not
meaningfully better than the iPhone 5
you'll get a full day as long as you
don't use it constantly but nothing more
the iPhone 5s starts at $199 for 16
gigabytes of storage and it's the best
iPhone ever but of course it is there
are plenty of cool features here but
Apple and developers both need to work
to get the most out of the a7 the m7 and
even from your fingerprint and for those
still wanting a bigger screen there are
plenty of alternatives like the HTC One
and the Moto X that the 5s doesn't
exactly leave in the dust
I like the iPhone 5s a lot and it's
still probably the best overall
smartphone on the market but the best
may still be yet to come
