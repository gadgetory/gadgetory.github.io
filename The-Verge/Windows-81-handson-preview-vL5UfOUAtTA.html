and this is a first look at Windows 8.1
first things first the new start screen
windows 8.1 now looks a lot more like
Windows Phone and that's a very good
thing you can hold and select individual
tiles to resize them large versions
display more information and the smaller
ones let you squeeze more into your
Start screen you can also group them
move multiple tiles at once and
generally set things up the way you want
without banging your head against a wall
pulling apps around want to see all your
apps just swipe up you can also finally
set your own Start screen background
even ones that move as you scroll around
or you could set the Start screen to
your desktop background for a less
jarring transition when you switch to
desktop mode unfortunately the Windows
8.1 preview doesn't show some of the
most dynamic backgrounds that Microsoft
is shown off like this red dragon that
swoops around as you move through the
Start screen speaking of the desktop
Microsoft is now brought back an old
friend the controversial Start button
it's literally a button and there's no
actual Start menu here but there's also
additional options to boot directly to
the desktop and disable some of the hot
corners that bring up the charms and
recent apps perhaps the biggest change
in Windows 8.1 is the integration of
Bing search you can swipe in to reach
the search charm or just start typing on
the Start screen and get apps settings
files and web results where this really
gets interesting is when you search for
an actual person if we look for our
fearless leader Joshua Topolsky were
immediately thrown into this new
fullscreen hero experience where
pictures and information really pop
search for a pop star like Rihanna and
you'll get an even richer experience
where you can immediately access songs
and videos
Microsoft is redesigning its mail client
for Windows 8.1 sadly it's not ready yet
but it does pull a neat trick
it can context truly snap a new window
into place to open photos or web links
the Photos app pops up in a 60-40 split
view and allows you to edit images right
then in there there's a neat little
option to enhance individual colors by
dropping a pin
and spinning a virtual dial if you click
a link in the mail app you can see two
apps sharing the screen equally that's
new for Windows 8.1 believe it or not
you can readjust with the slider and
snap multiple apps alongside each other
if you plug in a desktop monitor you'll
even be able to snap additional apps on
extra displays or use the devices charm
to project your content onto a miracast
display there are a lot more app and
prove Montano splay in Windows 8.1 the
new Internet Explorer 11 is catching up
to the competition now supporting
unlimited tabs and adding a reading list
so you can save articles for later
both those tabs and the list are synced
to other Windows 8.1 devices and Windows
Phone using Microsoft SkyDrive the
keyboard across the OS has also been
improved letting you quickly
autocomplete by swiping across the
suggestions with the spacebar and enter
numbers more easily Xbox music has been
redesigned to make it easier to access
content and the camera app lets you take
a 360-degree panorama just by filling in
missing puzzle pieces so to speak Bing
Food &amp;amp; Drink is a cooking app which lets
you get your hands dirty just swipe your
hands in the air in front of your
computer's camera and move forward in
the recipe it'll be interesting to see
if Microsoft opens up this functionality
to third-party apps as well overall 8.1
is in refinement over Windows 8 it
addresses key complaints and includes a
lot of minor changes that add up to a
big improvement in usability it's in
preview today but Microsoft intends to
ship a final version later this year
