starts around $1300,
is perhaps the most
interesting laptop I've used
in a long time.
(mellow music)
Now, we've seen and used laptops
made out of all kinds of
different plastics and metals.
But this one is made
out of actual leather.
If it works, it could mean that
have a super unique computer
instead of just another gray slab.
Fortunately, this thing
is better than I expected.
And the downfalls,
well, I can't really
blame them on the leather.
The first most obvious thing about this
is that it has leather.
It's wrapped in freaking leather.
Like, this isn't a case, it's
literally part of the laptop.
And it's not plastic-y,
rubbery, fake leather, either.
It's real.
It's...
It's honest to god leather.
Now, HP says it's using the
scraps from other leather goods
to make the Folio.
Now leather obviously gives
the Folio a unique look,
but it also gives it a
different feel when you use it.
It wraps all the way
around the laptop's deck,
so your palms are wresting on soft leather
instead of cold metal.
There's no real exposed
sharp edges with this laptop.
Everything you touch is
buffered by this leather.
And it should prove to be more durable
than the Alcantara fabric
that Microsoft uses
on the Surface laptop.
Though, if I'm being honest with you,
I haven't really used this long enough
to put that to the test.
But, after about a month of use,
it still basically looks brand new.
Now, the one knock I
can really point to you
with the Folio's leather construction
is that it makes the laptop heavy.
It weighs about 3.26 pounds,
which is more than half a pound heavier
than a Surface Laptop 2,
and a quarter pound more
than even a 13-inch MacBook Pro.
Now, that doesn't sound
like a lot on paper,
but it's definitely something of notice
when you're using the
Folio for a few weeks.
(upbeat music)
The other big difference between
the Folio and other laptops
is its hinge design.
Instead of having a
flip-around, 360-degree hinge
or a removable screen
like so many other Windows 2-in-1 laptops,
the Folio screen has a flex
point right in the middle of it.
It allows you to pull it
forward for a tent setup,
which is great for
watching movies on a plane,
or push it almost completely flat
for a more tablet-like position.
The hinge is actually stiff enough
to hold the screen in
a variety of positions
between the tent mode and fully flat.
So, if you're using the included pen
to draw or write on it,
you can set up the ideal
angle and just get to work.
Inside, the Folio I've been reviewing
is a fanless Y-Series Core i7 processor,
which is not the most
powerful processor available.
But it can handle productivity tests
without much issue at all.
Honestly, I really expected this processor
to be a bigger problem than it is.
Intel's Y-Series chips
tend to get bogged down really easily,
but for my day-to-day work,
it's been completely confident.
Now, the entry-level Spectre Folio,
the one that cost 1300 bucks,
has a Core i5 chip and eight gigs of RAM.
So, I can't speak to the
performance on that one.
But the $1800 model I've been testing,
which has an i7 chip,
16 gigs of RAM and LTE,
has been just fine.
Now, the Y-Series chip runs cool, too,
even though the Folio doesn't have a fan.
And I'm not sure if it's the leather
that prevents heat from reaching my lap
or if the processor just
doesn't heat up as much
as in other laptops,
but the Folio remains comfortable
the entire times that use it.
Even more,
that processor enables incredible
battery life in the Folio,
easily lasting more than
a full workday for me,
even when I'm using
batter-hogging apps like Slack.
That's more than basically
every other premium Windows or Mac laptop
can go for me at this point.
The Folio's other odds
and ends are solid, too.
It's got a Windows Hello
webcam for face login,
three USB-C ports, two of
which are Thunderbolt 3,
a comfortable back lit keyboard
with good travel and feel,
and the most interesting thing of all,
an option for integrated LTE
with a SIM card cleverly hidden
inside the Folio's hinge.
It supports AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Sprint,
but not Verizon, for some reason.
(mellow music)
So, that's a lot of good,
or even great, things with the Folio.
But this computer isn't
free from problems.
There are three things that
kind of keep this laptop
from being as good as it could be.
Let's start with the display.
Now, I mostly like this screen.
The 1080p model that I've
been testing is bright,
has good colors at viewing angles,
and it only uses one watt of power,
which helps with that battery life.
But it's 16:9 aspect
ratio feels super cramped
compared to the 3:2 or 16:10 screen
you get on a Surface
computer or Mac laptop.
It also has this giant chin at the bottom,
which wouldn't be so bad
if it didn't remind me
every time I see it, it
would be a lot smaller
if the Folio had a 3:2 screen.
Worse than the screen
are the Folio speakers.
They are loud and clear,
and they can be really
good for video calls,
but they sound super sharp and
sibilant for music or movies.
And there's basically
zero bass reproduction.
If you're using the tent
position to watch a movie,
that sound echos inside this little
triangle chamber that's formed
and it makes it even worse.
Fortunately, there is a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack.
And then the worst part about
the Folio is its track pad.
The track pad's a little small,
but I could live with that
if it had good drivers,
which it doesn't.
HP is basically the last laptop
maker that's still not using
Microsoft's precision drivers
on its premium laptops,
and it sticks these crappy
Synaptic ones on it instead.
There is support for multi-touch gestures
and two finger scrolling,
but response is laggy,
and it's just frustrating to
use for long periods of time.
The entire time I was
using this computer at CES,
I was cursing myself for not
bringing a mouse along with me.
It's really that bad.
All that said,
I obviously really like
a lot of the things
HP has done with the folio.
The leather construction
looks and feels unique,
the hinge is awesome,
battery life and performance
are surprisingly great,
and it has built-in
LTE, which is something
every computer should come
with, but is still a rarity.
HP just needs to make a
for example simple fixes:
update the drivers on the track pad,
bring the screen into a modern age
with a modern aspect ratio,
and adjust these speakers,
and I could see the next
Spectre Folio being a slam dunk
as one of the best Windows
laptops on the market.
But until that happens, you
might wanna wait on this one.
Hey thanks for watching.
I'm curious,
what other materials would you like to see
a laptop made out of?
Is leather cool?
Maybe felt?
I don't know, a blanket?
