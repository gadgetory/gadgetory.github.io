2014 your car's gonna turn into a
smartphone here's why the concept is
that you have something very similar to
say the App Store on iOS or the Android
Market where you download apps from what
Chevy is calling the app shop and I can
pull that up here and it actually shows
me a list of apps that are available
this is all coming through a 4G an LTE
connection that's attached to the car
they have an announced pricing yet but
it'll be going through AT&amp;amp;T in the US
but if you don't want that connection
you can also pair via bluetooth to your
phone and use that connection if you
want of course Chevy is recommending
that you use their connection the idea
being that the antenna provides a
stronger signal so when you're in a weak
signal area you'll still be able to pull
in possibly an LTE connection where you
wouldn't be able to on your phone once
you have the apps that you want you can
rearrange them on the screen just like
you would a tablet or a smartphone and
there are a few that that Chevy has
ready to go and will be available at
launch you have Priceline tune in the
Weather Channel I Heart Radio NPR
slacker kaliki event seeker and city
seeker you heard me mention a number of
streaming radio apps and those actually
do pull down over the LTE connection so
we'll have to see how pricing goes but
if say theoretically 18t uses mobile
share for this they'll be pulling out of
your regular data bucket you're gonna
have to be very careful you can imagine
going on a long road trip pandora is
playing you're not really thinking about
it and the next thing you know you've
burned through a couple gig of data so
that'll be something that that we have
to start worrying about now now a car
like the stingray has a number of
different displays you have a full-color
heads-up display up here you have an LCD
and in the instrument cluster and then
you have a rather large touchscreen LCD
in the center stack of the car these
apps only work with the center stack
it's a one screen setup it's not pushing
data out to the instrument cluster or
the heads-up display and you can imagine
how that's kind of a safety and security
thing they want to keep the apps in the
sandbox GM also says that there will be
a capability for the apps to have
different displays or features available
depending on whether
cars stationary or if you're driving so
that when you're at speed
for instance certain complex features
that take your eyes off the road aren't
available that's not to say that a
passenger isn't in the car but still
it's a safety thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
