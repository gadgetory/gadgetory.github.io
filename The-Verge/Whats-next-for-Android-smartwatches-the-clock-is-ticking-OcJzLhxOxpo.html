there just aren't very many good
smartwatches for Android users but since
then a whole lot has happened there's a
new chip that's coming out for where OS
smartwatches and there's a new version
of where OS its 2.0 and it's coming out
to smartwatches right now and it has a
whole new interface but oh wait actually
now it says it's where OS 2.1 they they
keep changing it I mean I don't know
whatever the important thing is it's the
new version of where or less here's a
question has anything really changed
where OS as you know works with both
iPhones and Android phones but the truth
is if you have an iPhone and you want a
SmartWatch your best option it really is
the new Apple watch it's it's really
great but if you have an Android phone I
still think you're basically looking at
those same three options I talked about
in the last video and just to review
that is a where OS SmartWatch it is a
third-party SmartWatch with the screen
or a hybrid SmartWatch which doesn't
have a screen now I think right now the
best third-party SmartWatch is the
Galaxy watch which is nice but I kind of
don't like it if you're not using a
Samsung phone because there's a bunch of
extra software and the hybrid
smartwatches they're fighting they're
still doing their thing but the real
question is what's going on now with
where OS and actually there's quite a
lot welcomed has announced a new
processor for where OS it's called the
snapdragon 3100 and before you get too
excited about it the main thing that you
should know about it is that it has a
little co processor that runs the thing
in ambient mode and also can detect all
the sensors and it allows it to run in
low power for a longer time but the main
processor isn't any faster so it still
feels basically the same when you use it
that's not necessarily a problem
assuming that where OS has been updated
to work better on like the existing
chips so I've been using where Oso the
past week or so and you know what it's
been updated to work better but the
other thing about this new processor is
we haven't seen any watches using it yet
that may seem confusing cuz you may have
seen that a bunch of smart watches just
gonna announced at that tech show in
Berlin called Aoife but you should know
that all those watches still have the
old processor and here's one of them
right here it's the fossil Q Explorer HR
Gen 4 and the HR stands for heart rate
because it can read your heart right now
it costs two hundred fifty five bucks
the other new thing that it has is
NFC so you can use it with Google pay
and you know honestly it's pretty nice
it's got a really big screen it's you
know kind of thick but it's not too
thick and I think it looks pretty good
and I do kind of like it but I don't
know if I like it to the tune of two
hundred and fifty five dollars for a
SmartWatch with an old processor kind of
like it you know what I mean
also honestly the battery life it's it's
not that great at a high level the
biggest change is that Google seems to
have feared out what a smart watches for
finally or maybe again I don't know
Google seems to have a really clear idea
if you take a look at what's happening
here you begin to see something really
important so let's look at the new
gestures on where OS so when you swipe
down from the top you get a new quick
settings screen and it's just a lot more
coherent than before there's a whole lot
of new buttons here there's a Google pay
button so if you have NFC you can just
turn on Google pay really quickly
there's a button to find your phone
right away do not disturb
airplane mode it's just it's a much
nicer quick settings interface now if
you swipe up you get the new
notifications interface and it is way
better than the last version of where OS
because everything is on a single
scrollable sheet you can still expand
them you can still see stuff grouped and
you can still swipe stuff away to get
smeared on your phone good job way
better thank you for making it the way
it was now from the home screen if you
swipe right swipe right yes well if you
swipe left to go to the right swiping is
hard I'd be really bad at tinder by the
way it's a good thing I'm old anyway you
get to the new version of Google Fit
which just got updated it's got two new
scores and Google really simplified it
and made it easier to understand so good
job there Google and then when you swipe
right you get to the left-hand screen
which is the Google feed this is the
place where you can see you know ambient
information you're gonna get the weather
you're gonna get what Google thinks is
you know the next thing in your calendar
or whatever this is where they can be a
little bit more experimental put it all
together look at all the stuff in the
new gestures what do you really see well
here's what I see number one I see an
operating system that is maybe slightly
faster and a little bit more responsive
than it was before now this could just
be new watch syndrome anytime you get a
new gadget you just think it's faster
but I don't know
I do think Google has optimized things
just a little bit number two
finally we see a coherent focus on the
two things that people most want out of
a SmartWatch fitness and notifications
both of those things are way better now
and they're easy to get to from the home
screen or the watch face anyway the
features are more purposeful now and
they're also more useful especially
google fit now Google isn't trying to
compete at every level with the Apple
watch Google fit is maybe just a little
bit more basic than the health stuff on
the Apple watch but you know what it
works and I do think it's enough for a
lot of people and then the third thing
that we see here and this might be the
most important one there is room to grow
and especially in the Google feed is it
great yet now maybe it will be someday
that's always how we feel about the
Google feed but it is a place where
Google can experiment with new features
and ideas without mucking around with
the core functions of the SmartWatch add
those three things up and what I think
we're really looking at here is a reset
where OS is now simpler and it's easier
to understand and that's more than I've
been able to say about it for kind of a
long time so I want to go back to that
very very first question has anything
changed well you know what let's look at
what I said in the last video and see if
it still holds up now when you use an
Android phone and you want to wear a
SmartWatch your choices are actually
kind of grim yeah you know what grim is
mean but it's not wrong the problem with
where OS is Google hasn't done right by
its users with this platform the new
update actually shows Google listening
to its users and I'm really happy about
it the third-party apps are like not
that great if you can find them at all
and digging through the piles and piles
of watch faces to find the one good one
that you like just takes forever
Google recently put this like quality
like filter on the App Store for iOS so
that really low quality junky stuff kind
of will go away so hopefully that will
make it easier to find the good watch
faces and what few good apps there
actually are I kind of want to go back
to where OS which seems like a really
bad choice yeah I actually kind of liked
it especially with this new interface
it's great as long as you know
you don't need to have your watch work
after 10:00 p.m. because the battery
dies even though it might be the right
choice for me I don't think I can
recommend a wear LS watch to really
anybody else still true but that might
not be the case forever and let me
explain why wear OS is in a much better
place now than it was six months ago and
that comes down to Google solving the
same problem that Apple solved with its
watch knowing what a SmartWatch is for
Time Fitness notifications everything
else is stuff you build on top of that
foundation and foundations should be
simple and sturdy and wear OS it finally
is but that doesn't mean that now is a
great time to buy o arrow s SmartWatch
sorry it's worth waiting to see what
these new qualcomm processors do on new
smartwatches and if it makes a big
difference and honestly it's worth
waiting to see software wise what Google
can build on top of this new foundation
hey everybody thank you so much for
watching you know we made this video
because so many of you were asking for
an update to our last SmartWatch video
and I don't know if you like this kind
of video let me know in the comments
maybe we'll do it again sometime
lastly have you ever listened to our
podcast the verge cast I co-hosted with
Nilay Patel and Paul Miller it's fun you
should go to listen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
