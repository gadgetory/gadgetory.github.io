room we've wanted one set top box to
rule them all something that would
combine live TV on-demand streaming
services and a cloud DVR well today a
company called Manhattan says that
they've cracked it about two years ago
they released an iOS app that help you
discover movies and TV shows across all
different kinds of apps it turns out the
whole time they were actually working on
hardware a set-top box that would do all
those things I just described more we
came down to their offices in san mateo
to see what they've been working on so
around here we call it the the friday
evening problem and so the friday
evening problem is you know you come
back home and sort of you want to watch
a movie whether on your own or with your
wife i'll go find out the whole family
and there's a the session you're going
to go through in terms of finding
something to watch it's going to be one
that's going to end up in frustration so
we call this a friday evening product
and as a company we've been focused on
creating a entertainment experience that
is one that's you know immersive and
simple and joyful and we've done that on
ipad where we launched an app an app
that ties together all the different
streaming services but when it came to
the living room the issue was actually a
lot a lot more pronounced because of you
know the different remote controls we
are dribbling with and so we decided to
set up with our own hardware mostly
because we realized that there was not a
clear platform that was built and that
scale in the living room already in
which you could sort of run a service
black time without touch remote you can
literally flip the channel right now i'm
watching a channel and i want to peek
what's on the channel to the right so
I'm going to sort of swab it in and you
see with my set of grabbing in oh if
that's a dentist shows okay maybe i'll
see what's on the other side on the
other side is okay american figures cool
well i can click through a bunch of
channel or do this right oh cool it's a
movie i want to watch so so i can sit
down and watch it if i want to browse
through the the other channels i can
bring up the overlay and here again i'm
literally going to swipe through those
as if it was a giant tablet
and it becomes really natural to sort of
check out either all the channels or
here you go to full history of the
channels you just watched and so it's
kind of like think of it as a browser
where I can go back and through all the
sort of bread crumbs of channels that
I've watched its kind of the simplest to
kiedy experienced attorney you can have
and also the the most fun one because
I'm essentially using the remote to
swipe through different channels it's
very cool we still think that the logic
of adding yet one more device you know
and daisy chain it with the other
devices and sort of overlaying one user
interface on top of another and having
sort of an infrared blaster coming back
and trying to control the other device
is really kludgy and in 2013 they ought
to be a better solution so this was our
ideas to create a device that really is
the only one you need so that you can
also have only one remote control to
advance the experience I think it
actually doesn't matter how big of a
company you are on how many hundreds of
people you have working on it in fact I
think most of the kids are most of the
time it's a question of focus so we
build the software and now we build the
hard way up to grow with a software so
we can deliver something that security a
really a compelling user experience
that's fancy v it's coming out later
this year there's still a lot of things
you don't know about it how much it'll
cost what cable companies that will be
available on as of right now there is no
version plan for course others you have
to have the cable company
music but if the hardware we've seen and
the user interface that we play with or
any indication is quickly just the kind
of set top box that a lot of us have
been looking for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
