that's the vision Google has I'm Nathan
sie Kurt and this is 90 seconds on the
verge Google has posted the module
developer kit or MDK for project ara
it's documentation that provides exact
specifications for manufacturers that
want to create stuff for the upcoming
piecewise smart phone so here's the gist
project ara breaks down a smartphone
into various modules like camera battery
and processor those modules all attached
to an endoskeleton the company has
outlined three different sizes for ara
endoskeletons sectioned off by the spine
and various ribs that's Google
terminology not ours only Google will
build the endoskeletons for now but it
wants third parties to create an
ecosystem of modules those will be sized
to fit in one by one one by two or two
by two slots and will lock in via an
electro permanent magnet that applies to
both the rear modules and the front
which fits various display sizes
speakers and even a keyboard if you want
one the MDK hints at some pretty
ambitious thinking on Google's part
listing potential module ideas like
health sensors and even thermal image
cameras I mean say I wanted to ditch my
posh city life and move to the
wilderness I could potentially build a
phone with a massive battery and even a
built-in dart gun okay I might be
dreaming a bit too big on that last part
really the biggest question is will
consumers care about an upgradable phone
we'll find out soon actually Google
hopes to have the first our phones on
sale early next year for more on project
ara check out the verge coming up
exhibit and I get to work on our own
modular phone that can make calls steam
of s and make Fettuccine Alfredo at the
same time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
