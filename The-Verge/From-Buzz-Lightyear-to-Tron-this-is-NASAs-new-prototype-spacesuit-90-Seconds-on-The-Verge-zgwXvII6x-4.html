this well NASA has the answer I'm Ross
Miller and this is 90 seconds on the
verge
you might recall last month NASA asked
the internet to choose a design for its
next generation z2 spacesuit the agency
presented three options entitled
biomimicry technology in the very catchy
trends in society after over 230,000
votes a statistical majority picked
technology a design that quote pays
homage to spacesuit achievements of the
past while incorporating subtle elements
of the future the design is
unquestionably reminiscent of Tron
that's still a marked improvement over
the Buzz Lightyear inspired z1 suit from
2012 the z2 is also a functional
improvement over its predecessor with a
hard composite upper torso and materials
more compatible for a full vacuum
environment now to be clear the z2 suit
isn't intended for use in space now or
ever
NASA Z's series is actually for testing
purposes only developed under the
agency's advanced exploration systems
project come November when the suit is
expected to be fully built NASA is
planning on conducting multiple vacuum
chamber tests to mimic the lack of
atmosphere in space it'll also be tested
at the neutral buoyancy lab a huge
indoor pool used to train astronauts on
space walking the results of those tests
and others will go into the eventual
design of z3 which will hopefully allow
for more mobility after all astronauts
could really use it for more on the
future of space travel check out the
verge coming up NASA updates its
freeze-dried menu for foodie astronauts
now they have freeze-dried pork belly
and freeze-dried bond meat sandwiches</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
