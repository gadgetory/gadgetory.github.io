know Joe Jonas that I'm here for you
buddy and I can harmonize with the best
of them this is 90 seconds on the verge
according to Reuters president obama has
ordered the NSA to curtail all
eavesdropping on the united nations
headquarters in related news the White
House maintains that Obama was unaware
of the NSA's wiretaps on some 35 world
leaders The Wall Street Journal reports
at the White House subsequently cut off
some but not all those phone taps once
it was made aware meanwhile at home a
new NSA reform bill to in bulk
surveillance has been introduced
ironically enough by one of the
co-authors of the Patriot Act imagine a
phone that could last forever
upgradeable piece by piece like Legos
well that is the dream of motorola's new
project ara the goal is to provide an
open source initiative for modular
smartphones Motorola plans to create an
ecosystem that can support third-party
hardware for individual phone components
the company will be working with
phonebloks in its community throughout
the process to help realize the same
idea with motorola's technical expertise
interested developers can sign up now to
receive a dev kit do out sometime this
winter finally whether you like it or
not entourage is back Vince re e drama
and turtle are all returning for a big
screen continuation of the hit HBO
series the film which has been talked
about since the series ended in 2011
will begin shooting early next year no
word yet in the plot but my guess is
Vince and his friends will go around
Hollywood sleeping with models and
struggling with the concept of Fame
that's it today's top stories but coming
up tomorrow beans and seeds one is the
key to immortality the other one might
just kill you find out which is which</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
