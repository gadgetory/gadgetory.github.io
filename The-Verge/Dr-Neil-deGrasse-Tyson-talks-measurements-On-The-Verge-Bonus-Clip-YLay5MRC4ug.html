we are gadgets yes okay uh just stuff I
carry around with me like I have a not
exactly legal laser that I carry around
with me because what you want to point
on you right now is because I'm as a
planetarium director when you're in the
dome you have that little arrow to point
out the Stars but when you're under the
real universe you need an arrow that
would work in the real universe too so
there are lasers lasers for that you
have it on you right now it's in the
green room could you know shoot it in
them yeah well just a quick it's a peer
chef it's just real quick mess up so
plus I tweet the universe it's like my
mostly cosmic brain droppings but it's
the universe and so I was at my kids but
my son's little league game and they had
one of these pictures who's like faster
than everybody ever was there's always
one of those and peels like wow you know
he's striking everybody out and so I
said well how fast the pitches are so I
calculated the distance and timed it I
use the timer on the you know did
multiple timings got down to a tenth of
a second did the division i said this
kids throwing 62 miles an hour at that
distance it is airborne for the same
amount of time a 96 mile an hour
fastball is in the majors so I tweeted
this I tweet it you know a 5th grader
throwing 62 miles an hour cool oh sorry
fourth grader okay
now look who's wrong now so I tweeted
this and someone replied which app did
you use and I said it's called the brain
app all right hi so so so anyhow so I
carry I like things that measure the
environment in which I'm immersed so
have an electromagnetic field reader
I've got a breathalyzer that I carry
with me just cuz it just cuz it's fun
now to measure yeah there must be
another reason kannada not like it's
that it's it's I don't think measurement
is a is an activity that is celebrated
in our school system and measurement is
the lifeblood of all science and in fact
though sciences that have not yet
achieved a system of measurement cannot
claim themselves to be mature subjects
okay so so if you'd like blow my mind it
like it's six times during this
conversation is why I'm gonna not
recover my brain is gonna be seeping out
of my ear when we get back but so take a
look at like everything fried road and
you're looking there where are the
measurements are none so that's why
psychology that lagged so far behind the
other science technology felt salad i
should mention they need better
measurement method well cuz like how
crazy are you I need to know I need a
number right so so you try and and so
you struggle I mean struggling the way
physics struggle when it first began but
you know you come along give psychology
a few more hundred years you think
you'll be entering the field of
psychology at any point and no no
interest not interest in humans alright
so yeah so so I just have to get the
gadgets off my chest that I'm glad with
a week where there's more to talk about
we're gonna have you back at legend dr.
