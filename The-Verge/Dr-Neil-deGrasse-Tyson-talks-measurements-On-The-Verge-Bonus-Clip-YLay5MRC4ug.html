are gadgets yes okay
just stuff I carry around with me like I
have a not exactly legal laser that I
carry around with me because what do you
want to point on Uranus because I'm as a
planetarium director when you're in the
dome you have that little arrow to point
out the stars but when you're under the
real universe you need an arrow that
would work in the real universe too so
there are lasers lasers for that you
have it on you right now it's in the
green room could you shoot a quick it's
a peer share it's just real quick so
plus I tweaked the universe it's like my
like mostly cosmic brain droppings but
it's in the universe and so I was at my
kids but my son's little league game and
they had one of these pitchers who's
like faster than everybody ever was
there's always one of those and P was
like wow you know he's striking
everybody out and so I said well how
fast the pitches are so I calculated the
distance and timed it I use the timer on
the you know did multiple timings got
down to a tenth of a second did the
division I said this kids throwing 62
miles an hour at that distance it is
airborne
for the same amount of time a 96 mile an
hour fastball is in the majors so I
tweeted this I tweet it you know a
fifth-grader throwing 62 miles an hour
coupe oh sorry fourth grader
okay well look who's wrong now
so I tweeted this and someone replied
which app did you use and I said it's
called the brain all right so so so
anyhow so I can't I like things that
measure the environment in which I'm
immersed so I have an electromagnetic
field reader I've got a breathalyzer
that I carry with me just cuz it just
because it's fun now to measure there
must be another reason no it's the it's
it's I don't think measurement is a is
an activity that is celebrated in our
school system and measurement is the
lifeblood of all science and in fact
though Sciences that have not yet
achieved a system of measurement cannot
clean themselves to be mature subjects
so if you'd like blow my mind they'd
like it six times during this
conversation is why you know I'm gonna
not recover my brain is gonna be seeping
out of my ear when we get back so take a
look at like everything Freud wrote and
you're looking there where are the
measurements there are none so that's
why psychology that lagged so far behind
the other science knowledge develop
measurement they need better measurement
math well cuz like how crazy are you I
need to know I need a number right so so
you try and and so you struggle
I mean struggling the way physics
struggle when it first began but you
know you come along give psychology a
few more hundred years you think you'll
be entering the field of psychology in
on interest in humans alright so yeah so
so I just have to get the gadgets off my
chest
no I'm glad with the week where there's
more to talk about we're gonna have you
back at legs gentleman dr. Neil deGrasse
