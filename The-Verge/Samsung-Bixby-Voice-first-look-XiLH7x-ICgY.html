checking out big speed voice on the
Galaxy s8 now this is Samsung's version
of Siri or Google assistant and there's
a button on the side of the phone that
actually activates it we're going to try
it out it's in beta today so it's going
to be rocky gonna have some problems but
we're going to throw some common
questions at it and see how it responds
so there are two ways to trigger bixby
voice you can say hi big speech or you
can just hold the side button here and
hold it down while you talk so hi big
speech
show me the weather in San Francisco
it's 69 with lots of sunshine today so
it's got that right not bad kind of
basic stuff let's try something else
fairly easy choose the president of the
US
it's 59 with lots of sunshine today well
couldn't have gotten that much wrong hi
big Street turn down my brightness
alright brightness has decreased so you
can ask you to perform system tasks
brightness turn off flu tooth turn on
Wi-Fi things like that so it's got that
down pretty well so one thing Vicks be
voice can do that Siri can't is actually
interact with apps and do things that
you would normally take several steps to
do so I can say hi pics be open ooh BRR
and show me my account settings so it
opens the app and actually goes several
screens and to show you what you want
pretty cool
and so you can of course open apps so I
can say hi big speak open Spotify
alright
ears yeah so so far it will open Spotify
that will actually apply any music for
the unfortunately you can use google
music if you want to play music directly
but Spotify can't just yet hi big speak
text mom and ask how are you here is
what I found on the web me to improve on
that one let's try again from the home
screen hmm hi Bixby hi Bixby
so voice is less than perfect let's hold
this side button text Dan and ask what's
up search SF message not working so
great
send a text to dad and ask how are you
that one didn't work at all so the big
dilemma that Samsung faces here is
trying to offer things that Siri and
Google system don't there are some of
those
there's promise here but how long will
it be before Google and Apple offer the
same functionality and better Bixby
voice has some unique features but it
also struggles with some basic questions
on day one we'll see how it pans out
over the next few months
I see a lot of things aren't working at
all or they're coming up wrong now this
is in beta it's day one Samsung is still
working through this stuff but Google
has this stuff down already like I can
say text mom and ask how are you got it
do you want to send this text or change
it sand sand okay message sent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
