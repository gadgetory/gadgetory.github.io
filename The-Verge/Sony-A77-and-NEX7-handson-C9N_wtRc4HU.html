the sony booth at CES and we have the
a77 camera here as you can see it's a
pretty big body it's a reflecting its
pro prosumer kind of design the screen
is fully articulated we're looking at
the viewfinder is 0 LED and the screen
has pretty good quality as you can see
if we turn it on so we look at them
one of the key features of the a77 is
its high speed 12 12 swim 25 second mode
if I turn it into this dial it will go
straight like this and shoot very very
very high speed like so one other thing
we have here is the next seven thank you
the next seven uses similar LED
technology but it's a mirrorless camera
so the body is a lot smaller it's got a
three dials to control it and so there's
the one here this is to hear and these
are all programmable so we turn it up
but again it this game has got a very
nice unusual design it's sort of
rangefinder inspired there's like a kind
of baking rubberized leather texture to
it but the body is very solid feeling
it's a really nice feeling camera and
again similar to the a77 the viewfinder
is o LED and its really beautiful when
you look inside it it's not it's not
quite the quality of an optical
viewfinder of course but it's pretty
great it's about as good at ebf as you'd
expect your phone so here we have it the
next seven and the a77 Tony</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
