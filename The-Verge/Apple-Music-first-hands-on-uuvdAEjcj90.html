we've just downloaded iOS 8.4 which has
Apple music on it and we figured we'd
take a look at it right away for the
first time all together so here's a new
music icon it's very pretty and
multi-coloured when you open it up you
get this splash screen and a three month
trial so I am going to do the three
months trial just start it as an
individual we're going to accept iTunes
turn to service the way that you do by
not reading it and we're going to buy
the plan and we're in so the first time
you launch it it drops right into your
music which is pretty great here's all
of my artists from my library a lot of
90s a lot of really 2000s because I'm
old and haven't paid attention to music
in a while the first tab is called for
you and it starts by giving you all
these bubbles this basically comes from
beats and you sort of start picking the
stuff that you really like so yeah I
like rock sure I like experimental I
like indie no seriously I like indie I'm
also I listened to some electronic
technically ambient so when I work so
I'll tap on that and hits because
otherwise I won't get Beyonce and Taylor
Swift and that would be a problem and
sure I'll pick rock and roll and then
I'll tap next and then once these come
in they start giving me names of bands I
need to pick my favorites and hopefully
they will show me some favorites yeah I
like Sonic Youth will do more artists
and it's going to try and grab some more
and I can start swiping around and these
bubbles start jumping around it's kind
of fun I picked a bunch of artists they
say they've got it and all those bubbles
float in and now I have for you this is
a bunch of albums and songs that are
curated for me partially by humans and
also just by guessing what I might like
based on the stuff that I've just picked
and so there's some playlists there's a
bunch of stuff from the kinks and so on
and I've had specific albums here as
well if I go to the new tab you can see
that there is just a bunch of new music
this is not pulled directly from my
algorithm this is just stuff that's new
stuff that Apple might think I would
like we've got some video on here so I
can click on a video
and just start watching it you can also
minimize it and it'll keep playing here
in the background which is pretty cool
so a bunch of new music bunch of new
stuff if you go to something in tap one
of these many three menus you can add it
to your music you can set it to be
offline you can show it in the iTunes
Store if you actually want to buy it you
can add it to a playlist you can also
add it to your cube music and even start
a radio station based on it kind of like
Pandora so a ton of options there hidden
under those three dot menus and that
kind of explains why they're sort of
littering up the whole interface here
because there's a lot of stuff hidden
underneath it you can see stuff directly
from the Apple music editors which is
pretty great so here's all their Sean
Rosario aided by actual humans and we
move on so here's radio and the big
thing is beats one but because we went
ahead and installed this as soon as
possible it's probably not live yet but
we'll take a look see if it started
looks like it hasn't quite started yet
but there's the old
iTunes radio which is now called Apple
music radio and so you can see there are
these old classic stations here and you
can choose a station and it'll start
playing it shows you the song that's
playing here you can hit another one of
those three dot menus to do all those
other options before you can also fav
something play more like this play less
like this add it to a wish list and so
on the connect tab is the sort of weird
weird tumbler esque like stuff that you
get from artists they can put little
videos on here here's a selfie from
Rufus Wainwright
because here's some stuff from Sonic
Youth and then of course there's my
music this is the classic iTunes
interface where you get all of your
music which is where we started and if I
tap on my little face here you can see
the information for the artists you can
reach use artists that you like and
here's all the artists that I'm
following right now so that is a super
quick look at Apple music we're of
course going to have a lot more about
this very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
