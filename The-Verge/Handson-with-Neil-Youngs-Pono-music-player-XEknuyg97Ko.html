verge at CES showstoppers take a look at
the pono music player this was a huge
hit on Kickstarter but this is our first
chance to get in person it's a music
player meant for high res audio so the
design is pretty unique it's a triangle
it's got a soft matte finish you can buy
it in black or orange people who got it
on Kickstarter have a nice custom
Edition that's actually clear but for
consumers it's orange or black and
orange is actually a pretty nice color
comes with 64 gigs of internal storage
and you can expand that through microSD
up to 128 km/h hours on a charge and
store it pretty much any kind of file
you have flax Apple Lossless WAV pretty
much any kind of file you can throw it
this thing and it will play it and sound
pretty good doing it it's not really
meant for everybody whether you can
appreciate the difference in sound
quality is really on a per person basis
but obviously some people can this thing
raised a ton of money on Kickstarter so
it seems they're people who are really
eager for the high res audio experience
and that kind of thing
the software is very basic it's based on
Android the screen isn't amazing but it
does the job and you've got your volume
controls here the nice big indicator up
and down if you want to pause just the
middle button so the real story here is
obviously sound and it sounds pretty
fantastic
I played a few tracks everything sounds
very deep very robust so if you've got
really nice headphones or or an app or
any that that sort of thing you're going
to be a person who really wants this set
up you can tell a difference between
this and your iPhone or your Android
phone this pumps out really great
sounding music it's 399 and you can buy
it right now it's shipping in black or
orange there's a ton of high-end audio
stuff here at CES we're going to take a
look at quite a bit of it so be sure to

the latest videos and all the latest
gear here at CES 2015</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
