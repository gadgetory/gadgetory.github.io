an app that turns your lockscreen
and you're constantly updating newsfeed
for your friends that's a big deal but
it also announced chat heads
notifications from Facebook messenger
that show up on top of any app you're
using on your Android phone Facebook
realizes it needs to win big in the
messaging space even if that means
putting your friends faces inside every
app you're using this is the future of
Facebook messaging
one thing that you may not know is that
Facebook as a company when you pretty
much run our entire company on Facebook
groups you don't use mailing lists there
are over 400 million active groups on
Facebook 80 million of those groups are
secret and so dovetailing off that we
said well how else can people connect
more privately private sharing is like a
really really important thing for
Facebook and I think things like status
updates and photo posts and stuff in
newsfeed just gets way more visibility
so people I think only think that we
think about newsfeed and these other
things but you know a lot of people
don't like to share publicly and a lot
of people and that's totally fine we're
not saying hey everything has to be
public and like every time you send a
message we're gonna like throw it in
newsfeed or something yeah like that's
not it at all so we started focusing on
this we started building the team first
we did the belukha acquisition a couple
years ago and we've grown a team around
that too now where we have a ton of
people thinking about the problem from
different angles
as Facebook put more thought and
resources into developing intimate
experiences it began to focus more on
its users most intimate devices their
phones so last year we did this without
some thing where we took mobile and we
ate you know where a mobile became a
mobile first company which means every
single team at Facebook builds their own
mobile experiences right so there's not
one mobile team at Central it's like hey
I want to put a feature request in it's
like no the messages team is responsible
for the holistic messages experience on
web on blackberry on an iPhone on
Android everywhere I think snapchat is
really awesome like we're all super
addicted to it and we think it's great I
think there's a lot of other people who
are doing really cool things and I think
phones are becoming way more pervasive
and everyone has them and if not
everyone's going to be getting them not
only did Facebook realize that needed to
focus on mobile it also started to
embrace the nature of the best and most
popular mobile software simple single
utility apps but Facebook thought
something was missing when you're solid
away inside of those apps your friends
we always talked about how like apps
with messaging components are always the
best and so it's like oh man like that
white like why doesn't chrome have like
a built-in messenger or something and it
was me and another designer named
Brandon walk in and we worked from home
on Wednesday one time and we already
been working on like messaging but we
just had some ideas around messaging so
we just like stayed up that whole day
and all night and like buy other
roommates work here and they were always
coming in and being like yeah what he
was working on all the stuff and we
actually just worked like around the
clock for like two days on this idea and
basically had the whole chat heads idea
fleshed out at that point in time it all
starts on the phone we invest a ton at
Facebook in really awesome design tools
that allow the designers to prototype
everything so at the end of that second
day like Brandon and I had working
prototypes of in a sense a lot of the
interactions that exist in today's four
years the best mobile Facebook
experience has been on the iPhone but as
Facebook's ambitions grew so did its
desires to focus on a platform more flex
Boldin iOS we got the original video
from our designer Joey Flynn and Brendon
Walken and then just kind of saw that it
was really cool and try to actually
implement it like they made that video
we think that social and people should
be part of the phone and Android is a
platform that lets us enhance all
different parts of the phone before this
I had only ever worked on iOS products
and I used an iPhone and I wasn't super
familiar with Android but I'd always
heard these horror stories and everyone
kind of always makes a big deal like
it's gonna be inherently worse because
it's on and like the touch latency and
everything and I think if you think that
then that's what will come out of it but
we were just like oh yeah this has to be
the best possible experience we've built
and if it requires rewriting like base
level views like you know scroll view
and you know like ListView and all of
these sitting like pager we spent a long
time making our pager really great then
it just feels like it's a great
experience on any phone we spent so much
time digging through the Android source
code trying to figure out you know how
to use the simple compositor how to not
bring battery all this kind of stuff and
it was pretty intense
we built like an entire physics engine
that everything runs off of it's more
like your app is built like a game as
opposed to your app built with like
these app components it is interesting
just like even using the word Android II
it has like a lot of these baked in
things where you feel like it has to fit
some certain aesthetic or have some
certain kind of like patterns that it
evolves around but we Android is a great
platform for us and we just were like
hey we're not like we're not gonna try
to make this thing feel androidy for the
sake of making it feel Android II people
see the chatez feature even employees
inside the company be like you know I
would actually get an Android phone now
so I can get these chat heads because
they're so cool
so that was pretty gratifying for me too
the problem that we're trying to solve
on Android we can solve it a hundred
percent of the time right because we can
have chat heads available in other apps
people are still spending 20% of their
time in Facebook for iOS so we can solve
that problem for them for that 20%
clearly you know we'd love to be able to
bring that experience to other apps as
well and Android is a platform that lets
us enhance all different parts of the
phone and bring that social layer and
bring people first see
I think I definitely think using this
this is the best version of Facebook
that ever I've ever used and it makes my
phone like alive and feel social the
open nature of Android allows Facebook
to create private messaging experience
layered on top of all of their apps on
your phone Facebook wants to be wherever
you're chatting with your friends and
today that place is increasingly mobile
this is just the beginning of Facebook
taking over your phone there's something
about chat heads which is that provides
a lot of more opportunities that I think
no one has been able to explore yet just
because I think this is kind of the
first of its kind is being able to like
integrate with other apps so you could
say you know if you're in maps you could
like pick up the map and like this drop
it to a prayer you know there's like a
lot of opportunities to do really cool
stuff like that we're just scratching
the surface of the potential of what we
can do in integrating with Android to
really make it a communication hub and
something again that feels alive and
like your friends are with you on screen
so I think there's there's a lot of
stuff that we can we can do in the
future it's it's exciting</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
