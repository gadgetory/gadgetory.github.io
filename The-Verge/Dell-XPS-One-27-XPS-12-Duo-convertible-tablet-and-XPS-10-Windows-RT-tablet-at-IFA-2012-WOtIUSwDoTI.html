2012 a Berlin where it tells booth where
three brand new products have been
introduced this right here is the dell
XPS 127 the new difference is that it
actually has a touch screen now has a
10-point touch screen which should work
nicely with Windows 8 it has intel core
i7 processors etc etc and one of his
neat new tricks is that it's got this
reclining stands which can make it goes
that goes into about 45 degree angle
when you want to have it let's say on
the table top and you know something
like 70 degrees if you want to be
creative in the office that's that's
kind of the way that they was pitching
it but has a cool stand its method
touchscreen 27 inches that's number 10
describes is as s XPS XL so this is the
largest of the new products today there
was also introducing two new tablets /
laptops one is the dell XPS geo 12 it is
an intel-based Windows 8 tablet which
comes with a flip stand it's very much
like an old inspiron design that there
we had where it flips out to be a tablet
with a keyboard attached or you can flip
it back in and it works as a laptop
unfortunately they'll head this behind
glass you just before it put the glass
Salman I got to try out the flip hinge
and it was very quick very easy and
smooth even operation so it looks
interesting looks appealing but the most
exciting thing is the new Windows RT
tablets the dell XPS 10 again it was
behind girls so what we really do is
take a few pictures and look at it it
has a saturable keyboard look like quite
a few of the new devices that was seen
from the likes of samsung and the way
that their pictures both of these
devices is that convertibles were always
the most part o price details or release
details are being announced yet this is
just our very first look at all three of
these new XPS products</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
