working at scale
last year eight out of ten phones that
were shipped were based on Android there
are all of four thousand distinct
devices you see in Android and the range
of what we see is what we really embrace
of course for TV for televisions we have
a simple and elegant solution in the
form of chromecast and today I'm very
excited to announce HBO now for the
first time it's coming to Google Play
and it's available across Android and
iOS using care and today I'm excited to
share a preview of the new M release of
Android the central theme of M is
improving the core user experience of
Android
we're greatly simplifying app
permissions to a smaller set of easily
understood things like location camera
microphone second apps will now ask you
for permission the first time you try to
use a feature instead of asking during
Act installation time so next up we want
to give you a preview of an important
initiative we're working on which we
call Android pay it's simple because all
you have to do is unlock your phone like
normal place it in front of the NFC
turbo to pay and there's no need to open
any app your actual card number is not
shared with the store during the
transaction I don't pay will work in
over 700,000 stores across the u.s.
which accept contactless payments
Android pay works on phones from KitKat
forward but with the M release Android
pay gets even better
because it turns out the Android device
makers have been including fingerprint
sensors on devices since 2011 the users
simply touches the fingerprint sensor
which unlocks the phone the phone will
then make a secure NFC exchange with the
payment terminal and then the payment
goes through and you get the Android pay
notification of the transaction at the
top we're changing Android and M to be
smarter about managing power through a
new feature we call doze
Android uses significant motion
detection to learn if a device has been
left unattended for an extended period
of time in that case it will
exponentially back off background
activity to go into a deeper sleep stage
of course no matter how much better we
make power management Android sooner or
later you've got to recharge that device
so we've been working with device
manufacturers to bring type-c devices to
the market with the amberleigh's and
because type-c is bi-directional
the M release adds the ability to select
whether you want your device to be
charged by the cable or and still
instead for your device to access the
charger to whatever it's plugged into as
another example we've been sharing
easier the system can now automatically
learn which people and which apps you
share with most frequently and make
those available with just a single click
so that's how we're working incredibly
hard to produce our most polished
Android release to date Nest has been
working hard at taking traditional
devices in the home and reimagining them
for users so we booked collaborated
closely we pulled in people from the
nest the Android and the Chrome OS teams
to take a fundamentally new approach to
the Internet of Things so I'm very
excited ants today we're announcing
project brillo which is the underlying
operating system for the Internet of
Things the next step is what we call as
B leave is the communications layer by
which the Internet of Things can
actually talk to each other our core
mission is to organize the world's
information and make it universally
accessible and useful so we are working
hard to be more assistive to users to
talk about how we are doing that I'm
going to invite Aparna from the Google
now team so we're working on a new
capability to assist you in the moment
right when you need it wherever you are
on the phone we're calling it now on tap
so here is listening
relax and you wonder like me what is his
real name okay Google what's his real
name
Skrillex his full name is Sonny John
Moore so here you see an email from my
friend Allie about catching a movie so
all I have to do is a simple tap and
hold on the home button Google now
brings me information about Tomorrowland
again with a simple tap and hold on the
home button you get help but I have to
say the computer scientist in me is
practically giddy with excitement here
because that's some like epic natural
language understanding action going on
here pretty much I can tap on you and I
get information about you Lori how often
do we spend time just scrolling
scrolling scrolling to find that one
photo that we want what if we could use
Google's unique capabilities to help
people take back control of their
digital lives and that's why I'm
thrilled to be here to introduce a brand
new product Google Photos Google photos
automatically backs up from your phone
tablet computer and even your camera
memory cards we can also sync all your
photos and videos with Google Drive I
can view my memories across days but
with a simple pinch across months and
again across years using machine
learning google photos understands
what's important and helps you by
automatically organizing your memories
so here I'm just gonna tap the blue
search button and you'll see all my
photos organized by the people places
and things that matter the most in my
life this auto organisation is private
and it's for my eyes only let's have a
look at all the photos I've taken of my
niece the recent ones are at the top
I can go back to when she was 4 years
old as a flower girl in my wedding but
what's amazing is I can go all the way
back to the week she was born we can
automatically group photos of the same
person over time I just tapped the
search box I'll type snowstorm in
Toronto and instantly I'm able to find
these photos that I'm looking for by
selecting and tapping the plus button
google photos lets me create collages
animations movies with soundtracks and
more we've introduced a new gesture to
make multi photo selection really fast I
just press and hold on one of the photos
and drag my finger to select them all so
in this case I'm simply going to tap get
a link and in less than a second I have
a link to all 25 items now the beauty of
this is I don't have to worry about
whether the recipient of the link has a
particular app or has a login I can
share it any way that I want now when we
see a home for all your photos and
videos we want everyone to be able to
safely back up and store a lifetime of
memories and that's why we're also
announcing with Google photos you can
now back up and store unlimited google
photos is rolling out starting later
today on Android iOS and web so we've
been thinking a lot about how to bring
the real world to use this in a more
immersive way so we started our efforts
here with Google cardboard
now the original viewer it was great but
phones turns out got a lot bigger in the
last year
so the new design fits phones with
screens as large as six inches and now
instead of it taking 12 steps to
assemble it takes just three and so as
of today the cardboard SDK for unity
will support both Android and iOS we're
excited to announce expeditions so a box
arrives with everything that you need to
travel cardboard and phones for every
student a teacher tablet and all of
these devices are synchronized so that
then when the teacher chooses a place
the entire classroom jumps they're
together and if you want to capture
something that's truly immersive there
are really only a handful of very custom
camera rigs in the world that'll do the
job so today we'd like to preview
something that we call jump has three
parts a camera rig very specialized
geometry an assembler which turns raw
footage into VR video and a player I'm
excited to announce that GoPro plans to
build and sell a jump ready 360-degree
camera array the assembler takes 16
different video feeds and uses a
combination of computational photography
computer vision and a whole lot of
computers to recreate the scene as
viewed from thousands of in-between
viewpoints everywhere along the
circumference of the camera array
starting the summer YouTube will support
jump so if you want to experience VR
video all you need is the YouTube app
your smartphone and some cardboard I
often get asked how to search Android
photos and things like this how do they
relate to each other for us it is about
as Google putting technology and
computer science to work on important
problems that use the space and do it at
scale for everyone in the world this is
why is so exciting for us we get to
share what we have been up to in the
last year and all your developers get to
go out and build amazing things on top
of what we do so I can't wait to see
what you build next year thank you so
much for joining us good luck and see
you next year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
