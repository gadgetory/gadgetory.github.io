we're here in New York City taking our
very first look at the Nintendo switch
now the switch is the next major piece
of hardware from Nintendo and it's a
device that kind of brings together the
two sides of the company now for a long
time Nintendo was sort of split into two
you had the portable side with devices
like the Gameboy in the DS and then you
had the home console side with things
like the NES all the way up to the Wii U
and what the switch does is it brings
those together it's a tablet that
connects to your television so you can
play games either on the go or at home
the core of the switch comes in the form
of this fairly unassuming tablet it has
a 6.2 inch 720p display it features
multi-touch but that's also the only
tablet that can run a game like The
Legend of Zelda breath of the wild and
the way this works is through these new
controllers Nintendo has come up with
called joy Kahn essentially it's a
modular controller system so you get
these two little parts that can snap on
to the side of the tablet so you can
play a traditional console game like
Zelda on a tablet but you can also
remove them and snap them into a shell
to make a proper controller so that you
can then play the game on your
television now in order to emphasize all
the different ways you can use the joy
Kahn controllers Nintendo showed off a
bunch of new games for the switch in
addition to more traditional experiences
like Zelda and a brand new Super Mario
game they're also a number of motion
control games where you use the
controllers in your hands sort of like a
Wii Remote back in the day to play
things like the minigame collection when
to switch or the boxing game arms where
the two controllers essentially serve as
your fists so you can punch another
player and since so many people miss out
on the Wii U the predecessor to the
switch company is also bringing back a
number of franchises just in case people
miss those games there's a new version
of Mario Kart 8 called Mario Kart 8
deluxe that add some new characters and
tracks to the series as well as the
sequel to splatoon colorful multiplayer
online shooter that's sort of like a
cross between a traditional game like
Call of Duty and paintball but where you
play as teenage squids now because the
switch is essentially a tablet it does
come with a few drawbacks in addition to
being a little bit underpowered the
device also comes with a
scant 32 gigabytes of hard drive space
and the battery life isn't so great
Nintendo estimates you'll get around two
and a half to six hours of battery life
depending on what game you're playing so
for something like Zelda that's a little
more intense you're probably only going
to get around two to three hours of play
time the Nintendo switch actually
launches really soon it's going to be
available on March 3rd globally and in
the u.s. you'll be able to pick it up
for $2.99
and you know I've only spent a little
bit of time with it but from what I've
seen it does a really good job of
bringing together those two sides from
Nintendo when you play it as a console
it feels like a console and when you
play as a tablet it feels like a really
good handheld experience
it's kinda strange it's sort of like a
combination of dr. Mario Tetris but I
think this
character is like crazy
stuff at me and</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
