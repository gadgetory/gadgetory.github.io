later this fall but if you're daring you
can try super early version of it right
now the iOS 10 public beta is available
to anyone who wants to try it and I
wouldn't recommend installing it on your
phone but if you do you can get a good
taste of what's to come there's a ton of
new things in iOS 10 but here are some
quick highlights of what to expect and
the first and biggest change is going to
be to your lockscreen with iOS 10 your
lockscreen is pretty much your new home
screen pull the phone out of your pocket
and it automatically turns on the first
thing you're gonna notice is that swiped
unlock is gone in order to unlock it you
have to push the button to enter your
passcode or use touch ID but if you do
swipe you get to see a whole new pane of
widgets which can show you things like
weather
stocks and calendar music controls and
all these other things without having to
unlock your phone so what the other
direction and you launch the camera but
if you stay in the middle you'll get all
your notifications which now have more
information and 3d touch features and a
lot more useful things than they used to
have when you do unlock your phone
you'll see that the Notification Center
has been totally redesigned
notifications are bigger with more
information there's now a 3d touch
feature to clear all your notifications
at launch which is awesome and then
there's also built-in spotlight search
so it works in any app that you're
already in if you're in a messenger app
and you're in a conversation you can
swipe down from the top and search for a
movie without ever leaving your app so I
pop from the bottom of the screen you've
got a new control center which has 3d
touch features so you can set specific
brightnesses of the flashlight or
specific times on the timer it's got a
new to pain control systems so swiping
over to the right gives you your music
controls but all your system controls
are on the other side and on your home
screen you can finally remove those
default apps so you can say goodbye to
stocks goodbye to find my friends and
goodbye to all those other apps that
you're not using anymore and technically
it doesn't really remove them it just
hides them but you don't really have to
worry about them anymore which is
awesome for the apps that you do want to
use you will see some new redesigns
music has been redesigned Apple news has
been redesigned and there's also a new
app called home for controlling home
kits stuff if you happen to have those
apples Smart Home stuff in your house
the last big thing in iOS 10 is a brand
new messages app messages has been
expanded with lots of new functions to
make it way more competitive with things
like snapchat and whatsapp and all these
other messaging platforms everyone uses
there's big emoji there's 3d touch
features there's digital touch features
there's drawing
there's different effects when you send
messages and in the future when iOS 10
launches to the public you'll be able to
integrate third-party apps right into
the messaging app so you can call up a
cab or book of the restaurant or buy
movie tickets without ever leaving a
messaging conversation if you do want to
install the iOS 10 theta on your phone
just go to beta Apple comm on your
device you can enroll right there and
download it right away a fair warning
we've seen quite a few bugs with this
it's certainly not stable you're
probably gonna have bad battery life and
a bunch of other issues come up while
you're using it but if you're daring and
you're willing to accept those things
you can get a taste of what's to come
right now there's gonna be a number of
other betas released before the final
were launched this fall and of course
we'll have more information on the verge
com in youtube.com slash the verge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
