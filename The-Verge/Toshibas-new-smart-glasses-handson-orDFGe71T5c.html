AR glasses right now and in the early
days it kind of feels like everyone's
trying to justify why air glasses should
be a thing for some companies that may
mean making sports goggles and for
others it may mean making air glasses
for entertainment purposes for Toshiba
it means basically putting a PC on your
face these are two Sheba's new dinah
edge AR smart glasses they start
shipping today and they start at $1,900
Toshiba is aiming these at enterprise
customers think people who work out in
the field and might need remote
assistance but their hands are tied up
so it might not be easy to just use
their phone so this is the display arm
of the AR headset there's a display that
I'm looking at right now in my right eye
there's also a camera built-in and
there's a microphone for voice control
but really the majority of everything
that's happening is happening on this
this is Toshiba Dyna Edge mini mobile PC
it's running on an Intel Core M 5
processor it's running Windows 10 that's
16 gigabytes of RAM 512 gigabytes of
internal storage
it's basically an entire computer packed
into this little thing and this is
running all the applications that I'm
seeing in my eyes so this is not the
computer here some AR headsets that
we've seen have been full-fledged face
computers this is really a display set
the glasses also have a swipe panel on
the side and you can eventually use your
voice to control them but that wasn't
working yet when I tried them I should
also mention that even though they're
called AR smart glasses this isn't
really a are like the kind you've seen
lately it's just a flat display resting
in front of your eye and Toshiba says
that's because the kind of apps they
envision people using with these whether
it's referencing a document or a PDF or
making a quick Skype call doesn't really
need volumetric AR so in this case I'm
actually going to make a phone call to
somebody who is in this case across the
room but imagine it's a remote worker
I'm gonna go into an application it's
called call the operator this is custom
Toshiba software built on top of Skype
so basically it's using Skype over Wi-Fi
and I'm gonna select that application
using the computer I'm gonna go down
right now I'm scrolling through a list
of names I'm
fine Philip and I'm giving him a call
hi Lauren hey Philip how's it going it's
going okay so listen I'm having some
trouble out of the field here and I
wanted to to get a second opinion on
this thing that I'm working on what are
you seeing right now yeah I can see the
camera and I can see the guys behind it
okay
hi Felicia hey Tyler they're not both
guys but that's okay with the use case
for this beyond just you know
troubleshooting average video remotely
use cases you can show me what you're
seeing and I can help you and try to fix
it as quickly as possible so when I
first put these on they weren't super
comfortable to me and that may be
because the display was on my right eye
and I'm left eye dominant but even after
I switched to the left eye it still
didn't feel great to me other people the
verge tried it on they were a little
more comfortable for them one of the
good things is that you can adjust the
arm that the display is on so you can
sort of just twist it or position it in
a way that makes sense for you you can
also easily slide the arm into non-glass
form factors like a safety helmet so you
would just be wearing the helmet the arm
would slide in front of you and then
you'd have the display and also that
kind of stable fitting thing made the
display feel a little bit more
comfortable but there is just a learning
curve when you first put them on I mean
you're not supposed to look directly at
the display the whole time you're
wearing them you're supposed to focus on
what you're doing in the real world and
then when you need it
the glanced up to the display so you can
refer to it in this way it's not too
dissimilar from some very early
iterations of air glasses that we've
seen like Google glass and it's
different from hololens because hololens
really just kind of covers your whole
face and even though it's a AR or mixed
reality makes you feel enveloped in the
world around you this doesn't really
have that effect so to call these AR
glasses feels like a little bit of a
misnomer and the pair I saw wasn't
totally production-ready but like I said
these are still new and Toshiba plans to
run tests with its early customers to
improve the glasses and who knows maybe
in the mean time more people will
actually grow to love computers on their
faces I'm seeing
I'm not seeing you how's that happening
you're not supposed to see me I'm only
supposed to see what you're seeing so
you can concentrate on your job okay so
lots of it okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
