flight to make it feel more like a
cruise ship with access to a daycare a
co-working space or a full restaurant
and bar for most people flying is
terrible but the next level of flying
might be modular cabin experiences ones
that are loaded onto the plane in
between flights and are supposed to be
accessible to everyone this is Transpo's
it's a modular cabin project that Airbus
has been developing inside at Silicon
Valley labs called eight cubes the
engineers in the project are taking
inspiration from cargo planes and
applying the same loading and unloading
concept to passenger planes cargo planes
like the kind used by shipping companies
often load and unload cargo using giant
pallets that are moved throughout the
aircraft on rollers the mines that
Airbus think that you could replace that
cargo with an experienced the idea being
it could both improve travel for
consumers and give the airlines and
other brands opportunities to charge
them for it now this isn't a real plane
it's a mock-up in the labs but it's
modeled after the Airbus a330 Jason Chua
one of the Transpo's executives who
previously worked on Motorola's modular
phone project gave me a tour of the
plane so we are boarding through the
door for area and we're gonna enter the
plane from the rear so this first
experience that we're entering is a
sleeping area
unlike business class right now it takes
up a lot of room we're actually stacking
four people vertically which makes it a
lot more financially viable
another thing that airplane cabins today
aren't really designed for it is
traveling in groups of friends or sports
teams or just with families with young
kids this is a place where families can
you know really spend some good time
together
these seats actually flip down and
creates this large open space for four
kids to sit down and play with trucks
and stuff like that so this is a
restaurant area in flight this looks
like a cocktail table but for taxi
takeoff and landing just grab this put
look at that and you can sit down and
buckle in
[Laughter]
you can imagine that you know you can
grab a cup of coffee from our restaurant
and come back here and take a seat and
get some work done it's kind of crazy to
think that we might have these really
cool pods before we have really
consistent working Wi-Fi in our place
airbus has imagined other scenarios for
a modular cabin that we didn't get to
try first hand things like a cycling
studio or a day spa or a name-brand
coffee shop and they're experimenting
with state-of-the-art three millimeter
OLED displays that would act as Windows
showing a cotton candy sky while you're
actually trapped in a metal tube all of
this might make you think that this will
inevitably be something that only the
rich can afford but Chua says that while
the airline's will ultimately determine
pricing Airbus imagines these
experiences will be priced at the
premium economy level if they're able to
maintain the same seating density he
also says he thinks people will use the
modules like they do on a cruise ship
roaming freely around the plane we want
to make flying feel more human so you
know this could be your office or a
co-working space the restaurant could be
in any nice restaurant and so we want
people to feel more at home when they
fly rather than like they are trying to
fit into something that's not been
designed for them so I've done a lot of
hands-on videos before but I'll say this
I've never done a hands-on with a plane
at least until now the engineers let me
help load one of the modules onto the
aircraft you know you're just you're
just loosening it in order to load a
module onto the plane they're partly
relying on the existing infrastructure
from a cargo aircraft but they removed
the ball mat and rollers that are
normally used saving about a ton of
weight in the process instead they
embedded eight air Castor's into the
module these are built to withstand up
to 16,000 pounds which is well within
the maximum weight of a fully loaded
10,000 pound module and all of this is
happening remarkably fast at least in
the lab
the Transpo's team claims it can swap
out an entirely new module and well
under an hour right now aircraft take
about 30 days to do a change of a cabin
we're trying to take that customization
period from 30 days to about 30 minutes
so we're actually targeting about 15
minutes per module at this point how can
you be sure that everything is safe and
secure and sealed in that amount of time
we're actually using proven engineering
connections so seat track attachments is
which is what connects our current seat
to the aircraft we're using those same
exact connection points we're using the
same exact processes that cargo aircraft
use for loading on board an aircraft and
so we're trying to we use a lot of dis
existing work and only change the things
that we want to change like the
experiences in a way that the cabin is
architected that doesn't mean the
Transpo's team has it all figured out
just yet there are still other safety
and design aspects to consider things
like the placement and accessibility of
oxygen masks how quickly it will take
people to get into their seats if
there's turbulence or even how doors
might be designed differently in a
modular cabin we've got an additional
floor structure that's on top of
something that wasn't meant to handle
that additional force structure even
though it's a really small floor
structure about two inches you have to
handle that two inches sloped down to
the actual door trying to solve
something to where you're not taking up
any existing cabin interior space is
something that we're kind of still in
the process of brainstorming another
element the transpose team has had to
consider is the human element how will
people move throughout the plane if
they're allowed to wander around
well people argue or gripe even more
than they do on planes now in December
we did a test at Crissy Field where we
did a very low resolution flight with 66
passengers on board it showed us some
really interesting stuff like one is
that if you don't tell people what's on
board an airplane everyone kind of knows
what the learn behavior is he going and
you sit in your seat what we found was
that slowly people started getting up
and kind of going to the to the bar or
restaurant and and soon people got the
idea that oh we don't have to stay in
our seats there's actually reasons to
get up and and move around it also
showed us that yeah when you have a lot
of passengers moving around it is a
different experience but applying some
simple traffic rule type ideas
passengers can quickly figure out how to
kind of navigate the cabin in a new way
even if Airbus gets the modules
perfectly engineers and
it has come up at the right guidelines
for human interaction there's still
another big hurdle to consider approval
from the FAA and international
regulators is it realistic to think this
could be in the sky is within the next
couple of years
absolutely so of course our number one
priority of this project is safety we've
had lots of good conversations with both
FAA and NASA around how we could get
this thing flying and we've gotten some
really good feedback from them about how
we can get this thing flying in the next
couple years but that may be an
aggressive timeline according to one
analyst I spoke to even though it is
only an interior concept FAA regulations
are incredibly strict and there's
usually a lot of back-and-forth between
the administration and manufacturers
when it comes to a new project
the FAA wouldn't comment on this
specific project but told me that the
certification process can range from
less than one year to more than five
years it's depending on the applicants
experience and the complexity of the
project at the very least Airbus
certainly has a lot of experience
building planes it's an ambitious
concept when you consider the
engineering that goes into it the
potential regulatory hurdles and the
fact that most airlines only change
their cabins every seven to ten years
even if it does get approval there's
still the economics to consider but
Airbus thinks if it does take off that
it can eliminate the downtime that's
required for customizable cabins which
means more money for the airlines
there's also the possibility it could
make flying a lot less onerous for
people and really who wouldn't want that
plenty of room okay what's the what's
the weight equivalent of this fifteen
hundred pounds
yeah they feel like this is going off
the edge alright now I think we're good
