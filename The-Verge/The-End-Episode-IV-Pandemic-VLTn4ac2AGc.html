sometimes in the area of scientific
research they like to see if it can be
done no matter how scary a reckless
risky it is
I got involved in the subject matter in
2006 when our local congressman tried to
bring the country's second-biggest bio
defense facility to a farm in Pulaski
County Kentucky he said that it would be
as safe as going to walmart the local
newspaper published stories stating that
facilities like this had been operating
in the country for over 50 years and had
never had an accident well this
particular facility is a bsl-4 facility
vsl force facilities study diseases for
which there is no cure or effective
treatment like smallpox and Ebola and
bsl-4 facilities have tighter
containment conditions the researchers
have to wear the sealed space suit and
have an independent oxygen supply when I
got to researching the history I
discovered all the claims they were
making were absolutely false there had
been numerous problems and incidents
including people researchers or janitors
dying from diseases then in 2007 there
were a series of accidents around the
country at Texas A&amp;amp;M the CDC in a foot
mouth outbreak in Britain that caused a
congressional subcommittee to conduct an
investigation and the government
accountability office conducted an
investigation and issued a long report
there had been over 1200 new high risk
germ labs constructed in the US since
2001 that nobody in the government was
even keeping track of all the facilities
accidents were always a risk and were in
fact occurring we have 15,000 people who
now have access to these bio weapons
agents 15,000 chances for a mentally
unbalanced person to use them in a bad
way or for an accident to happen
can affect members of the general public
in 2001 most people are probably aware
of the anthrax attacks that killed five
people sickened 20-plus people these
attacks were used as a basis for
attacking Iraq supposedly to find
weapons of mass destruction that it was
claimed sodom Hussein had anyone who's
researched that history knows that most
of that evidence was fabricated by
people in the bush administration the
FBI he had let it be known as as early
as 2002 that they believe the attacks
had come from Fort Detrick our largest
bio defense facility in the US what that
should have meant is that we are much
more careful about whose hands we put
these agents into and instead we
constructed over 1,200 new high risks
labs around the country well they're
doing all kinds of things in in bio
defense facilities they're researching
the germs in various ways unfortunately
in too many cases they're actually
creating scarier versions of the germs
to see if it's possible to do so and
then I suppose if they find if it's
possible to do so they're going to try
to develop a countermeasure to the thing
that they just created so you have an
endless cycle of a dog chasing its tail
and at plenty of work for bio defense
facilities it was an overreaction to the
fear of bioterror the federal government
has put about 70 billion dollars into
bio defense since 2001 the average
annual funding for bio defense has gone
up four to five times they are funding
the construction of new labs around the
country by universities government
agencies private companies the problem
is the federal government is giving
money to build the lamps
the money for maintenance in annual
operations is going to come from
ordinary budgets like universities even
government agencies and we know there
are a few budgetary problems so these
things that might have seemed safe at
the time they're being built are going
to be maintained at a questionable level
of protection the government's chief
regulatory agencies the CDC and NIH the
ones who are supposed to regulate these
dangerous labs operate dangerous labs
themselves and so they have a vested
interest in making it appear to the
public that this is all safe and no
problems with it there have been various
efforts to create antibiotic resistant
versions of existing buy weapons agents
things like anthrax tularemia q fever
brucella these are all things that if
you're diagnosed early enough you can
get some antibiotics and you'll probably
be okay but if they create antibiotic
resistant versions of the germs that's a
whole different question I think if
there were an accidentally infected
researcher they might actually try to
cover it up for a while and making it
much less likely that we'd be able to
respond quickly so that's another whole
aspect of this
a 1918 flu killed 50 million to a
hundred million people worldwide the CDC
and others brought the 1918 flew back to
life it was dead it was not out there in
the general public and they recreated it
from DNA from a corpse and they have
been constructing experiments with the
1918 flew around the country including
crossing it with other flus and I just
think there's a really scary and stupid
thing to be doing we presumably have
some immunity to it because some of our
flus are descended from it they've said
that it can be treated with Tamiflu and
things like that but just bringing it
back to life something so scary in
creating the possibility not only
creating the possibility but
deliberately trying to cross it with
other forms of flu to see what might
happen it may be interesting to
scientists but it's really scary and
reckless for the rest of us</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
