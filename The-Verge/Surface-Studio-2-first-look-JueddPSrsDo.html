I'm hearing you you're looking at
Microsoft's new surface studio 2 now
Microsoft was here two years ago
launching a surface studio originally
and obviously had the giant 20 inch
display you can use the dial the pen all
that sort of crazy stuff but it was what
was inside that kind of led it down as a
little bit slow and also quite there and
now this model it doesn't look all that
different from the outside but it's
actually something you might want to use
as your real PC now and just because of
what's changed inside most of upgrading
the the graphics card the processor and
even the storage so it's gonna be a lot
faster and performing so first let's
check out what's changed on the outside
now I'll be honest not much has changed
on the outside it's the same 28 inch
size display now what's actually changed
is it's 38 percent brighter and it's
actually 22 percent more contrast to
this display so might just tweak the
panel it's gonna be pretty great if
you're doing video dancing or picture
editing or and if you like that and
that's really fun and what this devices
just geared towards anyway and other
than that the base is pretty much the
same thing you've got the power supply
built into it and all the internals and
down here and the display will go up and
down into sort like a drawing mode you
will see what the dial to put on the
display and you get the call app options
to change colors for text so you still
got the same surface pen support and but
what's actually changed is this is the
latest surface pen so you score over
four fouls on the levels of sensitivity
it's also got the tilt support so you
can draw at an angle stuff like that so
it's great if you want to use the pen
support on it now obviously look at it
it doesn't look like much has changed
but really it's what's inside that
counts obviously two years ago there was
a hybrid drive inside it was it was kind
of slow absolutely launched a little bit
slower and he just kind of bobbed the
system now now Microsoft has actually
switched it up this this year
and there's a two terabyte SSD storage
lab now on the place mobile that's one
terabyte and the base model also has an
NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics card now if you
know much about graphics cards you know
that that's pretty capable for gaming
and certainly for video editing photo
processing stuff like that but there's
also the the model with a two terabyte
SSD as a gtx 1070 in size let's give you
even more paperwork gaming and any other
image and video processing the affair
Allah okay so that's all great news but
there is one disappointing aspect to
this and that is Microsoft's not using
the latest Intel processors here it's
really disappointing it's got the
seventh generation Intel Core i7
processor and might not be a huge deal
given the SSDs been upgraded and all see
the NVIDIA GPUs er here it's just
disappointing where you're spending
three-and-a-half thousand dollars on
this godless machine he kind of wanted
to come with the latest and the greatest
okay in terms of models respects the
base model which is three thousand four
hundred ninety nine dollars you're gonna
get a one terabyte SSD storage there
obviously the core i7 processor and it's
16 gig of ram and the gtx 1060 now you
can go all the way up to two terabyte of
storage and a gtx 1070 and that's gonna
run you four thousand seven hundred
ninety nine dollars and this is not a
cheap machine by any means and we'll
have to see whenever we get to review it
just to see how much performance you're
gonna be able to squeeze out of it at
this time Mike's just taking pre-orders
now we don't know exactly when you'll be
able to get your hands on it you can
order it today okay so that was a really
quick look at the surface studio 2 here
in New York and now Mike just announced
a bunch of other products here so
