verge cast and a big week yeah I mean
come on was it a big week the droids I
bored was announced it was I rose the
week of this eye board and when you
think about it that's pretty really
element that's pretty important anyhow
but you know we're back to talk about
the week in technology and consumer
electronics and whatever wrong so I
don't know Ross just as I said that
rushes his eyebrows like tell me more
yeah so anyhow we're back and we're
gonna discuss what's been happening kind
of a lot going on but it's also one of
those if CES is coming in a month CS is
bearing down on us like a like a like
your tax return yeah is C yes in many
ways is you know it's inevitable yeah
it's gonna you're gonna have to do it
yeah let's you live in some sort of
European you know socialized where
they're just taking taxes left right and
center yeah I'm just doing I'm just
doing whatever they want with your taxes
am i right
I like my right Paul building roads
Falls not it Paul's nodding off camera
schools building roads how dare they but
listen anyhow let's this isn't it's not
about socialism which we talk about
every single part it's about we should
we should just talk to talk about
tantrum I do it
Siraj what why have you removed Paul I'm
staking identity actually no um I'm here
this week to talk about the Xbox Live
dashboard that went out this week so
like a really big update it's the what I
can tell it's played open for a couple
minutes so it's the second visual
refreshment the first one wasn't
launched was blades and then the new
Xbox experience and now this the Mixy
Mixy yes this is like Nix III yeah it's
like new Nick see ya in your new Nick
see it's like it really is like it's a
time of new newness yeah right with
Twitter which we're talking about later
yeah good
yes sorry so the big changes you'll see
and it rolled out this week I think on
Wednesday ish there's the Metro UI the
entire UI is now it looks like a Windows
Phone and this is future Windows as it
should be is it all should squares
everywhere mattress hope you like Metro
style is very metro you know I was just
not to interrupt but I was at I was at
the Microsoft campus earlier in the
weekend and Metro is everywhere there
are there services like on the floors
and the walls and the tables people are
wearing gigantic square shirts and
sliding from one yeah just I in across
the campus that's quite a minute it's
quite amazing
yeah and yeah go on Vidia metro it's
metro style yeah measures one it's uh
three big things
oh it's a metro but it also not right
and it's like it's got the sliding but
then like he bowls in its influence yeah
very heavy it's very metro styled of
course metro is like a touchscreen you
know kind of a interface but this is not
and you do not want to use this with
connect way it's still that kind of
hover hand thing oh really
yeah you still have to hover hand see
most of everything on there looks like
that I like your word of warning by the
way I'm adjustment Mike Scientologist
your word of warning you're like you do
not want this you don't you don't even
don't even it's bad it's not cool anyway
the second big improvement is being
searched I don't know what they call it
being but well I dunno why I think I
think I know why because that's their
search engine it's you know it's
searching the web you're searching all
the games all the movies and TV shows
you can watch on the Xbox and actually
includes Netflix and Hulu now you can
search through that mm-hmm
the unified being searched right and
that's like a Kinect thing they connect
things you can like but like Kinect not
wavy but like not ways Kinect not wavy
Kinect voice direct yes Kinect not wave
that some of their technical term
connect not wavy connect voice yeah
those are two different pieces of
documentation if you remember when
Sinofsky was talking about like I like
this Kinect not wavy thing yeah it's an
auskey talked about not wavy constantly
yeah let's get you let's get to the meat
of this anyway so you've got a being
voice search which is actually a really
cool thing if you can get to work and
most the time it does kind of understand
what you're doing you can I'm actually
watching myself a meal is going to don't
do this I actually just put mine on and
and I've observed that that at certain
angles this collar looks like an LL Bean
Dracula
thank you hang on like I mean isn't it
yuppie vampire your listless dad on a
boat I'm just with dad I don't know if
you do if you read it here you're about
to go yachting
yeah I'm yachting I don't think he's to
me at night night yard yeah oh come on
dude
night yacht she's good nights my 80s
like super class yesterday night night
yacht not yeah a yacht is really good
okay that's cool that's like the spinner
you mean like it so it's with a K yeah
yes
night yacht yes good that's good for the
band - yeah we must attract these people
don't yes sir
no but he is a different kind of voice
right yeah I mean I assume so it's like
it's bronze like a pirate voice all
right come on seriously let's talk okay
Metro UI odd notes box Live dashboard
Metro UI being voice search and the
other big thing is the new Windows Phone
app the Xbox companion which is
legitimately cool it is legitimately
cool if you have a Windows Phone which
again is a very small hey come on yeah
okay so that's what they're trying to do
they're trying to many people in the
game it's ok one could go wait a second
I've got a Windows I've got a Windows PC
I've got an Xbox
I've got an Xbox next next move in spots
yeah yeah it's to get the phone where
you can't do gaming get the phone you
can either games but not multiplayer
chivos there's chivos on it yeah you've
got upper gamer score bro gamer Schwartz
terrible my gamer score reflects them so
what do you make of the new what do you
make of the new interface what are your
feelings on it
I mean honestly compared to what the new
Xbox experience or the old new Xbox race
a lot better and I do like the look of
it it's very grown-up it's very grown-up
the new net Netflix app is sophisticated
yeah it's very fun it it orders a bottle
of sparkling water when it goes out to
you if a new Xbox Experience is am still
light this is kind of a two buck chuck
it's getting there and so and I
literally like a six-pack of Amstel
Light is is way more expensive than this
then two buck chuck but you get six of
them but I'm saying like it's more
alcohol by volume
think about it and it's more alcohol in
volume yeah did I've just literally just
shoot my truck would be going down
that's like you're a wino or yeah but
it's easier to drink it's an easier are
you happy why now yeah they're out there
on your night yacht
Oh God not yacht no I like it the other
face Netflix got updated it looks a lot
better whoo-hoo got updated and now you
can actually like instead of saying play
panel one play panel two you can
actually say played Arrested Development
and it knows you're talking about that's
pretty cool yeah really nice it's a lot
and they're doing all this other video
stuff so they're gonna bring FiOS TVs
you if your FiOS subscribe you can watch
TV your Comcast you can do Xfinity on
demand all those YouTube is coming none
of these are actually out yet from FiOS
and you two were supposed to come this
month comcast sometime early 2012 yeah
so we're not there yet but those are
like in the pipeline now and so this is
like I mean I have to say so I played
with it a little bit yesterday and then
looking at the partner stuff it's
interesting that this is not this this
whole thing is not about gaming for the
Xbox no this is about doing everything
else no this is this is they've got
gaming unlock right this is like hey we
have Netflix and we have Hulu and we
have all this other stuff we're adding
we really want you to start thinking of
this as right this is your entertainment
this is what you depend on this is I
think if they do fire never turn off so
the thing about the FiOS thing is that
it's only 26 channels so I don't know
what that channel list is but if they
could do it to this thing actually it's
26 of the worst channel I'm sure it's
like it's like WB 4 on the verge fan
just we could have W before this this
next season sponsored by to be
determined yeah but I mean if they had
all the channels or if there's 20 such
annals are good like I would put this on
input one what does input 1 mean when
you have when all inputs are basically
the same and not all this yeah well
they're all HDMI inputs and they just
have different numbers we but what you
turn on your TV and leave it on is input
1 cuz that's TV no no
I mean how do you leave your TV on well
so I have an AV receiver so I'm accurate
I leave it on yeah and then I have a
harmony and it's so it's so you are a
gigantic nerd with the universal remote
yeah I just I just I'm just saying like
it's not I don't it's because something
else is managing for you well I mean
sometimes yeah I mean yes but in many
ways something else most people don't
have that other that's something else I
mean you have to push the input button
on the remote to get beautiful
metaphorical input what not actually
physically changing the cable those oh
this is just the most beautiful no I'm
gonna get back there I'm gonna light a
candle I'm gonna sing a song I'm
unplugged my DVR and I'm yeah I don't
think anybody's taken nobody taking
their DVR off input one but it's the
goal I mean that's that's the end game
for Microsoft is to say you don't need a
DVR anymore you just need an Xbox 360
will stream FiOS TV d you will stream
your Comcast on demand to you and for
everything else there's this sounds
great
exactly you know actually one of the
they do IPTV delivery in other countries
so in the UK around the world it
actually is a set-top box it actually
does you and there's a menu option that
like laughs and Americans that select
your TV provider right if you dig into
the menus it says TV and like I clicked
it like all excited you know what
allowed that to happen just it's not me
you know you know it's made that
possible
what's that socialism that's right
yeah maybe but that's like what's
happening here right they're trying to
do all this TV stuff and like be the
living room provider because you're
right they have they've kind of won the
gaming's but yeah you know who's you
know sniffing around what's that
you know who's about to show up is it a
polite well I mean I'm not gonna put
words in your mouth and you're not gonna
put words in my mouth
no or stay away from it but yeah I mean
they've got it they gotta get they got
to come big with this stuff now yeah and
I mean they need to make this a thing
right they need to say this is now we're
doing this we're in the living room
where the entertain because it's clear
there's all this talk something is
happening apples gonna do something
right and the second Apple does
something they start telling the story
Microsoft's can do like you got to be
kidding me
right we'd be doing right
via phone just died of styli what's the
plot you know and if this is the tablet
and this is voice right no no it's it's
the tablet all over again they're pushed
they've been in the living room right
they've been pushing more than just
video gaming in the living room Media
Center has existed for ages does is not
getting traction I mean this is kind of
their tablet again right but and you
know how to check it out I mean the way
Xbox is their tap that's what I'm saying
though but but they're the TV push
hasn't been successfully their Xbox is
successful as a gaming system and it's
growing as an as an entertainment hub
mm-hmm but they need to make it real
right for people they said they need to
actually you know an Xbox was launched
they did all this Media Center
integration right yeah they need to
actually just stop the Ilia connection
you can connect to write your media
center people every was like I don't
have a media center I think I think the
minute what's a media center I think the
minute they got Netflix on there kind of
realized well this is like this is their
success story right like the health
Netflix was kind of blow up and yeah
this is their success forex story that
in the in 92 percent of all pcs in the
world that run their software right
right in every enterprise everywhere
which is amazing is they got nothing
this is a thing I think this is where
they missed it with media center right
92% of the PCs were on their software FL
PCs and Xboxes don't talk to it don't
play don't play with each other right
and they should they should do a way
better job well they should have a lot
of time together they should have found
some way to bring like Xbox gaming to
pieces they they they veered in and out
of it I think they've been talking about
that in like halting like Evo's yeah
Xbox Live I mean is your wait is though
access to Xbox Live you hit PC Paul
right no you can go to Xbox calm that's
it it's right but it's like they just
sitting there yeah 92% of the PC market
people are playing games on their PCs or
so I'm told
no you know no I was told they put out
an iOS app actually speaking of Xbox
Live it's now easier to kind of interact
with Xbox Live on an iPhone
where's the Android app they're not I
doubt I would say I think Microsoft has
like a cordial relationship with
Microsoft it is just me being mean
without a boy yeah and it's just open
hey I'm telling you I when we were out
there I talked to a few people and it's
definitely clear there's now like
you know what apples not too bad I think
especially by the way since Steve Jobs
died I feel like it's pretty hard to dis
a pariah they just had like a pretty
major loss like a really emotional thing
I do they're kind of like you know
pretty good partners actually when you
think about it we're actually kind of
friends you know yeah you don't realize
this like there was a lot of like you
know you don't realize this but blah
blah blah blah it's like yeah you guys
just have a you have an enemy now
together a real one it's like the enemy
of my enemy is my enemy or what is it
the ready is my friend yeah it's the
reverse of that is it not a friend of my
friend is my enemy is my friend my
friend that's the work that make both
the enemies a friend you think about it
no the enemy of your enemy is your
friend because you should say it's a
three-way three-way and share because
the enemy of your enemy is not
necessarily your enemy right at any rate
I think we could agree I don't think I'm
stupid I'm not sure basic there are very
basic concepts that I find impossible to
grasp
yeah right like bingo yeah still don't
know how it's played how many days are
there in a year still so we're camping
like I'm like at least 120 yeah I know
that takes more than 100 yeah okay we
will tell you what the dashboard right
alright we have a hard stop in 20
minutes we get to rehearsals for the
show tomorrow so no let's just let's
just jam through some things
alright thanks this is where you leave
Miller tag team out we said nothing
about the dash bar by the way we talked
about it there's tiles as i speaking you
ready to tag in here alright okay here
we go Miller's goodbye Ross is real not
cool
oh wow their clock it's gonna be getting
this Miller emotional over there I just
need your reaction you straight that's
great you don't know what just happened
off camera it was pretty sick yeah not
in a cool way we do have a bingo some no
we have we have like two bingo people
are awesome hey so you guys hear about
this this xbox update hey what's up with
that file with us phone and they made
you know the tetris tetris time metro
yeah and they brought it to the expo the
impression that Microsoft and Apple are
kind of a little more buddy-buddy now
was just think I was just really really
tell me more yeah anyhow I were the next
thing yeah let's do so as I gherkin Lee
said at the top of the show the Motorola
Droid zai board was announced this week
yeah what are your most hilarious you
know by the way yeah who super funny
that's basically every once while
there's like a major product like
product announcement that just wasn't
around for you know like I was doing
something else I was at this was a major
product announcement well so I see a
word like zai board on Twitter right I
like I'm out of the office come back oh
that's a real thing that's that's really
hilarious I'm a design board is very
real hilarious Android name generator'
oh yeah yeah really good we covered that
this week it's awesome if you guys
haven't seen it by the way the Android
phone name generator is amazing in fact
I'm just gonna dial it what's great is I
boards the like the name generator could
not come up with right yeah it's the
exception that proves the rule
laughs like they will go to no end to
make what your worst name you know it's
really amazing about these products is
first their it seems to be a letter
dated like four eyes and just did them
alone
I mean here's a good one Acer legend
touch my uncle bought one he was asking
me how to get any great Samsung dream
plus these guys are so good yeah you
should put that away because I'm not
it's another color of this happening LG
devour do act easy
how would she devoured neo xtz that's
really awesome amazing yeah on a lot
actually devour neo is a really
realistic that's good
xt xt z yeah I assume this is based off
of the the galaxy s ii 4G
let's Britt yeah which is the most it is
one of the most heinous phone namings
it's awful or at naming if anything yeah
babies well I think the LG rumor touch
still is like the worst overall phone
completely bumble it's great Evo branded
yeah completely they followed it up with
the the Evo slide no it's called the e
above that was called the Evo what was
the slider one and the Evo touch force
you know it's called like the Evo what
the hell was it called I've designed a
4G that just came out which is a piece
of junk Evo that he was Eva 3d was the
real misstep yeah that was where they're
like they're still trying to go high-end
they thought high-end Oh sweetie anyway
look so about the design I think this is
really interesting because we're about
to go you go either shift Evo chef
yeah the slide thank you last year it's
yes a year ago this time we went to CES
and we saw the Atrix and we saw the zoom
right yes and they're both being member
excited about the Atrix I remember how
we're like the serum it like this is a
big deal this is a true tragedy of being
into technology when you cat compact
crushing this you have to look back on
your excitement about the Atrix and how
you thought that the the lap to the lap
the laptop dock was going to be it for
you know the ish well it so so the Atrix
to just came out like totally on
heralded launched an 18 t you rolled it
it wasn't like it just came out the
motors like this video you mean herald
an arrow did I say her all did yeah I
think about geraldo I thought you would
say like there's a phone called the
Geraldo thank you this is what happens
my type for a living and you drink a
Miele yeah not an endorsement it's just
like it's now to about Chuck okay it's
also not an endorsement and then this is
awkward leaked out and they actually
released the Xoom 2 media Edition in the
zoom 2 in the UK at a launch or just
trying to get some stuff out before the
Google deal goes through I guess I try
to get rid of all
it was that opportunity yeah exactly but
they weren't even involved in this
launch like motor like Verizon has been
talking about the droids I board for
like a couple weeks and nor does like we
don't comment on this stuff
and finally Verizon's like well here's a
press release it's five $29.99 on the
comment on this this is this is the
inverse of the the Galaxy Nexus it is
insane though right the Quran is by
Rison will not release the Galaxy Nexus
yeah but they're all too eager to put
out the press release for these iboard
which is five hundred and thirty dollars
on contract ridicul and nobody's going
to buy to buy the quarters you know like
this corner I just cannot they remind me
I don't know if you guys know a skater
Christian Hosoi from the 80s he had a
series of decks they were called
hammerheads
and they had a shape that was like it
was kind of like this and then that the
front of them if you can imagine this is
like the front half the board went like
that than that and then down kind of
like that now I mean they're the shape
of those tail at the other there was it
yeah I mean just I feel like on the
internet and look up look up Christian
Hosoi hammerhead it's h OS oh I these
guys know if my brother Mannis Cooper
that's what this eye board that's what
all these new Motorola's remind me of
everybody now is furiously everybody see
it you're saying by the way we have a
bunch of our new writers here know in
the office that everybody's furiously
googling right now we just we just
brought it we did do we you get that
great you see it do you agree this it's
similar to the Zhai board it's got a way
about it nothing says I board TCU is
just saying it's there whatever anyhow
anyway so there's two of them they're
ridiculously not specific or his that's
a quote and they're named as a board
which is just amazing and I have no idea
why so we just suggested the Zoidberg
yes with it acts like that number a year
ago they put out the zoom in the zoom
and nine honeycomb remember they
remember how they were like you get
upgrade to 4G yeah it's been and like
just well so if we're gonna stick with
the X
naming convention where do you go from
here I mean whatever zoom to xylophone
you can pick any word you want
so it needs to be a three three axes the
xxx - yeah xxx - damn so that mean
that's why don't they just call
something the triplet the soul oh no
that's a Zhi Zhu I know yeah well you
got to make it go dizzy you gotta mix it
up when nothing stopping them from good
using D names what the exes is worth
extreme the extreme would be why Detroit
extreme I'm actually and I believe this
belly will be X T ar e ex TR TD you know
just like a little macadam is like he's
got like if it's like a like a really
thin may or maybe like a flip form
factor the ex TR m oh I see that's right
no no that's right ex TR M is what it's
gonna be
yeah do you think like they're just
waiting for it like like Samsung comes
up to like Verizon like what about this
one thank you do an x-ray change things
like eventually something large in the
universe is gonna hit planet earth you
know what I mean like eventually like
Armageddon I'm just saying like these
names are inevitably going to go there
you think you think you mean they're
leading up to Armageddon a philosophical
question right when you think of things
that are inevitable right you think of
planetary objects striking the earth and
destroying all mankind it's just like
like you don't think like inevitable
inevitability is like tomorrow the Sun
will rise
no it's different than that it's like
well I mean I'm just worried about you
know weights at Wayside Waifs i okay
it's like that's what he meant
it's like chaos theory or it's like it's
like if somebody's throwing a whole
bunch of darts and you're in a room like
eventually a farmville eventually a
darts gonna hit you well how many guys
how many darts you think I'd have to
throw before a lot of darts but there's
a lot of large bodies in the universe
that could hit earth and how does this
but what I want to show you think of
probable events I don't doubt that that
might happen
mmm I mean I'll accept it an asteroid or
something's gonna slam into the earth
and destroy all mankind I can follow
deep it well you've seen deep impact yes
and Armageddon
yes you tape with Armageddon the movie
right wait wait wait but what does that
actually have to do with the tip with
these eye board I'll just say it's not
it's not like a premeditated
think it's not a strategy on Motorola's
part it's there just hurtle you using
that as a comparator yes you see much
like much like an advanced office much
like an ashtray which is on course to
destroy life on this point can I just
talk so you're saying that we need to
send Bruce Willis to destroy Maps on us
no you but did you say started ah Bruce
Willis has to go up and yes the land on
the word XT RM and yes that's perfect
plant a nuclear missile in the core of
XG RM and he's got to stay up there
which means which would be right in
between the T in the R so it and then
Owen Wilson gets with his daughter right
isn't that what after something Ellen
Wilson's in that moon that was Ben
Affleck cool Bix up there no no one will
sit is not in Armageddon my completely
confused yeah you're completely confused
as he being this ring you could IMDB at
all you want but Owen Wilson a felon
will says it Armageddon character little
but he's not he's not the Ben Affleck
he's like what I say to you all Wilson
as he do he's like he's like he's the
fun he's Owen Wilson he's like Owen
Wilson plays plays like he's like a
scientist or something but it's Owen
Wilson yeah it's like the scientist can
I put this can we can we get my computer
and up in the video podcast to show
people who's gonna make slow circles
with my mouse yeah you know I'm sorry I
doubted you okay yes we should be
published we should move on any of the
xiphoid no that's exactly right
alright so what's up what so let's talk
about more middling Android products mmm
quickly I'm so ATT watched LT in New
York they put out a bunch of terrible
phones already the HTC vivid which Kris
reviewed which is it seems like these
this first wave of devices is
particularly bad but it's always bad
like with 3G most of the yeah the
Thunderbolt was a bad phone most of the
3d devices were feature phones even know
but I'm thinking like the Verizon
LT launched devices were not very right
so the Thunderbolt was okay the Droid
Charge was just okay I just got
gingerbread Lacroix I mean if you have
if you know anything about technology
right now if you know anything it's
pretty hard to get fired up about the LG
natural state so have you played with it
do we have I haven't had a chance
Jeff has it you should see this thing so
it's LG's like first big kind of baby
brought over here it has a 720p LCD
display it's actually fairly thin it has
absolutely terrible battery life David
said it doesn't he last week and the
skin on it Oh is a crime he made it a
day oh yeah sorry yeah you have been all
kinds of guys and doing nothing but
Tommy a little worried about you guys
it's just ever happen you do nothing to
talk all day anything kind of forget on
a talk no no okay that happens to the
one thing I can do pretty well is talk
oh I know I know the more tired you get
the worse you're talking becomes ya know
with me it's like literally if I do
nothing but talk all day by the end of
the day like I've run out of words
you're losing your yeah which is good
because I did that today when we had the
podcast we're not getting this phone no
I don't think anybody and nobody's
paying attention to us does anybody know
where the Nitro HD is tonight can I see
it alright just you could just walk it
over so I say just this skin is so so
bad
everything about it it's like it's like
a bad copy of touches from a while ago
you know what mister next Oh hon this
screen is seven - Wow yeah whoo yeah
it's gross
this screen is 720's screen is 720 it's
a nice screen they built a nice screen I
don't know I mean I've seen worse you've
seen a worse skin than that I'll just
open the app drawer let me tell you a
couple things here it looks a lot like
Samsung as the early skin that's what
I'm saying they it's like you know Apple
nothing's like zooming Samsung years
more overly copying them Samsung should
sue LG for copying them from two years
ago
it's like LG didn't even catch up oh I
have to say do you know this reminds me
of he reminds me of
he reminds me of NeoGeo related graphics
and then or super cartooning normally
that would be a cool thing yeah he kind
of reminds me oh you know reminds me of
the Neo Geo Neo Geo made a product
called the Neo Geo pocket yeah which was
a portable it's a handheld gaming system
it's actually pretty awesome I have one
that's in blue camouflage they release
them in a bunch of different colors they
had a pocket they had a pocket that was
black in my pocket color I have pop
color somewhere in a drawer any help
they've had icons on it that looked like
the icons on this yeah and it's
happening it oh you were filming this
okay sorry let me keep doing this is
there any personal email and this I
should be worried about
no just David's Tryphon sir yeah there
isn't okay good I mean look at this can
you see that they get HD games icon yeah
it's like full of crap what really it
really is to provide that's fine because
it's it's by far 18 T's best LTE launch
device but it's terrible like it's a
terrible phone the new Twitter and it's
kind of like this LG should try harder
than this so they want to like make a
credible argument that they're a smart
phone manufacturer which seems as though
they do they have to do bet they have to
do better than copying Samsung's from
like a year ago
yeah I don't know it's weird because I
kind of liked LG's play early on which
was look you know we're not gonna blow
you out of the water but we're gonna
make a good cheap phone and that was
interesting to me but they're definitely
not coming that was like the early
optimus long I just think why like you
walk into a store and you get the iPhone
sitting there it's IOT that's the
business oh I understand that and but
then you've got like a HTC devices and
then like that's it it's LT that's your
only selling point and 720p display yeah
I know but who cares right this I mean I
I want I actually kind of like the
backing I'm gonna give that a cut the
backing here this is six just four by
two minutes of play you know the back
and looks like though is it looks
exactly like the what was the captivate
it's like the same kind of idea is
Samsung's doing on the back of its fence
it's amazing to see you pixel their copy
and make a find she makes the pixels a
megapixel sensor huh
yeah Samsung looking at you let's take
it let's do a size comparison here
so these are really similar in size and
shape Josh Thole and galaxy this is a
galaxy in anyway yeah I'm holding galaxy
nexus next to the Nitro HD the LG Nitro
HD neo x7 oh yeah they actually have a
lot in common I mean it's obvious this
is you know at some point in the near
future
itís a the nears wrong I don't know
upgrade it's funny we I was at interview
with David it's like what do you say
about this phone in the end you just
have to say don't buy it
right that phone is doomed from the
start well I just what I was gonna say
is it's hard it's hard to if you know
anything about technology it's really
hard to buy into an LG if a if it's me
and I care knowing that what ice cream
sandwich is and that it's gotten a lot
of really great reviews pretty difficult
to buy into an lg device on AT&amp;amp;T that's
on and this is on gingerbread yep you
know when will that be up it's a it's a
first generation LTE device for 18 T's
right by the wayside so fast there's no
way that'll be upgraded to Ice Cream
Sandwich I predict this will not have
Ice Cream Sandwich in the next year the
charge and this one saying the Droid
Charge got Gingerbread last week that
was launched device press it like here's
the thing gingerbread like Froyo to
gingerbread not a big leap not not a
huge leap right that was that was those
are the versions back to back right and
Gingerbread to Ice Cream Sandwich like
not even in the same ball like I said it
makes it makes the version space
gingerbread look like 2.0 a forehand
ride blowing on it like do the numbers
yeah there's I just think it's I just
think it's it's a sucky situation for
people and it asked them you know even
the venue Pro got a mango update in a
reasonable amount of time well this is
this is interesting brings up our next
topic because the LTE ATT's LTE network
in New York is like basically empty he
was getting ridiculous speeds on that
fan like you know 60 megabits down like
insanity yeah I'm sure the other the
only guy I'm sure the only guy with DSL
in a small town kids really get speedy
faster yeah fair point
anyway run the they could run a bit of
that bandwidth to the 3d town it could
have hurt them yeah share it Paul like
socialists yeah
like socialist motorola and Saudi
Erickson both put up statements which is
it's a little bit of a different
approach I think everybody they know
there's a huge backlash
you know they know everybody's pissed
that they've just bought a huge great
new phone and they don't have the newest
operating system it's interesting
they're actually addressing it yeah
they're actually addressing it with Sony
Ericsson and Motorola kind of detailed
what they need to do before they can get
Ice Cream Sandwich on their devices
Sony Ericsson is actually promising a
pretty tight timeline motor oil isn't as
as specific if they're not it's worth
coming no statement is like this will
take months like what does it matter
we're gonna be part of Google anyhow so
but so some of the interesting things is
Motorola said that additional releases
will enable device manufacturers to ship
commercial products with Ice Cream
Sandwich with Ice Cream Sandwich so uh
like nobody's gonna launch project
products with the this initial run say
they gotta get a fork oh yeah something
like that it's I mean it's hard to tell
now Sony Ericsson said that Ice Cream
Sandwich is really only built with the
ti with support for the TI stuff that
the Galaxy Nexus has so since they're
there phones are running Qualcomm chips
they have to do that sort of porting so
that's a lot a lot of work for them this
is interested it's like what you know
it's interesting as they both on the
same day it's like very coordinated like
there's no way this was an accident
right like it's like Google's like okay
you guys are allowed to talk about your
plan right now or something like that
and you know Motorola made the misstep
of talking a lot more about how it has
to integrate all its Motorola things
into the zone yeah differentiate yeah
keep differentiating really are
necessary its they have to do it
features like moto cast Smart Actions
that are comprehensive action integral
parts of our device experiences we want
to make sure we continue delivering
differentiated experiences for our
consumers with these software upgrades
because they wouldn't rather just have
this Joni Eareckson mostly just
complained about wife Allison camera and
that sort of drivers for I will say this
what I would I have one thing that I've
felt at using the Galaxy Nexus the
creeping feeling hmm
that no software is being
updated for it no one's updating for
seven caps no one's that yeah no no apps
are being updated no one's updating put
720p displays and no one's updating for
any of the functionality of Ice Bowl
because there's no nobody's up there's
nobody has them and that's how it's
gonna be actually been ridiculous to me
we're always like hitting these new
updates on Google Wallet rollouts like
you know there's thousands of places now
especially in New York yeah where you
can pay for stuff of Google Wallet but
there's just like one one and a half
phones that can actually we can trim it
basically and they sold like 20 of them
yeah we can talk about this a little bit
but the it's actually on the list but
the Verizon Nexus they don't have not
going to get they killed Google all
right so but we have that unless unclear
as to why that is the case because the
phone has the functionality and I assume
what I mean I assume it would I mean it
has an NFC chip let's just skip down and
update on the gallery called like
Verizon pocketbook but it'll be in
competitor if they're doing Isis which
their partnership with t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T
I mean it's Princeton character and they
say it Rison said an insane thing about
not having Google Wallet which is they
refer to the Galaxy Nexus is our phone
and so their statement is like we pull
it up here yeah but they're lying I mean
it's a lie
that's definitely was made to use Google
Wallet I did I did want to say one more
thing about the software update one of
the most impressive things I've ever
seen in technology was when Apple came
out with the iPad and you didn't really
know right off the bat if that was gonna
be hugely successful but a ton a ton of
app developers redid their software like
for basically day one for the for the
iPad and then there was a quick wrap-up
and obviously they made the right bet
and there was a huge I read the wallets
it just I just want to say like that the
fact that this doesn't happen on Android
is a big problem for Google because that
that veracity that Apple of third-party
developers know they came out people
went to Retina display within months it
was it's almost instant and that's it
doesn't happen for other people and and
Android really needs to start it needs
that for for people to really be ready
to aggressively upgrade their phone
because because if Josh upgrades his
phone and it's like well but none of the
apps are really any better maybe you can
wait around you know that's not an
exciting store for Google no no I read
the same in a minute wallet recent
reports this Verizon research that
Verizon's blocking Google Wallet or
devices are false Verizon does not block
applications Google Wallet is different
from other widely available em commerce
services which makes me want to die
Google Wallet does not simply access the
operating system in basic hardware of
our phones like thousands of other
applications instead in order to work is
architected by Google Google Wallet
needs to be integrated into a new secure
and proprietary hardware element in our
phones the NFC chip right yeah the
anesthesia it's an app it's an app that
accesses NFC and it's not their phone
right it's not that sounds really bratty
yeah I think the Nexus isn't their fault
it's Google's felon it's well is it
probably not hard to say I mean when
Verizon can block a Google application
on a Google device it's supposed to be
the flagship device for a Google
operating it shows it really should it
was really wrong it really shows what
little power Google has here at Google
I'd say listen here's the deal like
we're gonna put Google Wallet on that
right now it or not sell it right you
think the Apple's gonna ask when they
eventually do NFC - Verizon for
permission I don't even know why they're
bothered at this point they should just
sell the thing on LT like LTE like it
well they can sell an L they can sell it
for Verizon but they can't because you
can't get it on Verizon couldn't you but
couldn't you can't provision it to her
you could provision it couldn't you no
there's no SIM card but it won't most of
it won't work through the devices thing
but if it went through the every way
what happened it will happen what
happened to our effective government
doing effective regulations I don't know
then this is an argument for socialist
but you won't get voice for this so you
could do it maybe you could like hack
and else nobody could you but couldn't
you put it in there but but but you can
get a Verizon device and have it you I
can buy like my friend could sell me his
phone you tell you his verizon phone
yeah right but you couldn't but it won't
be until provisioned by Verizon so you
would take your friends variety doesn't
get it provisioned but you couldn't get
an on Verizon right but I mean
were right Salah gay teens he was tried
you could do it you were able to do it
if you were able to somehow hack like
the LTE radio to accept a different SIM
card from a different Verizon device yes
they're tied together I really I
wouldn't get voice service because that
currently runs over 3G I truly I treat
truly is a struggle to not want to just
stop using a phone all together because
I have to deal with carriers yeah there
but the carriers that we have where it's
like Verizon why does it even matter
you'll sell you're not gonna sell the
Galaxy Nexus is not going to be your
hottest phone right you've made sure of
that
mmm okay you made sure that you're not
gonna sell a ton of Galaxy Nexus is over
the holiday season you're busy pushing
all of your other crap and people are
gonna buy those and you can do whatever
you want why not just do the one thing
that Google wants to do with this phone
which is let it be a Google phone let it
have Google Wallet give that small
segment of consumers what they want
because it will cost you I mean in the
grand scheme it'll basically cost you
nothing right it'll be a rounding error
and yet Verizon can't do that no they
can't they can't give a consumer a phone
that is free of their garbage and free
of their restriction and that's actually
they can't they're burying their assets
except for the iPhone right which I have
to say hats off to Apple they're really
sticking it to him I mean it you know it
must be the worst thing in the world for
Verizon to have to it you know they need
the iPhone on their network I mean how
how how hard is it for them to have I
mean obviously does it use they're fast
I mean we're Jeana right obviously and
it's I would imagine it is her best
selling phone obviously the reason it
came to Verizon so late we know is
because they essentially said no way and
how we won't do it you're asking which
is you're gonna make a pure Apple phone
and put it on our network right well
they also had some really weird revenue
sharing things up front that they have
changed I would love to have been in the
room when they made the conceit when
they when they made the concession to
Apple and said we'll do whatever you
want please let us have your phone I
love to bid in that room at that moment
and laughed at them after like the the
these executives can be so good at their
corporate speak that they can carry it
into all conversations and they're like
we have the we have a world class
leading Network and you've got a great
phone and people love it and they just
wanted to cut like like doing their
spiel in the the room I could totally
imagine that and maybe inside of their
heart of hearts they're crying right
there are world class that they're
dreaming you don't dollar bills the
pre-loading NFL Mobile will bring to
them it almost makes me want to not I
mean I've been saying you know I have to
send this review you in the back very
soon mm-hmm which is painful hmm and and
I've been saying I'm gonna get the LTE
version of the phone but it almost makes
me want to just buy the unlocked version
yeah and say screw Verizon and really
screw AT&amp;amp;T in a way because you're not
kidding them I want if I want to take it
over to t-mobile I can't if I want to
move to Canada I can shake my phone
which are you AT&amp;amp;T huh take this hello
Rogers I mean anyhow we can write we ran
throughout the carrier's every week we
gotta get we get a speed through so the
top ad psycho
yeah Jam and we got a chance with each
other gets more top and a library
process science a reach I still film
no no broseph on this podcast I mean on
this verge cast yeah okay we have more
topics just a few just to just a few
things so I think we have it on pretty
good authority from scoop Ziegler that
uh his nickname scoop had on just scoops
know that ad team also to invite earlier
in the week saying inclusive here it's
exclusive have you seen at the arts
cluesive lumia 710 on t-mobile I could
be less I could not be less excited so
this is really this is a very sure I
said last week guys is what I couldn't
be less excited about there's a Nitra HD
I think this is I think this is taking
so this is a really vision what's the
change kind of announcement topics is it
no no I'm looking for it on the site it
should be on the front page it was
the front page moments ago where is it
clicking we published a lot of stuff oh
there it is huh we published a lot of
stuff since that went up I thought it
just went up a few minutes ago No
Wow uh no okay I've located this is a
really interesting aspect because nokia
has been really adamant that they're not
going to launch the US and so they can
do a proper focus on on the States they
can do a halo device that can do
differentiation and then instead of
bringing the 800 to the United States
they're gonna bring the 710 which is the
low end product and I don't really know
why and actually Chris and I were
listening to I know why Stephen Elop
today speaking at an investor conference
we're soliciting webcast and he was
actually really upfront he was like look
the United States is different than
every other part of the world and he
actually said it's different than
Finland and it's different than China
those were his two examples like that is
that is true thank you Steve I'll tell
you what I'm gonna go with the lava this
one in Finland are really different than
America he's got it right he's pulled
like that but he was like and we can't
take the same products to America we
bring the rest the world and then it
certainly seems and I I think Chris is
very solid on this on this report 710 is
coming to t-mobile which is maybe the
deepest combination of like failure
failed ideas right now it's like you
don't want to be on t-mobile it's like
you're spinning out of control no it's
like you're the phone that no one cares
about on the network I feel like
t-mobile gets a lot of castoffs like in
an Nokia as always a lot of trouble to
shoot a Nokia device yeah it was the act
like a sixty device they were just
pushing like you were doing ads for it
yes oh yes yes they were just they were
I can't think of the name right now it's
like the neutron or the the neuron but I
trow then they're out that was a while
ago
no he wasn't that long ago it was like
six months ago they were doing ads for
it all right yeah you sound get sound so
what it is somebody say the neuron the
neuron the neuron they were doing sound
it's not April 6 2011 this down I don't
think so is it is it an s60 device yeah
yeah they were selling like pushing that
they had ads on television for that
life's yeah by the way one of our
Japanese editors corrected us whatever
not even here you know what you're
saying I got honestly I am going to
admit I won't I cannot keep track of
every smartphone it comes out for every
carrier I mean I have my limits man but
I just get I get a picture of Nokia like
how about I ruin like every few months
they like roll into all the carrier
board rooms and pitch some phones and
nobody in America wants them and so then
they finally drag the tail to t-mobile
and asked him oh they'll take it and
they took it yeah t-mobile wasn't like
yeah we'll take the cool one right they
weren't like we'll take the movie eight
hundred we're gonna go Lumia 710 you
know this is totally off topic but uh I
just glanced at Ustream and I think
somebody referred you is Neil yeah
that's Finnish I kind of like it that's
how I check that's how I make every
reservation and be able to tell your
Patel are you serious Lyle's what else
it let's start there's a battle worth
it's like it's like a horror what is my
what is my name Jake Tapper no I think
it's Jay I think it's jack topper Jack
topper
Jack Tom Jake or Jack and yours is just
Paul Miller regular white guy Dave is
just Paul Miller yeah
anyhow you know dials Patel's it is not
in anywhere like a little more Indian I
can make a reservation restaurant nobody
has any question there they're like oh
you're Neil Patel sounds a little ethnic
Nilay Patel is like oh so you're Jewish
Eli now you live in town you know I
pretend baby patellas is a Jewish I know
they I'm sir named the next heritage
introduce you to most dominating
seriously gilt City USA so so what's it
in where we have let's wrap it what is
it it is a great love it this is all you
man you're the next version of Windows
in Redmond I don't have a lot to say
about it so to say say about why there's
a few things you know who should come
back for this oh we should get Sean
Miller a shot so I shot Hollister
rockzilla event we should get Sean
Hollister on the line we can't we're not
gonna do it now yeah I would like to
hear his voice no I actually think Sean
Miller should be an employee that we
have yeah we got we've got a shot
Hollister we have a couple
yeah so we can talk about it so yeah I
was doing the thing that you were just
talking about what's that where I can't
talk now
yes you ran out I never happened
I never have a problem with that no
problem I'm great talking here so
Windows 8 Papa beta coming in February
and the Windows Store the App Store is
launching late February apps will be a
dollar 49 to start and they can add
anything up to $1,000 which is I don't
want you to have to thrombi my next
version of Photoshop in the app store in
the app there's one piece of this that I
think is really interesting and this is
just a rumor from Paul throt who did
five minutes in the virtual that's this
week yeah we should actually talk about
that but he was on his own podcast and
he was talking to Mary Jo Foley and he
said well my sources say armed tablets
will only run the metro start interface
and they won't have full windows and
Microsoft has decided that's what they
have to do that they have to make a
decision we decided the arm tablet the
Intel tablets might still do both
because they can do but I think them so
I talked to I talked to some people
Microsoft about this and there's much
that we talked about that I can't repeat
but there was there is I think there is
a this is like a point for them you know
and I I started thinking about a pretty
deeply there's gonna be two different
things yeah there has to be two
different things I just don't think you
should be called I just don't think they
should both be Windows things right I
mean I think that you I think the tablet
should be something else I think there
should be an iPad yeah that's me know I
think but I think they should you be
caught I actually think it'd be really
exciting if Microsoft said we've got
something new this isn't the Windows
that you know this isn't even really
Windows like this is something else this
is brand new it's for tablets it's for
devices that are kind of football or as
adamant that everything is Windows I
think it's a mistake guess what is in
Windows hey Xbox guess what we're
talking about Xbox and Windows Phones
like Windows box how great would that be
you know they toss it around I got one
for you yeah look everywhere
is Windows X yes that's pretty good
windows act like a tablet and the the
the Xbox run Windows X yeah the desktop
and laptops and then Ronnie you could
say oh you I would even say Windows
Phone X ba you call X start calling X
boxes whatever it is Windows X tablets
Windows X and then everything else is
like Windows classic
so what does a Windows 8 right you know
and then Windows they should also do
Windows enterprise which has nothing to
do with Windows 8 and they don't and
it's like whatever the enterprise needs
it's just looks like actually Windows
and it just XP well you know actually
there was some interesting reports but
that's that's actually not so inaccurate
the thing about the enterprise and XP
there were some interesting reports
about you know like analyst reports and
you know IT strategy reports where
Microsoft has a big job of selling
Windows 8 when it comes out next year
because all of the big corporate
environments have already done Windows 7
and they're like tired like it was a big
transition well the seven they've
installed telling you graphics cards
pretty don't wait for a Windows 9 or
whatever that which will all run in a
browser right like we've allowed a
browser to the cloud like a browser
running Silverlight that's connected to
the client that's right right but like
even like basic stuff like you know an
office gets updated like I know I know
like IT consultants and they say things
like when I update office to the ribbon
interface like we had to do tons of
training was really expensive to teach
more stupid all the admin and like you
know executive people in the world it's
actually funny because rim is new office
ribbon is designed for stupid people
it's UI design to like be blatant about
how to use all the function you start
that's for awhile but they know they
don't want to learn anything the other
day actually today what oh yes you're
unstuck loose and he's losing his on
Windows 7 ribbon
I think they much improved paint in
Windows 7 I have to say but the ribbon
interface is horrible it's just horrible
it-it's a try to find say that these are
like for us try to find say it's like
boys get smaller
thank you thank you you know I honestly
you know it needs another one you know
it's why we had to sub in the BT Miller
Ross as who I love and I'm the peach
reliever Thomas B BT Miller so now you
know a little bit I haven't touched my
xbox in a while because I I do all my
games on PC now on windows and the moon
nice oh you just rebuilt your windows
right right right
why can I say I just what I would like
to just can I just say I just want to
make sure everybody understands but with
just what just happened right yeah
Paul Miller yeah who built right yeah
and regularly uses right a Windows
machine right just said peleg but he
said paint you know he said he said it
was paint you were tape with the ribbon
yeah the ribbon in Jeff you said it's
like poison and the ribbons coming
everywhere two windows 8 on the desktop
I think is like by the way that there's
like a forum topic that started like day
the first day that we launched and it's
like still going people are like jumping
on hilarious podcast combat all I was
saying is I don't care for a lot of the
interface elements and that they are
slowly killing me that's all I mean it's
somebody you don't need slipping a
little strychnine in or confit ever you
don't have to eat three meals a day a
poison to die that's right I need a
little bit a little bit of poison like
just a drop can do it next thing you
know funeral for I'd say you know it's
funny because I don't think they should
call the Xbox Windows X I don't know I
should think they need to get away from
the word windows entirely I think they
need to say this is our new opera cases
think of the expert I think Windows
Phone is I've said this for a long time
but I do believe calling it Windows
anything has hurt them in the phone's
face right I think they they called it
like
Metro Metro Microsoft Metro yeah that's
like this is our new this is our new
it's phone it's nothing it's like it
isn't Windows it's something totally
different because it is in Windows it's
something totally different they could
say yeah we brought you know just like
you know with the iPhone they were like
yeah we meets Mobile Safari but it's
iPhone OS it's not Oh
s10 right I mean yeah it's you know this
kind of variation or whatever but at the
very beginning this there was a tie said
but they and then it didn't have a name
for four years remember well you people
just called it iPhone OS but even when I
was on the iPad they called the iPhone
OS up until the iPad they caught it and
they change it they changed it with iOS

say the the shift to this thing is
really over my face I just realized it's
