and I'm in Panasonic's booth at CES
checking out the new technics SL 1200
GAE
which is a descendant of the original
tech 12s from 1972 from when these were
originally announced yesterday you can
tell that this is a beast this weighs 40
pounds which is a far cry from the
original 27 pounds of the originals were
now this is a grand class edition which
basically means it's heavier more stable
and basically provides better sound than
even the original beloved tech twelves
that came out now I've been told that
this is a magnesium tone arm which
provides better stability along with a
brass plate underneath the record right
here and you have a big aluminum
enclosure here with rubber and more
heavy feet basically what that means is
this as heavy as possible so you can
create more stable plates so you don't
have vibrations that get in the way of
creating a good sound now this is
available in a limited run of 1200 get
it and it'll be available for us the
year until the standard edition comes
out late in the year and it's going to
retail for approximately $4,000 we're
seeing a couple of record players at CES
since vinyl sales are exploding at the
moment we just saw the Sony psh X 500
turntable the other day but this is
basically the Cadillac of record players
of CES if you want to see more about
this turntable check out the verge and
