dollar buyout a video game streaming
startup twitch letting people watch
others play Vince okay a little at sea
on this one make no mistake it could be
the best billion dollars it ever spends
I'm adrianne jeffries and this is 90
seconds on the verge twitch launched in
2011 is a subsidiary of justin.tv since
then it has grown at a phenomenal rate
by the end of 2013 there were 45 million
unique viewers watching a total of over
200 million hours per month it even
surpasses Hulu and Facebook and peak
internet traffic but twitch admits that
it's gotten to the point where it quote
can't keep up with the growth that's
where Google comes in YouTube has the
technology and infrastructure to help
twitch scale where twitch shines and
where YouTube absolutely doesn't is a
venerable live streaming community last
year a league of legends event attracted
32 million viewers with 8.5 million
watching simultaneously Google's efforts
at turning YouTube into a live-streaming
destination have been fruitless so far
highlighted by the universally maligned
YouTube Music Awards that's the benefit
for both companies so what's the catch
top of the list is copyright many of the
prominent twitch streamers play their
games against a background of unlicensed
music small companies with limited
budgets aren't particularly attractive
for infringement claims but what happens
when it's backed by YouTube's deep
pockets just ask Viacom which sued the
company for a billion dollars after it
was bought by google in 2006 it just
settled in March for more on twitch
check out the verge coming up twitch
plays Pokemon put pokemon fights back
and there's blood on the road to
viridian city</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
