Things what we're really talking about
is this group of items things that
traditionally never been digital and
we're connecting them to the Internet
doors and windows
it's coffee pots it's slow cookers these
are all real examples but the thing is
with the Internet of Things is right now
we're in a phase where it's a kind of a
Wild West not everything is talking to
each other we have so many internet
thing items so many connected devices
but we're really not asking ourselves
what should these do more importantly
what shouldn't these things do how do we
interact with them
this is Matt a co-founder of one button
it's a company that specializes in home
technology and automation but his ideas
about the home of the future are a
little more practical and down-to-earth
and you might think to me what a smart
home is is a home that's controllable
and well designed but you don't like
that being called smart because the
other thing it's a little more or less
human friendly is also considered a
smart home right smart home would
typically imply that there's some degree
of intelligence going on we really like
to think the intelligence comes into the
design so what are we looking at here
this is a future automations male ok the
mounts designed to work specifically
with this TV and that was just the
controller like there's no iPhone app
this time it's just the but this is a
standard Harmony remote standard harmony
remote so why go with a physical piece
of hardware a physical remote versus a
phone ultimately convenience factor it's
tough to beat something you pick up
press a button pulling out your phone
unlocking it it's going to the right app
launching the app waiting brick to load
pressing the volume down far more steps
there than just having something
tangible in front of you what does the
internet things mean to you in many ways
it's a whole bunch of solutions looking
for a problem so there's a whole lot of
neat things that you can do out there
but not certainly a lot of compelling
use cases yet so most of our clients
when they come to us they don't want all
the things they've been experiencing the
drawbacks and all the technology
creeping into things that might not
provide all the benefits
so we have a full music system in here
we've got six sono zones also we've
automated all the shades and lights in
the space so this is all based on the
Lutron radio Ratu system both for
lighting and shade control so both
shades and lights can be fully
controlled from the iPad for the most
part we don't like to rely on the iPad
for day-to-day control people are going
to use the keypads on the wall which are
also mirrored here so the keypads we put
them in the entry thresholds and that's
what you're going to use most of the
time so you come into your house and
you're gonna press a button entry and
it's going to turn on a path of lights
to the space we're gonna occupy is there
an element of these companies just
throwing smart devices out there just
because they can they look at people
thing that has a chip or maybe does have
a computer chip and go let's connect it
to the internet let's see what happens
yeah and I think that's currently the
hazard of the Internet of Things
and that's the state that we're in right
now every time you add technology to
something you're adding complexity so
our consumers asking for a more complex
coffee machine maybe not it's got to
have some sort of compelling value it's
got to do something that it doesn't
already do this compelling enough to
offset the extra complexity format this
philosophy bleeds over into his own home
we don't always have to have the newest
flashiest technology at our disposal
sometimes we have to work with what
we've got
matt has added new systems and
retrofitted old ones to improve his own
apartment this is the August lock that's
remotely or locally lock and unlock the
door so right now it's just
communicating via bluetooth so I press
that and it'll give us a lot now the big
thing here of course is like what does
this talk to you is there this is
connected anything else in the house at
this point right so it'll connect to a
couple of things so I've got an S login
and that allows me to see my temperature
just right on that main screen so I can
see that seventy-two degrees in the
house okay so no hub or device needed
it's just going directly to the nest
login so the nest is talking to the
cloud
pulling that information down and then
giving it to the nest as well when I
lock the door it will ask me if it wants
to set the nest to away
so it'll conveniently let me right now
say set to away and now the nest will
become in a more conservative
temperature mode so from the smart lock
and it's actually talking to nest and
this is one of the units is talking to
you right here right so this is this
seems like a hack job to me because I
know this is like what came in with the
apartment right it did just occur to me
that just like a wall thermostat the
PTAC unit here was using an identical
device to a wall thermostat and then you
could just as easily replace that with a
nest as it could if it were in the wall
so August is talking to nest one over
there the nest of the bedroom is there a
central hub are they talking directly to
each other
so we're seeing this shift in IOT from
devices that are talking to a hub and
kind of like a hub spoke model it's kind
of more of a mesh network so for
instance we're seeing things like the
nest and the August lock talking to one
another but not necessarily to my door
sensor unless it needs to from lights to
shades it turns out a smarter home is
actually within reach for us and
non-professionals let's give it a shot
this is Sean okay he's a reporter and
photographer at the verge and that's me
in his apartment I brought along a lot
of consumer level toys to make life in
his house fully better so here's the
plan
we're going to try to improve three
aspects of Sean's apartment music
lighting and security I brought along a
few options for each one first step
music we chose the Sonos play three it's
a standalone speaker and it doesn't
require a Sonos hub box posts one button
setup but it didn't tell you how many
taps were required the Wi-Fi setup
through the Sonos app seemed like it
would never end we press the button
again our already recognized in fact we
couldn't get the Sonos to work at all
without being hardwired to the router so
it lives here now it sounds great and
works solidly with many mini online
audio services but they need to be
controlled from so Knossos own
proprietary app in fact you need to sign
in to each service within the Sonos app
even if you have that services app
we're on your phone it's a great option
for people who want the simplicity of a
single destination for everything audio
but I'm looking for a little more
flexibility amazon's echo promises the
same stand-alone wireless speaker
experience but via standard bluetooth
and as a Bluetooth speaker it sounds
well pretty bad Alexa play no scrubs no
scrubs by TLC from prime music that's
not the only reason you want to buy an
echo by saying Alexa followed by what
you want the echo to do the speaker can
surface music from Amazon streaming
library read the news set timers and
more Alexa how much time is left on the
timer about 1 minute and 10 seconds like
a lot of voice recognition in AI
services it's hit or miss but when it
works it actually feels like magic and I
really liked having it in my kitchen so
music is taken care of but there's
another reason I brought along the echo
- it's got hooks into lighting systems
with philips hue and Belkin Wemo hue is
a system of Wi-Fi enabled LED light
bulbs that can change their color and
brightness based on input from mobile
apps web services and more the setup for
the hue also took a very long time and
involved waiting for the philips app to
find the hardwired hue hub so that's one
more break attached to the router but
once it finally locked in the system
works great from within the hue app and
because it's got an open API things like
the echo can hook into their abilities I
can shout Alexa turn the living room
light on and the echo will ping the hue
service on the internet and that service
will find the bulbs and turn them on
this worked equally well with the Belkin
Wemo system and in fact that could be
even more powerful since we most
switches are just on off wall outlets
with some clever setup saying
Alexa turn on the coffee pot could do
just that we live in the future like
guess so let's lock all this down I'm
away from my apartment most of the day
but my dog moose is not so I want to
know if something goes wrong while I'm
gone
in case there's an emergency the nest
Protect's smoke and carbon monoxide
detector can alert my phone if something
is amiss it's super loud to testing
damnit
and while I'm away I also want to make
sure moose doesn't get into too much
trouble
that's where Dropcam also by nest comes
in it's a small internet connected
surveillance camera setting up the
Dropcam was actually much easier than
anything else we tried today we just
connected an iphone to the cameras own
Wi-Fi taught it about the apartments
Wi-Fi and we were off the Dropcam app -
some pretty cool things like alerting
you when there are loud noises or when
there's motion in the scene you can even
set it so that you're only alerted when
there's motion in part of the scene
which is good because the Dropcam has a
pretty wide view so where does this all
leave us there's something fun and novel
and maybe even useful about being able
to control lights with your voice but
it's hard to justify minor convenience
when there's so much time spent setting
up and troubleshooting and as a cost of
each device start to add up it really is
true that less is more the Internet of
Things is just a sea of experiments and
toys but the big question is how do all
these toys actually talk to each other
that's where projects like apple's
homekit and google's brillo and weave
come into play finding a common language
among smart appliances is the next great
platform war and there's really no clear
winner yet but until then I'll just
enjoy the simple jury-rigged pleasures
of automatically hearing the sounds of
Kaiser every time I open my back door
