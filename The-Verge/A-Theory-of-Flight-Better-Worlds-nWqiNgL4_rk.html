guys holding down the sidewalk in front of
the Quik Mart, Carlinda's name was on everyone's
lips.
Story was, she got fired from her job designing
rockets for rich folks.
Now she was back in the neighborhood…
plotting her revenge.
Carlinda and her team are building an open-source
rocket to go to Europa.
Everyone wants to go there.
There are domes there filled with plants,
most of them extinct on Earth.
There are no days hot enough to kill you,
and the air is always safe to breathe.
There's no way I could afford to go 
there on my own.
Only a privileged few can afford it.
Building a ship to Europa made from easy-to-find
materials, though?
That's a genius level hustle.
The cops arrested her pilot on some trumped
up charge.
And pilots aren’t easy to come by around
here.
I can fly anything.
And I want in.
With so many hands to help, the rocket comes
together quickly.
But when Carlinda uploads her ship designs
so that anyone can use them, that's when the
cops show up.
The game is rigged.
If everyone leaves, there won't be enough
people for the megacorporations to exploit.
We knew that eventually, they were going to
come down hard.
What we didn't know was that Carlinda never
planned on coming with us.
She had bigger plans in mind.
There's no time to waste.
I have a ship to fly.
The cops didn't come to play.
Neither did we!
Sometimes on Europa, when I'm running in the
woods or drinking clean water, I wonder what
happened to Carlinda Winstead.
Did she get her revolution?</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
