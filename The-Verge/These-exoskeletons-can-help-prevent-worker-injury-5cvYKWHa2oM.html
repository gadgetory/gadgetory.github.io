work exoskeletons have been around both
in concept and in practice for decades
most people probably think of the bulky
suits that Tony Stark wears but that
doesn't seem to be the future of
exoskeletons the future is modular
lightweight and maybe even right in your
workplace
this is Ford's final assembly plant in
Wayne Michigan if you've never been to a
car factory before which I had not it's
kind of what you might think it would be
like there are lots of moving parts a
steady stream of car husks being
transformed into something drivable and
a lot of people hard at work 3,500 of
them in this specific plant one of those
workers stands out he's one of four
people at Ford who have been testing an
exoskeleton vest my name is Paul Collins
I go by woody I've been a Ford Motor
Company since January of 95 what I do
most of the day is I work over my head I
install a carbon cane on the c-max I
also put rubber grommets in on the focus
on the SDN on the b√°b units and pretty
much that's what I do most of the day
long almost 70 calories an hour
so how many times a day are you lifting
your dad I couldn't tell you I don't
know I lift my arms probably seven or
eight times on each vehicle so times
that by 615 it's a lot enter the vest
since May Paul has been wearing an
exoskeleton adjusted to his height and
arm length so when you're lifting your
arms now where are you getting the
assistance is it on the way up yeah as I
come up here as soon as I right now
right now it's lifting my arms as I'm
right now my muscles are holding my arms
up at all it's all the best Paul told me
there was a pretty significant
adjustment period and that wearing the
vest was at first like wearing any pair
of boots but after a few weeks he was
sold the energy level I have now versus
what I had before is a hundred percent
different now that when I go home at bay
at night my my wife says let's go
somewhere I jump up get in the shower I
have a more energy to do things around
the house my grandkids come over I can
play with them versus going home and
popping down to couch and feeling like
you're dead until you got to go to sleep
and get up and come and I'll do it all
over again the next day for Ford the
exoskeleton is not about giving people
superhuman strength it's more about
preventing injury caused by repeating
the same motion hundreds or even
thousands of times a day we're trying to
further reduce the number of injuries
that we have in our plants but if you
look at the body parts that are still
getting injured it's predominately the
shoulder that's our number one joint for
injury it's also the longest to return
to full functionality and most costly
just because of the soft tissues in your
shoulder so we're really trying to
prevent shoulder injuries in our
assembly plan that's Marty Smith's
he's not gonna mix engineer who works on
human systems and virtual manufacturing
at Ford he's the one who's been
evaluating different options for
exoskeletons and ultimately decided to
work with the company XO on this vest
how many people right now are using this
so we only have four right now in the
Michigan area so we've got a couple at
Flat Rock assembly and a couple at
Michigan assembly and they've been using
them pretty much full-time since May how
much do they cost
the devices are around 6500 dollars
apiece
yeah really doesn't feel like I'm
carrying a nine extra pounds I think I
felt worse after Thanksgiving dinner
than I feel right now it's probably 11
or 12 extra pounds if you eat like I do
speak for yourself
the best that Ford is trying out happens
to not have any electronics in it but
some exosuits do like this lower body
exoskeleton from sue decks a
california-based company that's also
working on modular exoskeletons so we
founded a company in 2012 and we were at
UC Berkeley as graduate students under
professor Katherine II what problem were
you and your team hoping to solve when
you decided to make these we're hoping
to solve a problem that people have
without replacing the people for
industrial use and they have very harsh
environments they get back injuries
shoulder injuries and injuries all the
time so you're hoping to make their work
environment better and do these have
electronics in them not all of them only
the latex has electronics the
electronics there are just to trigger
the mechanism not necessarily running
the mechanism so it's a very lightweight
low battery system okay Bluetooth using
yes so the idea is that if you're
wearing an exoskeleton with electronics
it's communicating but it's not actually
doing the work for you exactly okay so
you see the exoskeleton is something
that can help humans do more robotic
like work she was doing a body work I
would I would call it like robots hoping
she would work rather than humans in
robots work yeah sue Dax also makes
exoskeletons for medical use cases
they're first released exoskeleton the
Phoenix has literally allowed paralyzed
people to walk again but medical
exoskeletons while arguably offering
more significant benefits also tend to
be a lot more expensive and need FDA
approval
as far as our product map we have
variety of exoskeletons one of them
exoskeletons for elderly we can actually
walk for the longer distances without
getting tired we also have exoskeletons
for people who want to run they can run
longer distances without getting tired
so their oxygen consumptions drops and
there will be less fatigue so that's
another product there was which is
coming out so we are looking at variety
of element to give a little bit of an
enhancement to the person either to
reduce injuries or at the capability
okay so exoskeletons are not a new
technology journals and research papers
point exoskeletons that were being
developed back in the 1960s often from
military purposes the idea was to
increase the capabilities of ground
soldiers beyond that of a human
since then exoskeletons have taken on a
life of their own whether they've
appeared in pop culture at trade shows
or in much more legitimate use cases in
Japan for example where both an aging
and shrinking population mean people are
working into their 60s companies like
Panasonic Honda and Cyberdyne have
introduced a bunch of different
industrial exoskeletons but exoskeletons
are still far from mainstream one big
challenge has always been comfort and
design in case that wasn't obvious from
the videos you're looking at even when
the benefits are clear they can take
some getting used to I have this fear of
falling backwards suddenly that I don't
normally feel standing up it's kind of
like I feel like if I fell backwards now
I wouldn't actually know what to do
right the economics of exoskeletons are
also a challenge according to rich
Mahoney whose company seismic is working
on what he calls powered clothing what's
really interesting is that from a from
an industrial and medical point of view
it is actually very difficult to bring
any product to market not just an
exoskeleton there hasn't really been a
form of an exoskeleton at a price point
and a use case that makes sense for
consumer applications the jury
is still out on which market for
exoskeletons could potentially be the
biggest some analysts say they make the
most sense in the military others say
they're more valuable in healthcare or
in the workplace
more big-name companies have been
experimenting with them including
Siemens and Lowe's but they're still
relatively rare but there's no doubt
that this category of wearable robotics
has advanced over the past several years
the future of exoskeletons and and
powered clothing for that matter is
really related to the development of the
technologies that you need to design
them and so motors batteries sensors and
so any developments that make motors
more powerful and efficient that make
batteries more condensed that make
sensors smaller and more efficient are
going to allow better exoskeletons that
still deliver the power that you need do
you envision a future in which our
exoskeletons are completely connected
they're smarter they're adjusting to you
in real time absolutely right now to us
this is like the very earliest stage we
are expecting a lot more clever devices
just like any other technology like your
cell phone like five 10 years ago was
different than the cell phones you have
right now and as you go along these
things will get added into that it's all
responsibility to make sure those
features coming in at the lowest cost to
people mostly because the customer
doesn't have much money this is not a
luxury item this is for workers and also
for people with mobility disorders who
really need these devices so maintaining
highest performance at lowest costs is
an engineering challenge thank you good
thank you
who's a pleasure nice to talk to you is
pleasure okay did you get that party
this is crazy I feel like I could use
this in the ladies room but I don't want
time to see</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
