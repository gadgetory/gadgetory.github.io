is Samsung's Galaxy s7 edge special
edition for the Olympic Games it's being
given to all the athletes taking part in
the upcoming Summer Games so whether
they seize their dreams and come away
with a gold medal or go home
empty-handed
they're all guaranteed a pretty sweet
phone at least people like you and I can
get it - starting next month at Best Buy
now last month we cover the Batman s7
edge and that was another special
edition that one was very cool
it has sleek all-black design and a
Batman logo on the back
Samsung also tossed in a custom gear VR
this Olympics version is way more
colorful though the hardware buttons
match the different colors of the
Olympic rings it looks a bit strange at
first but it makes more sense when you
realize just what this phone
commemorates the home button in the
earpiece are yellow the power button is
read volume controls are green and the
camera bezel is blue and you've also got
those same rings on the back of the
phone and Samsung's also customized the
software so it stays true to that theme
of the Olympics inside it's the same s7
edge as before it's got a Snapdragon 820
processor 4 gigs of RAM a great 12
megapixel camera 32 gigs of storage and
a microSD slot it's still waterproof and
this is the unlocked version so it
should work on all the biggest u.s.
networks sadly there's no gear VR this
time Samsung and put that in the Batman
bundle but it's not here
maybe these out dates are just too busy
training to get lost in virtual reality
or Samsung just want to mess up their
eyesight but it's just not in the box
but you do get this nice carrying bag to
store the phone and if you're traveling
or just want to keep it safe we don't
have the final price just yet but it'll
probably cost around the same as the
regular s7 edge which is pretty
expensive and that's pretty much all
there is to say this is just a fresh
coat of paint for the s7 edge and free
swag where people will work their whole
lives to reach the Olympics the Summer
Games start August 5th and this phone is
coming the best by later on in August
