Women's Hospital and we're about to get
a crash course in how to deal with a
medical emergency in space I'm terrified
NASA astronauts go into space when
they're at their peak physical ability
but like the rest of us they can still
get sick and when that happens it's not
as if they can just drive to the
hospital astronauts in low-earth orbit
like those on the International Space
Station still have constant contact with
ground control if there's a medical
emergency
a flight surgeon can talk them through
it and provide professional expertise
astronauts flying to Mars won't have
that luxury they'll need to solve
emergencies on their own without much
help from earth and that's why we've
come to the Stratos Center it
specializes in medical simulations from
doctoring robotic dummies to using
virtual reality to practice microscopic
surgery Stratos received funding from
NASA to build its own spacecraft sickbay
where they run medical emergency
simulations while astronauts are
currently trained in basic medical
procedures this program is focused on
how teams should behave during a medical
emergency on a deep-space mission and
what it will take to work autonomously
without constant support from ground
control so what I love about this Center
is that you know we're in a regular old
hospital hallway and then we turn here
and we're in space I have to hand it to
y'all it looks like you ripped it
straight out of a sci-fi movie hi thanks
well we had we had a lot of input from
experts from NASA and it's based on the
Destiny module so it's the same kind of
height and width so it feels compact
just doesn't space weight is such an
issue for launching so how did you
decide what tools you at need you know
what are some of the basics that you
have to have a what is a huge concern
and this even things like fluid so we
use a lot of IV fluid in the hospital as
so every to take fluids you probably do
and so we've got like a basic cardiac
MCAT a respiratory kit like a first aid
kit that you would have with bandages
and gauze and so on it's a low resource
M health care environment so it's not a
lot of equipment but it seems like you
have a lot of different things that
could be used for different purposes
this has all of the medicine you'd need
so this is like a medicine care that has
some some key drugs for dealing with
cardiac conditions as such as
epinephrine
it has European it has albuterol other
other drugs and these this is actually
what it really looks like right there in
these little pouches so what would
happen normally if you'd open the door
and things would sort of fly all over
the place right at the very morning
people come through here and they expect
us to have a switch or we can flick the
gravity off and people will be floating
so you don't have a functional healthy
so I suit up for the simulations we're
gonna run through three of them a common
emergency a dire medical emergency and a
full-out meltdown situation the common
medical situation we dealt with first
was cardiac arrhythmia or an irregular
heartbeat however vital signs the pulse
ox is 96 and heart rates about 140 what
pressure is a 120 eighty percent eighty
so the stickers it tells you where to
put them so right left upper and lower
I'm looking at the images from the
monitor right now so I think you're
gonna need to get her some medication
take one two three
medicines in so I got a pause on the
monitor and heart rates back it's slower
I think we're good she's looking much
better
next we faced a more dire medical
emergency Ripley how to collapsed lung
and I got to try out my shot giving
skills we were really thinking now of of
how does the crew and deal with these
events and a semi autonomous or
autonomous work if you have an acute
episode and it's 20 minutes to wait for
a response from the flight surgeon on
the ground
you don't have that functionality and
you got to do it so hey so the crew then
has to work autonomously but we're lucky
in these simulations we have
communication with ground control to
help us through these trainings and good
thing too because our last test we faced
a critical emergency toxic exposure plus
a ship malfunction on top of that hi we
have an alarm going off it looks like we
have a leak maybe an ammonia leak an
issue with the ship causes a toxic
ammonia we need to put on a personal
protective equipment we don't have time
for that we don't have time for that on
top of all of this one of our solar
panels starts overheating which we have
to address for the safety of the entire
Earth
solar panel okay okay can we put the
solar panel okay what with this Brett
need to do to isolate the solar panel
problem so he needs to go into control
panel three go to control panel three
section J section J okay over these
simulations help teams practice better
communication and learn how to work
together efficiently under stress if
you're dealing with a new emergency you
don't want to be figuring out how to
work together at the same time in the
extraterrestrial environment simulating
things before they actually occur
figuring out the ergonomics of how do
you take care of patients under very
challenging circumstances is a real
opportunity to improve the care that we
provide potential patients in the space
in a space mission and you only can't
really go to space all the time and
practice unfortunately you can't go to
space all the time to practice so doing
this is at least the beginning of the
work towards improving the quality of
care in in space medicine no astronauts
have gone through these simulations yet
but Stratis plans to do more behavioral
studies and improve their sickbay
simulations and their methods could be
incorporated into astronaut training
someday so I think it's clear that I
have a lot more medical training I need
to do before I'm equipped to deal with
one of these emergencies in space I
think it's clear that NASA does too
they're gonna have to do a lot of
simulations like this one before they
send astronauts to Mars NASA is still
many years away from sending crews into
deep space but when that time comes
simulations like these will be critical
to training crews to work together so
that they'll be able to handle
agencies without much help from home if
