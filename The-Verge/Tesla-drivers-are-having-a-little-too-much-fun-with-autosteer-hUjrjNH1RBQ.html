update giving the cars powerful
self-driving features however the
company made it expressly clear those
features are still in beta and drivers
should still keep their hands on the
wheel naturally some drivers are
ignoring that advice so the feature in
question is Auto steering which is
pretty self-explanatory it allows the
Model S to sear itself at highway speeds
monitoring the traffic ahead and keeping
in a single lane this is without
question really cool but and this is a
big but this technology is really young
and should never ever be taken for
granted but yeah people are totally
taking it for granted I get it this is
exciting stuff and thankfully no one's
gotten hurt but taking your hands off
the wheel and letting the car do
whatever it wants using beta software
it's probably a bad idea not right there
now is it worth questioning why Tesla
would release unfinished software to its
customers who are driving real cars in
the real world of course that shouldn't
be downplayed but until self-driving
cars are perfected and that's clearly a
long way off it's still fully on people
to drive safely</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
