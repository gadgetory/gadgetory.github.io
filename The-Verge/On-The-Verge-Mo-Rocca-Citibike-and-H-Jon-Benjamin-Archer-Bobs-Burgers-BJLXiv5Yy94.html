nuisance to litter the streets he's be
sorry first time welcome back to Citi

Mo Rocca mo I'm crazy first I want to
ask you something don't even do you
finish that don't even finish telling me
how you are uh your name mo mo is short
for something yeah my um my father was a
diplomat in Africa when I was born this
is true you latest yep in the late 60s
and he was the ambassador to Mozambique
and so just mow is just you know I'm
making that up i just want to see how
you react to that no my mother did you
have to admit i did catch that you were
making up right it did but then you lied
for like they knew you really eww back
thank you loved well I thought once I
asked in you and then you said no I
would imagine that you were a liar that
you would lie to my face right now I
know I know I know and you were actually
really thoughtful about it is I think
you also thought the whole thing was
loaded I've dragged Africa into way to
cut very sensitive a little bit a little
bit sensitive right for your day this
shelly is or is not short I don't know
what happened is my mother was actually
she was a very sore bohemian kind of a
hippie and I was worried it is you know
in so I she was she was living the
Mojave Desert when okay okay it's uh you
don't want to help it I'm ashamed moving
along so you're an Emmy and Peabody
Award winner I like this just sure I've
been on sort of oneness yes I did I you
haven't I actually have an MDI front yes
I had a statue it's a set yet I think
what does that mean well no they're
statuettes and a statue those is has to
be large yeah step they don't give you
like eight foot tall that's just not
just a proximate of what you're getting
exactly unless you steal the thing
that's in front of the Academy which is
a life-size one which is also cheap
right it's just a prop you have to buy
you to be equal daddy you have to buy
the Emmy you actually have to buy it's
actually very common for its apparently
we want some some webbie's and I think
that you have to buy the web ease as
well not there's anything wrong with
that we love the webbings continue to
award us the prizes
but ok so your daddy every supposedly an
Emmy Award winner not but you but you
and you've done a lot of stuff in news
comedy you know you're doing food stuff
now uh but you did children shows by did
a show called wishbone which I had never
seen but there are several youngsters
here in the room who were telling me
about the how beloved the show is for
kids and it's about a dog that sort of
was the doc you can tell you okay is a
dog Jack Russell terrier who in his
fantasy life becomes the hero of classic
novels in order to familiarize kids
between the ages of 6 and 11 with the
themes of those books so that when they
encounter them later on the final s
daunting right what kind of book so it
could it would be on Don Quijote I did
trade ya oh ya ya know he was central
pons oh wow it's a great show anyone
under the age of 30 um loves it and
knows that or not not anyone but most
people's I mean not the skids I'm 26 all
right oh then you're one of the people I
don't have a TV yeah right i HEV I live
in Brooklyn got oh yes I don't they take
your TV away when you cross the brooklyn
he drops the williamsburg bridge as a
guy waiting there it's terrible hits he
hands you a copy of Catcher in the Rye
exactly you don't have a teeny you must
be a really rolls up the cost of your
jeans yeah yeah go on um I what was I
saying now beside the dog you know so he
would be such a Ponzi or he was uh in I
I did treasure island uh in he was
active suddenly became a character in
treasure on the kid Jim what's his name
I Christic in Treasure Island oh god in
the book yeah let's say Jim that sounds
wrong okay I know all right i'll totally
I think it's turning Tony yes exactly
problem is that code Tony you ever wish
bone to perfect 10 G's horn magazine so
it's not really porn magazine well
that's generally where he is Phoebe to
poor not know the perfect time is do you
guys know do you guys know perfect 10 is
it's a magazine it was a magazine from I
think the 90 is yeah it's the answer the
modern answer to playboy which was a lot
of fake breasts at the time um perfect
tenant was a magazine for connoisseurs
it was the only adult men's magazine
that featured models without breast
implants right and that was their thing
yeah they're like their attend naturally
exactly and you were the one soul
editor of perfect 10 and I was on I it
was an unusual way that I got there the
guy who ran it was a totally fascinating
guy named norm Zeta who made a lot of
money uh playing international poker
poker tournaments and was kind of like a
mathematical genius he was very nice
very generous highly neurotic and he had
a house in the Hollywood Hills uh with
all these beautiful women there he
didn't even have sex with all these
women that were now she was a very
neurotic guy but like having all these
beautiful women around him and they were
for the most part the staff the magazine
uh but he says- staff by beautiful in
addition having to pay out of it and it
was very hard to find models without
breast implants a lot of the women came
from Eastern Europe because when the
iron curtain fell it took a while for
breast implants to pour and I guess and
so uh I you think I was right right at
the star is interesting as an iron
curtain came down there was a lot of
beautiful women of that breast implants
there was also a clown glut I remember
this because there were a lot of state
supported circuses and they're all these
clowns that couldn't find work because
this is totally true yes there's nothing
to do with the story but you about times
were out of work because the state was
no longer there was no longer like
spaghetti steakhouse yeah exactly yeah
yeah and so anyway so he had this
magazine and uh and it wasn't he wasn't
he didn't oppose breast implants for
ideological reasons he just hated the
way they looked and the way they found
aesthetic yes that but I was the
magazine's grammarian basically because
he was a real stickler about poor
grammar and there was very little text
in the magazine but he hired me four
hundred and fifty dollars an hour to
pour over the copy and make sure that
there were no syntax grammar punctuation
errors okay so then so let's fast
forward a little bit okay let's have a
daily show sure tell me about how how
did you get involved in the Daily Show
and at what point did news become a
thing that was important to you well I
was always like a news junkie and so I
started going around the country
visiting the homes and grave sites of
obscure presidents I got very interested
in seeing
the weird off the beaten path
marginalized historic sites like all the
presidents between lincoln and Teddy
Roosevelt the guys with the facial hair
a couple of them were knocked off like
you know like Grover Cleveland he wasn't
knocked off but like our James Garfield
or benjamin harrison and i found that
when i went to their sites it wasn't
like Hyde Parker Monticello aware when
you walk in you're already in awe but
that the people had to really sell it to
you because you might be there to use
the bathroom and I met like a woman
named Wonder Wheel a woman named 12
wheat wheeler in Indianapolis at the
Benjamin Harrison house who volunteered
their full time for 22 years and by the
end of the tour she gave you she was so
committed to him you wanted to sandblast
Mount Rushmore replace it with a year
like this why is this guy getting his
due yeah you get what number what number
presidency I he's 23 because he's in
part of the Grover Cleveland sandwich
his Grover Cleveland's 22-24 legacy yeah
yeah and we don't because remember
non-consecutive terms under I think
about that all the time high tide in
casual conversation every River up
grover cleveland had non-consecutive
presidential terms anyway so i started
meeting to really interesting characters
and at the at the warren harding house
in marion ohio i met a god that was so
obsessed with Florence Harding the first
lady that he dressed up as her to give
tours of the house in the small Ohio
town and it wasn't like he was amazing
people thought it was exactly doing this
solo you just like I'm gonna go check
out these places I've got some free time
ya know I was I decided I thought you
know I had this like yin this itch to do
this so i did that my collected some
great stories and so then somebody said
you should go on The Daily Show and do
these as pieces yeah so they knew that's
how it started yeah that has morphed
though from doing sort of comedy news
you've done real news as well I mean you
you sort of and I would never be
interested in going on the cable net on
the news on the three cable nets in
doing punditry i mean i get i ran out of
opinions like that said you don't know
everything I'd like I'm done with our
whatever what do you think man go either
way but doing like something you know I
my name gig is on CBS sunday morning and
doing like a 7-minute piece there on and
this was actually felt almost like a
daily show piece on right before the the
2012 election uh I went up to to see
the UM the Chester Alan Arthur
birthplace because when he was president
in the 1880s there was a movement of
people the city was actually born in
Canada so there were birth or is that
and this is really back to your roots
this is right is actually history on
both sides of the border you found
Canadians going Chester Alan Arthur was
the first American Canadian president
like and they were and then the people
in both Eric only to the Canadian holder
like listen you know that they're like
this is where he secret history of
America that has a Canadian president
exactly and then and the Vermonters to
hear Vermonters get really upset about
this was just really funny yeah so what
number was he uh he is 21 because
Garfield is 20 and then he gets killed
no stop set it yeah poor poor Garfield
yeah nah not the cat is fine though he
is high cholesterol from the lasagna a
very dangerous you got a head she killed
during the parking a poison lassan yeah
like yeah okay so fat now now cooking
your dear you have an interest in food
and cooking I don't know if you're an
interest in cooking necessarily you're
gonna tell me in a second hold on don't
answer that yeah but you're doing a show
it's called my grandmother's ravioli
explain explain my grandmother's ravioli
okay well so my grandmother this is
another to lie i can do know it's true
actually i didn't go on my credit my
grandmother was uh was a very good
and she made really great ravioli and um
and when we were little we would show up
at her apartment and like you know like
10 minutes before it was tiny and wolf
the food down and then kind of take off
and uh anyway so this shows really about
guilt abatement as I never learned how
to cook and I still don't as you don't
you don't really cook no so I thought I
want to go and learn how to cook from
grandmothers and grandfathers across the
country I would I feel like grandparents
would be less concerned with the health
factor of their food then modern parents
might be yeah in the sense that like
this is this recipe requires six sticks
of butter
and that's no problem whatsoever
solutely are there are there I mean
they're the ravioli I would imagine that
you had must not it couldn't be that
healthy right her ravioli was it was
okay had spinach inside uh no but like
Millie's chicken salad had a whole lot
of mayonnaise and Mary's pierogi had
lots of butter I'm just trying to think
of a different grandparents and gaetano
only eats when he shoots and kills he's
a 92 year old observer Mark Zuckerberg
reacts estate he'll only he'll only eat
when he kill me but he kills yeah that's
caetano does that to his 92 years old he
took me out shooting and uh and uh and
he also said that he'd the big problem
and it's it was in our this episode with
the skies a real badass is that today's
kids are so attached their smartphone
that if their plane went down they
wouldn't know how to survive if they're
playing crash if the crashes in the
Andes and they and they and they live
yeah just very rare he says that they're
probably and I said what they have cell
phone coverage in the Andes yeah and
there's a great question yeah exactly
then they could look up like forage or
something or just call the police and
say can you get more right and he was
really bothered by one of the areas he
did like the concept he didn't like the
scenario that I was painting he insisted
that when the plane goes down the Andes
that your cell phone breaks it just
there's no way if you you let yourself
on breaks maybe if it was in the
overhead compartment and that got
destroyed alright it wait with it's an
overhead compartment it's and you're
alive it's likely i i'm not i don't know
either i'm confused about the whole
concept of a plane crash anyway anybody
surviving but but you know guy tonnos
that his name i'm gonna let you know yes
this is sure I mean my that's my my
thought was what you'd obviously eat the
people right cuz they're there but I
think once they're dead you'd have to
hunt them you had but you have to I
don't know it's like eating a lobster
don't you know you have to kill them
first right Yeah Yeah right well anyway
good and so on
I can't remember what he said I do know
that he said that this is like a really
good part to eat that thing but I feel
like there's a lot of fat in that right
apart is that good I think so it would
savory ok I think that's that we should
just stop here on cannibalism where and
when if I want to see this show the
episode about cannibalism and others my
grandmother's ravioli is on Cooking
Channel on Wednesday nights uh and it is
not the cooking channel their bare their
realize that there's a two yeah they're
about each other could you know there
isn't it's just called cooking job but I
think it's I always feel like a caveman
when I'm saying where it is that I also
I've a new show on Cooking Channel yeah
but just it down there they like country
actually they can't say the DA they are
they said don't say that and they're
gonna have to they're gonna happen it's
like ending a sentence in a preposition
at one point like you just have to do it
like we have to get over that rule it
has to be thought cooking I agree so
what time on The Cooking Channel I go to
see this what day what time it's on
Wednesday what channel on if I'm a Time
Warner subscriber which I am do you know
what channel the cooking channel is on
my it's on Cooking Channel Judah you
know that number it is in New York is on
the cooking channel it's no don't go to
the cooking channel because you'll never
find this show right or any others right
I think actually Paula Deen is now on
the cooking channel that's a bit better
it's the that's the racist cooking check
is that a good base didn't like it give
us both thank you so much and next up
Ross millar sits down with Jon Benjamin
the star of archer and Bob's Burgers to
see what life is like as a voice actor
check it out you're a writer you're
meeting your voice actor what do you see
yourself first and foremost a Jew you
may not recognize John Benjamin's face
but you almost certainly know his voice
from home movies dr. Katz Archer he
played a can of vegetables in wet hot
American summer we had a chance to sit
down with prolific voice actor just as
he was wrapping up this past season of
Bob's Burgers how are you recognize and
is it
by sight or sound it's by smell they
said oh yeah you'd get that a lot yep
that's definitely John Benjamin yeah I'm
not the thronged by people but said
daily do you ever like you do you ever
like go to like a crowded burger place
it's like I'm just gonna very quietly
tell you my orders no one can overhear
this not many people have recognized me
just by voice a couple times though
hello sterling sterling listen very much
oh boy smell you know what to do oh damn
it god damn it what wait for it hahahaha
leave it I mean if you will ask you to
do voicemail I've very frequently how
often do you actually do that voicemail
very infrequently there's a lot of
legwork and getting the voicemail up on
a phone and they'll stop asking you the
voicemail and I go through the menu
while you wait yes there was a kid who
followed me for while I was walking to
the ymca for three blocks while he said
it was setting it up without asking me
like he decided just noticed I'm going
to have you do my voicemail so he walked
with me and he was like hold on like I
gotta I just got to get it oh my god
that's great walking with me oh no
I just gotta set it up Oh case is it and
I'm like i'm not doing it i'm on my way
to the gym i can't do it no no no hold
on Don press two you know doing that for
like but ya wouldn't go away until I
walked in the Y and then he wasn't a
member that was that was the escape
route he wouldn't even of his cars all
right just take it in not doing your
voicemail was over in the entryway
despite his numerous projects John
Benjamin has never actually ventured to
what many argue is the next big boon for
voice actors video game rolls you're one
of the few boys actors who have not even
touched those why is that yeah
no I've never been asked and I'm a
player I've played them what do you play
well I I play a lot less than I used to
but my son now plays so there's he's
he's pulling me back in so we've been
playing red dead redemption oh really
yes it's just not a great game for a
ten-year-old to play but there are
moments he's learning about morality yes
and about the West yeah and about rape I
didn't know that about red dead
redemption did you know that no I am
playing it actually was a rape
apparently a rape okay I a prompt like
you actually want to rape her press X to
rave yes ok that's what he said I can't
find that ok so I'm not sure whether
either way that's bad yes if he made it
up that's really bad right like he's has
right so even that the fact that that
scene is lexicon is crazy when he gets
there he'll don't know so this is rape
yes oh dear john benjamins curling the
midst of two hit shows Bob's Burgers on
Fox and Archer on FX with two
fundamental difference your sessions are
very efficient and sometimes really
quick like about an hour and a half
usually for a full episode for a full
episodes they do an episode in today I'm
on in the studio with headphones
everybody else in headphones are right
yeah so so are you at that moment are
you in a booth alone or their other
people with you I'm in a booth alone and
there's an engineer outside yeah sewing
nothing is that I mean so you how often
do you interact with your cast members
in your actually recording are they on
the telephone as well no they don't if
they are true they record everybody's
part separately okay so occasionally I
will bump into a cast member but most of
them live in LA
in New York I think Jessica Walters who
plays my mother lives in New York so I
saw her a couple times how does that
compare to a Bob's Burgers Oh Bob's
Burgers is done with everybody usually
together so it's much more unruly and
much more funky the way it smells yep so
how much add lignin can you do on that
show how much is in well that's
encouraged to do a lot of ad-libbing and
it's not that Adam Reed doesn't
encourage it it's just sort of not
called for but in Bob's Burgers we'll
we'll do a lot of improvisation when you
are doing the different roles how do you
differentiate the voice well with the
chosen presently doing not much
difference I thought I did suggest which
was I think quickly shot down by Adam
Reed like an effete accent for the spy
which what would that sound like I think
I don't mind I can't remember he might
have the tape but you know I saw I was
sort of doing this or something you know
like doing a voice like make rights a
spy right no I don't know but he was
like no no no no like dough stop like if
I wanted that I would get somebody way
better at doing that accent than you we
work to do I had to ask you know you go
by John Benjamin mostly you're also h
john benjamin the Henry when did the H
go silent uh at birth you just you just
stopped using it for you um I was not
told about the age for a long time and
then it was sprung on me like I was
adopted like I am son do something to
tell you your name is John but it's not
just John there's an H in front of it so
what I was and I was like I was what so
why was it picked in it like it was
never like to be used it's not Henry
though hi Henry well that's what
Wikipedia I'm not gonna tell you what it
is but I'm gonna let them think I'm just
gonna say melis humdinger then it's
about humdinger
well that would be crazy I mean what is
a humdinger no idea it's just when those
words you hear like shenanigans it's
just a blowjob right in the 20s they
would call it I'll have a humdinger so
the H is going to be intentionally just
a mystery yes I keep it that way by the
only reason I've had the H was Laura
Silverman who was a was on dr. Katz
filled out my credit ok and she did it
just to make fun of it ultimately though
John Benjamin is a comedian and even
when interviewing him you're never quite
sure if he's being serious or if you're
just part of one of his really big
elaborate jokes my name is actually h
john benjamin and dude there is a name
