environment where decisions have to be
made quickly and the algorithm will have
to take care of that the question is
will there be humans in the loop or will
they be on the loop or will they be out
of the loop killer robots are weapons
that would make drones look primitive at
least with the drone there is a human
being who looks at a computer screen
sees the target and pushes the buttons
to fire the missiles and kill as we
begin to approach the possibility of
having machines select and engaged
targets we want to be very careful not
to cross that line without high-level
policy review as technology races ahead
as we achieve these fantastical advances
what decisions are we going to be
comfortable delegating to machines and
what kinds of decisions are we going to
insist on reserving for the exercise of
human judgment
we're a long way off from the day when
armies of robot soldiers will march in
perfect formation shooting lasers across
enemy lines but the US military has
stated its intent to use robots on the
battlefield where they can theoretically
carry supplies bring cameras in to
dangerous places and yes even kill some
experts are calling robotics the new
arms race for that reason an
international group of scientists
professors and activists including the
Human Rights Watch and the International
Committee for robot arms control are
calling for a debate on the questions
that inevitably arise with robots that
can be used in war i'm martha brood and
i'm a member of the international
committee for robot arms control I'm a
physicist by training and I proposed a
ban on autonomous weapons as early as
1988 we go to war and when we see what's
going on we decide there's a point we
don't wanna go beyond that point if you
look at the history of the Cold War
there are many incidents where people
interrupted the chain of events if you
look at the crisis decisions at the
highest level that were made during the
Cuban Missile Crisis or other major
international crises it's always a point
where somebody says no don't go don't
take the next step and if we automate
everything is not going to be that human
intervention somebody always has to do
that no more otherwise wars will never
rent either you won or you lost or it's
just too much blood and it's not worth
it anymore at some point people say stop
but if we outsourced war if we outsource
the process of conflict if we make that
all a matter of machine decision and
we're not going to have
that that intervention of the human
heart this is going to be just the
program that's running good morning
everybody for all of us in the DARPA
community there's no place we'd rather
be even right here today and the reason
for that is that a DARPA our mission is
about breakthrough technologies for the
future to help make our nation in our
world a safer a more secure place DARPA
is a 55 year old agency in the defense
department we were started in the wake
of Sputnik it was a real wake-up call
for the United States it was a huge
surprise and then as now we understood
that technology is a cornerstone of our
national security people were pretty
clear that we did not want to go through
that kind of surprise again so DARPA was
created specifically to live outside of
the rest of the way that we do our
science and technology investments to be
a projects agency with a specific
mission on breakthrough technologies for
national security the general desire is
to build machines that amplify the
effectiveness of people during the Iraq
war there was a very difficult problem
that the Defense Department faced with
improvised explosive devices and so we
had funded a number of robots before and
DARPA helped to see that those machines
could be adapted for getting rid of IEDs
really when you think about what robots
are capable of today it's very very very
early and here at the DARPA Robotics
Challenge I think that really
comes home to you when you see robots
taking you know 30 minutes and not being
able even in that much time being able
to do the things that we as humans would
find very very simple to do but focusing
on disaster relief in the context of
this challenge I think really allows us
to to push the technology first to see
what we're able to do today and then
start pushing it to the next level so
that eventually we will have robots that
have far more capable features for
disaster relief and I think you know I
think for many other applications as
well we're not building weapon systems
here we're building the underlying
technologies that can be used in many
many applications and our main focus
here is recovery and disaster relief but
just like DARPA worked on the internet
GPS fiber optics all of which we use
every day and so does the military
robotics will be the same
we'll use robotics in our homes in our
work and some of that will be military
but not all of them to be sure if
somebody came up to me and asked me to
build a robot they could fire a gun I'd
probably say no I like what I do now
I like the research because the research
is fun the technology itself doesn't say
what it's going to be used for in
certain cases of course like a
particular weapon and a bullet and
things like that
those have primary uses for military
systems and are not dual use but these
robotic systems are very general purpose
and you really need to understand that
they are neutral with regard to the
concern of are they military or
non-military so whether the Defense
Department funds them or some other
company funds them for whatever use that
development of technology is in fact
possible to end up in any kind of system
given the outrage over the military
using unmanned drones and lethal strikes
many people may not be comfortable with
the idea of robots as weapons and most
people in the robotics community seem to
agree that now is the time to have that
conversation before we have killer
robots
not after million comes down to how
people use technology it's a matter of
human wisdom and being thoughtful about
how technology gets applied I'm very
confident that we will have the wisdom
to use robotics for mankind's benefit
but we can't assume that will happen we
have to make that happen this is an
issue that well when I first started
talking about 25 years ago and people
would just kind of stare at me and then
ten years ago they would just say oh
yeah terminator yeah so ladies you know
it was a big joke just in the last five
years it's you know the giggles of
stalked people are realizing it's too
serious you know our job at DARPA is to
invest in advanced technologies and we
pursue them because of their promise
but robotics is a great example of an
area where we also recognize that that
in driving those technologies forward
we're also raising a whole host of very
important broader societal questions I
don't have a position in terms of
whether the US should or should not sign
any kind of and I think that the
directive that the DoD has itself signed
with regard to legal autonomy has been
it's really good it's been very
carefully thought through it says that
the primary concern is one of
reliability you'd want to make sure that
if these systems decide within a
particular set of instructions from a
human operator whether to go to one
place or the other that that choice is
always in line with the intent of the
operator so it really reflects back to a
human beings choice there's someone like
me comes along and says we should have a
hard red line we should not cross that's
what they don't want to hear instead
what they want as well we should think
about what the ethical rules are which
is just a way of deflecting the concern
and and and saying we're gonna do it you
know we have their rules about how we're
gonna do it
some people will say oh well you know
where do you draw the line and I always
say well you draw it somewhere that's
the important point
and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
