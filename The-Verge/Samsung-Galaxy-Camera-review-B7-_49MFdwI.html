this is samsung's new Galaxy camera
which is essentially a point and shoot
camera matched up with a smartphone it
even looks like a combination of the
tooth there's a zoom trigger and a
shutter press on top and a big lens on
the front but there's also a huge 4.8
inch display on the back that's actually
a decent looking camera a lot like some
of samsung's other point-and-shoots and
ironically it's smartphones its plastic
body is really wide though and it
actually starts to tip forward a bit
when the lens is extended just because
of how the weight is distributed so it's
a little awkward the 4.8 inch display is
really the most important part of the
Galaxy camera though it's a fantastic
720p screen and it's honestly better
than we've seen even on a Samsung
smartphone before it's also a touch
screen and is as responsive and useful
as you'd expect your phone to be a
slightly smaller screen might be better
since it would actually make the camera
a little easier to hold and use
especially in one hand but this is a
really great camera display the Galaxy
camera runs Android 4.1 jelly bean same
as the galaxy s3 and it's pretty much
the exact OS you'd expect to see on a
Samsung phone plus some camera specific
features full Android is good and bad
though you get all the apps you want for
photo editing sharing and things like
that but you also get a lot of
notifications and pop-ups and sounds
that just distract while you're trying
to use your camera there is fortunately
a blocking mode which lets you turn all
of this stuff off but that's not on by
default the full Android experience is
also not great for battery life normally
cameras hibernate when you turn the
screen off so the lasts a long time just
on standby but with the galaxy camera
it's still grabbing emails tweets and
everything else so the battery only
lasts a couple of days even if you're
not touching the camera there's also a
setting that turns the wireless radios
off whenever the screens off but for
some odd reason this isn't on by default
either the kenner interface is blocked
into three categories and it
automatically initiates anytime you have
press the shutter button
there's Auto which is just to set it and
forget it automatic mode there's smart
which lets you pick scene modes and
filters and let the camera adjust
automatically an expert which basically
puts the camera in manual mode and lets
you control aperture and shutter speed
and ISO and the light Auto smart worked
fine but when you're an expert it gets a
little complicated to wade through all
the different menus and options and
you're constantly flicking and scrolling
on the touchscreen to change settings
one physical dial would be really nice
to have but instead you end up using the
screen for everything the two most
integrated apps with Android and galaxy
our Instagram and Dropbox the Instagram
app itself is a little awkward since it
only runs in portrait and that's not
really how you'd want to hold the camera
but it's at least part of the sharing
API is an Android you also can't zoom an
Instagram or any third-party app right
now but apparently that features at
least coming to Instagram soon for the
most part at least for now you're
probably better off shooting pictures in
the camera app itself and then sharing
them from there which fortunately
Android makes really easy the other
great app is Dropbox which isn't
specifically designed for the galaxy
camera but it's auto upload feature is
awesome you just turn it on and every
time you take a picture it automatically
uploads to Dropbox and you get it
everywhere else the most frustrating
thing about the Galaxy camera though is
that it's not a very good camera it
takes soft pictures without particularly
great dynamic range or low-light
performance there's also a lot of barrel
distortion meaning the center of the
image tends to bulge as you look at it
the pictures are about the equivalent of
an entry-level point-and-shoot which
would be fine if this were priced like
an entry-level point-and-shoot but it's
not fortunately that 1080p video
situation is a lot better but it's still
really nothing to write home about so in
effect the Galaxy camera is just a $200
camera that costs $499 the extra money
does buy some great bells and whistles
but it honestly might be too many we'd
love to have Android in the camera with
all the apps and options on the big
beautiful screen but we'd like to have
camera optimized app selection or
funeral notifications or at least some
of those things turned off by default to
make the Galaxy camera better as a
camera it's a great proof-of-concept and
we definitely hope other manufacturers
pickup the idea that Android can power a
great camera but unfortunately the
Galaxy camera isn't really that great
camera</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
