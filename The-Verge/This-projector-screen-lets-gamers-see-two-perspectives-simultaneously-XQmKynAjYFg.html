at CES unveiled the first of the big
gadget Expos here in Las Vegas we're
checking out the mirror of his
multi-view display effectively it's a
projector screen a multi-layered
projector screen that'll let two people
see different images from the same
display so depending on where you sit in
the room you'll see a different image
projected from one of the projectors in
the room now the projector screen works
only with two different projectors the
company says they can do many more but
right now they have its showing with two
different ones so on the right side you
have a an image of Toy Story playing and
then as you rotate from the right to the
left you'll see it change into a nature
video now mirror biz isn't doing
anything special with the projectors
they say that these are off-the-shelf
projectors they have some of some
changes to the optics of the projector
but nothing major they're off-the-shelf
projectors hardware that anybody can buy
it's the multiple layers in the
projector screen that are able to handle
two different projected images on top of
one another it's kind of hard to capture
on video but as a viewer if you stand
directly behind one of the projectors
you'll get a crisp bright image and then
as you rotate it'll kind of degrade in
quality and degrade in brightness but
it'll sort of shift and shoot the other
image and then when you're standing
directly behind the projector on the
other side of the room it'll look
perfect and crisp and bright from that
angle
now mierqis is imagining this as a
technology for one for gamers so
essentially if you want to do couch
co-op with your friend you don't have to
do split screen anymore one of you can
sit on one side of the room the other
one can sit on the other side of the
room both of you can enjoy a full screen
display and they're just layered on top
of one another they also describe this
as a way to do competitive gaming
without screen looking so if any of you
played like Halo 2 back in the day
looking at somebody else's screen that
was like a huge taboo kind of a a kind
of cheating here with the mirror vis
multi display projector system both of
you have your own screen and you can't
even see the other person's display now
they imagine it's bigger than just
gaming now this could be like a home
theater experience where two different
people are watching different things at
the same exact time without interfering
with the other one now if you don't own
any projectors the company will sell you
a bundle including the screen the two
projectors for around two thousand
dollars now this week at CES the company
is launching just the screen for 499
dollars starting at a 54 inch version
scales all the way up to 95 inches you
can buy it now from your business
