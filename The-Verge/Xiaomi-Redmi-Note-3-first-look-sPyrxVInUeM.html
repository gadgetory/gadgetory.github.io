The Verge and we're taking a look at the
xiaomi redmi note 3 it seems like every
year would check out down these latest
phones because they kind of set the bar
for price versus form and design this
phone is about $200 u.s. and for that
money you get a metal body which feels
fantastic so it's got a great design
middle sides the top and bottom are
plastic for the antenna so you can get
good signal but aside from that I mean
it's got a fingerprint sensor on back
all the things you'd expect from phones
in 2016 and for a really really cheap
price so this phone is a massive 4050
milliamp hour battery inside that's
bigger than the Nexus 6p bigger than the
note 5 bigger than the s7 edge so it's a
positively huge battery it should last
and last so up front is a 1080p display
it's 5.5 inches so it's not super sharp
it's not quad HD it's not Q HD so it's
not as sharp as like say a note 5 or a
s7 edge but it's still plenty bright and
it's pretty sharp so inside is a
snapdragon 650 processor it's not top of
the line but it is very fast very fluid
there's no app drawer because Johnny's
theme is kind of strange it's kind of
iPhone like in that regard so it's a bit
different but everything is really fast
and fluid and super responsive it's
snapdragons mid-range processor but it
feels very fast on here and so as for
the camera a 16 megapixel sensor which
is pretty good and it'll focus in point
one seconds that's what Johnny says
anyway and it's got phase detect
autofocus so that also helps with the
speed and focus accuracy as well so it's
pretty decent camera it's not gonna
compare to a galaxy note5 or s7 edge or
any of LG's latest phones and it's $200
so that's how much you'd pay on contract
for an iPhone or
something else with that name there are
phones in the US that are near that
price point
there's the Moto G and things like that
but I mean the build quality here is
kind of on a different level that's what
Johnny is really trying to push they're
trying to raise the bar as far as what
you pay and what you get in return and
we can't really think of any other
phones for this price point that really
hit that bar like this one does still
can't buy it in the US but the hope is
eventually maybe we'll be able to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
