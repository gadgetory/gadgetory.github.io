is the Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.7 for
verizon when you first think about it it
seems like just another screen size in
the galaxy tab lineup but it's actually
much bigger change than that it's super
thin it's only seven point eight
millimeters thick which is only point
one millimeter thicker than the toshiba
excite and this is a way better built
tablet weighs about 12 ounces and is
much thinner than the Galaxy Tab 7.0
plus it's the first galaxy tab to use a
super amoled plus display and that's
really the best thing about this tablet
it's 1280 x 800 has incredibly deep
blacks and really great viewing angles
and it just looks great it's definitely
among the best displays we've seen are
an Android tablet of course it's nowhere
near as good as the retina display on
the new iPad but it's still really solid
the device runs Android 3.2 plus
Samsung's TouchWiz skin and TouchWiz
changes pretty much everything about
Android and on at allit it actually
really helps honeycomb has some serious
issues with being sluggish and laggy and
then can cause some real problems with
tablets and TouchWiz helps it adds some
new functionality there's an easy way to
take screenshots there's a quick access
settings menu that lets you change
connectivity settings and things like
that and there's also a little bar that
has many widgets that you can just pop
up over an app that you're in and take a
note or change the music that you're
playing without disturbing the app that
you're actually in which is pretty cool
but unfortunately it can't get around
some of what's really awful about
honeycomb and it's still difficult to
use there's still some browser issues
fortunately this device actually loads
full sites instead of the mobile sites
that most tablets do but it still runs
into problems with pinching and zooming
or even just basic scrolling and moving
around from apps so honeycomb is still a
huge frustration but TouchWiz definitely
helps Samsung has promised an update to
Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich but
Samsung actually has a pretty bad
history of delivering updates on time or
really at all so we're certainly not
holding our breath for that update to
come the Tab 7.7 has two cameras it has
a 3.2 megapixel camera on the back and a
2 megapixel camera on the front both are
fine neither is worse than most tablet
cameras but neither is particularly
interesting either the camera app on the
other hand is great it has tons of
settings readily available on the left
side which make it really easy to change
white balance exposure or a timer and
it's just a really great way to get a
little more
control over your pictures you can also
shoot 720p video but there's no image
stabilization and holding up a tablet
this big to try and shoot video is
pretty difficult so you get really shaky
really blurry video there are two
speakers on the device one thing that's
really cool is the peel remote app
there's an IR sensor on the Galaxy Tab
7.7 and it works at the peel app to
basically create a universal remote
control for all of your home theater
stuff out of your tablet it has a really
easy setup wizard that walks you through
all of your different devices and lets
you control them straight from your
tablet and it also kind of works as a TV
Guide so you can find stuff to watch and
it's a pretty good remote the tablet
connects to verizon's LTE network which
is great Verizon's definitely got the
best LTE network in the u.s. right now
and we got solid and consistent speeds
and it was fast but not nearly as fast
as the iPad which was odd we
consistently got better scores from the
iPad even though the Galaxy Tab 7.7 s
were still pretty good and even despite
having the LTE connection battery life
is still really good on the tablet it's
good enough for at least a couple days
of use if you're using it just regularly
and even using it heavily it lasts more
than a full day the Galaxy Tab 7.7 is
really a reminder of how limiting
honeycomb is it has great hardware great
internals and even the LTE connectivity
is great but without better software
it's just not as good a tablet as it
could be it'll be much better when it's
updated to Ice Cream Sandwich but even
then there's the problem that there just
aren't that many good apps designed for
larger screen android devices right now
and at four hundred ninety nine dollars
on contract or 699 without it has some
really serious competition especially
the iPad which best sit on almost every
level and even other Android tablets
like the transformer prime which is
already been upgraded to Ice Cream
Sandwich are probably a better buy right
now
