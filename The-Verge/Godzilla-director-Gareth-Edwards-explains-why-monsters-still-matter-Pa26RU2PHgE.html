and I am here with the director of the
new Godzilla Gareth Edwards Gareth
thanks for sitting down with us where is
he I want to meet him he's over there
hey I still hasn't hit me like when
people say that you go oh yeah I guess
we did
yeah well you here at South by Southwest
last night you did a new clip from the
movie where you just like screw up and
jack up Hawaii all over the place it
looked awesome
okay can you talk to me there's some
clips from that they've been in the most
recent trailer can you talk a little bit
about what that sequence was and what
was about yeah I mean I guess I guess
it's fair to say that it's the big it's
the big reveal of Godzilla and you only
saw a glimpse he's actually like twice
as long but we couldn't show all of it
last night and so I felt like in the
film he needed a really good
introduction I didn't just want to throw
it away so I spent like it's a 10-minute
piece that builds up to the first proper
reveal of him in the movie and it's one
of my favorite parts of the film and I
love the suspense like I love like you
know in a weird way when you do a film
like this there's like an unwritten
agreement with the audience that they
want to be teased and they want to be
like pulled in slowly and this is kind
of like what I'd call like cinematic
foreplay that goes on you know before
before the climax and I think that's as
much fun as as you know the big fight
sequences and things definitely and I
love there's that one shot where it's
and it's in the trailer he kind of like
goes underneath this ship it has you
know shades of Jaws and this you know
feels like that bill before the tidal
wave was great and then the dog thing
happens what I'm not going to talk about
that because people will be sad yeah
so I about the creature design like it
was the big reveal like there's you know
you're very true the 1954 original but
also it's like it feels like a real
creature like the folds of skin around
his face you know how did you when you
set it out to do this how do you say
we're gonna go and you know bring all
the different elements together that
people know about the character yeah I
mean that the design of Godzilla was
predominantly worked on by weatr
workshop in New Zealand and I was in the
UK at the time so we did like we did
everything by a Skype and so I'd be up
to like 4:00 or 5:00 a.m. and
they would share their desktop with my
desktop so I could sort of watch them
work and we would chat and and the
simple way to approach it was I mean
they did hundreds of designs but we had
this 3d model of Godzilla and an artist
there called Andrew Baker was it was
kind of in charge of pushing and pulling
all the points and sculpting this thing
and we we basically said to ourselves
like we would turn it into a silhouette
so we instead of seeing it or like a
gray clay thing it would be just pure
black on white and because it's such an
iconic silhouette in our film you see it
as a silhouette you know a lot so we
wanted to get that right and so
basically we we had this model and we
turn the silhouette until we saw that
doesn't look right let's push and pull
that turn it a bit well now we've ruin
this bit it's like a Rubik's Cube like
you get one side right and you look at
I've ruined the other side now and our
goal was to do this until we could
rotate it 360 degrees and not want to
change anything and I thought that would
take a few days and it took months and
and I am very hard on myself I don't
like often whatever I do I think it
could always be better and I look at
that sculpture that we have got a copy
in my office
and and I have no regrets that's what I
kind of go okay that he's cool right
I really pleased with what we did there
awesome and what about you know you
teasers before other creatures being in
the movie was it the same kind of
process and how did that and obviously
monsters there are many many creatures
in that film yeah I mean the I think
it's out there now that there is maybe
something else in the film obviously and
possibly and we wanted to do something
unique trying to find a unique monster
in this day and age one of the designers
summed up well they said it's like
trying to find the last parking space at
Disney World or something it's like so
many monsters have been done in so many
films like trying to come up with
something that feels different is is
really hard and we spend I mean we must
have spent over a year or so designing
whatever it is and
and we basically looked at all our
favorite monsters from a t-rex to HR
Giger salient Starship Troopers to jaws
to King Kong and what is what is it
about each one that makes them like so
iconic and then tried to die all those
aspects in and it's funny because we we
didn't do it consciously but we kept
right about this try this try this we
kept mutating it and doing different
things and having different generations
until we found this until we taught I've
arrived at something we thought like
Adela's really cool and then we look
back at it and when hang on the head
looks like that monster in their arms
that like that much than that and
realize that all these inspirational
creatures it kind of ended up on our
thing and and that felt appropriate
really because we set out to kind of do
this it you know kind of try and combine
all those elements but in a way that
felt like a cohesive be you know
creature that wasn't like a
Frankenstein's monster but like yeah it
all has it all looks like it was evolved
from the same organism a little bit that
we saw was very very exciting so I know
this even more and I want to talk about
you know you know updating the film the
original Godzilla 1954 there's obviously
a lot going on somatically about what
japan had just gone through but you know
nuclear attacks you know and the big big
monster movies in general are kind of
like you know an allegory for you know
nuclear paranoia and fears you know when
you're sit down to adapt the movie or
update the movie you know how did you
decide to go and attack it you know and
make it relevant for 2014 or there are
things you already had in mind was you
think it was already relevant no I mean
I like um I like a bit of meat on my
bone and and I think you know the great
thing about good science fiction and
fantasy is that they can work on two
levels like you can have on one level
it's just a fun piece of entertainment
and you know you come to see monsters
writing or whatever it is and you you
it's great but then I like another level
that if you want to look for it or you
know it's there subconsciously is that
there's some meaning behind it and
it has a point in a way and and I think
all all good stories they shouldn't
preach or anything but they should be
they should have you know they sort of
should have a point you know or be about
something and in there's many ways we
could have gone like in a million
directions and and we have various
aspects in our film and I think you know
man versus nature is the predominant
theme in the movie and and there's
obviously a nuclear theme within there
an idea that being that you know
probably most powerful thing that we've
discovered in terms of nature is the
nuclear age is that you know the power
of splitting the atom or whatever and
that was always at the heart of the
original in and so something that came
for free with with the Godzilla movie
was like you know we've spent the last
few decades go in you know with this
amazing like abuse of nature really this
this this Pandora's box that we've
opened with the nuclear power and and
it's like yeah we can have weapons and
you can't have weapons you're not
allowed to do that and and these
countries can have nuclear power and
news countries can't and then what what
naturally comes from Godzilla is well
what if there were giant creatures that
were attracted to radiation suddenly
like everything would be flipped and you
want to be getting rid of this stuff and
and so that was for me that was really
interesting and a good basis for our
film and it's all like subtext but but I
I really like when films like this have
a bit more weight to them and I think
that's the ones that stand the test of
time that you watch again that they're
still on your DVD shelf that they still
show 60 years later at festivals like
this are ones that are about something
and so it was really important to me in
everyone who worked on the film that
there that we find that layer that will
make it mean something
yeah well that like that notion of like
resonance and genres so good at dealing
with that and sometimes the opportunity
just gets thrown away
you know which is um which is a shame
because I can it can be such a good
allegory and you know function to get
people thinking about about different
topics I was wondering about the the
continuity of the universe like where
does this film fit into you know the
kind of the other films is that part of
it do those forms exist in this movies
universe how does it has all the pieces
fit together the Godzilla movies don't
exist in our universe but monster movies
exist there's there's I mean I can
probably say it's no big deal
is the a main character is a child's you
see his bedroom at one point and in the
bedroom is a Japanese monster movie
poster and so they obviously exist
you know I mean that's something that is
happening there but it but we didn't
want to make Godzilla part of popular
culture in that in that world we wanted
this was kind of like the origin story
this is kind of like where the world
finds out about these things and so so
yeah the Toho movies were not probably
don't exist obviously in that in the
world that we created but but I like to
think after the events in this film
there will be lots of monster movies
being created in in you know about
Godzilla in in the world that we've set
up does that mean you already have ideas
in mind for sequels should it go over as
well as the the preview did last night
last night I don't know I mean I you
know I it's I would you know obviously
you make a film because you want people
to like it and you want everyone you
know go see it and and I don't know how
people are gonna respond to it hopefully
they will like it but I feel like we've
setup like we've done the hard work of
setting up this thing and now like
there's so much fun to be had like
there's I get excited about what you
could do you know after this but I don't
wanna I want to wait and see what people
make of it really and then see how
everyone responds yeah because it's up
to everyone else if we get to do another
one
well I can't wait to go and see the
movies comes out May 16th I believe is
the date yeah
so great um great meeting you and thanks
my chicken the time Dara thank you thank
you very much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
