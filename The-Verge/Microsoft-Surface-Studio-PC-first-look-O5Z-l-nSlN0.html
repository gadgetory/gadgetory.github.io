I'm here in New York City check it out
mic sauce new surface studio and we were
kind of expecting myself to do an
all-in-one PC and that's kind of what
they've done but it's a little bit more
than just a normal regular PC and they
start with the basics there and 28 inch
display on the front of here and
Michael's picked an interesting aspect
ratios free by twos pretty much the same
as the surface book and the surface pro
4 and they've done that because
basically they want it to be true to
life so if you're working in digital
documents on it you'll see the actual a
full-size and what it's going to print
like and in terms of the actual hardware
is super thin and I think it's about 13
Milkin is like literally super
paper-thin and in terms of the actual
hardware and a lot of I think a lot of
the components are actually in the base
here and there's an NVIDIA GPU got the
980m I think there's an option to also
have the 965 m as well and it's 32 gig
of memory a quad core intel core i5 or
i7 and so pretty much what you'd expect
from all-in-one PC but what really makes
the surface studio shine is this new
surface style it's a new accessory works
with the surface book and a service pro
4 but it really works the best on the
surface shader I'll show you how that
works for right now so combined with the
surface studio and the displays a new
hinge that allows you to basically push
it almost flat to the desk it's a
specific angle so it's obviously more
comfortable to write and draw so it gets
really interesting is to place this in
the schedule app where you'll see as you
get a relevant menu to wherever you're
doing so at the moment I'm inking and I
can dial it around
you'll change the colors and flow them
in just as I'm inking regular here you
can do also other stuff so I can go into
the pen options here since if ever I can
change the diameter so it's really
interesting how this third accessory
complements the pen the mouse and the
keyboard and touch input and kind of
just sits there as you a little sort of
like buddy in the corner being able to
change Advanced Options what's your
what's your drawing yeah this is
literally a PC that's clearly designed
for creatives Michael's really going for
that Potts part of the market with with
its surface devices in general but this
is like a big play for 3d creativity and
that kind of thing and it's supposed to
start shipping around November sort
December time in limited Caucasus most
of charging nearly $3,000 for this
particular device needs to be more
coming next year and but yeah this is
the surface studio it's the first quick
look at Microsoft's new creativity
device and if you like this video you
