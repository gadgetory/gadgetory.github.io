this is Rin speeds oasis concept vehicle
they built a car in partnership with
Harman and a number of other technology
providers this is about as funky as
concept cars get it's a cute little
brick of a car with garden in the dash
augmented reality windshields autonomous
electric used for ride-sharing a very
social vehicle this is probably never
going to actually hit the road at all
but it's a lot of fun to look at and to
experience from inside and out as you
can see there's a lot of white leather
interior cameras everywhere Harman built
this display on the front that can
showcase both the the controls and the
speed and the battery power as well as a
beautiful display of mountains or a
stream if you want to see it that way
Rinspeed Oasis has gesture control it's
a not a perfect system but it works
pretty well to swipe through the menu if
you want to load up some content you can
do that you can check out some
Steppenwolf ac/dc
so it's a self-driving car so you won't
necessarily have to be paying attention
while you're driving but it does have
cameras all on the dash here tracking
your eye movement so it knows if you
have stopped paying attention and aren't
watching the road necessarily then a
prompt will come up on the augmented
reality windshield to tell you to watch
the road there's a lot of features in
here there's a lot of bells and whistles
it's a lot of fun but this is not a car
that's ever really going to be out on
the roads like me this is more of a
platform it's an idea about moving
forward and inspiring automakers and
technology companies to see what they
can envision inside the car transform
the interior of the car into a third
space a place where aside from your
office in your home where you would want
to spend the majority of your time and
that's why there's all these creature
comforts like lights cameras and music
and video and is the surround sound it
would be a ride-sharing car it could be
an uber car it could be you know your
commute home it could be a place just to
just sort of relax and to forget about
the outside world it's a really bizarre
out-there thing but don't expect to see
it on the road anytime soon
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
