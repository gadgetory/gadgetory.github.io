overview of the drone market and the
industry has changed by leaps and bounds
the drones we played with last year were
amazing they could do things like take
off and land on their own and they could
return to home but what makes this
year's drone so amazing is that they
have so much more in terms of
intelligence hell you don't have to fly
them half the time anymore you can set
them to follow mode or 360-degree orbit
it's a flying camera right so
fundamentally what you want to do is get
it in the air and then you let it worry
about capturing the perfect shot last
year we spent a lot of time struggling
with assembly there were rotors that we
couldn't attach and batteries that have
loose wires this year all the best
drones have really tightened up that
process the batteries snap into place
easily and the rotors are self
tightening that means it's no longer
about struggling when you get it out of
the box but how it flies in the air the
DJI phantom is still our favorite drone
out of the box it's the one you can rely
on to capture great footage which means
a lot when you have a 20-minute battery
but some of the other drones we tested
are bringing more innovative features to
the market 3d robotic solo for example
has built smart features like an
orbiting cable cam right into the remote
making incredibly easy to capture
advanced maneuvers that otherwise you'd
have to be a great pilot to do another
nice feature we saw this year was a
remote with a built-in screen that means
you don't have to attach your phone or
your tablet and you're not burning
battery on that device while you're out
flying all the units we tested this year
except for 3d robotics solo have an
integrated camera and one of the great
things about that is you can adjust the
camera settings on the fly from the
remote or the app what that means is if
you're outside and changing weather with
shifting lighting conditions you can
ensure you grab that perfect shot the
DJI phantom was still my favorite it's
the most reliable the easiest to fly and
capture the best footage the digi eye
has a number of other interesting
features it has both GPS the American
system and GLONASS the Russian satellite
system that meant that it found more
satellites faster and in general was
more stable in the air the phantom also
comes with a downward facing camera
which means if you're flying inside
without a satellite signal it can find
and hold its position the phantom offers
the ability to livestream to YouTube and
while it's not perfect yet it's really
promising I also found that the phantom
was the one that was pushing the most
consistent software upgrades out of the
box that couldn't do things like follow
me or orbit mode but DJI pushed that and
now those features work the Phantom is
also the only
all that comes in a wide range of prices
you could get it for 700 bucks with a
decent camera or 1250 with the full 4k
the runner-up was probably the solo from
3d robotics it's built some of the smart
features like an orbit and cable camp
right into the remote which makes it
super easy to get shots that I couldn't
do as a pilot the big problem was that
the gimbal and the camera which is a
GoPro were never as reliable I had
problems with shaking and weird shadows
and the colors look washed out the
typhoon from uniq is a great drone and
it has a feature that I love which is
that the screen is built right into the
remote often when I'm out flying I have
to use my phone which means I'm burning
the battery on my principal device just
because I'm up in the air typhoon has a
great camera beautiful bold colors and
crisp picture the problem is that the
digital stabilization adds a weird jelly
shape to the image the chroma is
basically the same drone is the typhoon
with a few small modifications it has
the same great remote with the screen
built-in unfortunately it was nowhere
near as reliable and crashed a number of
times before I could even get it in the
air the para P Bob comes at a great
price and a small form factor which is
easy to fit in a backpack unfortunately
it's not reliable enough to put in the
air we crashed two units during our
previous testing which is why you don't
see one pictured here today the big
difference was that the DJI phantom was
the most reliable when it came to how it
flew and the quality of the footage it
could capture at the end of the day
that's the decider a number of the
drones we flew this year were easy
enough that my two-year-old son and my
65 year old father could both fly them
but in general drones still don't feel
safe for cheap enough to be accessible
to lots of consumers now that could
change chip makers like Qualcomm are
telling us that by this time next year
4k drones could be as cheap as $300 with
batteries that last an hour if that
happens I believe they will be the next
camcorder totally ubiquitous at weddings
and beach vacations something you see
all the time and in every family
