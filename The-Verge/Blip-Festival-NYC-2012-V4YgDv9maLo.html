years ago and before that I was running
a non-profit performing art space here
in New York called the tank and at the
tank I was booking in all sorts of
different electronic music and some of
the guys who started coming around with
people that were involved with chip
music which I'd never heard of before I
started booking it as that sort of
picked up steam and got bigger and
bigger we hit a point where it made
sense to sort of do sort of one big
annual thing where we could bring this
whole community together and now was the
first blip festival back in two thousand
six the festival has evolved a lot I
mean just technically every year it's
gotten bigger and better I think every
time you do it it just just kick it up a
notch I wanted to make chiptune before I
knew what chiptune was there are a few
different ways that people come into the
chips and I think there are people who
enter in as you know I grew up going
video games and I love this nostalgic
factor there are a lot of people that
come in from an electronic music
perspective I think chiptune and video
games are two separate worlds and it's
interesting to see where they intersect
I think for a lot of people video games
is a very like strong entry point to a
chiptune but I think that they'll be
surprised that where they wind up
obviously they're using retro hardware
right this is stuff that a lot of us
grew up you know I grew up with playing
on a gameboy or playing with an Atari
and but what's interesting is that a lot
of the people that are on the scene
right now didn't write in your hit a
point where there are people who are you
know 18 19 20 years old who are doing
this stuff that never grew up with this
stuff they grew up at a time when this
was like already the sort of the ancient
past nostalgia definitely plays a part
in chip music but to me it's so much
more fun when I have a fan who's 16
years old and like loves the game boy
sound that never played an NES game or
has never played a game boy game and
nostalgia is no part of that and to me
what that says is this sound palette is
robust enough and cool enough and has
enough character on its own to really
stand
by itself and it's not just nostalgia
driving if there's a legitimacy to it
a very important part of the blip
festival is showing that it's not just
chiptune music it's a lot of different
things coming from a lot of different
people lista that we're doing is
informed by chiptune and it's an element
of what we're doing but is not like the
entire picture we're just trying to
recontextualize what it is
these sounds are kind of like becoming
popular in pop music like you literally
hear on like pop radio samples of these
sorts of things I personally would like
it to stay my own little niche seen
forever but I think it will it will grow
I think the inclusion of chip music in
mainstream music is actually a really
good thing I just went on tour I played
a bunch of shows i was an opening act
and most of the people who were watching
me had never heard chip music or maybe
they've only heard like a song or two
and there's so many different genres
that people are making within the chip
music scene that you know there's
something really for everyone six years
ago I had no idea what chiptune was I
think most people didn't know and now I
can have a conversation with someone who
I met on the street who actually knows
what your team is I've seen a lot of
other electronic music genres and
there's lots of amazing people in all of
them but this scene is is particularly
embracing and open and supported and I
think that's what's helped the community
grow because people who show up as an
audience member one day or you know a
year later they're playing and they're
like oh an active part of the scene this
is actually my first year performing a
blip festival but last year I attended
as a fan and I actually walked away
extremely inspired they have such a wide
variety of artists that they get here
and it shows how diverse and expansive
that music scene is</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
