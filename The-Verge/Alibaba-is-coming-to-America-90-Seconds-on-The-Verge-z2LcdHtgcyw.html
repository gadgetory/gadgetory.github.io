its us IPO Alibaba Alibaba Alibaba
Alibaba Alibaba says Open Sesame to Wall
Street wait pause what is Ali Baba I'm
Nathan siker tanned this is 90 seconds
on the verge Ali Baba's a Chinese
e-commerce company founded by Jack Ma
former English teacher who's akin to
Steve Jobs or Jeff Bezos in China
Alibaba is made up of several sites but
the two biggest art al bow and tmall
Taliban is Ali Baba's ebay allowing
small businesses to sell products online
but taobao doesn't take a cut of the
proceeds instead it makes money through
advertisements tmall is much closer to
Amazon where large companies like
Samsung and gap can create online stores
for an Asian market last year sales on
taobao and tmall totaled over two
hundred and forty eight billion dollars
alibaba's biggest challenge is going to
be trust the company has been criticized
in the past for promoting counterfeit
and defective goods something had
explicitly acknowledged in its IPO
filing but if Ali Baba can earn that
trust it could prove to be a serious
threat to Amazon which thrives on
undercutting its competitors that isn't
slowing alibaba's growth internationally
the company already does business in
Russia and Brazil and is working on an
American marketplace it's calling 11
main for Amazon which thrives on
undercutting its competitors Alibaba
could prove to be a serious threat what
happens when hordes of Chinese
manufacturers can sell directly to its
consumers for more on alibaba check out
the verge coming up I start my own
international ice cream business but I'm
a little low on money so it's gonna have
to be ground shipping</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
