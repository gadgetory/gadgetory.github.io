we downloaded Word Excel and PowerPoint
from the App Store and this is what they
look like Microsoft Office has long been
the productivity suite juggernaut on the
desktop and now it's trying to claim
some new territory the iPad since office
is also on the iPhone and the web Apple
users will now have an easy way to sync
and work on office documents across all
of their devices Microsoft does a good
job of translating the apps for a tablet
too they look clean and stylish right at
home on an iPad but still distinctly
part of Microsoft's family each app is a
really similar interface to so it's easy
to pick each of them up and move between
them on their editing screens there's a
brightly colored toolbar at the top and
then plenty of room for your document
below the dual bars each have a few
different tabs you can switch between
letting you view basic editing tools
layout options review functions and
another feature specific to the app
everything is nice and big for the touch
screen to all of your documents are set
by default to automatically save to the
cloud though you'll of course be using
Microsoft onedrive and onedrive only the
good news is that sync worked once you
close out of a document on the iPad
it'll be updated and ready the next time
you open it on the desktop or where
anywhere else just make sure you have an
internet connection otherwise you'll be
out of luck each of the apps is really
polished and sleek where it does a great
job of letting text images and shapes
mix together on a page Excel is a custom
keyboard for punching numbers unless you
build formulas just by tapping on cells
and PowerPoint still has more
transitions than you could ever ask for
I'm not sure if you'll find every single
one of their desktop counterparts
options in here but I was definitely
able to find all the ones that I wanted
so the apps are good but there's one
potential deal-breaker and it's a big
one
when you down the apps are free you can
only view them if you want to create and
edit anything you'll have to pay for the
home edition that's nearly $100 per year
that's a steep price to pay considering
that Apple offers its own productivity
suite for free however all these apps
are looking good even though these are
just our first impressions you can
download all three in the App Store
right now
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
