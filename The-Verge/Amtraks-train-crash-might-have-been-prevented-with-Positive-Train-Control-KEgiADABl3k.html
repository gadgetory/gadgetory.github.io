Safety Board released the speed records
of the Amtrak train that derailed in
Philadelphia the data showed that the
train was speeding along a track her
about 100 miles an hour twice the zone
speed limit similar accidents like this
have happened before in 2013 a
metro-north train derailed after going
almost three times the speed limit
killing four and injuring 61 people and
every time accidents like these occur
the same three words come up positive
train control positive train control or
PTC is a technology that's been around
for years and it's very effective at
making train travel safer it uses a
combination of radios and GPS signals to
coordinate trains and act as a failsafe
for their operators holding safe speeds
on curves and other slow sections all
the while maintaining a safe distance
between trains the system started
gaining traction in 2008 after a
metrolink commuter train crashed into a
fright car due to human error the NTSB
investigation concluded that the PTC
system would have prevented the crash
and a month later the u.s. rail Safety
Improvement Act was signed mandating
that the positive train control system
be fully implemented in all passenger
trains by the end of 2015 unfortunately
major forces in the locomotive industry
have deemed 2015 as an unrealistic date
in a 2014 report the Association of
American railroads decided that a 2015
deadline would be impossible for them to
meet due to various technical and
non-technical challenges the PTC system
isn't cheap either and financing the
program has been hard to come by
considering recent budget cuts it's not
all bad news though seven years since
the Metrolink crash the PTC system has
been active on over 100 miles of track
in California and the federal government
has recently approved a 1 billion dollar
loan to the MTA to develop their
positive train control system along with
other improvements with Amtrak
experiencing ever increasing ridership
more lives are relying on safe train
travel than ever before the positive
train control system has the turtles but
its ability to prevent
students is undisputed the cost of safe
train travel should never include a life</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
