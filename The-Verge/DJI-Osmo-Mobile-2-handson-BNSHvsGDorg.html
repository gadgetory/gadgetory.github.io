video with the DJI Osmo - which is a
handheld gimbal that keeps your phone
steady and can do stuff like track your
face track other people's faces and let
you make the way better video with your
phone than you could if you're just
holding it with your stupid dumb and
what's amazing about this thing is it
only costs one hundred and thirty bucks
this is the original Cosmo mobile and it
was retailing for about 300 bucks the
differences between these is this is a
little bit lighter it has a longer
lasting battery which you can no longer
remove there's a few other differences
worth talking about - but to me the most
important difference is that this thing
in addition to holding your phone in
landscape mode can be rotated and you'll
be able to shoot in portrait mode and as
everybody knows portrait mode video
portrait mode selfies portrait mode
whatever is the way that most people
look at videos on their phone these days
on snapchat and Instagram and so on now
if you're familiar with gimble's a lot
of the stuff I'm about to say to you is
stuff you already know but it's worth
talking about because this thing is so
much cheaper than any other gimbal it's
130 bucks so a lot more people are gonna
pick this thing up so what this thing is
for is for stabilizing your video and
giving you like better smoother tracking
shots as you move around the world your
smartphone probably already has a bunch
of really good image stabilisation but
what it doesn't have is the ability to
just hold it up with one hand way far
out and have these smooth easy good
tracking moves okay it also probably
can't do a thing where you can track
somebody's face with it and then it will
handle the camera movements for staying
centered on their face while you can
the camera round so you can get a bunch
of shots that you wouldn't be able to
get on your own with just a phone it's
pretty cool now the thing you should
know about the current demo that I'm
doing right here is right now I'm using
beta software and it gets a little buggy
sometimes because this thing can shoot
in portrait mode and because it can also
handle larger phones you need to spend a
little bit more time than you might be
used to adjusting it there's a few
adjustments that you can make the first
is on the clamp which is just sort of a
you know spring grip here which isn't
great there's also another knob over
here so that you can move it in and out
and the reason that that matters is
you're gonna be doing a lot more of it
because when you switch from portrait
mode to landscape and vice versa you're
gonna need to recalibrate this thing
every time to make sure that it stays
balanced now I would say that's a big
knock on this thing but the last one
couldn't even do portrait mode so it's
not that big of a deal
so as I've been saying over and over
again this thing the DJI Osmo 2 is only
129 bucks it's available for pre-order
now and if you're really looking to up
your video game with your phone it's
almost an impulse purchase I think a lot
of people are gonna be picking this
thing up
