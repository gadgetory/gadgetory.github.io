on the verge brought to you by samsung
i'm your host Josh Topolsky and you're a
dude named Ralph which I'm personally
excited about we have an incredible show
an amazing show tonight may be our best
ever director Paul Feig is here in the
studio with us in a little bit to talk
about film and so much more i sat down
with Lance Reddick from the wire and
fringe and most recently White House
down and we're going to discuss all
sorts of exciting things and there's a
heat wave in New York right now and it's
very uncomfortable so clearly a lot to
talk about let's get to the news get
excited get very excited the official
trailer for the film jobs has finally
been released if you don't know what the
movie is I don't know why you're even
watching this it's ashton kutcher in the
role of Steve Jobs covering the birth of
Apple up until the release of the
original ipod so none of the iphone
stuff but you know no big deal for what
i can tell it's going to be an
incredible film and it's going to
feature a rebellious barefoot and
frankly sexy Steve Jobs who has the
voice of Kelso here take a look
these are state-of-the-art nobody's
making anything like this welcome the
helpful computer this is everything
startup I think we should start with
around 90 grand could you repeat that if
you'll have me bored boom right there
that's what it all happens I have to say
it does really look good and I do want
to see it but I can't help but feel I've
seen this somewhere before you don't
just live in life you changing shape it
you make your mark upon us Steve Jobs
dumb for the navicomputer what on earth
would ordinary people talk with
computers kind of venture money we
talking about my well I figure we start
with about a quarter million dollars you
see what I was excuse me that's the
first time that people are coming to me
send me going to them we have to think
of ourselves as artists just like the
tussle said good artists copy great
artists steal
I asked you for brilliance I've asked
you for genius when you give him this
you guys are not being paid to be a
bunch of clowns you guys are supposed to
be writing toe friends ladies and
gentlemen a toast to a remarkable man
Steve Jobs a truly a guiding light a man
who sees the future
filling their words the way I could see
that right now but I'll just have to
wait okay on a more serious note on a
very newsy important note I need to talk
to you about one of my favorite movies
of all time 1985's life force which has
just been released in a special limited
edition blu-ray that is jam-packed full
of extra features interviews with the
cast and crew there's a director's cut
it's thrilling if you don't know
anything about life force and you're
thinking should I go buy or rent this
movie and watch it over and over and
over again let me try to help you make
the decision the film is written by
alien scribe dan o'bannon who's a very
sick man and directed by tobe Hooper
that's the tobe Hooper who directed the
Texas Chainsaw Massacre a very sick
movie but life force is really truly
incredible on its own it's a rollicking
thriller / horror / adventure / romance
that will leave you totally breathless
and if you're not convinced let me list
just a few of the things that you'll see
in the movie after you hit play on your
remote control space vampires space bats
zombies 150 mile long phallic alien ship
a post-apocalyptic London Patrick
Stewart in his first onscreen kiss with
a man
and most importantly I think extended
scenes featuring full frontal nudity of
a beautiful woman now look I'm not
saying that you have to watch the movie
but if you don't I will hunt you down
using the body of a nude woman and then
suck your life force out through your
mouth all right enough about me I had a
chance to sit down with Lance Reddick as
i told you from the wire and fringe and
most recently a major Hollywood white
house explosion movie called white house
down and here's a clip from that and my
conversation with Lance sir we're at
DEFCON 1 nuclear football on the white
house just went live that's impossible
it's happening and someone has just
entered valid launch codes captain oh
damn hell is going on sir we have
nuclear missiles spinning up on the
Albuquerque if our lics launching a
full-scale nuclear strike they will
respond rush will launch China will
launch will have World War 3 in the next
10 minutes let you level the White House
four minutes to target sir sir I need a
final go/no-go for payload delivery
plans thanks so much for being here my
flesh really appreciate it we turned up
the heat in the building for you I could
tell ya it's very warm and I apologize
the good thing is that when black people
get shinya looks good so you know just
keep it up i wish i were black I mean
I'm just cuz im just gonna sweat and
look like crap well we really look
amazing but see that's what fancy that's
how you know god works in mysterious
ways because white people look good dry
so it's just I do look I do look amazing
dry that is a well-known fact what are
we talking I like this interview already
this is good so uh I want to talk a
little bit about your earlier career I
know you've got new stuff that we're
going to talk about but um maybe you
hate bringing this up maybe I you don't
want me to talk about this but I want
talk about the wire a little bit okay
there's a very rabid fan base for the
wire a lot of people say it's the
greatest show greatest drama I ever put
on television so that must be cool to be
part of that but but that character your
character in the show is a character
that seems to be people seem to like you
in this character which is sort of kind
of an asshole like a little bit of an
asshole but just get done it's
funny because I think it boils
we're going to Aston at least at least
four seasons pray that's animation is
similar in a similar vein Paul Giamatti
and our buddies from drama school and we
were shooting the first season of friend
she and I were having lunch and he was
talking about yet the first season of
fringe is really was the very end was
when the last season the wire aired and
that's when he really kind of blew up
right and we're shooting in New York and
it was the first time in my career that
I just like I just couldn't get down the
street without being stopped and I was
talking to Paul about it and he said man
is something about TV too because I
didn't you know cuz Paul's a movie star
but he said it wasn't until I did John
Adams that I started getting that and
it's something something about coming
into people's living rooms you know in a
consistent basis and it's not just that
they see you often but they see you as
that person I mean I remember we're
shooting the first season of fringe and
the makeup artist ahead make a person
told me the story she said that a couple
of cops were doing security we were
shooting in New York they were doing
security and they think they came to her
in decent man that guy's a badass and
she looked around she said lions and
well that's the character yeah yeah the
characters about you you think they
think I'm playing badasses do you why
not do not think of yourself as a bad
news you mean in real life well I don't
know I mean you get cast as a badass yes
my kids they'll say though really yeah I
mean yeah it's funny cuz like I always
think you know when you see somebody
who's played you know it's kind of a
gruff character yeah I mean I I said an
asshole but it's which is kind of
insulting I now realize but but it is a
character who's kind of like you could
see how that's the character who kind of
gets in some ways can get under people's
skin on the show in a way that is very
forceful and and it's a very specific
role you know it's kind of gruff but
then ends up being a good like a really
good guy and I feel like that must be
something that people see in you
naturally because it's so you're so
often in such a similar kind of role
well but once again the funny thing
about it is it wasn't until the wire I
mean
you remember i audition for three
different roles for the water and that
was the last they didn't want to see me
for Daniel's at first I yeah I just
refer bunk three times that's so insane
because to imagine it as anybody else
seems impossible yeah I dish of a bunk
three times and the third time I went in
they wanted to see me for bubbles really
yeah because uh on my third audition
David Simon was there and he had cast me
as Marvin in in in the corner who's it
was crackhead so he knew me as a
crackhead and I just played great
crackhead and in Oz you know I played in
undercover cop but a guy who gets
addicted to heroin right boylar yes
spoilers in case you're watching oz oh
well you know what that shows it's been
several it's like a decade i think
there's got to be a statue of limitation
to fix oh that's interesting so it's
crazy though because i show you so
perfectly embody that character i mean i
think it's a job playing Broyles after
that kind of that's what it was like
okay I may be in danger of becoming tap
cash yeah I don't think it's typecasting
I mean I think that it's it's a I think
it's a role it's hard to play I mean in
my opinion it's kind of because you kind
of have to like it's almost like in some
ways you think that guy's kind of a jerk
but then you sort of love them and I
think that's a fine line to walk am I in
mine you know Lynn I did feel that I had
to get a really get into the guy's head
because it wasn't just a matter of
saying the lines and you know acting
feelings so so obviously the wire is is
a big deal for you but then fringe comes
along was sci-fi something that that you
have an interest in naturally or was
that did you have to come around to the
concept of doing something that was
because it really is you know there is a
pretty big difference in the tone
between something like the wire we're
like it's like really gritty really real
and then infringes obviously feels with
its almost straight forward action
adventure yes right exactly was that was
that something was with sci-fi something
that you you you love to start with or
was it did you have to come around to it
I mean I will say I'm a huge Star Wars
and Star Trek fan yeah particularly I
mean I have all seven seasons of Star
Trek Voyager yeah very interested yeah
really and Captain Kirk well I mean will
William Shatner's portrayal of Captain
Kirk was one of my um like I growing up
I just always wanted to be him yeah I
mean I remember when I
I'm over a moding that's like one of
those Shatner's very throws himself into
the emotion well I mean in all Disney
Chatteris this is blowing my chances of
a shattering well its engine because I
feel that um if you watch his work in
the first season there's really a lot of
subtle teen nuanced I mean it's piece up
he's mesmerizing to watch right and I
just think that quite frankly as iconic
as that original series has become once
you got to the second or third seasons
um it really kind of a lot of the
writing became more and more ridiculous
yeah I show his character that have
played that yeah and when you you know
when you're kind of being the guy mostly
who carries the show and you don't I me
right I just think he kind of fell into
some habits that he became more like
Kirk right in he almost became like a
parody of himself right but right yeah
but no I guess that's true guinea I just
feel like he was really you know me I'm
yeah I think there is more subtlety in
general in the first season of that show
yeah and and yeah it's weird to see how
it did become it well I mean look once
you establish the character and this in
the place then it's sort of easy to play
inside of that but it also gives you
more rigidity to the to what you can do
yeah and also your it's the kind of
thing where and once again i don't i
don't want to spend too much time trying
to defend my shadows reforms not really
really are a shatner defender you well
known it's it's I'm just thinking about
the difference in SE the wire for
example um you know I remember I can't
say what sure was but I went I had a
meeting at the end of the last season of
the wire I started going on auditions
for new pilots and I wanted this pilot
audition in one of the creators of the
show was a big fan of my work and he had
he had been a showrunner on HBO show and
now this is a network series he said you
know the difference between Sean HBO and
a show network is on HBO they hire you
to do your show a network they hire you
to do this
uh and I know and you know from the
things that I've read about the original
Star Trek it was as groundbreaking as it
was it was a constant fight to keep it
just from being a Western in our space
right so you've got a new thing a new
very new project that everybody's very
excited about White House buddy oh yeah
what else does you know like how is it
because there is there's others other
thing to talk about white house down
explain white house down to me tell me
what this movie is about I mean I think
I know it's about but I want to hear
from you well it's basically about
terrorists attacking and almost it's
successfully taking over the White House
they're just so crazy to hear it out
loud yeah terror is taking over the
White House yeah and and it's about kind
of the Channing Tatum is the hero and we
can say to heroes and Jamie Foxx pizza
present and it almost cost yeah yeah the
bat it just baddest-ass president ever
and you're in your character is I play
the Vice chamber the Joint Chiefs of
Staff okay so you're a military dude yes
and I'm basically the guy in the
military who is in charge of the
military right and you've got the horse
some reason it's given but it's a little
shaky but for some reason the chairman
of the joint chiefs of staff is not
around so I know guys Eisenhower Falls
to you yeah he's like on vacation
something like that listen I know you
got to go thank you so much for doing
this we might appreciate it yes Lance
Lance is an awesome dude and also really
really good at staring next up we've got

the new film directed by paul feig and

catbird seat why I don't appreciate that
Paul yes sir you're a man of many
talents director yes sometimes I
producer actor occasionally a creator of
beloved television shows and other
exactly author yes true that I said yeah
I know my publisher would rival but to
me the most interesting thing about when
I was reading about you and I did
several weeks
reading before I'm sorry the most
interesting thing is that you were on
you acted in the first season of sabrina
the teenage witch certainly did you tell
me about your character I was the
biology teacher mr. Poole and they asked
me what would you like your first name
to be and because i'm a comedy genius i
said gene so I was dr. gene pool they
actually went so they went for it see
what your what your resist this is a
1997 so tell me about that experience I
mean first off were you was this a dream
of yours had you been thinking yes I
want to get on the sabrina the teenage
witch is not was originally a film right
it knows I comics was a common era comic
book okay okay a graphic novel the right
kids call it these I don't think it was
another guy reading graphic novels like
it would be a compilation or what
storyline that's right I'm just a
graphite no but you and that's the kind
of jokes see the heat yeah but how did
that happen and can you tell me a little
about your experience I mean in a
skirmish orange a shoulder sure it was
not kind of a Jojo was it you know it's
you know I was an actor I'd been on I've
been a regular in like four other TV
series that all got cancelled in there
in their first season Dirty Dancing the
TV series no that didn't exist it did
you were in you were in it yes you play
this way Z character and this of course
I can i play baby ya know I was ever
you're not old enough to remember this
but do you go well I don't know because
you're a youthful looking man thank you
that's not totally uncalled do you are
but no they need to be like would they
would make like the the Partridge Family
cartoon in the Brady Bunch cartoon and
they'd always add like a dancing panda
or like a singing bird and that was me
on the show because I was a character
that was not in the movie I was you were
enormous yes I was I should have been a
bird I was Norman the comedian bellhop
did you have to dance in it they tried
to get me to dance but I refused was he
refused to dance on the show no no there
was a scene like there's it like it was
Patrick Swayze padding out of the
Patrick so he was um Patrick Cassidy
failures at Patrick Stewart knows
Patrick Cassidy plated number laura hart
enjoy the end
moment years later I directing on the
office as because she was Michaels a
girlfriend one time yeah but they were
doing a sexy dance and I they had a
reaction shot of me in the doorway and
the directors like pretend like you're
into that you're kind of dancing with
them and getting turned on I was like
I'm not gonna get yeah I like getting
turned on ya know it was out to be like
oh you're not just dancing you not just
into the groove you're actually sexually
around one either I'm dancing dirtily
right tell me you've done all this stuff
your preferences or one thing that you
love more than all the others oh dude to
do in terms of like acting direct I like
you're producing you like to record that
I gotta push people around can you see
yourself just being a director just in
forever until you yeah so you dealt oh
yeah I mean I was right and I get them
very involved in the writing and some
things I actually write myself and other
things are you hire your having these
amazing writers i work with rye i like
it it's is an actor i was very limited
let's just say i only get some of these
skills then the director is really the
boss yeah you're in movie making depth
oh right you are the main story teller
and TV you're sort of the facilitator of
the writers write these great scripts
and you can make it better but you also
when they say like no I wanted this way
then you go okay that's fine is there
any person when you're a director that
you can't tell what to do uh decides
like the pricing the producers web in
the studio when oh yeah I mean here you
are as a movie director York
occasionally fighting everybody I was
looking out not the last two ones i did
that everybody was pretty cool but um no
I fought some Pyrrhic victories in my
time ya Yin just didn't know you win and
you're like well nobody hates me yeah it
was all worth it to get him in a red
shirt so so director would be your
preference yes you'd like to die
directing yes but not anytime anything
the scene ends and they look back
there's a skeleton hanging on yes
sitting in the director's chair I'm run
over by a crane and they go he wouldn't
want to go that's how that's yeah I
never I say he would have wanted to go
that way i don't think i would have
wanted to go whatever way they think i
would have why we gonna go just quietly
in my bed asleep yes not like in the
like dick Shawn remember the comedian
dick Shawn go oh I'm so long dick shots
that's like a made-up person enough I
it's a man that will the beginning of a
joke man yes right you know dick Shawn
at the track but he died on stage
performing and he was a funny guy near
one-man show and so he did the money
collapse on stage and people were
laughing for a minute Redd Foxx this is
what with red fog no didn't really I
think he had a he no-hit cuz his thing
was I'm going oh another big 10 and then
ed I think he actually this could be an
okanagan i'm aight be propagating an
urban legend if you die eating pop rocks
no he had a pop rocks and soda and then
that he was doing his bit right and they
died in Vietnam that's right you created
the show Freaks and Geeks wildly popular
well now now you think let me finish
okay wildly popular now not popular in
its in its time TB has really changed
though since freaks and geeks yeah was
on the air and obviously people love it
obvious i mean i think a lot of people
consider to be one of the best shows
ever put on television it's nice
somebody know it's the fact accepting do
you think it would if do you think that
show would have had a different story in
this day and age if it were on if NBC
had that show today I don't think it
would have because now the business
model is kind of if you get an entire
season then you know people will binge
watch it right whether when they might
not necessarily watch the first season
so I think we were so critically
acclaimed at the bet we would have at
least got another half season do it
given the dvds kind of changed yes yeah
but you have done a lot of TV you've
done a lot of directing yeah on TV
besides you're you're very deep acting
career which goes back several hundred
shows it certainly does I heard failed
and weird shows but you've directed a
ton of television yeah you did an
episode 30 rock more than one yet no
just 1 30 rock what happened there they
didn't want you back oh you know Alec go
Alec Baldwin's at all yes and yes
exactly no it was fun a great on you he
leave nasty I believe the quote was uh
you gotta knock it off with this
Truffaut man really yeah it's did
he say that's a de but he was so you
have a real laeta maneuver real be for
that we might even know I certainly do
this is real no I certainly do that i
love the man because he will take action
on a good to trust me i know i don't
know but sure that is
hello sure I've had action taken on your
beef oh oh god those jokes okay so do
you do you have interest and creating
new TV shows I mean I mean you seems
like there would be some fertile ground
there oh yeah and now that people agree
that that unions freaks and geeks was
excellent I mean TV isn't the greatest
place that has ever been I think I think
we were honestly in a more of a golden
age and it was back when they called it
a golden age and just think of all the
shows but it's also because of they are
open to the serialization of
storytelling right which i think is a
better it's a way to tell a story so now
I episodic shows annoying yeah you know
and they're just not out there not as
exciting to work on because you're just
like reinventing the wheel every day you
have the same cast a chimeric Monster of
the Week yeah exactement yes well as the
x-files monster-of-the-week I don't
drive my very annoying cuz i just want
to see the x-files story unfold oh yeah
are you working on anything new for
television would you be interested if
we're developing a few things they are
oh you talk about them here of course
not can you just tell their agent no i
will say there you will oh there is one
with a sci-fi been to it i like sci-fi
Carly and I don't feel there's been
enough sci-fi comedy you're on Twitter
yes I am now that's gonna go a hard
pivot all right with ya I thought of it
you're on Twitter yes uh you have 1.3
million followers it's like first up how
did you get 1.3 million followers how
does that happen I got in early I'll
tell me give me a pen I will tell you
exactly I happen but it can't happen
again I'm afraid because I came in early
on it and rain will I was working on the
office Rainn Wilson said hey if you're
gone twitter I'll tell my followers so
immediately at 7th 00 but what happens
they put me on this thing work oh you
are suggesting users list so every day
like every week I got thousand more fire
a reviled person I know exact Witter I
have the suggester suggested users list
was a highly controversial I know move
on the part of no turn the benefit which
gave power to people like you hmm who
would probably abusing it oh no totally
so I'm ends up yeah
this true though yeah you now have
incredible power you know pretty much
anything oh yeah I can I said so do you
see Twitter I mean there are people who
use Twitter as a comedy platform you
guys like Rob Delaney for instance it's
really made a career out of Twitter as a
platform for comedy do you see it that
way do you use it that way oh yeah that
that's my favorite use for it i will
occasionally self-promote on it but i
don't like to do that I know guys even
doing a lot of heat promotion I know a
lot of you and I'm suffering for it
because you see the numbers dropping but
yeah but at the same time you know
Studios like can you put it out there
but I to me twitter is being a comedy
man yourself you always had the joe to
the notebook that you carry around and
you write like funny thoughts I have a
smart I've own app on my smartphone well
okay in the old days in it yeah do carry
notepad you have a something not anymore
no I used use your phone yeah okay yeah
i know you but but there's many years
when i had the path give you write stuff
in there then you put hurling it would
put anyway wow that's to go like i have
a funny thought to put it out that's why
do I actually right I have I do tend to
write down I'm gonna get I shouldn't say
this because it's a great idea but I'm
gonna tell you an idea i wrote down i'll
just say what the idea is not gonna
explain it Jewish terminator that's it
and you could just admit you just you
just figure out chose date it's not not
violent okay and I violate I guess I
should to expand on that a little bit
you know the Terminator has a heads-up
display yes where he's evaluating what's
going on interprets it in a more of a
deuteron illuminator is Jewish yeah
that's it let's move on wow so so were
you when you were in I mean obviously
freaks and geeks with base after going
back to prefigure man oh I'm so good I
heat stress and everything there's two
of you rises rap let's just round me
about it oh I my pants sorry
forgot to tell you here too yeah I know
I knew it we have that one thing that
happens uh but but but well this is sort
of related to the twitter stuff and sort
of the rise of nerd culture yes i mean i
think in some ways freaks and geeks is
now it now makes more sense because
people better understand nerd culture
and sort of geek culture which is really
risen to be the dominant force in
popular culture yeah when you look at
the movies that are number one movies
right it's it's Superman and and the
Avengers and just real star trek just
incredibly nerdy stuff yeah that even
ten years ago was was still sort of
breaking through no I mean I credit the
internet for all this stuff back when I
was a kid and you know we got all our my
geeky friends you always felt like am I
are we the only weirdos out there that
like this stuff and you had no community
the minute you have an internet you have
this community that empowers you like
the weirdest stuff you're into yeah
there's a bunch of people just suddenly
like it seems not only not that weird
but kind of popular oh don't know then
you're cool it wasn't got this cool all
of my weird sex stuff oh yeah I thought
I was the only what yeah who knew you
got you guys a people huge gas mentality
like oh oh that's right oh you're your
cop brother how are you but I'd a look
down here by the couch give me a baggie
and a nice looking
there were lonely days I uh that is good
stuff but I do want to talk a little bit
about because you do have a film that
you're now promoting aside me you
haven't promoted it except for the
couple of times during this interview
yeah I was at once but the heat yes tell
me just give me the give me the outline
of the heat everything is about the
female a buddy cop comedy there you go
okay this movie though this has been a
big people made a big deal about your
portrayals of women in movies it's not a
traditional they're not traditional
portrayals in the sense that the female
characters are really fully fleshed out
real people yeah and frankly for
Hollywood that's unusual I know that's
so crazy is it right that's a weird
giver like can you believe the care like
these characters in brides are smart and
funny and acting like all the women we
know in real life right how dare you lay
right do that so what is it why is it
why did you crack this where's that I
mean what is it about you that that gave
you this sensitivity and insight into
the female condition I have a very item
of a very feminized man yes aiiah does
that mean I I grew up around a lot of
women my god I grow I was an only child
i grew up next to a family of eight kids
and six of them were girls and they were
all my best friends so hung with them
all the time and then I'll of bullies in
school so I drobo it was bullied of
course how could you look at me yeah but
I always would run to the girls and
going okay and I got no part of the
problem now that's the boys and I know I
understand believe me oh yes I know Tim
practice running to the girls not yeah
maybe they were fun and we laugh and I
was in drama club and all the guys so I
I just always knew women and I always
kind of liked how how funny they were
and I was like kind of making them laugh
and they made me laugh and it just this
feeling that I'm watching all these
movies their guy dominated something
like the funniest women I know are in it
they're playing just like a mean girl
friend yeah funniest yeah why doesn't
she get it be fun did you think this is
something I have to crack or did it just
happen because this is the movie that
you wanted to make it was a little bit
something I wanted to crack because I
over the Pinot Lindsay we're and freaks
and geeks is one of my favorite
characters ever you know created so I
had other projects that have like female
leads in Hollywood just going no you
can't because people won't go to see
they always had like some reason and you
go okay and then finally started going
like wait that why is that a reason it
doesn't make sense that there
the population of the world that is a
great point there are a lot of women in
the world all right okay final question
yes we have gone way longer and I've
enjoyed every minute of it thank you and
nor am I more than I expected to be
honest and you're you wear suits
constantly is that you're a very
handsome Lee dressed man thank you sir
what tip can you give someone one tip
onto they want to be a great looking guy
mmm every day of the week yes what's
your what's your advice it's not about
how expensive the suit is is about how
good the tailor is so you can buy a
cheap suit go to some guy spend a little
bit of money to get tailored because I
guys although I don't dress up cuz too
expensive not an excuse you can go to
the thrift store and you can buy a suit
and just get something to tailor it
nicely for you and then you will look
like a million bucks that is an
incredible piece of advice thank you so
much oh thanks so much really appreciate
you and that is our show I want to thank
