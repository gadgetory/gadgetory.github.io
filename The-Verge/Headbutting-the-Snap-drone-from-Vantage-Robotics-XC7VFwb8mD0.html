he calls it a flying camera drone has
this sort of militaristic connotation
and it means something that's brainless
the new gadget Hina's company Vantage
robotics of design is definitely smart
whatever you want to call it the sale of
aerial robots equipped with high
definition cameras has exploded over the
last three years but they still present
an intimidating challenge for the
average consumer
the learning curve can be steep flying
is inherently perilous and it's easy to
make a small mistake when you're
handling something with high speed
rotors snap solves that last problem
with an ingenious design borrowing from
bridge builders and bicycle wheels it
has encased the rotors on this drone in
a shield that covers everything but the
very top so obviously if I did this with
your average drone I would slice open my
face I have sliced open many a finger
but the nice thing about this design is
that you're protected from the rotors
definitely makes it a lot more
accessible kid-friendly consumer
friendly better etc another issue with
most drones is how bulky and unwieldy
they are the snap fits easily into a
small backpack it uses magnetic
connectors and a detachable fuselage to
craft a form factor that slips easily
into a small backpack even a large purse
it's incredibly light and easy to
assemble but despite that small size
managed to pack in a 3-axis gimbal which
stabilizes the camera during flight you
can pilot this now for the traditional
RC controller a Bluetooth game
controller or a mobile app that connects
through Wi-Fi in our testing the game
controller worked well and the app was
decent if a little imprecise I had a
terrible experience with the parrot
bebop which also relies on a mobile app
in Wi-Fi but didn't experience any
disconnections during my limited testing
with the snap the snap like many new
drones tries to simplify the experience
of flying by offering pre-programmed
shots that are easy to execute with just
a few taps on your screen so for a drone
II you set the distance drag in the
direction you want to fly click a button
and it executes the mission
it uses a lidar system to sense objects
around it and avoid collisions moving
away from our cameraman as you stepped
in for a close-up Vantage is launching a
pre-order campaign today and hopes to
ship its first units to customers in the
spring of 2016 the one we saw was
clearly still a prototype but that
accident actually highlighted a unique
feature of the snap it's magnetic and
modular design breaks apart an impact
dispersing the energy and keeping all
the pieces intact we pop the magnet back
in snap the unit together and we're
flying just fine a few minutes later
after spending an afternoon with the
snap I'm really excited to see the
finished product
It's Made dramatic improvements on the
portability and safety of the average
consumer drone while retaining a
stabilized camera and good battery life
advantage can iron out the kinks and
start to deliver consistent flight
performance the snap is poised to be a
very attractive new offering in the
drone sark flying camera market</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
