verge and we're looking at the surface
laptop it's not quite called the service
laptop it's the surface book and
essentially as much sauce tape on the
laptop so you've got a button on the
side here which attaches this display
and associates turns into a surface as
you know very well like a surface pro 4
and this hinge flip it in here and
they'll turn it back into into a laptop
it's like a snake things try and show
you the hinge a little bit at the side
here it's kind of like a snake into
those snakes down and you see there's a
little slight gap just it runs through
the entire surface book and that
basically turns into the laptop that
they showed on stage if you want to
actually touch it there's a button you
hold down your like that it says ready
to attach it take off from there you can
turn it around and attach a game and
then pull it back down it's sort of like
it's sort of like the Novo sort of tabby
that you see we'd better use it like
this and when it's actually docked in in
this station it feels a little bit
heavier than when it's unlocked it's
incredibly light like this and you can
use it one hand I'm holding it like this
it just feels like a really light
version of the surface pro free an
actual base of the surface but is a
paint in magnesium so kind of similar to
the stuff that most us using the social
pro free and before and good thing to
point out here is a bigger trackpad and
it's actually it's got better plan
rejection so it will disable the size of
the trackpad when you're using
especially for when you're typing
there's a lot of space in between these
keys here and it feels they feel fairly
rigid when you're typing them it is like
it's pretty solid feedback on that and
other things to pull out the surface pen
you no longer have the annoying little
loop that it just sort sits to the side
it snaps to the top of the surface book
now and that's the same the surface pro
4 so some magnet sort of like danglies
there
there you go holds in place inside there
yeah as you can see it is a laptop
there's no mistaking its the surface but
that's not the surface laptop and it's
coming at the end of the month for
$14.99
and you bear to pre-order it I think
tomorrow and that's a quick look at the
surface book</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
