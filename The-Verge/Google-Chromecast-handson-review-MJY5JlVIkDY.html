this is Google's chromecast the
chromecast is a $35 HDMI dongle that
lets you stream video from laptops
tablets and smartphones and it works
across Mac's PCs Android and iOS devices
like the iPhone and iPad the only
complicated part of setting up a
chromecast is getting it power and even
that is pretty simple
almost all TVs have a USB port that
you're not using on them and the
chromecast can just plug right into that
if you don't have a USB port on your TV
there's a small power adapter in the Box
all in all it's a tiny little bit more
cable clutter than you might expect but
it's also one of the simplest setups out
there the only thing left to do once
you've plugged in the chromecast is
either open the Android app or the setup
page and Chrome on your PC give the
dongle a name and configure the Wi-Fi
connection which takes just a couple
minutes you'll also be prompted to
install the google cast extension in
Chrome on your Mac or PC the first time
through but I get the feeling that will
all be built into Chrome very very soon
once you've got everything set up which
took me just 5 or 10 minutes using the
chromecast is ridiculously simple
supported apps and services will display
a little icon when they see the
chromecast on your network and when you
hit it it'll tell the chromecast to
connect to that service and stream the
video using chromecast and apps like
Netflix and YouTube is almost perfect
since the chromecast is streaming video
directly from the web and not your phone
the video looks great and you can switch
to other apps and tabs on your phone or
PC and keep working while the video is
playing there are some glitches I find
it pretty easy to confuse the Netflix
app on my iPhone and occasionally I find
yourself sort of lost while the video is
playing without any obvious way to
control it since you've closed the tab
or switched apps it's not the end of the
world but Google would be smart to build
some basic controls into that Android
chromecast app and released a similar
iOS app the other problem is that right
now the list of apps and services that
support chromecast is pretty short it's
Netflix YouTube and Google Play Music &amp;amp;
TV on Android that's it
compared to something like Apple TV and
airplay that's a pretty sparse list
Google has a long way to go and
convincing content companies to support
chromecast directly although I imagine
Google's working pretty hard on that and
I imagine those content companies are
pretty interested in supporting
chromecast since it's at this point the
only viable competitor to airplay but
you don't have to wait for Google really
you can also just stream any tab from
the Chrome browser on Mac PC or the
Chromebook pixel that means you can
stream pretty much anything to a
chromecast I tried the Verge's homepage
vimeo spotify are do ESPN whatever i
wanted really clicking fullscreen on a
flash video makes that player fullscreen
on your pc and on the TV the only thing
is it didn't work where video players
that rely on quicktime which is built by
apple dragging a video into chrome from
the desktop that played using quicktime
sent video but not sound
streaming video from a tab isn't perfect
though there are some clear stutters the
scrolling lags way behind your finger
and the Audion get out of sync
especially in bad connections but it
works which is important and google says
the feature is only in beta so I'm
really hoping it'll get better and
that's pretty much it the chromecast
does what it says it's gonna do and it
does it really well it's the first
device that's made it easy and desirable
to put a web browser on your TV and
while there are definitely some glitches
in places where Google needs to fill in
the gaps it's pretty good for $35 in
fact it's probably one of the best
impulse purchases you'll make this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
