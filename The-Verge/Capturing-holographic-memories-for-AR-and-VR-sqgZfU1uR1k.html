you love or the stories they have to
tell in a way that makes it feel like
they're right next to you
AR and VR have the potential to
dramatically change everything from
gaming to entertainment to training for
a new job but they also have the
potential to impact our memories not
just the moments we remember but actual
living testimonies and how we interact
with people after they're gone I can let
go back into myself right whoa she's so
little
Ashley Scott is a Los Angeles based
actress an interior designer she is also
a mom which is worth noting because
she's one of the few people in the world
who has turned her kids into Holograms I
you know just was still kind of keeping
up with the casting calls and stuff that
were rolling through my email and I saw
something for a mom and a baby and I
thought oh that's me like I can do that
for me it just didn't even compute like
what that would entail or how real it
was the virtual reality of it this mom
and baby casting call led her to a tie a
Los Angeles based company that makes
so-called Holograms volumetric video
that can be viewed in a VR headset or as
part of an AR app a lot of the video
content 8i makes is focused on
celebrities or animals but not in this
case this was really early out in the
company and we were looking for ways to
test the emotional connectivity that can
happen between a real person and a
digital person and so a mom and a baby
seemed like a really good idea when
Ashley came back and she was able to
enter her hologram and hold her baby
again
she was got very emotional we all got
very emotional watching her and we
understood hey we're onto something
after seeing Ash's experience other 8'i
employees started to bring their kids in
to get their own holograms made this is
one-year-old Little Mix - almost two
year old loan and he was super bummed
then but he still carries the same
blankie we're gonna film you using all
these cameras right now see all the
cameras circling around you but you have
to stay in this little circle in order
for the cameras to see you last month we
followed Ashley as she made her fourth
trip to a tie this time with her now
youngest child Wilder being recorded
isn't any different than normal video
which I happen to know because I've had
a hologram of myself made before what is
different though is what it's like to
experience it afterwards whoa this is so
cool and it's so nice to see the little
her again looking at a flat image it's
just way different she's changed so much
and it's just crazy how fast it's going
it just takes you right back to that
moment and when you're dealing with a
newborn it feels like that stage is just
gonna last forever because your days are
long and your nights are longer but it
really goes by so fast and so to be able
to jump right back into that again it
was like I was overwhelming any time you
kind of had that feeling of like I miss
you know I miss my newborn I missed that
stage it's kind of cool that you can
literally just put on a headset or with
the new technology with the phones and
everything you could be right back in
that place a R is definitely more
accessible to view now that it's on
smartphones but the big question is when
will people be able to tape Holograms
the way that Ashley has at least one
major company invested in AR and VR has
taken steps towards that Microsoft just
opened its first mix reality capture
studios in San Francisco and London 8i
says that's coming but they're just not
there yet do you have friends asking you
if they can come in tie a tie and do
this sorry to interrupt you but
everybody asks me
that everybody wants Holograms of their
kids yeah can you imagine a world in
which this becomes commercially
available through a tie yes I think it
will be hopefully in the not too distant
future we don't have a date for that
because there's a lot of engineering
that has to out them but what I can tell
you that we are doing is starting to
experiment with how the quality get
affected if you use less cameras and
that's with an eye towards a lot of use
cases capture your kids what about
dating right how are people going to
make dating apps of the future social vr
but it's not all baby holograms and
dating apps and our quest to find others
who have been experimenting with AR and
vr to capture memories we ended up
taking a deep dive into one of the
darkest moments in history I think is
how are you today I'm fine thank you
tell me about your experience during the
Holocaust
this is Pincus guter he's a still living
Holocaust survivor who has had his life
story preserved by the USC Shoah
foundation over the past 23 years the
foundation has been capturing personal
testimonies of people who survived
genocide and as part of a newer project
called new dimensions in testimony the
foundation has been experimenting with
AR and VR how does it feel to be a
hologram myself it's so important for
the future to actually see and hear and
be able to interact with a Holocaust
survivor
despite the fact that he's just a
hologram is so important because I think
it will impact the audience in a much
more forceful way than just watching a
film in one or two dimensional way even
though I know it's not a real person and
it's a video it feels very real part of
the reason why talking to Pincus felt so
natural is that the foundation created
its own natural language processing
system that enables the video to respond
to you actually have a conversation not
preformed robot responses I think that
the immediacy of this format brings you
really close to the subject
and I think it's going to become a
standard way in which we document our
history because what we've seen so far
with new dimensions and testimony is
that people do feel emotionally
connected they want to know more and
feel when they come away from it that
they have had some kind of visceral and
emotional experience
there are obviously still technical
hurdles around creating and experiencing
personal memories in these formats in a
lot of cases like when it requires a
headset these things just aren't easy to
pick up and view the way you can look at
a flat photo or a video clip on your TV
but the bigger question might be what
happens once this kind of immersive
video is married with artificial
intelligence which is where some experts
say it's going what if a holographic AI
isn't just recognizing what you're
asking but is formulating its own
responses so these are all discussions
that we had to have and they are
important because actually there are
going to be versions of this in future
for sure where you're going to be able
to take the human form of a subject and
put words into his or her mouth and be
able to create answers from an
artificial intelligence drawn off a
database that's continually growing and
changing that's without question that
that's going to happen but that's going
to be an Android and what we've got is
human beings telling their story and we
make a very clear distinction between
the two a future filled with hyper
realistic holograms seems bizarre but
also quite possible when you consider
the advancements being made in AR and VR
and it makes sense that this technology
would impact the way we experience
memories the stuff closest to our hearts
and minds basically it's an emotional
experience right now that mostly just
means capturing people as we see them
now but this kind of volumetric capture
might also be the next level of how we
interact with people when they've
dramatically changed or when they no
longer actually exist
