worry if you haven't heard of these guys
before you're going to this Chinese
company has grown from nothing to one of
the largest smartphone manufacturers in
the world in under five years Xiaomi has
a bit of Google a bit of Apple a bit of
Amazon but that combination is
completely they're gonna be launching in
the US later this year not with
smartphones but with some smaller
accessories like headphones and fitness
bands in the meantime Xiaomi is on a
u.s. media tour with its 2015 flagship
phone the me note I've been using it for
a few days well maybe not using it per
se because it doesn't support us LTE
band so I haven't been using it as a
phone but I have been using it as a tiny
tablet not to say that a phone with a
5.7 inch display is tiny but you know
what I mean
speaking of the display the me notes
1080p screen is absolutely gorgeous
don't be fooled into thinking this is an
anonymous mid-range phone designed to
sell in bargain bins it's not the screen
is laminated just like you'd expect from
a flagship phone from Apple or Samsung
meaning there's no gap between the glass
and the pixels you can hold the phone at
an angle and it looks like the display
is quite literally on the surface its
vibrating enough so that it almost has
an OLED quality to it even though it's
an LCD oh and here's something the
iPhone doesn't have a glove mode so you
can use the capacitive touchscreen
without taking your mittens off it's
great but it's not just about the screen
the me note is exquisitely constructed
it's weird to be using a phone from a
brand that didn't exist five years ago
and have it feel basically a salad as
the best smartphones on the market I
might argue that the volume rocker is a
tad fidgety but otherwise it's smooth
glass married perfectly to chamfered
metal edges yeah I said it chamfered
that old buzzword launched by the iPhone
5 a couple years ago and yes it's true
xiaomi gets accused for mimicking apple
on a fairly regular basis but i wouldn't
call the me note an iphone knockoff it
might borrow a q or two from the iphone
5 but the curved portions of the back
make it look and feel notably different
if anything it's a dash of iPhone 5 a
dash of galaxy note 4 and some Xiaomi
originality all mixed together in the
end you get a big phone that
legitimately looks and feels like a
flagship device if the galaxy s6 being
announced in a few days look anything
like this honestly Samsung would be
doing all right for itself
if I have a problem with aminos design
those that is a little too sterile the
Meno combines so many tasteful
understated design elements that there's
just very very little room for character
it kind of screams generic flagship
smartphone that's fine I guess but if
you're looking for something quirky
you're not going to find it here and
Xiaomi might have trouble finding its
calling card if it keeps this up unless
your Apple I'm not sure you can hang an
entire brand on something that looks
this simple basically I'm saying that I
don't think I'd be able to pick a Shami
phone out of a lineup
now take basically all of my sentiments
about the hardware and carry them over
to the software it's beautiful
understated and simple maybe to a fault
this is heavily skinned Android that's
changed in all the right ways for a
change of pace the Meno uses Xiaomi is
well known me UI environment which looks
almost nothing like stock Android
everything's changed from the fonts to
the icons to the status bar to the
launcher it somehow feels simpler than
the typical Android phone maybe it's the
color scheme which leans heavily on
whites and grays or maybe it's the fact
that there's no app menu app icons just
appear in the homescreen like they would
on iOS seriously this phone feels like a
contender it's really good and I can
imagine Xiaomi making even better stuff
over the next few years
but I still think they're smart and
steering clear of the US market look at
Sony and Nokia which started with way
more name recognition made awesome
phones and still a failed to capture big
market share here could that change over
time sure the big players in the u.s.
phone market today are completely
different than they were a decade ago
who knows in 2020 maybe I'll be riding
around in my Apple car and talking on a
me note 6</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
