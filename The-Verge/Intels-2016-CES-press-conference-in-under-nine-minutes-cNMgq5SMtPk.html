they set the stage for the whole week
they frame the conversation they create
the industry buzz we love and of course
with every Intel keynote we get live
demos right here on this stage the
technology that enables the new
experience that's the product that will
be successful in the future during our
time together I'm going to show you some
amazing experiences and they're all made
possible by technology that Intel is
going to be bringing to market and our
key partners so let's start with sports
in gaming I didn't tell we want to make
sure that every gamer can take advantage
of the full sensory opportunities that
gaming can offer so we built processors
that are extremely expressly designed to
deliver more performance and more
sensation than ever before as a pro
gamer we only use Intel chips and
obviously I'm not only saying that just
because you're my sponsor we actually
know we're going to get the best framing
and the split-second reaction time that
makes all the difference in tournaments
how about we put you right into the game
does that sound like I'm the best game
there is if I'm in there well it's gonna
be the a Branca vanish game so let's go
ahead and using this 3d capture software
to take a little take a little 3d model
of my boss here and this is gonna allow
us to take the 3d capture and put it
right into our game I'd like to
introduce you to replay 3d video format
it captures the sport and the action you
love and turns it into a 3d experience
that you can now watch on broadcast in
the stadium or on your PC at home
last year at the CES forum I introduced
you to Intel security computer that fit
in the size of a button Fury's dedicated
sensor hub can be used in a variety of
exciting ways you've already seen some
of those tonight since then we've been
showing the world how Intel Kure works
and integrating it into some new
experiences Curie is sampling today and
will ship in volume this quarter for a
price below ten dollars last year I
showed you some very advanced but
relatively expensive drones that could
see and respond to their environment
well tonight we're going to take that
technology to its natural next step I'm
excited to show you tonight the world's
first truly intelligent consumer drones
the unique Typhon inch with real cells
this drought is built with the end user
in mind you can use it right out of the
box it's ready to fly it has
best-in-class features it has
collapsible propellers so it can be
compactly stored it has retractable
landing gear it has a 4k camera and one
of the best features I've found is a
built-in display in the controller so
you can see the drone is seeing
real-time using an intel realsense
camera and an Intel CPU with the
collision avoidance technology we've
developed with ascending technologies
this drone goes everywhere it can
navigate any obstacle so I'm pleased to
announce that the unique typhoon aged
with real science technology will be
available in the first half of 2016 and
what's equally is important at a price
of less than $2,000
so now let's move to our next set of
experiences health and wellness just
over a year ago we announced that Intel
would be working with luxottica on smart
eyewear I'm excited to share a sneak
peek tonight of the product we've been
working on with one of luxottica x' most
popular brands Oakley so radar pace
isn't just giving you preset
instructions it's really looking at the
data and responding to your workout
real-time radar pace launches in late
2016
New Balance is dedicated to creating
real products that can help athletes
focus on their training so they can
constantly improve performance we've
been working with 3d printing for a long
time and recently we started
experimenting with intel's realsense to
see if we could create 3d images of the
foot that create a truly personalized
running shoe and we found the
possibilities for design were incredible
and we've really enjoyed working with
Intel to create a SmartWatch a
SmartWatch designed by runners for
runners will be launched in the holiday
season this year we think it's going to
redefine the athletic experience this is
just one example of how our expertise in
manufacturing mixed with Intel's
technology can really improve the lives
of athletes so we wanted to think about
technology can truly advanced wellness
in the workplace as well and one of the
most interesting developments is
bringing technology to one of the oldest
safety devices the hard hop I'm excited
to be here tonight to show off the new
daiquiri smart helmet it has a six
generation intel core m7 processor and
realsense camera technology built right
into the helmet
the new daiquiri smart helmet starts
shipping to our Tier one partners today
technology has become a catalyst for a
new age of creativity the engine behind
entirely new experiences in the world of
fashion music art and my favorite area
the maker movement cutting hair so these
bands have the intially technology and
what it does is it kind of senses my
gestures and transfers that into MIDI
data and it goes to the computer on one
of the software's and changes that
finally every teenagers dream an air
guitar that actually works tonight I'd
like to show you a platform for creation
that we are introducing for the first
time tonight
oh hey Kraig the innovative engineers
from nine BOTS and the technology
acquired from Segway has given rise to a
brand new platform this particular
self-balancing transportation vehicle
actually has a real unique trick of its
sleeve is that this one transform into
your own personal robot hello world it's
been 1 hours and 12 minutes since I last
seen the world good to be back because
it's an open platform Brian we can
pretty much program it with a little
know-how to do anything that we want
with an Intel Atom processor as well as
the realsense camera that we have built
in all of it's able to take all of the
vision have all the smarts and all the
balance to really do an autonomous run
without knocking all over the lamps in
the house we have designed this robot to
be extendable can design an attachment
accessories tweet for example this robot
arm developers can start creating on
this Segway robot with the developer
cape release in the second half of 2016
if we want the technology industry to
define the future we must be
representative of that future we wanted
to make sure that at least 40% of the
hires that came into Intel were women
and underrepresented minorities and we
wanted to make real improvement
and the retention rate of those same
employees in diverse talent tin tantalum
tungsten and gold are the ingredients of
almost every consumer electronic and
originated in places with unimaginable
human conditions in 2016 every product
that Intel ships will be conflict free
and you can look for the conflict free
symbol starting in q2 on all of our
products to be confident that you're
doing your part to improve the human
experience there's far more to do but
I'm confident that will stand up on this
stage in 2020 and tell you we've not
only met our goal but we truly changed
the dynamic in our industry and beyond</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
