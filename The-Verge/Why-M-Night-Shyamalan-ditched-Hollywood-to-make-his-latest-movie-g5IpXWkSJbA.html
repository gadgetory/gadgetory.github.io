lot of introduction with films like The
Sixth Sense and signs he became one of
the premier thriller directors working
movies after that they didn't do so well
and the last two been do well at all
now he's back with a new secret project
called the visit we sat down with him at
Comic Con 2015 to talk about the movie
and what's coming next
so you're here primarily to talk about
your new movie the visit which is a very
interesting movie you kind of seem you
went away in secret told nobody made
this movie self-financed around five
million dollars which is fascinating cuz
your last couple movies were much much
bigger what made you feel like it was
time to kind of just go off the grid and
do your own thing
you know I guess it was a feeling like I
just wanted to concentrate on
storytelling I just wanted to
concentrate on the things that make me
happy as a filmmaker in the sense of
like you know writing a great script not
thinking about writing a script and
saying how am I gonna convince someone
else to make it so which is already a
kind of a weird mindset to be and you
know you're already not being anything
using this is for me this is this is I
want to I want to put as much of myself
into it and then you know really you
know saying it's never been about the
amount of money that makes a great movie
never you know and and and and I want to
concentrate on storytelling how to
direct properly how to storyboard and if
I do all of those things right somebody
will want to buy this movie and one day
maybe I'll be at Comic Con and show the
movie I'm interesting like you find that
smaller scale like and it's a bit of a
you're normally like you as a director
you're very very formal in your
composition yes it seems like you're
look more loose like were there things
about going small having more fun in
this project intrigue you in particular
well I'm definitely shot oriented very
carefully meticulously craft the shots
and that's true for the visit they're
all very meetings now it had to look
like it wasn't meticulously crafted
which was fun it was a fun challenge I I
love this approach to filmmaking and it
did it was it was more pliable it was
more
loose because if I went you know what
you know we're we're not gonna do this
self a scene right now
you know I have this idea I want to I
want to go do that thing again that we
did yesterday I just don't think we got
it
you know it was there's no there's no
and there's no process to check with
there's no one knows the countenance I
just we just moved the cameras and we
did it and in fact I'll give you an
example of how pliable it was I I took
the budget which was 30 days and I said
we're gonna shoot it in 27 days and then
I said to everyone the crew in the cast
everybody I said we're coming back in
three weeks no one take a frickin job
we're coming back in three weeks and
when they do the last three days so I
was almost like I was cheating I felt
like you know I took a test saw that saw
what I got wrong and was like I'm just
gonna fix this real quick and that's
because it was so pliable and thin and
lean and the you know small crew and
small cast and it turned up to just be
this fun you know you didn't you know
you were really listening to the
characters really listening to what you
were making so it was a very it was a
very rewarding process and hopefully you
know audiences will sense how much fun I
had making the movie and we'll have an
equal amount of fun watching it yeah
it's interesting like you've seen
reinvigorated between this and wayward
Pines you know after you know working a
lot of big movies which can be
exhausting us yeah the physical
perspective one thing I'm curious about
both this is a thriller as wayward Pines
yes which is kind of like becoming your
hallmark yes I remember reading yes a
lot of your early scripts and you know
in the 90s before The Sixth Sense
you know stuff that's you know like love
yes yeah exactly yeah more than first
two features yes small character pieces
that were fantastic and moving you know
that thread is well continued in your
work yes but I'm just curious it was
have you ever felt like you had to
always add the layer the thriller layer
on top of that you know no I don't think
of it like that I do definitely know
myself now unconsciously I'm like I have
two sides of me one's kind of a dark
twisted side and then the other ones
kind of like an emotional family side
and those have always existed and
they've existed from go as you mentioned
you know I've wrote and made more dramas
and more family-oriented fare before
sixth sense
in the year of sixth-sense I wrote
Stuart Little so for me it's always been
open I've always been out of the closet
about this that I've had these two sides
but yet they go oh no this is this is
you you know and I get what I also get
is I'm my baseline is more emotional
than the general population
I get that you know like you know I'm
very you know I'm very moved very I'm
right I'm ready emotionally to be
involved in anything that stories and
things like that and what I what I what
I did I think in sixth sense was the
first time I kind of took that those
instincts and kind of gave them balance
with other things so that there was
there was the emotionality was coming
this way not right at you and when it
comes at you everybody does that and
goes you know I'm not - I'm not gonna go
there but if it sneaks up on you it's
powerful and really we want to be have a
cathartic experience like that that was
the balance that I've learned so I don't
feel like I'm not making dramas anymore
you know so the visit for all of its
scares and all of its outrageousness and
all of its humor there's a core drama
that's going on in the at the center of
it you know for me the visits about
forgiveness who knows if the audience
will even know that but you know they'll
be screaming their heads off
but at the center of it is is a drama
it's it's interesting you talk about
that emotional accessibility that a lot
of people aren't I think we see that
across a lot of movies right now where
there's you know you know where
audiences maybe aren't as ready to go
and be open emotionally to things have
gotten more cynical and darker and it's
rare and something actually even tries
to push through that so I'm glad you're
still like trying to go and do that
though yeah it's important you know oh
yeah by the way it's actually respect
what we're talking about that what you
just said that the audience is saying to
you to me if you make something too
emotional too soft
right off the bat you know if the
baseline is that I'm not with you
because that's not my life experience so
I don't find that valid the way you're
saying now if I acknowledge their their
their their well-deserved cynicism of
the world and I can acknowledge
and I can come in with that voice and
say I'm with you we're gonna we're gonna
I'm gonna speak to you from this angle
and then we we together might turn and
find something emotional they'll go
there they'll go there and I believe
they even want to but again it's this
there you have to acknowledge that
there's we're starting all of us are
starting like this yeah
so it's interesting like that does
factor into your writing process it does
it does because to some extent it's the
simplest version of it is you have not
earned the right to go to that emotional
place yet
you just haven't earned it yet and by
earning I mean you have to acknowledge
where people are coming in that's out of
that's respect you know and then if you
can do that you can might sometime in
the two hours earn your way there right
well it's like it's interesting if
that's the way to Surprise them it's a
very similar title unbreakable work for
me where people did not know they like
comic book movies at the time yeah
that's all they like that they're like
oh maybe we do and now everybody likes
comic book yes right but you had to
sneak it in there it was like kind of
like you know we're not really doing
this thing don't look over there but
away yes yeah they told from like a very
serious dramatic perspective yeah you
know the predominant way to tell comic
book movies now is kind of
tongue-in-cheek you know farcical you
know kind of keeping it buoyant and
entertainment saying what I think I'm
says we're not taking ourselves see
we're not taking ourselves seriously and
that's really entertaining to watch and
all that so that wasn't what unbreakable
was for me that was take you know always
it's taking some premise that's on the
verge of unbelievable which is unbeliev
but I'm gonna try to ground it you know
and make it so that you walk out
thinking is this possible is this this
you know is what's just we just saw on
the visit is that possible is you know
is is unbreakable possible you know that
kind of thing and so the limitations do
help with that right so so talk to me
much I mentioned my label of earlier
there's an announcement that you're
gonna be working on that possibly Willis
yes yes is that still happening
yeah I'm nothing I'm doing it next I'm
writing a new a new thriller the problem
is you know the problem with trying the
labor of love is one of two screenplays
that I've written since puberty that I
didn't make
and I won't want to make labor of love
badly but it it to some extent the the
reason that that worked is because it
represented a time in my life you know I
wrote it when I was 22 23 and I'm
burning to write this thing right now
that I'm that that that's telling you
exactly the thing I'm writing right now
will tell you guys what I'm feeling
right now and the philosophies and the
things that I'm thinking about right now
so it feels weird to kind of go let me
just go back in the time portal and
pretend I'm 23 again and and ignore
what's happened over the last 20 years
right yeah so how do you go about when
you say I came we want to revisit that
like what does that process revisit like
like if you want to go like redo that
project you kind of sit back and get
such a rewrite from square one or you go
no I wouldn't
that's the struggle I I you know I've
almost made that movie three eight three
times now three separate times it's also
I'm under the quandary that that was
prior to the the things that we talked
about right so the audience's I you know
do I now put my name on it
do I you know use a different form of my
name these are all the things that when
if I'm gonna make a thing that's
basically a flat-out romance there's
nothing scary about it at all there's
nothing there's nothing thriller about
it at all you know how do we how what
what to do it that's an interesting an
interesting challenge at that point well
yeah how do you how do you break that
down because you know you know your name
has weight you know baby items that have
come out yes there's an expectation how
do you how do you juggle that you know
between like what you want to do yeah
we're like you know we're well luckily
yeah luckily if it is a box it's one
that I created you know it wasn't a book
that I found and I'm like oh no now what
am I gonna do
it's it was all things that that were
parts of me that I deeply believe in my
goal is to keep widening and making the
box time they say they even widening
although that's the case but making it
more customized the box I'm happy to
live in this box I created it but it
should really match who I am so like I'm
breakable though that day I didn't like
it it wasn't scary
I didn't the disabilities Gary but it's
it's a mystery and a thriller and I love
comic books you know and
now the box becomes like you know and so
you know you keep adding in the village
and lady in the water these are all
wonderful the Box goes chichi
right do you think audiences have a hard
time tracking when their favorite
artists and any other musicians yeah
because whatever grow and evolve oh yeah
I absolutely absolutely you know I and I
get that you know when we think about I
mean you know when you think about like
my favorite authors as my heroes I got
the Christa you know she made 8080
mysteries right and then she used a
pseudonym for non mysteries I mean she
was very black-and-white about it and
that just might be the case you know
that might be the case and that's the
fine I'm you know if you're an author
it's it actually is not so bad you know
I mean I wonder I'm like I'm thinking
about like Stephen King or something
like that you know an author that we
have really strong expectations from and
he's done a good job of keeping his the
box you know more more customized for
him you know like the one about Jay had
the book about JFK which I love it's
weird it's not necessarily scary it's
you know it's weird and interesting as
will stand by me and things like that so
that's important for me to know that
that's there as opposed to just the
horror elements for him</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
