can tell you the basic whether out of
the box but if you're willing to dig
into the App Store's
you'll find countless weather apps that
promise to be more accurate give you
more information and be nicer to look at
than your smartphone's default weather
apps are some of the most useful apps on
my phone they determine what I'll wear
and where I'll go in any given day the
apps that come with your smart phone can
tell you the current weather conditions
and perhaps a short forecast but if you
want more information such as longer
forecasts radar maps or severe weather
alerts you're going to have to look
elsewhere
for the iPhone the best-paid weather app
is hands-down dark sky it's 399 which
might sound like a lot the dark sky has
an uncanny ability to pinpoint your
location down to a street address and
then tell you exactly how many minutes
you have before it will rain the first
time you get a push notification to your
phone letting you know that will rain in
15 minutes and last for 11 minutes and
that's exactly what happens you quickly
forget about a few bucks you spent on
dark sky dark sky is also a
full-featured weather app with 24-hour
and full week forecasts and animated
maps for precipitation and temperature
importantly dark sky has an easy-to-use
design with bouncy but informative
animations sprinkled throughout it also
works on both the iPhone and the iPad
it's almost silly to say this about a
weather app the dark sky is just fun to
use if you're looking for a great free
weather app you can't do any better than
Yahoo web it's one of the prettiest
weather apps ever very clearly inspiring
Apple's own weather app introduced with
iOS 7 but it doesn't just offer good
looks Yahoo weather is as feature
complete as they come and it doesn't
have any obnoxious ads interrupting your
forecast Yahoo weather presents the
current conditions in a beautiful font
overlaid on images culled from Flickr
and it provides more information in a
vertically scrolling column there are
hourly forecasts 5 or 10 day forecasts
and detailed weather information for the
current conditions it works on both the
iPhone and the iPad and it even has
animated radar maps but it does lack
alerts for severe weather conditions
over on Android the best-paid weather
app you can get is AccuWeather platinum
for $2.99 AccuWeather platinum offers
pretty much everything you can ask for
in a weather app detailed current
conditions accurate hourly predictions
forecasts that stretch out for up to
three weeks animated radar maps and TV
style video forecasts
it also has minute-by-minute forecasts
and exact locations right down to your
street level a cue others design is
clean and fits right in with androids
native design language and it includes
informative and attractive home screen
widgets there are no ads in the Platinum
version and you can opt to have your
current weather permanently displayed in
your phone's notification tray as well
as get push notifications for severe
weather conditions you can get the free
version of AccuWeather which offers the
same features in design but it comes
with obnoxious banner ads that
in the experience for me as with iOS the
best free option on Android is Yahoo
whether virtually everything that makes
Yahoo weather great on the iPhone is
found in the Android version including
it's clean but information dense design
the only thing the Android app is
missing compared to iOS is animated
radar maps and it doesn't have the
minute-by-minute forecast offered by
AccuWeather there are countless other
options out there everything ranging
from the ultra simple weather line to
the graphics have a clear day to the
ultra complex radar scope and even old
standbys like weather bug and The
Weather Channel's own app when you cut
through the noise what you really want
is a weather app that's accurate
powerful and pleasant to use every day
you'll pay a few dollars to get that
experience in dark sky or AccuWeather
platinum but when you're able to duck
inside just before the torrential
downpour it'll be worth every penny
