away than Pluto and bigger than Pluto
itself we're calling this new object the
the tenth planet in the solar system
this will absolutely rewrite the history
of astronomy textbooks there's there's
now a tenth planet out there but that's
not what happened
in fact the discovery of this tenth
planet it's a reason that we don't even
have Pluto anymore Pluto used to be the
ninth planet in our solar system but it
got demoted ten years ago to a dwarf
planet Pluto isn't alone out there there
are thought to be hundreds if not
thousands of dwarf planets astronomers
are finding more of these tiny worlds
all the time so why do we even make the
distinction between a planet and a dwarf
planet it all started in 2005 when a
team of scientists led by Mike Brown
found a new tantalizing object at the
edge of the solar system it was a rock
that eventually be named Eris and when
it was found astronomers thought it
might actually be bigger than Pluto
don't worry Pluto's the larger one but
Eris is more massive Eris even has its
own moon just like most of the other
planets do in our solar system that led
many in the science community including
NASA to think Eris was the tenth planet
beyond Pluto but not everybody was on
board with the title when they found
Eris astronomers have been finding more
and more tiny objects beyond Neptune
calling eras the planet could open the
door to calling all these objects
planets too plus other Pluto like
objects were being discovered around the
same time scientists everywhere were
clashing over what makes a planet a
planet to the point that it became
downright catty the debate came to an
emotional head in 2006 with a meeting of
the International Astronomical Union
that's a group that's responsible for
giving names to celestial bodies after
meeting in Prague the IAU came up with
the first-ever official definition of a
planet and it boils down to three main
points
it has to orbit the Sun it has to have
enough mass so that it's rounded out by
its own gravity and then there's the
last one which people freaked out about
it needs to have cleared the
neighbourhood of its orbit okay so what
does that even mean again it comes down
to gravity the idea is that the planet
has to be big enough that it swept away
all the other objects out of its orbital
path and that's where Pluto doesn't fit
in Pluto orbits in a region known as the
Kuiper belt large cloud of small icy
bodies that circle the Sun beyond
Neptune many of the Kuiper belt objects
cross Pluto's path making Pluto's
neighborhood a little crowded it's the
same deal for Eris which is also in the
Kuiper belt and the object Ceres which
shares its orbit with the asteroids in
the asteroid belt
it's a criteria that didn't sit well
with a lot of people especially Allen
Stern the head of NASA's new Horizons
mission to Pluto that whole zone
clearing criteria is at its root very
anti-scientific because it was designed
to give a specific answer and science
doesn't work that way
Engineering does so they engineered an
answer because they wanted a small
number of planets okay and there was a
concern that school kids wouldn't be
able to remember the names that there
were going to be a lot of planets now I
have to say as a scientist I find that
kind of silly to be fair it is pretty
easy to poke holes in the neighborhood
argument for example Pluto's orbit also
crosses Neptune so doesn't that mean
Neptune hasn't cleared its neighborhood
either and Earth isn't exactly alone in
its orbit there are more than 15,000
asteroids that orbit along with us when
I mean earth is a dwarf planet - to
address this Steven Soter of the
American Museum of Natural History came
up with a clarification it's not that a
planet has completely cleared its orbit
but that it dynamically dominates its
orbit basically a planet has to be the
boss of its orbital zone a good way of
establishing this dominance is to
compare the mass of a planet and the
combined mass of all the other objects
in a similar orbit so earth is one
point seven million times bigger than
all of the other asteroids in its
orbital zone combined
likewise Jupiter is 625 thousand times
larger than all of the Trojan asteroids
and its orbit the planet may be way more
massive than ours but it orbits with a
larger swarm of objects now let's take a
look at Pluto
it's just 7% of the mass of all the
objects that cross its path by Souter's
definition Pluto does not dominate its
orbit but why even distinguish between
planets and dwarf planets at all for
many of the classifications are tied to
the roles these objects played in the
formation of our solar system the
planets are the ones that help to clear
everything out by jettisoning smaller
bodies out into interstellar space or
sending them hurtling toward the Sun
drawer of planets however our leftover
debris from the early days of the solar
system that got kicked around by the
larger planets Pluto for instance is
thought to be where it is now because of
a great Neptune migration long ago ten
years later
critics like Stern's still think it
shouldn't matter if an object's orbit
has been cleared if it's rounded out by
gravity then it's a planet the IU has
mostly closed the case on the matter so
the planet definition is going to stick
around for the foreseeable future but if
you're bummed about only having eight
planets in our solar system it's
possible there could be one more
evidence is mounting that there's a
mysterious Neptune sized planet orbiting
even farther out than Pluto and Eris but
that's for another video
to be fair Stern also has an argument
that if you were to put earth where
Pluto is now it also wouldn't be big
enough to clear its orbital zone because
the orbital zone would be too big but
I'm not about labels man you know we're
all just floating in space together as
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
