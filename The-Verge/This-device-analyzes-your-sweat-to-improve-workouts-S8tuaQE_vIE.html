sticky and sometimes embarrassing fluid
that signals everything from exertion to
anxiety but for doctors and biochemists
sweat offers more than a hint at
people's emotional state it can also
give scientists information about a
person's muscle fatigue or hydration
level unfortunately getting useful
information from sweat hasn't always
been easy because its composition
changes over time that's why researchers
have been working on ways to measure the
components of sweat in real time now
scientists say they've come up with a
device that can do just that and it's
small enough to fit in a sweatband the
device works thanks to five sensors
located on a flexible circuit board they
measure sodium lactate glucose and
potassium in sweat as well as a person's
body temperature at the other end of the
prototype are a bunch of chips that take
data from the sensor and generate a
detailed sweat profile of whoever's
wearing device during a workout that
information can then be sent wirelessly
to a person's phone the researchers
tested this device on a dozen people as
the exercise on stationary bikes or ran
outdoors they found that results were
comparable to those generated by
conventional machines putting all that
together you know you know in a wearable
platform that provides it continuous
monitoring capability i think it's
qualitatively more powerful than you
know just episodic single time point
measurements that have been done in the
past the scientists say that they like
to see the technology used by regular
people not just athletes or astronauts
the idea here is that looking at a real
time sweat profile could help users
figure out how well their body is
responding to a specific exercise or to
their work out as a whole this kind of
platform with other emerging devices
that can measure clinical quality ECG
for example blood swells blood pressure
all these kinds of randers will be
possible in wearables of the future and
I think it will take us into a whole new
regime of management of human health
care the sensors can be mass-produced
for low costs the researchers say so a
scaled-down version of a device like
this could end up in a fitness band or
smartwatches in your future
but Rodgers thinks it might make more
sense develop a wearable akin to a
temporary tattoo because smartwatches
don't always get the right amount of
skin contact until then though we're
probably going to keep thinking of sweat
as the price you pay for a good workout</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
