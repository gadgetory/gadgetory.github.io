standing in front of the Volkswagen
buddy which was unquestionably one of
the most anticipated launches here at
CES certainly in the automotive space
and possibly across the entire show few
reasons for that one
it sort of evokes the microbus which is
an iconic brand for Volkswagen it's up
there with the beetle and the thing so
this is sort of the modern
reinterpretation of the microbus it's an
electric vehicle well over 300 miles of
claimed range the bunch of cool things
about this car none of which are real
none of which are in a production car
today but might be eventually one is
that you can just talk to this car you
don't have to press a button to engage
with the voice recognition so that's a
lot like hey Siri or okay Google or
Alexa they're using hey buddy
they're also a bunch of screens in it
and these are cool because they can
connect to a bunch of smart home things
they brought LG onstage they brought the
maker of a smart doorbell so you can see
who's at your door from your car the
doors all of the doors on this thing
automatically open and closed with a
gesture you just swipe at it or if you
don't want to swipe you don't feel like
moving your hands you can talk to it you
can say hey buddy open the door problem
is it's not real but considering these
the response is getting here tonight and
the language that Volkswagen is using I
am led to believe that some form of this
car will be production eventually if
nothing else the platform certainly will
be they they're building a modular
electric architecture that they can use
on a number of different vehicles so
that part will definitely make it to the
factory floor it's just a question
whether it'll look like a microbus
that's it from Volkswagen here at CES
2016 of course we have plenty more CES
coverage coming later this week so stay
tuned for that and subscribe to us on
youtube we're at the birds</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
