about the new Apple watch series to
right off the bat it's that this is
probably what the first Apple watch
should have been from the hardware
components to the new software the new
Apple watch series - feels like both a
legitimate fitness tracker and something
that could be a useful platform for apps
and actually that's how Apple has
prioritized this new gadget it is really
focused on health and fitness while the
idea of Apple watch being a computer on
your wrist has really faded into the
background so your next inevitable
question might be should I buy the Apple
watch series - or if I invest it in the
first one should I upgrade that's all
going to depend a lot on your personal
use case like whether you're looking for
an exercise tracker or whether you just
like the idea of having iMessage and
uber on your wrist but I can tell you
this much as a fitness tracker it feels
like it has finally arrived the series
two comes in three models they all have
the same internals just different
external materials there is also a Nike
branded version of the sport watch which
will have a built-in Nike running app
and of course as with any Apple watch
you're going to have to have an iPhone
to use this thing it looks almost
identical to the first Apple watch the
display is brighter in fact Apple says
it's the brightest display it has ever
made and if you compare the two closely
you can tell that the series 2 is just a
tiny bit thicker because of its bigger
battery but let's talk about something
more interesting the speakers they now
include a mechanism that wait for it
expels water because the Apple watch
series 2 is water resistant up to 50
meters now when you go into the workout
options in the watch you'll see that
there's a pool swim option and an open
water option when you start one of those
workout options the watch automatically
locks the touch screen display and then
in order to exit the workout you twist
the digital crown on the side of the
watch and it actually makes this little
noise comes out of the speakers and
expels water it is admittedly a strange
and kind of brilliant way to get water
out of a consumer electronic device more
important than the water resistance is
the addition of GPS now if you go
running or cycling or do anything
outdoors with Apple watch series 2 and
you
don't have your phone with you it will
do location tracking through GPS and
then it will show you a map of your
activity after the fact in the activity
app on iPhone I tested the GPS on this
going on my normal running cycling and
walking routes without my iPhone and it
pretty much gave you the same exact
distances that I would get if I was just
using my smartphone or if I was using
another GPS equipped running watch a few
things to know though the watch doesn't
tell you when it's searching for GPS
like other GPS watches do you just have
to start an outdoor workout and assume
that it's working also you're going to
get five hours of continuous usage with
GPS and Apple watch - that's it and
finally if you do happen to bring your
iPhone with you when you're doing a
workout outdoors the watch is going to
default to the iPhone for GPS rather
than the watch for battery conservation
otherwise the daily activity tracking
and the exercise tracking are pretty
much the exact same as they were on the
first Apple watch the optical heart rate
sensors are the exact same heart rate
sensors one cool new feature is now if
you're doing an other workout using the
workout app you can later on identify it
as something specific like yoga or
strength training oh and the watch now
has a breathe app that reminds you when
to breathe which is all part of this
growing trend around mindfulness
although to be honest I didn't use it
much this week maybe because I'm just
not very chill all of this data will be
synced with the activity app on iPhone
and the most important new feature there
is social sharing which honestly Apple
is behind on and is a testament to the
value of what other companies like
Fitbit have been doing for years you can
set it up so that you get a ping when a
friend finishes workout provided of
course they are also wearing an Apple
watch and you can send them encouraging
messages so what about the non Fitness
stuff the everyday stuff B do I really
need a SmartWatch stuff the first Apple
watch suffered from slow to load apps
and require too many taps and swipes and
interactions to get anything done this
one feels much easier to use part of
this improvement is due to the new dual
core processor and the watch but a
bigger part of it is the new software
watch OS 3 which is actually available
on all Apple watches not just the new
one now when you swipe up from the
bottom of the watch you have a mini
control center right there
you can change watch faces just
by swiping from edge to edge and then if
you press this physical side button it
brings you to an app dock which is
basically a shortcut to apps the Apple
watch still isn't perfect though I mean
the display doesn't wake up every time I
raise my wrist which gets real annoying
real fast also even though the display
is much brighter it's still not super
easy to see in direct sunlight and then
there's battery life bigger battery
definitely needs better battery life on
this than the last one I mean now I can
get through an entire day use GPS for an
hour and by 9 o'clock at night I still
have around 20% left but it's still a
charge everyday kind of watch which is
one of my least favorite parts about it
so should you get an Apple watch series
too well if you already have an iPhone
and you really want GPS and
waterproofing and you have at least
three hundred and sixty-nine dollars to
spend then go for it I mean serious
athletes who are looking for things like
a highly visible display and hours and
hours of GPS tracking and a multi sport
mode need not apply but I still think in
general this is a big step up in terms
of fitness tracking ok so health and
fitness aside the Apple watch series too
has improved simply as a piece of
wearable technology I mean is this as
essential as your smartphone no and it
may never be it's also not a replacement
for your smartphone but if you're
already buying into the Apple ecosystem
and you feel like you need a SmartWatch
then Apple has improved upon this in a
lot of the right places I tested the new
Apple watch by going on my normal
Pokemon go routes swimming in the
bathtub holding my breath till it told
me to breathe and it was</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
