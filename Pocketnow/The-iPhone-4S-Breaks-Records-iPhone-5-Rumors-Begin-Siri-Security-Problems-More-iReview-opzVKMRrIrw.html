the iphone 4s keeps breaking records
rumors about the iphone 5 have already
begun and problems with Syrian your
security become an issue all this and
more coming up right now hello everybody
I'm hi matter iveta and welcome to the
pocket nail I review the show we go
through all this week school and they're
not so cool inside the role of Apple's
iOS devices let's talk this week off
with the cool if you had any doubts on
how good the iphone 4s would sell think
again apple sold four million iphone 4s
is in just three days in comparison to
the 1.7 million units they sold up the
iphone 4 in the same three days now
remember back then it was only AT&amp;amp;T and
now you get verizon and sprint in the
mix many consider a lot of the features
of the device to be underpowered in
comparison to the competition but it
does seem like the market is showing us
that specs aren't really the big thing
for them in comparison to looks and
functionality aside from the experience
so sales have even ended in reservations
only under low stock at even weeks for
you to get the device and low pre-orders
have already begun in 22 more countries
so make sure you pick yours up raw
supplies last Apple has recently aired a
new Sri commercial that tries to show
you just how useful Sri can be the
question is do you really use Siri or
not is it really worth it or not well
Brandon recently spent some time talking
to Siri if that's even possible and he
recorded his thoughts on what he thinks
at the platform and where it should go
so far series good but it could be so
much better with just a couple of tweaks
if it's for you or not it's really
highly dependent on your busy lifestyle
and how much time you spend doing tasks
and how many things your phone should be
able to do for you instead of you having
to do it on your phone watch Brandon's
video to see if it really meets your
needs or not because again it has a lot
to do with the fact that well phone
should be smart enough that they are
called smart phones to do things for you
instead of you having to do it for them
aside from that make sure you watch our
pocket now face sobs in comparison with
the iphone 4s and the Droid Bionic
also the samsung galaxy s2 all really
good videos to show you if one device is
worth it or not in comparison to the
other now what about the iphone 5 yeah
you heard it the rumors have begun
according to certain reports Steve Jobs
spent his last days living working on
apple's next iphone and his involvement
on the iphone 4s was really minimal
rumors have it that apple dust plan to
release an iphone 5 next summer at WWDC
and well does it make sense or now or
just think about it I mean Apple release
the iphone 4 on verizon in February and
just a couple of months later we get the
iphone 4s so it does make sure it
doesn't make sense so let's just keep
the speculation up and well let's just
hope for the dramatic redesign coming up
next and hopefully some LTE love when
people are going crazy for it and when
carriers are just evolving to it as we
get closer than I so cool section let's
talk a little about Steve Jobs his
biography is scheduled to air on Monday
October 24th and already everyone is
talking about certain excerpts and
comments that have been pulled from his
bio some parts of it have the true idea
of what it was like for a guy like Steve
Jobs to be building these new products
and just how exciting these product
launches were but on the other side row
we also have his honest opinion on what
we could expect from competition and one
of the points for example was the fact
that Steve said that he was going to
destroy Android because it was a copy
product and well if you remember Android
and what it was before the iphone was
released you remember that video with
Sergey Brin coming up from google ins
talking about Android you saw a
non-touch device that they were trying
to build and eventually we see the
iphone come to town and then bull
delaying androids product launch because
they were working on more things and you
end up with something that looks a lot
like the iphone so Steve could be riding
the fact that some products were copied
and some things were copied from iOS but
then again a lot of the things that
Android brought to the table we're
different so there's a lot of really
interesting stuff coming up from this
bio and you can bet a lot of us have
already pre-ordered it so just make sure
you watch our recent tribute to Steve
Jobs of you didn't catch it recently and
well a lot of things are history already
but
again this just gives you a perspective
on how things war on Steve mind and how
we could expect apple to react to
competition in the future because ice
cream sandwich is looking very
interesting that is it for the cool
let's continue on with the not-so-cool
as much as many naysayers consider siri
to be overrated we call it to be a hit
because it's the only feature that
actually sells the iphone 4s have you
compared to the iphone 4 there are a lot
of specs bumps but still siri is really
the breakthrough here and now well you
can see that the iphone for us are
selling a lot better than the iphone
four now the problem is when you match
security issues with siri because
recently it was discovered that if you
have enough if you have a locked iphone
so we can actually unlock your password
and actually allow you to access the
phone or at least access certain tasks
like making phone calls so it's not
really locked is it now before you wait
and hold your breath for Apple to fix
that just go into settings and go into
the security portion of your settings
and just disable the Sri reaction when
your device is locked because it's
actually a feature they could turn off a
lot of people are making a lot of bundle
over Sri doing this but still you can
choose to turn it off if you want so
make sure you just turn it off if you
consider it a problem for you and as
they're an untethered jailbreak for iOS
5 the answer's no the death teams own
muscle nerd recently tweeted about the
fact that some people are selling the
service called fast rain and according
to fast raiment claims to jailbreak and
bring you an untethered jailbreak to iOS
5 so far first of all the dev team never
charges for their jailbreaks and second
of all they have nothing to do with fast
rain so remember to stay away from these
scams I've actually even been a victim
of these scams in the past so make sure
you don't pay for this stuff at least
unless you buy it on ebay or something
where you can actually have ebay buyer
protection so far the death team has not
released any untethered jailbreak for
iOS 5 whenever they do you make sure
we'll find out and we'll tell you about
in our next video probably that's it for
today's show thank you very much for
watching I'm high memory metal remember
to give us a thumbs up if you liked what
you saw that's it for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
