edu slash now alright hello everybody
and welcome to the weekly brought to you
by pocket now and xda-developers on this
day the 15th of March 2019 all right so
we are moving into a generally new
format for the podcast so we do have a
one big topic to talk to you about
though in this topic this is basically
what I want the show to look like I want
to have one main topic where there are a
bunch of stories I sort of add to that
particular topic but before we get to
that let's have a warm welcome to all of
our guests we had and among last week
aboard network himself thundery but now
we have the old crew back let's start
off with Brandon minimun over there
how's it going Brandon hey it's been a
while there has been a bit yeah it's
good to see everyone's faces again and
then hailing from ok so you had it you
went on an epic rant about Williamsburg
Ville where are you right now I'm
alright a warm welcome back to Jaime
Rivera of course thank you thank you
and then in the booths today is our
producer extraordinaire Jules Wong
well it's been the first time in a long
time that I've gotten on camera and at
this very comfortable angle for me
because you're hunched over my nose cam
and those nook 14 yeah yeah so I just
don't that beat be conscious and stare
at the camera like this every time I
want to talk meanwhile on my end I can
do something like this let me say yeah
oh no it doesn't really count but yeah
never mind I have a lamp in front of me
that like
that like rolls in a rainbow so it would
look kind of funny in front on my face
in any case there were questioned by the
way I'm Joshua Vergara what's going on
everybody
oh you're cursed by request of our
fellow hosts I had I was about to go
into a funny little story about a tweet
that I had made so let's do that so the
other day this is just a great example
of tribalism on the Internet so even on
a very simplistic level I tweeted out I
think it was yesterday that I shouldn't
be reading YouTube comments first thing
in the morning like I do one of those I
do that dumb things though where I wake
up and the first thing I do is go like
this and I start looking at stuff ready
at YouTube comments tweets all that
stuff not the healthiest thing and and I
learned that the hard way yesterday so
like that what I said was that level of
negativity is something that I shouldn't
be having before I even have coffee so
there's already like back and forth the
there's always sides when it comes to
YouTube comments and all that stuff and
I was like I'll take to Twitter people
are responding saying oh yeah I don't
worry about just don't read those things
until you're actually like ready to read
them blah blah blah it's all quit once
we came back and said but aren't you a
tea guy and I was like in a nutshell
right they're just the internet
tribalism just just the tribalism right
there even in a simplistic little tweet
like that and I responded with I do I am
I like coffee too like I'm allowed to
write like you can you can you can do
whatever you want everybody it never has
to be just one side anyway I just wanted
about your brand
now that you've been damned to JB Tech
tea here you're stuck on it and no one
will ever let you go
someone did once say that should be GV
tech coffee and I'm like it doesn't all
the time as well what's wrong with you
anyway I do want to do a quick check-in
with everybody now that we have one main
topic for today we're gonna get into it
there are a few different stories about
this whole idea behind the I want to
call the ultimate demise the ultimate
demise of a phone of a service of a
company because over the last couple of
weeks we've actually had a lot of
examples of it which is kind of odd and
these are all things that people were
excited for but then probably all too
soon they go
by the wayside so before we get into
that topic I want to check in with
Brandon Brandon how have things been
over the last how many weeks has it been
since you've been on like a thousand I
but when we were setting up and having
some back and forth before we hit the
live button I noticed something I may
pick up the phone you're using just show
it to the camera quick which one yeah
that no the white one yeah okay no to
stop the white one or this one
okay Joshua hold up the phone you're
using right in front of you whatever
yeah we've got we are very unoriginal
here yeah look at that oh gee Kouts the
S one this should be a signal to all of
our viewers right now that the s10
content is nearing it's not end but
we're getting employment yeah it's
hitting that peak because we were high
Mae's pocket now review is going to come
out my review on JB is going to come out
and then of course we have some
comparisons the way that we signal that
that is about to happen is there's
another phone and play now I'm actually
using the me 9 after the s10 is done so
I'm actually bringing this thing with me
to China tomorrow so I'll be I'll be
beyond the Great Firewall so everyone
pray for me
Lee uh Jaime how we weren't able to have
you on last week we had a spirited
discussion with with enna bong about
foldables for a while there sorry about
that
I'm currently posting on Instagram that
were alive for people to join Oh God so
what did I miss in that conversation
about foldables because I was the
naysayer that actually ended up becoming
a believer well we had another we did
have another remember what the other
topic of discussion was but I remember
that the last like 20 minutes turned
into all about foldables and I was
missing 10 Elisabet during the chicken
doing the chicken was the last time we
were talking about the wallpapers and
and all that which by the way I know
this because I listened to the podcast
you have to listen to at least four
times before but yeah the though as far
as foldables went I was saying that I'm
not fully convinced yet because the use
case scenarios that I know of foldable
or even a larger
screen could provide we just don't have
the software for that yet it's just not
optimized for it yet so current
applications on a foldable like the mate
X or the Galaxy fold just aren't where
they should be yet so I'm not going to
spend the $1,500 to get one until the
actual experiences match the technology
match the hardware but then you talk to
any bar and he's like spend the $1500
these companies can have a little cash
and then you know what it depends like
the problem is not all companies are
reliable in that department particularly
Apple for example they're like okay
we're gonna charge $17,000 for a watch
and then because people didn't buy it
they're like oh okay $17,000 was a bit
too crazy yeah so that's what I kind of
feel like if the technology is there if
they want to take it to the next level
they need to dock drop the price and so
I feel that consumers I mean you don't
need one so it's like you know why why
spend on it I would be like you know
what companies you figure out you are in
gee if you're spending two three billion
dollars in R&amp;amp;D how about using part of
that to drop the price you know yeah
exactly and then amongst whole thing was
like but just think about think about
the video editing in the gaming and I'm
like yeah you're absolutely right but
we're not there yet we're not even there
yet with these screens just think about
it think about it how good do you think
the gaming is gonna be on a product
that's designed to fold I don't think
the thermal envelope on that thing is
gonna be good
that's a good point why didn't I think
about that things are gonna get hot
who's gonna need it's gonna need to
vapor chambers it's gonna be a hot
product do you think you guys have
gotten so fancy time about thermal
envelopes and vapor chambers you guys
NASA scientists now using thermo omlette
envelopes from Microsoft because they
still got that hotmail going right Jules
thank you well more on that later by the
Brandon he was saying like your thoughts
on foldables because I don't think we
actually spoke to you at length about
foldables after MWC after all that stuff
happened yeah I've seen the
sure and I know what's going to happen
this fold I'm very excited for the
foldable thing because I think like I've
said before there are times where like
you want a small form-factor and there
are times when you want to show grandma
your pictures so to have that all to
have that all in one is amazing but
here's the problem there's a lot of
devices that can do two things there
like a tablet and a laptop like the iPad
pro in some cases if you have the
accessory or the the that thing I sent
you the pixel book Jaime which can fold
around to be a tablet or you can use it
as a laptop the problem with all of
these products is that they're not good
laptops and they're not good tablets
because they're both and I think what's
going to happen with a foldable device
is that it's not going to be a good
phone it's too cumbersome it's too thick
and it's not gonna be a good tablet
because maybe it's gonna be also too
thick but there's going to be a seam in
the middle or some other flaw that makes
makes you think hmmm instead of showing
grandma my pictures on this foldable
tablet I'm just gonna get my real tablet
and instead of using this foldable as my
phone in my pocket I'm just gonna go use
my regular phone so I'm just I'm just
thinking that like these foldable things
are gonna be awesome we're all gonna buy
them we're gonna review them but at the
end of the day they're they're not going
to excel properly in either area they're
trying to be I haven't thought about
that that's a good point so you think
this is the neck the new 3d you remember
the time when 3d came on phones it just
collapsed horribly mmm we have a little
bit of that coming up in a second I mean
to be fair I mean hardware a lot more
aren't even volved with this so they're
gonna try and make this as work out as
much more as much as they can especially
considering how much money is that state
for them so if anything it's going to be
a long and slow death if there is one
mmm yeah all right yeah I I do kind of
do kind of agree with you Brendan I
think they're gonna be a lot of those
users who are still so ingrained in the
way that they use their tech right now
that they're going to keep reverting
back so the main X is actually going to
be a wonderful little centerpiece on a
table for a little while as you still go
back to your
20 Pro or to your Samsung Galaxy if you
have the fold you go back to your
original phone because that's what you
know that's what you understand and
that's what I mean
software needs to catch up with the
hardware before I will buy the hardware
that's what I want first you know and of
course I'm in a privileged position
because potentially I'll be getting a
review unit of it so of course I'm going
to end up using it at some point but
what I actually spend money on it no not
until the software catches up with the
hardware
speaking of catching up with them the
time is up for a lot of companies that
we're gonna talk about okay you brought
up 3d Jaime I want to hear you talk
about the ultimate demise of the
hydrogen one the red hydrogen one that's
what we're gonna start off with did you
ever hold that product no I didn't okay
there was an LA event that I was invited
to I didn't get to go because they said
they weren't going to allow and you want
to take pictures and videos of it as it
turns out I should have because they did
let us and that would have been the only
concept I could ever make of the phone
because now phone doesn't exist well it
does exist but they're there the
reevaluating well it's it's not the
reevaluating they're literally killing
off the project and starting a new one
that's what they're doing so yeah it's
so it's like we it's taken us two years
to realize that we wasted your money and
we wasted your time and we can actually
do this better but we need more time and
so two years two years pretty much
snapdragon 835 dude snapdragon 835 this
was the summer of 2017 and it took a
year if you've read Adam lambs review of
it from head to tail from pre-order to
usage to I mean I think he's actually
returned at this point so it's just been
a rough rough ride for all the people
involved unless unless you are one of
the people user net forums which has
always been a refuge for those for the
believers for the faithful for the fans
because they have been really ginning up
the support and saying what the hell do
these reviewers now Jim is at Jim
Jannard has done these things time and
time again and he's going to prove them
wrong that's basically what we've been
hearing but
you know I mean when we go back to Jim
Jannard statement on this shift he uses
very gilded language you know talks
about you know these things of like the
Molly you may have seen so it started
off with the the taking down of the
module depictions that they had planned
for the original red hydrogen one ran
runs off of pogo pins they took those
drawings down people were concerned for
a little bit and then about like maybe
12 hours later he released a statement
saying say not much of anything at first
glance because it's very it's crazy it's
like something about well we're going to
move on to we're going to have our red
team lead the project now and for those
who want to buy into the project or
something like it doesn't make anything
explicitly clear so it left many people
to infer that okay modules are not going
to appear as they have been promised at
this point and that we're probably going
to have to pay for a new file but okay
so there are a couple of different
companies we're going to talk about in
this in this segment about they clearly
have success in a whole different market
and they want to get into mobile but
then it turns out is it a matter of just
over ambition is it a matter I was
expecting going back to the what I had
started saying I was expecting this to
happen the problem is for the people
that didn't hold or use that red
hydrogen one it's very different for
people to be like but why it looks like
a razor phone I mean it's what's that's
another conversation but it's not until
you use the product that it's you
remember the time of the fire phone
which is also dead it's really right
it's literally it's literally this
one-trick pony that nobody's asking for
the price right in the case of the fire
phone in the case of the red hydrogen
one it was a great idea we have a phone
and we're gonna use this power to create
this modular camera from it it's but the
the problem was why take so long to
the phone why use a processor the
problem with the 8:35 is it didn't have
the spectra processor that the 8:45 or
855 have and so there's so much better
technology in the next two generations
of processor why stick to 835 I you know
they if it took them so long to launch
it they might as well had just use the
8:45 from the start and then the problem
is again this is like telling people
yeah this is this awesome car that you
can buy but the wheels aren't ready
so you can buy the car and leave it in
your garage for now because it's not
really a good car it's just it's a math
car and then you can attach the wheels
whenever we make them and then out of
the blue they're like we're not gonna
make the wheels anymore we're gonna make
a whole new car and we'll let you know
later I've you know I thought the moment
that I held that the product was so
heavy I'm like crap this is DOA all the
way all the while they missed the
fundamentals kind of like the Amazon
fire phone like you said Jaime they
spent so much time working on this
gimmick so it sound cool and look cool
but it just took too much time and too
much cost when they could have just made
a fundamentally good phone that has some
cool stuff to come in the future yeah
and there's a thing like I I find that I
find that the general theme of a lot of
the stuff we're talking about now that
the fundamentals like actually actually
dealing with what users want to deal
with on a daily basis those are not that
level of attention to detail is not
being paid attention to and it's always
about this like huge gimmick like even
LG you could argue that a lot of stuff
that they do are huge gimmicks but the
core experience is still reliable it's
still dope LG really yeah like losing
you yeah I'm telling you right now
using those phones on the daily even if
you were to not use half of the stuff
that they put on there you would still
have a good time the white Engel still
looks pretty good the camera is still
quite good like it's still a good phone
it's still good by the standards this
day is all I'm gonna say is I missed the
LG G 6 for me that was the coolest most
reliable most well-thought-out LG ever
launched and then everything else was
this like blend of experimentation
um that didn't necessarily look good or
work good that's though those are my
feelings on I would even I would even go
before that and say gee for like the
actual curve itself g4 was a great phone
but then yeah yeah yeah going back to
going back to the case of Reb red I feel
so bad you know michael fisher showed it
to me and i'm like oh my god
because i was at the moment that I saw
that he had it I'm like wait a second
these guys didn't read didn't send us a
unit like what that and then he gives it
to me and then I started playing with it
and I'm like oh and so there's actually
a photo of me doing that that Brandon
took at the oneplus event for the
oneplus 60 and you could just see my
expression there where I'm like what oh
I'm like I'm so-and-so Michaels like you
want me to reach out that I'm like no no
just leave it like that
I don't have the time I am we have so
many units to review right now and you
know what I'm I wouldn't use this thing
I just I would not that thing literally
felt like a brick with a screen mmm and
I think I think this is the this this
might be the most hype well not the most
high-profile but this is the one that I
it actually makes me feel a certain way
because I I think we've all been there
Brendon have you ever been in a
situation where someone kind of promises
you something and then like like Jaime
said we're good we're making of this car
the wheels don't work but then before we
even give you the wheels we're gonna
make an entirely new car that you even
like like that's exactly what they're
saying here is that once they transition
to a whole new system all the people who
bought the original red hydrogen-1 are
going to be quote unquote taking care of
them just like that just doesn't like
wow why would you put your faith in that
kind of nebulous statement that never
works that never works I you know I I
don't know yeah thoughts on that last
one these it's a lot it really comes
down to expectation I think like read
such a good company that people thought
well you know they make the you know
world-class camera equipment and then
they they make their phone launch so
dramatic and people's expectations are
like this is the company that should be
should should have been making a phone
they know imaging this is going to be
the ultimate and
we get a phone that has a gimmicky lacks
the fundamentals and doesn't deliver on
its core promise and you know here are
the expectations and here's what they
actually delivered and it's just so
disappointing
ya know what's the most disappointing
for me as a communication student is the
fact that there has just been poor
messaging all the way through like we're
in lanes review we saw that there was a
communication from the team but through
this weird French email that may have
had something to do the company but I
was like all factor doesn't like info
dash dot whatever the heck I hope it to
simple's and Adam had asked me wait are
you serious
and then yeah but put your info down on
this Google form and Wow
and like I'm looking at the updates that
Jim Jannard the founder of red here has
posted since his original announcement
you know he admits that from the outset
that well I understand that my original
post was a bit cryptic and and then
talks about in the absence of clear
messaging the crowd goes crazy trying to
fill in the blanks well hmm what
solution did I had in crowds fault just
freaking give us a clear message it's
not the crowds fault
no it's not when you use marketing terms
like obsolescence obsolete but what does
that really mean yeah exactly
I was just we had that phrase and right
above it like is the whole idea that he
said as I have said before everything
can and will change like what do you
suppose that mean what does that even
mean this is fire festival language like
the first actual PR firm you know they
emailed out just like saying hey we're
taking over there so so much passion
from Jules I you froze microphone is
already freezing he broke but that's
okay so we started off with red and that
and that one is an example of and it's
hard to talk about right in that way
because I mean obviously there are so
many people who love a lot of the
products I mean obviously to make great
cameras do all their Josas
but I think what we can do then is like
shift from this like weird messaging
from red to a little bit more of an
official type of of shift and that would
be over to Razer I don't know
God actually you know what I was in such
a hurry to get to my office so that we
could do the cast I forgot to bring my
razor phone - I wanted to pour some out
for it like does anybody else feel as
sad as I do that the razor phone which
basically started the gaming phone
category is now potentially going to be
no more according to the story which
again this is not from this past week
but this is an example over the last
couple of weeks last few weeks I'm a you
broke the story on the daily that
essentially the Singapore based firm has
laid off most of its phone division and
cancelled the third edition of the razor
phone series I was sad when I heard that
on the daily and I'm still sad about it
now like I actually had a lot of high
hopes for the razor phone itself how
does everybody else feel somebody's
calling and I cameo at it so somebody
else starts yeah I'll take a stab uh I'm
not surprised at this at all because you
take a phone that doesn't have a huge
marketing spend and it's it's do a you
take a phone with a different design
that isn't sexy or dramatic that people
can lust over and it's do a you make a
phone that's low volume it's very niche
for targeted at gamers or vloggers or
small phone enthusiasts and it's do a
it's just it's just not I mean it's not
surprising that these very niche phones
are just not going to work which is why
I like Samsung phones that present
beautifully in the store that have that
are on trend big screens color options
so many cameras you can't even count
them anymore those are the phones that
sell millions and create tremendous
profits for these sustainable companies
with these small players such as red and
such as Razer making these niche devices
they don't stand a chance
and it's it's unfortunate because we
like to see differentiation in our
industry and it gets exciting when we
see something finally different pop up
cameras all kinds of different display
technologies and functionality but these
products aren't going to go on to sell
enough units to become viable and
sustainable
Dover engine fields so when razor
announced their first like earnings
report after the well they went public
like a year ago or something like that
but you have to keep in mind that these
are diversified companies that are just
dabbling into the smartphone field razor
doesn't make its money off of phones it
makes its money off of mouses of these
mice keyboards and chairs and all those
other peripherals that gamers want and I
think phones were just a natural
extension of that he kind of dipped into
it they had a trend budget that had they
had to spend for research development
manufacturing I think manufacturing
partnerships were already formed with
their other businesses going on so that
saved in some money but you know they
said 18,000 units or well I did that was
derived from the actual figure the money
figure that they reported and I think it
was something like 18,000 units which is
I mean for a company first time serving
a small niche I don't think that's
necessarily bad I think and they said
you know they were showing promising
signs of growth but yeah and we but
since then we haven't had word which is
probably a bad sign of any performance
metrics for the reason for them to but
even then you know I think this has more
to do with razor as a company razor as
you know trying to get a profit track
going here again they went public last
year they had an IPO they now have
shareholders so this is a it's a little
sad to see something like this go by the
wayside when this is a company that
could afford to continue the project I
feel I'll tell you I'll tell you this
much for me in the case of the razor
phone
it's um I had a really well I have a
really good relationship with the when
you know one of the founders in CEO and
and who was the CEO of next bit who was
absorbed by raiser for this project um
and you know we we had a lot we had lots
of conversations but in one of them it's
like like I did believe in the next bit
project let's do a phone that's more
cloud centric I feel that the phone
missed a few things but the whole
concept was a good idea um the problem
is when you don't know when you don't
have enough budget to nurture the
project enough I'll give you an example
one plus there one plus one two three
they were me it wasn't until the one
plus five that things were like okay
this is now a phone that I'm willing to
recommend and if companies are not
willing the problem when you have a
market like the smartphone market is
it's very cutthroat profits are very low
it's like if you asked me if if if you
had ten million dollars when you build
an airline I'd be like no that's the
stupidest thing because you're operating
ratio is too high and so it's the same
with smartphones and you don't do a
Xiaomi where you own the store or if you
don't have more assets than just the
hardware it's very difficult for you to
win unless you're willing to throw money
at it and so here you have a product
that I think it's a good idea having a
gaming phone but like I said in my
review the problem is not the idea
it's the games you know smartphone games
aren't really great and then and then
I'm like oh shoot I remember what you
know we we're in LA we're at the event
and they're like we've got a controller
and I'm like yes okay fine this is what
I needed to become a mobile gamer I
needed a controller and then I get the
controller and I connect it and it works
like trash with my father and so it's
like wait a second I mean you're the
guys that get the mice right and the
chairs right and the keyboards right but
you're you know what you're being held
by a problem and the problem is not
razor the problem is called Android the
problem is Android gaming it doesn't
matter if you have a one plus sixty or a
razor phone
to the game
the experience is the same and it
shouldn't be that way yeah it should not
be that way
there should be games that cater better
to the concept of having a more powerful
phone or a phone that's better designed
for something or the peripherals that
will bring the experience to the next
level the problem is when you have
companies like Nintendo cave in and give
you a Super Mario run because they
realize that if they give you the same
experience as if you were gaming in a
console the game wouldn't play well you
just people just wouldn't enjoy the
process because you're using a screen
and not buttons and so I I was really
hoping that razor in a soos would force
Google you know be like okay you know
what we need better games we need you
know we need for the developer community
to have better tools and we've seen it
with you know in the case of Apple with
metal and with everything but the
problem is again it's the form factor
why is this why is the Nintendo switch
such a hit it's not just the indie games
but it's the overall experience of using
the switch and it's what I asked who did
I ask this to by the way Josh I don't
remember but I'm like what is the
difference between a switch
hardware-wise
and an android phone nothing nothing
from a from a power standpoint they're
literally almost the same thing
the problem is the operating systems and
it's a platform issue - it's a platform
issue it is totally a platform issue I'm
testing Android Q out right now and but
the trend is like with Google is has
been that they've been walking down more
api's they've been putting more of them
onto a blackness so that if you're
targeting a certain level of Android you
know certain Android version you can't
use these api's anymore you have to use
these api's and I feel like there's
going to be there's not enough what they
can do these gaming publishers that you
know can they do this and that and not
into it upon background process limits
that they have to conform to it's a lot
of I think unseen debate that we have to
like consider when it comes to these
sorts of things because Google has been
cracking down for the sake of privacy
for the sake of power savings
and that does not cut with the jib of
these you know more advanced gaming
features so well I think I probably and
you mentioned next bit earlier we
actually had a comment let me pull it up
real quick I think it was one of our one
of our regulars in the chat where is it
Steve Deroche it's the official death of
next bit sad yeah that is sad because I
remember just how cool next bit and just
as just in terms of a device was was
cool and then razor found a way to sort
of the elongate that that life cycle I
personally think like to go back to your
whole idea Brandon about the phone being
DOA I don't think it was DOA I think it
was ahead of its time to be honest like
the razor phone wasn't have AC yeah I
think the razor phone basically
introduced all of these other companies
or maybe put them on notice that game
was going to be the next big frontier
all of the enhancements in phones like
this galaxy s 10 plus which by the way
is the only one of the three that has
vapor cooling those enhancements those
advancements I should say are due in
part to razor making it clear gaming is
a thing on a phone and you're right I
made that like I was saying earlier
about foldables the software has to
match the hardware and right now the
software is Android so it's not the best
thing but there are good but one thing I
would love razor to do is to go by way
of Sega where they don't actually create
the apparatus by which everyone does
gaming on Android maybe they create all
of the supports products they actually
put in a lot of their R&amp;amp;D into making
the best controller they make the best
peripherals to make the best accessories
to make Android gaming that much better
for example let's say that let's say
this what was the name of that one
product that was supposed to be like an
Android gaming console oh the shield
Nvidia
oh no shield but there's another one
there was like the crowd everyone hated
yeah yeah oh yeah oh yeah yeah that
actually you know how much you know how
great razor could be at creating their
own whoo yeah where this particular
little console like device a lot like
the shield but the problem with the
shield was that they still focus on
having other Android features
all the way like take away all of the
strip Android to its base level so that
it is only a gaming console and then you
put in the work it's actually make those
experiences work for your peripherals
for your controllers and for your
accessories but that's what I think
raisin could totally do that we've seen
it but the problem is we've seen it dude
like we've seen it with a shoot the SP
the ZT the s pro - we've seen it in
projectors we saw experimentation with
televisions we've seen people trying to
use it in smartwatches
heck we even saw Vinci trying to use
Android and a pair of headphones the
problem is you know and Brandon you're
you're probably the most qualified
person to confirm this but if I if I if
I understand correctly apps and games on
Android erster are still emulated
correct what do you mean so to my
understanding anything that runs on
Android is not really native it's all
emulated I see I don't know if that's
the case anymore
it might have been the case or in
earlier versions of Android but I don't
think that's true anymore I think a lot
of the Android runtime I whatever the
quote but that's the thing it's like hey
I do understand now why Google is trying
to come up with fusia which is actually
another conversation but why we're
looking for alternatives for Android
because there are a lot of limits
patience um and I feel that Android is
the best platform and I feel that it's
the best ecosystem to get something like
this done it's just where how do we make
the jump towards it we've seen companies
use Android completely forked and come
up with some really cool things we've
seen it from Amazon um no but yeah I
feel I feel that you're right Josh it's
just the question is who is willing to
invest more than two generations of a
product and giving it a try
because there there is no there is no
case I don't think there has been a case
of a company that's launched the product
and has succeeded in generation 2 I
don't think there has been what
operating system does the Nintendo
switch run on their own it's proprietor
fully proprietor so there's a product
there's a product that was built from
the ground up
with every piece of software every piece
of hardware conceived for one purpose
from the very bottom to the very top
it's been very successful because of
that end to end its just gaming and
exactly exactly whereas whereas when you
try to convert a phone into a gaming
product still an Android phone that can
play games with some fancy tricks
exactly but then you know if I tell my
son to try to play fortnight on his
Galaxy S whatever he's gonna be like no
I need a controller I need a mouse
I need a keyboard I need a screen it's
different if you want to be really good
at these hardcore games you need more
peripherals than just a screen it
doesn't work that way yeah I totally get
the whole gaming on Android thing but
have you ever decided to put Chrome OS
on an Intel chipset that's very much
powerful and more than what you would
ever need oh my god you want to talk
about the pixel slate and I could tell
you more about that we are running into
out here so I'm just like okay fair
enough making sure all right so oh this
is actually the wrong story that I have
pulled up on the topic of gaming just
one last thing I wanted to put in like a
I do think that there should be
standardization of at least certain
layers of the gaming of the gaming
experience on Android and at the very
least that should be input in
controllers so like if there could be a
standardization then Razer could go by
way of steak and actually create the
products that support the gaming
experience so but then again they're
getting the software has to catch up
with the hardware and that's exactly why
the Razer phone I think I will say this
I think Razer is pulling out of the game
too quickly I feel that there is a
future I feel that they should have just
pursued it harder and that they
shouldn't have does he have the money
they have the money - exactly that's
exactly
they shouldn't have just assumed that oh
because we're not having the same
success and that's the problem when you
have public companies you know the you
know the problem of public companies is
they have to look good in front of
investors and so you know sometimes they
have to make decisions like these just
to continue looking good and firm in
front of investors there were makers
capitalism's
I I didn't I didn't hear that okay I'll
give you an example of the complete
opposite Huawei Huawei is a private
company they don't have to look good in
front of anybody
and so they are willing to nurture ideas
for the long term and that depends on oh
you know what actually that was the
topic that that in a bong I were talking
about last week was hallway anyway sorry
they do have to look good in from the
Chinese government there and verify or
confirm that jewels but you can't verify
or confirm that jewels it'll make the
Facebook knows if you disappear in the
next ten minutes we know why you're
using it 14 but the point being is
that's that's the advantage when you
have private companies like that's how
GoPro got started that's how many so
once you involve the stock market your
time to nurture products is gone you
have to always look good and that's it
and that's a problem yeah I can see that
happening all right so before we get too
far into that our next one has to do
with products not necessarily one okay
we are talking about products but in
terms of Google speaking of a company
that has so much money to invest no is
nothing in the Google yeah I'd like to
say the speaking of a company that has
so much money to be able to invest into
like certain core markets tablets and in
this case the pixel slate I actually
never got to review one
I heard mixed vu it there you go
I heard very mixed feelings about it so
what would you use problem with this
thing okay so the okay so in the case of
the iPad pro when it launched a twelve
point nine inch the biggest question
that everybody asked is why like why is
this product so big and it and it's not
until I met a cartoon artist that I
realized that he he loves his iPad pro
twelve point nine mainly because of the
size of the canvas and because that
Apple pencil is such a great tool for
you to draw and so
he loves it according to him that's the
reason why you need a large canvas and
so there's a there's a niche for that
product to exist the pixel slate you
know dude this is a very expensive
Chromebook like every pixel product and
so it's it's like when cool when Google
launched the Chromebook pixel and price
that had $1000 uh and and and and they
just continued that trend and it wasn't
until they launched the pixel book that
it was like oh my god this thing is
expensive but it's so light it's so good
it's so well done and it plays so well
shoot it's actually a really good
computer the only problem is it's a
Chromebook but then they come up with a
pixel slate and it was a very bad tablet
in a very bad laptop and then once she
added the price of the keyboard plus the
the pen plus the fact that they launched
this version that was $600 with an Intel
Celeron and I love so I love that
marques didn't get a unit he well I
don't know if he got a unit but he
actually bought the entry-level Celeron
version and his review is like you don't
use the it's not usable like you can't
run anything on it
it's literally janky and just about
everything and so think about it
$600 for an unusable tablet on one end
or 750 for an iPad pro what are you
gonna pay for yeah and it's way more
fleshed out the iPad so it's it's just a
more mature product and so I think that
Google reached the great point with the
pixel book I was really looking forward
to a pixel but - and and they launched
this late and I'm like okay fine if it's
got the quality of the pixel book but
it's his tablet sure but then I was too
large and the experience was just too
cumbersome like dude from the design of
it a lot of things were wrong well just
it just didn't make sense the product
just did not make sense you couldn't
attach the pen anywhere the keyboard
case the 20 dollar keyboard case is
probably like I have never in my history
of reviewing products I have never in
front of the camera said don't buy this
it was the first time that I'm like do
not do not buy this it's I've never seen
you so passionately just like a product
it's just
problem is the problem is when you're
liking more than the red this is even
more than the red so listen and I feel
so bad because I because when I saw the
product that the event I liked it when I
received it it's like because I received
the higher tier core i5 my product is
not really that bad it's just the moment
that I would reach that I reach Hawaii
and I'm like okay this is what I'm gonna
start using this product and so I go to
the event I snap on the keyboard and I
place it on my lap and Michael Fisher
sitting beside me and the thing just
kept falling off because of the design
of the keyboard and Michael and Michael
is looking at me looking at me and he's
like yeah dude that's the problem of a
short people it's it's hilarious that he
actually included that in his review but
it's just it's regardless I mean it's
such a it's such a good idea very badly
implemented so okay in the dichotomy
between tablets and laptops it clearly
tablets or the big culprit here right
because like Chromebooks actually so
pretty well though like when you look at
those Chromebooks they actually
someone's sure yeah because they are fit
for their design they are priced well
they just get you by and like that you
can easily distribute them throughout
schools literally like the Chromebook is
by buying a power drill it'll say it'll
always help you it's a tool it's pretty
much a tool and it's priced as a tool
it's not priced aggressively or anything
it's $200 $300 I don't mind buying that
for my kids I'm fine with that it's just
and so here's the problem and this is
the reason why my review is just I'm
like I really want to love this product
because I feel that this is the future
of tablets what is my biggest complaint
with iPads it's the lack of a good
browser it's the fact that for
absolutely every hard core thing that I
want to do I need to launch an app and
apps are not necessarily the best
experiences in certain cases sometimes I
just want a good web browser to connect
to my bank and I can't and so if I'm
using an iPad I can't connect to my bank
for a lot of things even if there's an
app and so wow I'm like this is a great
idea a tablet with a full Chrome browser
I'm done I want this and then I use it
and I'm like oh god no there's a lot of
miss fitting going around in Google
because I think
harder there Hardware week vp r a
Costello coming from Motorola and has
been there for the past three years
doesn't great things in terms of making
up the pixel team in terms of building
everything up for them and I feel like
the tablet and the laptop division has
really been just sandbox like they've
been making castles and but they don't
really much else purpose for them other
than for like a bully to stomp on them
that's a good way to put a joules
definitely because these products don't
get me wrong the pixel like if you asked
me if anybody wants to buy a high-end
Chromebook I'd be like the pixel book
man it's a great product it's hilarious
how much better the pixel book performs
than the pixel slate I just I don't get
it yeah well it's those very teams the
employees responsible for R&amp;amp;D and
manufacturing of those products has been
cut by dozens over the last couple of
weeks
they've just been asked to move to a
separate they go somewhere that also
means that the portfolio is gonna be
pared down that's the thing though like
like future products are going to be
affected by this it's the fact that this
whole team so we don't know if we're
going to see like pixel book 2 or pixel
slate 2 which you know it's it's it's
it's another one of those things where
like you were saying with razor high
made like you have to actually invest in
these kinds of things you know and
fuchsia OSU did mention for a second few
OS was supposed to be potentially the
next step in that and actually creating
an operating system that actually that
actually had heat that not here's that
actually matches the hardware yeah a
decent cohesive and I feel like they've
been doing and many tests on many
different sorts of hardware not even
from their own tablets and whatnot
they've been loading feature us to other
bio C's in other devices so I mean it's
gonna be interesting see week 1 between
we truly need like I have all credit
goes to like Chrome OS and all that for
performing the way that it has I mean
like we said Chromebooks do tend to sell
pretty well especially when they're
cheap enough but like we definitely need
an experience now where it's like a
laptop or a tablet that converts into a
laptop that basically has this same
level of functionality that Android has
that we enjoy in our phones but it's
just blown up to
top experience like III remember remix
OS I remember there was supposed to be
like even Android apps are supposed to
work in Chrome OS I don't know if all of
them are supposed to at this point but I
mean I know that they were moving in
that direction that has to be a thing
now I honestly if these tablets and and
laptops are going to be successful I
think that just has to be the next step
personally I Brandon you've been quiet
you don't you didn't like it either no
I'm just listening yeah there's
definitely some future whereby there's a
there's a convergence between a desktop
like Chrome OS environment with Android
apps alongside of it and I think you
know the Android Q Developer Preview is
out and Jules you're using it I don't
know if you had a chance to mess around
with the desktop mode built into it
unfortunately that no it's super
interesting to see Samsung go hard into
this desktop mode thing with Dex and
while we go super hardcore into this
desktop mode with whatever what their
thing is called like huawei home Dex
backwards yeah and then and then
Google's baking it directly into the
operating system we're clearly a lot of
these really big companies see a future
where by the phone can create a desktop
like environment while also having the
phone experience alongside it so I think
it's it's you know we haven't really
figured it out yet but the pieces are
there where you have like a task bar
along the bottom and potentially a full
desktop browser which for most people is
really all you need to get the work done
that you need yes my feeling sorry sorry
my feeling is exactly that light enough
so that you could make it into the
operating system but yeah it only does
it only goes so far
so yeah yeah and and and like it
defaults back to a phone first form
factor but if you if you're in the hotel
room or if you have a mouse and keyboard
but you forgot your laptop at the office
or whatever you you dock it or you plug
it in or you you do wireless
broadcasting to your display and you get
a pseudo desktop like experience running
all from your phone
and we've been talking about this for a
very long time with continuum and so
many other concepts the funny part is
might tell my TV and my monitor have had
an HDMI to USBC cable connected to them
since the huawei mate when made 20
people came out which was like now you
can do it wirelessly but ever since the
may 10 Pro asked me how many times I've
used them just wants to try it out and
then you're like what the heck oh I
don't think I even tried it out man it's
it's it's just the problem is so I
really like that project Linda from
Razer were you attach the the phone into
the the laptop at reddit and it becomes
the trackpad I think but how are they
gonna make that without the razor phone
and so we could we go back to the
concept of the asou spat phone I we we
love that concept and we praised it for
so long and these projects died these
projects just died because they bring
it's like listen it's like my
perspective on VR I love what it can do
I just hate the process to get it done I
hate the setup process and I think that
the most consumers feel the same way if
it's not something that you can do
quickly immediately know most people are
gonna try it out initially and then
they're not gonna care yeah I mean if
you're gonna be like okay I need my
specific USB C to HDMI output adapter
and then I need to find my dongle for my
keyboard and I need the mouse thing too
so you have like you just spent 15 20
minutes setting up this environment when
your laptop is like right there on the
table and you could just open your
laptop and you know there you exactly
which is exactly my point all of these
all of these ways of connecting a phone
to like yeah that's exactly right like
okay Dex is a thing I need a monitor
yeah like so that's all I'm saying is
like stop trying to make this the the
centerpiece of the entire experience and
just create an operating system that
actually works on a tablet works on the
laptop that actually has like we say
continuum
like that's that's that that should be
the goal here but again it's the lack of
investment in the actual fundamentals of
it
and then there's the problem with the
implementation of apps it's like for
example one note on like I tried with
the with the Samsung Galaxy Tab s for I
tried with a pixel book with the pixel
slate you know you the use of Android
apps on Chromebooks a lot of these
Android apps are like hit or miss dude
like for example you can't select text
correctly on OneNote you can't do
certain things and it's like like that's
the problem it's just Google controls so
little of the process that it just
becomes up for grabs and just so much
opportunity for failure if there are too
many hands involved in a process it's
gonna collapse
wellhere's that's it comes a segue
Google head right no Google had all of
the control in the world on a low what
happened there I don't think we're going
to allow God did any of you use a low I
mean I used it once because Adam dad
forced me to try it out um I did the
head that video it was again something
that was ahead of its time I have to say
I'm sorry I lose a head of mallow okay
so
allô allô this is another one of those
things weird like there's there's that
just there's that fragment is a
fragmentation that's the term right
there's like there's there the ecosystem
is so fragmented yeah hang out you have
a low and now there's is there like
hangouts meet hangouts work like there's
so many different versions of the same
like function and that's life right so
like I had a couple conversations on
Twitter the other day after I said like
oh now alo doesn't work and I felt I
actually felt kind of sad about it too
because I did use alum for quite a while
was a way that I actually communicated
with a lot of my co-workers back in the
day but the the thing is that allo
actually had a lot of the features that
we wish more messaging services had like
the voice messaging that now even
Brandon you and I use it now on
messenger because I'm a got all of us
addicted to using it on what's that oh
it's too cool to press that microphone
and record your voice like a
walkie-talkie that is cool
that is cool Jaime like yeah he
introduced me to that when he came to
visit he was communicating with Diego
and he speaks you know as fast as I
can't understand in Spanish and he's
just like boom boom boom back and forth
and I'm like wow that's brilliant and
then Josh started doing that with me
it's just it's brilliant like if you're
in New York and you're carrying a lot of
gear in one hand you can't be walking
down the street typing dude it's just it
doesn't it's it's the worst and so I
love voice messaging like in Latin
America that's the thing and I why it's
like it's funny whenever Jules tries to
talk to me on a hangouts or whenever
people try to talk to you at hangouts
I'm like if it doesn't have voice I'm
not using it because I don't have time I
just I don't have time to stop put my
freaking backpack down and respond to
your damn message I just I don't know if
you're if you're in a tradeshow
I don't oh that's true so that's the
thing that was that was like that was
the use case scenario that made it very
clear to me this is a useful feature and
my point here is that when a lo came out
it was one of the few that had voice
messaging like voice messaging was a
whatsapp thing yeah it was a whatsapp
thing it was a WeChat thing yeah and
then messenger finally put it in not too
long after we started seeing in more
places instagram has it now you can even
use it in Instagram DMS like yes that's
how much it's become a feature and then
there's another feature now though that
I thought was really funny uh first of
all being able to talk to Google
assistant I mean that was one thing that
was kind of funny but my favorite one
that I think maybe one day we'll see it
in whatsapp and I would love for this to
happen but it's a little bit silly but
that's the reason why I loved it when
you type something and then you press
and hold on the send button and drag up
and down to make it bigger or smaller
that made for hilarious conversations
like like when I would talk to let's say
David Amell because he and I are in he
and I talk all the time on messenger but
on a low way
and David when I would say something
like when we were at CES one time
together I was like hey I think I'm
actually gonna drink tonight it would be
small text of Josh please know that kind
of stuff is fine and it's funny and it
adds to the conversation which is why
honestly I'm a little I'm a little sad
that a lo my god I'm not let it go say
something about can I just say something
about the reason why products die okay
God okay when you have established
players and this has is completely
irrelevant but it's just this like I
have been used to so by the way my eg PU
is about to arrive it's eight stops away
so so I was away okay so how do I know
this I can actually see where my
packages on the map because lately
Amazon is not using they're not using
UPS they're not using UPS USPS or FedEx
now they're using their own delivery
service and so what was my biggest
problem I never know when FedEx is gonna
stop by I know UPS is here at 10 a.m.
sharp
but USPS and FedEx know but now with
their with by them using their own
delivery service I know exactly where
the product is on a map how cool is this
and then they take they take a picture
of the product and show you where they
placed it if they actually deliver it to
the right address which usually they
don't but when they do to the right
address you could be like oh they put at
the front door oh they put it the garage
because you get a notification that says
here's what it looks like so it's so let
me ask you this how much I used to work
in UPS how much business are they losing
right now how much think about it how
much is it for Amazon to launch their
own airline their own delivery service
into the delivery in a place as complex
as New York and to give me a far better
service than every other of the carriers
where that's their business that's what
they're good at they're good at these
information things it's not Amazon's
business to show me where my packages
and yet they do it better than the
companies that are dedicated to doing it
and you walk into Whole Foods and it's
got all this practicality because you're
a prime
temir see this this is the reason why
other companies die because they want
something good and they're not willing
to invest more in R&amp;amp;D or they're not
willing to nurture their product and
think of more cool things or as you have
a company as Amazon that's acid recive
as I want it to be lame I'm not gonna
lie I used to like you remember in Vegas
I was like yeah let's lose you let's use
an Amazon locker because I don't know
when they're good when they're gonna
drop the product but whose idea was it
Amazon and now would this have you read
the book the innovators dilemma I
recommended you to buy the book yeah
it's ignoring scribing the innovators
dilemma exactly they do something
awesome in the beginning and they
stopped like innovating and then other
companies come in build something from
the ground up that's so much better and
just eat their lunch I want I want to
hear from the Concord innovators of a
low from the beginning when because I
remember that Google i/o when this was
announced and everyone was like a
low-end duo interesting like you know
cool like we're gonna have a unified
messaging service and then they double
down on hangouts google hangouts
freaking what Google Voice that that
integration I mean Google you know prom
with Google is Google itself they have
it's like Project find all these things
a lot of things in Google started
project they are allowed a certain
amount of time for these projects to
develop during projects yep
and and then once the project is
successful they'll continue with it if
not then they'll kill it the promise
when you have four messaging platforms
that confuse users yeah and I think I
think in the beginning it was an IDE see
what Google needs to stop doing when it
comes to why am i holding stop doing is
proving concepts after they prove the
concept they have to continue the
concept like that's what they gotta do
because I was so that's what Allah was
in the beginning whenever commenters
just said I used Alaa when it was the
only place that assistant lived on
that's exactly what it was it was a way
of proving that Google assistant was a
thing that it was going to be successful
now Google assistant is great alo though
left by the wayside
I guess it's it's really a it's really a
sad thing and I think it's kind of a
weird way for us to have like this
entire show
we're talking about what I call the
ultimate demise but even then we know
why it's because of lack of investment
so that's really what it is so on that
oddly somber note we're gonna go ahead
and call it on this one thank you so
much for listening to the weekly we
certainly want to be making this show if
