operating system is here so let's not
wallow in the malo I'm jewels wrong with
pocket now at double D ers with your
first official look at Android 6.0
marshmallow Android number six was
pushed to developers today through sdk
developer which we flashed on to our
nexus 9 other nexuses OTAs are rolling
out as of this video so while we're
pretty sure what we have is what you'll
get we do have a tablet here as opposed
to a smartphone also bugs because that's
what you get with dotto software so keep
that in mind there's been a big enough
deal made about the volume sliders and
sure enough they're here in addition to
the designation Hughes and the return of
push to science there's actually a bit
of sophistication that last one its push
to do not disturb do not disturb is also
available from the pulldown toggles to
but the essence from either point is the
same it can have set a time limit or
permanence of a practical sort to
silencing notifications if you want to
fiddle with what apps get the thumbs up
for heads up you can now set specific
applications to be on your priority list
in addition to colors textures emailers
those types and while we're talking
about apps those granular permissions
we've been talking about are here for
the most part you don't deal with them
on install but you do get prompted on
first applicable occurrence in the case
of some other apps though like Facebook
well the old rules apply like handling
preferences / app are available here and
if you prefer dolphin for Flipboard
links and opera for YouTube ones for
some reason google now on tab is also
being hoisted as one of the masts of the
good ship marshmallow the search engine
takes a screenshot of what's happening
and uses its images algorithms to pick
out what's going on and what you want to
know call listen watch navigate stuff
like that if you want to know what the
heck and image is just ask google now ok
Google what's that picture
pictures of 38
it's not bad also not bad is highlight
scrubbing text with the chucking of
words going forward and letter by letter
edits backwards if you want to get sad
about something it's what's not here
there's no dual pane app running there's
no material dark theme that we've wanted
for a long time and there's nothing you
can do about the change in hardwood
standards and we can't be sure about
improved power maintenance during idle
we need more time to doze in order to
find that out but we'll have more
coverage of Android 6.0 marshmallow and
the first devices to grace the OS
including the Nexus 5x and the Nexus 6p
to know how soon reviews will come hit
follow like subscribe do what you need
to want puckett now's social media
shores also there's pocketnow.com of
course for the team here at Pocket now
I'm Jules long at greenpoint zero on
Twitter more from us later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
