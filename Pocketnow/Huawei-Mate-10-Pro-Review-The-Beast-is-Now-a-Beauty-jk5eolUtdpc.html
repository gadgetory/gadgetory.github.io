newest flagship has reinforced our first
impressions this just might be the most
attractive phone of 2017 over that time
though we have more to report on what
it's like to actually use the phone the
mate name carries a reputation for power
user performance does this phone live up
to that reputation here's our full
huawei mate 10 Pro review Huawei has
done an excellent job transitioning to a
2x1 aspect ratio display while
maintaining a familiar design language
not all companies migrated to glass as
gracefully no piece is out of place
balancing the camera tech and the
fingerprint sensor with terrific
symmetry in a band that recalls phones
like the Nexus 6p in the Nova I really
wished the pixel had felt like this
combined with a contrast II and
saturated AMOLED screen there's a lot of
eye candy for the consumer that display
by the way is respectably readable in
all but direct sunlight and the
resolution is perfectly fine for daily
operation 2160 by 1080 is similar to the
lower resolution mode samsung employs on
galaxies out of the box though I
personally prefer disabling the super
juicy saturated modes from design to
hardware this phone represents a few
controversial decisions the shift to a
glass back does not come with wireless
charging the pro omits a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack which is a real bummer
but I'm very happy to see the inclusion
of an IR blaster and for a pro device I
do appreciate dual SIM card support but
would have liked the ability to add more
storage with a memory card in daily
operation it's difficult to quantify how
these hardware choices have affected my
use the most obvious is hunting for an
underwhelming adapter for my favorite
headphones that's annoying it's still a
bit too early to tell if the storage
will eventually bother me as I generally
prefer phones with SD card support but
128 gigabytes of built-in space takes a
while to fill up I never did max out the
p10 plus even while shooting a lot of 4k
video happily we can point to a killer
hardware combo of chipset and RAM
the Karen 970 is a fantastic brain for
this beast it's rare to find a phone
this heavily skinned which performs and
multitasks is fluidly we all hope for
snappy and responsive this phone
delivers what's interesting is that the
raw power on tap doesn't seem to be
substantially different from the cure in
960 it replaces which shouldn't be
concerning as the 960 was months ahead
of Qualcomm in delivering snapdragon 835
level power a subtle bump to be sure but
the die shrink delivers a noticeable
improvement to battery life over the
mate nine we get the benefit of a big
battery capacity and more efficient
internals we lack wireless charging but
still benefit greatly from Huawei super
charger this is one of the fastest
phones to top off we've ever reviewed no
small feat considering the larger
battery capacity the pro easily lasted
me the day with plenty of juice to spare
and a short stint on a charger delivers
a lot of additional runtime we're fairly
far removed from stock Android though
Huawei is bridging the improvements
found in Oreo with their own blend of
custom controls I can't say I'm a huge
fan of things like knuckle actions but
pulling the notification shade from the
fingerprint sensor is a fan favorite and
the settings menu is a little better
organized than on previous Huawei's
Huawei has publicly committed to two
years of software support with at least
one major operating system update
considering how well our mate 9 is aged
we have some confidence that the May 10
will be well cared for over the average
length of time someone might keep their
phone one of the bigger talking points
for the mate the inclusion of a neural
processing unit NPU a custom piece of
hardware designed to offload certain
tasks on the phone without having to
push information up to a cloud server
it's responsible for context-aware smart
tips like when to activate the blue
light filter allocating phone resources
to commonly used apps and handling noise
reduction when taking calls which
sounded just fine to my ears
a more visible application on device
language translation which works speedy
quick with microsoft's translator app
there's a lot of potential here which
we'll have to revisit as Huawei is
promising NPU support for
Google's a our core augmented reality
and Google's own neural network ap is in
addition to eventually supporting Google
Translate sometime next year while the
karin 970 likely won't become a top
priority for developers to code for
specifically Huawei does seem to be
branching their hardware out to support
more accessible standards that NPU also
plays a part in how the camera functions
as image recognition is baked directly
into the photography experience we
retained the Leica designed dual sensors
12 and 20 megapixel sensors respectively
color and monochrome and when shooting
JPEGs data from both are merged for a
wonderful contrast II colorful and
vibrant photography aesthetic this is a
photographic flavor we don't often see
from a phone it's difficult to say what
the npu might be doing to image
processing but the subject acquisition
and recognition is near-instant
low-light performance is also excellent
but some folks might be turned off by
grainier output Leica engineers they're
not afraid of some noise and there's an
obvious effort in low-light shots to
preserve image detail over making the
smoothest possible plasticky photo they
consider this a feature not a bug if you
like a little texture in your shots
you'll really enjoy what this camera can
do when shooting auto Huawei also
continues to deliver my favorite version
of a portrait mode though this is a
little confusing to discuss on the May
10 there's a wide aperture mode which
produces a user controlled background
blur and the Huawei version of portrait
mode adds a beauty filter to the rear
camera the mates wide aperture mode over
Samsung and Apple's portrait mode using
the main camera sensors full field of
view it doesn't crop in as severely
because it's a larger sensor than a zoom
sensor there aren't any restrictions to
using this effect at night it's a much
closer competitor in that respect to the
pixels portrait mode but with better
controls on the back end to dial in the
amount of blur you want Huawei's video
is nicely improved over the mate 9 and P
10 with a subtle but noticeable upgrade
to image stabilization it's awesome
worth repeating that Huawei was well
ahead of the curve for h.265 video
compression
which means high quality 4k videos are
much closer in size to many other phones
high quality 1080p videos this was
painful for some folks last year but now
that Apple is using HEV C compression
Google seems much more interested in
supporting this codec so kudos to Apple
Google photos and YouTube work well and
folks who want to edit this codec is
finding more support by the day even
power directors Android app supports it
without having to jump through any hoops
I think we can finally stop being afraid
of h.265 we still should levy a
criticism at the complexity of this
camera app though Huawei and LG battling
it out for the most complete collection
of photo controls on a phone that makes
the learning curve on the mate steeper
muscle memorizing where all of these
settings live but this is one of the
most camera-like apps we've ever used
and the auto mode should be pleasing
enough to most people switching to audio
Huawei speakers are welcome in a field
opposite so many mono audio solutions
the earpiece and bottom speaker worked
well together to flesh out audio it's
not a true balanced stereo solution
sounding a bit more like an HTC but it
easily outperforms LG and Samsung
the head phone conversation is a bit
more confusing though no built-in 3.5
millimeter jack so a dongle is in the
Box alongside a pair of USB C headphones
the dongle works like moto and HTC's
dongles and Huawei is cross compatible
with those solutions
unfortunately output from this setup is
fairly disappointing and this dongle
will not work on other USB C or
Thunderbolt ports the included earbuds
do have their own DAC though and these
show up is a proper USB audio device on
my laptop and on other phones I'm not
the biggest fan of this ear pod style
design I wish it sealed the ear better
to block noise but happily they do a
much better job of universally
supporting other computers unlike
Apple's lightning connector ear pods so
let's wrap this up
where's that leave us with the huawei
mate 10 Pro I like this phone I like it
a lot the mate 9 was a surprise becoming
one of my favourite phones of last year
and genuinely one of the few phones I
regularly used almost every day since
its release the May 10 Pro hasn't
surprised me as much since my
expectations this year were higher but
it has satisfied what I care about in a
mobile device it's a big powerful phone
with great cameras and terrific battery
life just now in a prettier if maybe
less durable shell what might make some
people a little nervous is how this
device is being sold on future updates
it's being sold on its potential the
addition of new services AR core and
broader support for neural processing
that makes part of our discussion
incomplete and how we might recommend
this phone as a few pieces start to
become longer-term conversations plus
799 euro is no small chunk of change
we're still waiting to see pricing and
availability info on this phone arriving
in the United States all in all this is
personally one of my top five favorite
phones of 2017 but there are a few gaps
people will need to consider for their
own use as always thanks so much for
